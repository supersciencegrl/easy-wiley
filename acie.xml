         <title>Crystal Structures and Intermolecular Interactions in &#945;$\alpha$&#8208; and &#946;$\beta$&#8208;phosgene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite its notorious reputation as a war gas, phosgene (COCl2${\rm COCl}_2$) is one of the most important intermediate chemicals in industry. In this study, we present the crystal structures of two phosgene polymorphs as deduced from powder neutron diffraction and show which intermolecular interactions stabilise the different modifications. The first inelastic neutron scattering spectra show an unusual separation of the translational and librational modes, alongside sharp bands for the internal modes.








Abstract
The crystal structures of &#945;$\alpha$&#8208; and &#946;$\beta$&#8208;phosgene have been elucidated on the basis of variable temperature neutron powder diffraction. Although the stable &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;phase closely mirrors the published structure (I41/a$I4_1/a$, No.&#160;88), the new metastable &#946;$\beta$&#8208;phase crystallises in Cmc21$Cmc2_1$ (No. 36, at 135&#160;K: a&#160;= 10.244042(22) &#197;, b&#160;= 6.280321(21) &#197;, c&#160;= 5.46069(4) &#197;). Both modifications show dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, but only &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;phosgene shows pronounced &#963;$\sigma$&#8208;hole interactions. Quantum chemical calculations in both solid state and of model dimers in gas&#8208;phase reveal a complex interplay of intermolecular interactions. The first inelastic neutron scattering spectra of &#945;$\alpha$&#8208;phosgene shows an unusual separation of the translational and librational modes, alongside sharp bands for the internal modes. Our computational studies also show an unusual, extensive mixing of the in&#8208;phase C&#8211;Cl stretch (&#957;2$\nu _2$) and the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane bend (&#957;6$\nu _6$) modes, which are symmetry&#8208;forbidden from mixing in the gas&#8208;phase.

         <title>Genetic Encoding of Pentafluorophosphato&#8208;Phenylalanine Provides PF5&#8208;Proteins as Phosphoprotein Mimetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic code expansion with a unique hyper&#8208;fluorinated phosphotyrosine analog. In this work, we successfully incorporated the unnatural amino acid pentafluorophosphato&#8208;difluoromethyl&#8208;phenylalanine, carrying seven fluorine atoms and a permanent negative charge into three different proteins via the use of mutated orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases. Biological testing revealed the great potential of this approach for furnishing functional phosphoprotein mimetics. 








Abstract
Protein phosphorylation is one of the most important posttranslational modifications altering the structure, stability, and activity of more than 13&#160;000 human proteins. In this work, the phosphotyrosine mimetic pentafluorophosphato&#8208;difluoromethyl&#8208;phenylalanine (PF5CF2Phe) was genetically encoded and incorporated into three different proteins. Screening two libraries of orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases identified enzymes enabling the efficient and specific incorporation of PF5CF2Phe into red fluorescent protein (RFP) via amber stop codon suppression. Two model proteins, human ubiquitin (Ubq) and the B1 immunoglobulin&#8208;binding domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1), were prepared with PF5CF2Phe mutations and investigated for potential interaction partners. While native GB1 showed no binding to protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), PF5&#8208;GB1, with PF5CF2Phe at position 17, was a strong inhibitor of the phosphatases PTP1B and SHP2. PF5&#8208;Ubq was produced and converted into the first example of a protein carrying the most prominent phosphotyrosine mimetic, phosphono&#8208;difluoromethyl phenylalanine (PO3CF2Phe). With increasing need in the biosciences to delineate the functions of complex phosphorylation patterns, genetic encoding of PF5CF2Phe yielding phosphoprotein mimetics opens unique opportunities for precise functional studies where site&#8208;specific and homogeneous protein modifications are required.

         <title>Balancing Oxidative Stability and Ion Transport in Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolytes via Chlorine&#8208;Driven Halogenation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel chlorine&#8208;driven halogenation strategy addresses the inherent trade&#8208;off in polyether electrolytes. This approach precisely modulates the electronic environment, achieving exceptional electrochemical stability (up to 5.0&#160;V) and high ionic conductivity (1.14 mS cm&#8722;1). The resulting PCMO electrolyte enables robust cycling, high&#8208;voltage resilience, and reliable low&#8208;temperature performance, providing a scalable platform for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs).








Abstract
Polyether&#8208;based solid electrolytes offer significant promise for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), yet their practical application is limited by poor room&#8208;temperature ion transport efficiency and severe oxidative breakdown at high voltages. A key challenge arises from the inherent trade&#8208;off between boosting ionic conductivity and widening the electrochemical stability window, rendering simultaneous optimization difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a novel halogenation strategy that precisely modulates the electronic environment of ether oxygen atoms. This approach effectively reduces the nucleophilicity of terminal &#9472;OH groups and inhibits dehydrogenation reactions initiated by main&#8208;chain ether oxygens, while simultaneously optimizing Li&#8314; coordination dynamics for efficient transport. Our systematic investigation of fluorine (&#9472;F), chlorine (&#9472;Cl), and bromine (&#9472;Br) reveals that Cl exhibits the most balanced electron&#8208;withdrawing effect. This leads to an exceptional electrochemical stability window of up to 5.0&#160;V and an ionic conductivity of 1.14 mS cm&#8722;1. The chlorinated polyether electrolyte (PCMO) demonstrates superior performance, including 2000 cycles at 2&#160;C in LFP cells and robust high&#8208;voltage resilience with 85.3% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 4.5&#160;V in LCO cells. Additionally, PCMO exhibits reliable performance at &#8722;10 &#176;C in NCM622 cells and shows scalable performance in a 2 Ah NCM613/graphite pouch cell, retaining 70.1% capacity after 1000 cycles at 4.4 V.

         <title>Stereodivergent Deacylative Mizoroki&#8211;Heck Reaction of Unstrained Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereodivergent deacylative Mizoroki&#8211;Heck reaction for preparing a large variety of alkyl&#8208;tethered alkenes from methyl ketones and cyclic ketones under dual Co/photoredox catalysis has been developed. This protocol features a one&#8208;pot reaction, high ring&#8208;opening efficiency, mild reaction conditions, and broad substrate scope with excellent functional group compatibility.








Abstract
Alkene structures represent one of the most functional and widely used in organic synthesis, drug design, and material science. However, developing a practical strategy to produce such high&#8208;valued chemicals from widely abundant materials, such as ketones, remains elusive. Herein, we present a stereodivergent deacylative Mizoroki&#8211;Heck reaction of methyl ketones and cyclic ketones to furnish both E&#8208; and Z&#8208;configured alkenes via dual photoredox/cobalt catalysis. Interestingly, the tunable E/Z&#8208;selectivity is achieved by energy transfer catalysis via the judicious choice of photocatalyst. This versatile strategy features a broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance and is suitable for late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules and the one&#8208;pot operation. It also expands the reaction profiles of both deacylative transformation and photoredox/cobalt catalysis.

         <title>Cyclically Dynamic Defect Management Enables High&#8208;efficiency Sn&#9472;Pb Perovskite Photovoltaics with Enhanced Photostability and Fatigue Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active metallocene interlayer enables dynamic defect management in Sn&#9472;Pb perovskite solar cells by suppressing crystallographic imperfections and cyclically healing light&#8208;induced defects, significantly enhancing photostability and fatigue resistance under prolonged light cycling, resulting in 23.59% efficient devices with prolonged operational lifetimes.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have showcased great promise to approach the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit. Despite continuously proven elevated power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), the practical application and commercial use of Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs are hindered by poor photostability and anti&#8208;fatigue performance. These issues arise from multiple intrinsic imperfections formed during crystallization and light&#8208;triggered defects generated during device operation under intermittent illumination. Herein, we introduced a novel &#8220;dynamic defect management&#8221; (DDM) strategy that mitigated photodegradation of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites and significantly enhanced the device lifespan. The strong coordination between metallocene intercalation and metal cations (Pb2+/Sn2+) within the perovskite lattice effectively passivated the crystallographic defects, reduced the defect densities by 34.5% and suppressed the non&#8208;radiative recombination. Furthermore, the metallocene and corresponding cation could function as a redox pair, offering a dynamic and continuous healing mechanism to restore the light&#8208;induced defects in a cyclical manner. Additionally, the metallocene interlayer itself acted as a shield against the ultraviolet radiation during the light aging process. Consequently, we achieved decent PCEs up to 23.59% for the mixed Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs modified with DDM strategy, 14.7% higher than that of the reference devices, accompanied by enhanced photostability which witnessed a 7&#8208;fold enhancement compared to the pristine device under MPP operation tracking and remarkable anti&#8208;fatigue performance, retaining 83% of the original PCE after 22 accelerated fatigue test cycles (12/12&#160;h UV light/dark cycle).

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of Bacterial Terpene Synthases from Chitinophagaceae Producing Marine&#8208;Type Diterpenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six bacterial terpene synthases are reported, one of which produces instable chitinosphaerol, which is spontaneously transformed into several known natural products requiring structural revision. A second enzyme yields thermally labile neodolabella&#8208;1(14),2,7&#8208;triene, which upon heating shows sequential conversion into thermocyclenes A&#8211;C. The mechanisms of the enzymatic and thermal reactions were investigated experimentally and computationally.








Abstract
Two neodolabellane&#8208;type diterpene synthases from Chitinophaga japonensis (CjCsS and CjNdtS) in addition to one enzyme from Dinghuibacter silviterrae (DsJS) were investigated. CjCsS produces the instable diterpene alcohol chitinosphaerol, which degrades upon chromatographic purification on silica gel to known presphaerol and isosphaerodienes I and II. Despite seemingly solid evidence in the literature, for all three compounds a structural revision is presented. Treatment of chitinosphaerol with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide resulted in the formation of the stable compounds bromosphaerols A and B. Phylogenetically unrelated CjNdtS catalyses the formation of neodolabella&#8208;1(14),2,7&#8208;triene, a compound that undergoes a remarkable thermal three&#8208;step sequence by Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to thermocyclene A, followed by a water&#8208;mediated rearrangement to thermocyclene B and double&#8208;bond isomerisation to thermocyclene C. Japonene A was identified as a side product, but is the main product of DsJS, where it is accompanied by japonene B and anaerol B. The good production of anaerol B by DsJS allowed reinvestigation of its recently addressed biosynthesis as a trace product of peyssonnosol B synthase AbPS2. All structure elucidations in this study were secured through stereoselective deuteration experiments, and special isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the cyclisation mechanisms of the investigated enzymes.

         <title>Incorporating Redox&#8208;Active Hexaazatrinaphthylene into a 2D Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Robust Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first HATN&#8208;based 2D conductive MOF (HATN&#8208;O&#8208;Zn), featuring Zn&#8208;bis(dioxolene) linkages that provide dual redox&#8208;active sites, conductivity, and remarkable Na+ storage performance. HATN&#8208;O&#8208;Zn delivers high capacity, long&#8208;term cyclability over 5000 cycles, and robust performance at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. This work highlights a rational design strategy for durable, high&#8208;performance MOF anodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) hold tremendous promise as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), owing to their electrical conductivity, porosity, appropriate interlayer spacing that facilitates ion intercalation, and stability in organic electrolytes. Yet, creating cMOFs hosting multiple redox&#8208;active sites remains challenging. This paper reports a hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN)&#8208;based 2D cMOF, HATN&#8208;O&#8208;Zn, assembled by coordinating redox&#8208;inactive Zn2+ through bis(dioxolene) linkages. HATN&#8208;O&#8208;Zn forms hexagonal rod&#8208;like crystals with electrical conductivity that promote rapid Na+ diffusion and storage. As an anode, this material delivers a high reversible capacity of 319&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and retains a capacity of 86&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 5000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, demonstrating outstanding cycling stability at room temperature. Notably, HATN&#8208;O&#8208;Zn sustains performance at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, showing an initial capacity of 117&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 and 84.4% retention after 200 cycles at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1, underscoring stability under harsh conditions. This stability is attributed to the structural robustness provided by redox&#8208;inactive Zn2+. Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal that dual redox&#8208;active sites in the HATN moiety and Zn&#8208;bis(dioxolene) linkages facilitate multiple electron transfer. This work highlights the design potential of combining redox&#8208;active ligands with redox&#8208;inactive metal nodes in 2D cMOFs for durable SIB anodes.

         <title>Hierarchical, Template&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of Two Different Organometallic Capsules from a Tetrakisimidazolium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dodecasilver capsules were synthesized from tetra&#8208;NHC&#8208;decorated calix[4]resorcinarene ligands and Ag2O through hierarchical template&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly utilizing {Ag(NCCH3)4(BF4)8}7&#8722; or (CF3SO3)88&#8722; templates. The dodecanuclear assemblies represent the largest organometallic capsules obtained to date from poly&#8208;NHC ligands.








Abstract
Controlling the assembly of molecular nanocapsules through metal&#8208;carbon bonds constitutes a major challenge in the field of supramolecular organometallic chemistry. Here, we demonstrate the construction of two nanosized dodecanuclear organometallic capsules, [{Ag(CH3CN)4(BF4)8}&#8834;Ag12(1)6](BF4)5 and [(CF3SO3)8&#8834;Ag12(1)6](CF3SO3)4 from the calix[4]resorcinarene&#8208;based tetrakisimidazolium salts H4&#8208;1(X)4 and AgI ions employing the metal&#8208;carbene directed self&#8208;assembly and hierarchical template strategies. An [Ag(CH3CH)4(BF4)8]7&#8722; anion or eight triflate anions served as templates. The dodecanuclear capsules are the largest poly&#8208;NHC&#8208;derived assemblies known so far. Salt H4&#8208;1(SbF6)4 reacts with Ag2O to give the tetranuclear assembly [(SbF6)&#8834;Ag4(1)2](SbF6)3 featuring an encapsulated SbF6&#8722; anion. Transmetalation of the tetra&#8208;NHC ligands from silver to gold yielded in all cases tetranuclear assemblies of type [Au4(1)2]X4.

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Enhanced Photoiniferter Polymerization: Ultrafast, Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant, and Biocompatible Synthesis of Well&#8208;Defined Polymers Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triplet&#8208;enhanced photoiniferter polymerization (TEPP) is developed, which enables ultrafast kinetics through rapid photolysis while preserving excellent control via enhanced reversible deactivation and fast chain transfer, overcoming the trade&#8208;offs between speed, control, and oxygen sensitivity. This system also shows high biocompatibility with live cells.








Abstract
Photoiniferter polymerization offers an attractive, additive&#8208;free strategy for precision polymer synthesis but is often constrained by a trade&#8208;off between speed and control, oxygen sensitivity, and the need for high&#8208;energy light. In this study, we introduce a triplet&#8208;enhanced photoiniferter strategy that overcomes these limitations. Through computationally guided design, we developed methyl 2&#8208;((3&#8208;methoxypyrazole&#8208;1&#8208;carbonothioyl)thio)propanoate (MOP), a photoiniferter exhibiting exceptional photophysical properties: a large triplet energy (ET&#160;=&#160;43.5&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1), a remarkable triplet quantum yield (&#934;T&#160;=&#160;82.9%), and a low C&#9472;S bond cleavage barrier (8.5&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). These attributes collectively enable ultrafast polymerization kinetics via rapid photolysis while preserving excellent control through enhanced reversible deactivation and faster degenerative chain transfer. This triplet&#8208;enhanced photoiniferter polymerization (TEPP) achieves high monomer conversion within minutes under ambient, open&#8208;to&#8208;air conditions while maintaining low dispersity (&#272;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.1), with intrinsic oxygen tolerance conferred by efficient triplet oxygen sensitization to singlet oxygen. We further demonstrate the versatility and biocompatibility of this system through high&#8208;throughput synthesis, sunlight&#8208;driven polymerization, and in situ polymerizations that achieve &gt;95% cell viability. This work establishes a powerful and versatile platform for precision polymer synthesis under mild, ambient conditions, with broad potential in surface coating, biomaterials, and additive manufacturing.

         <title>Noble Metal&#8208;Free Photosensitive Terpyridine Coordination Assemblies for Efficient Single&#8208;Molecule H2O2 Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photosensitive terpyridine complexes via precise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly were synthesized. The high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic total synthesis of H2O2 was achieved under an air atmosphere via a unique synergetic process of energy and electron transfer. Notably, an outstanding photocatalytic rate of up to 40&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 1.23% were obtained.








Abstract
Conventional molecular photocatalysts characterized by long&#8208;lived excited states, such as Ru and Ir complexes are widely recognized and used in photocatalysis. However, developing new heavy atom&#8208;free photosensitive coordination complexes by manipulating their molecular structures to achieve highly efficient photocatalytic reactions remains challenging. In this study, a series of novel terpyridine complexes, S1&#8211;S4, with a rigid donor&#8211;acceptor configuration was designed and synthesized via precise heteroleptic, coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Experimental data, combined with theoretical calculations, confirmed that long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;transfer excited states were generated, enabling excellent photosensitivity. Furthermore, high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic total synthesis of H2O2 was achieved in pure water under an air atmosphere via a synergetic process of energy transfer and electron transfer to form 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8211;, respectively, in these complexes, differing significantly from previous reports on polymer catalysts. Notably, complex S1 exhibited an outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of 10&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming most organic photocatalytic systems. In addition, S1 achieved a photocatalytic rate of up to 40&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 1.23% with the sacrificial agent. This study not only paves the way for the development of novel noble metal&#8208;free photocatalysts but also introduces a novel photocatalytic paradigm for the green and high&#8208;performance synthesis of H2O2.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of Cholesterol Surfactants into Biofunctional Nanodiscs with Antiviral Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis strategy for cholesterol&#8208;oligo&#8208;glycerol&#8208;based surfactants with tunable nonionic to anionic head groups is reported. The precise control of multivalent surface charges directs self&#8208;assembly and transforms cholesterol vesicles into nanodiscs. Structurally optimized sulfated nanodiscs exhibit significant antiviral activity against HSV&#8208;1. This approach emphasizes the therapeutic potential of charge&#8208;directed supramolecular lipid nanostructures.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of lipid structures derived from amphiphilic molecules plays a crucial role in the development of biomimetic systems. Here we report a modular synthetic strategy for developing cholesteryl&#8208;oligo&#8208;glycerol&#8208;based surfactants with tunable head group functionalities ranging from nonionic to anionic. This approach enables the systematic incorporation of functional groups and thus precise control of surface charge and hydrophilicity. To investigate the influence of multivalent charges on supermolecular&#8208;assembly behavior, we compared three structurally cholesterol (CL) related surfactants: CL&#8208;4S, with four sulfate groups, CL&#8208;1S, with a single sulfate group, and CL&#8208;4OH, a nonionic analog with four hydroxyl groups. We then incorporated these surfactants into lipid bilayers of 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (DMPC) and cholesterol (CL) to study their behavior in membrane&#8208;like environments. Experimental, simulation, and theoretical studies demonstrated that the CL&#8208;4S formulation was able to convert lipid vesicles into nanodiscs, unlike CL&#8208;1S and CL&#8208;4OH, demonstrating the importance of adequate charges in supramolecular transition. Furthermore, both 1S&#8208;Vesicles (CL&#8208;1S based sulfated vesicles) and 4S&#8208;Nanodiscs (CL&#8208;4S based sulfated nanodiscs) showed inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus&#8208;1 (HSV&#8208;1), indicating the potential of this multivalent supramolecular platform for antiviral applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Alternant Helical Bilayer Molecular Carbons Bearing a Diaza[9]Helicene with Enhanced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy based on embedding heptagons and incorporating carbazole derivatives has been developed to create helical bilayer molecular carbons with a high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F&#160;=&#160;74%). An organic light&#8208;emitting diode device containing the molecular carbons shows a high &#951;EQE,max of 3.6%, while the enantiomers exhibit pronounced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) responses with a high CPL brightness (BCPL) of 112&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Helical bilayer molecular carbons have attracted considerable attention due to their distinct physicochemical properties. However, constrained by the limited structural diversity, helical bilayer molecular carbons typically exhibit low quantum yields and low circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness, which limits their potential applications as CPL emitters. In this work, helical bilayer molecular carbons (NDPH and NDPBu) featuring a heptagon&#8208;embedded diaza[9]helicene were successfully synthesized employing ring expansion strategy. The incorporated heptagons enhance the highly twisted and rigid bilayer geometry with a significant interlayer interaction index &#948;g (18.6), while the introduction of carbazole units yields a high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F&#160;=&#160;74%). As a result, the resultant enantiomers exhibit pronounced electronic circular dichroism and CPL responses with a high CPL brightness (BCPL) value of 112&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1. In addition, an organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) device was fabricated employing NDPH as dopant, achieving a maximum external quantum efficiency (&#951;EQE,max) of 3.6%, which demonstrates its potential optoelectronic application.

In this work, helical bilayer molecular carbons (&lt;b&gt;NDPH&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;NDPBu&lt;/b&gt;) featuring a heptagon-embedded diaza[9]helicene were successfully synthesized employing ring expansion strategy. The incorporated heptagons enhance the highly twisted and rigid bilayer geometry with a significant interlayer interaction index &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; (18.6), while the introduction of carbazole units yields a high fluorescence quantum yield (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;74%). As a result, the resultant enantiomers exhibit pronounced electronic circular dichroism and CPL responses with a high CPL brightness (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CPL&lt;/sub&gt;) value of 112&#160;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) device was fabricated employing &lt;b&gt;NDPH&lt;/b&gt; as dopant, achieving a maximum external quantum efficiency (&#951;&lt;sub&gt;EQE,max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 3.6%, which demonstrates its potential optoelectronic application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Data to Physics: An Agentic Large Language Model Solves a Competitive Adsorption Puzzle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that an agentic large language model (LLM) (OpenAI o3 with deep research) can autonomously reason, write code, and iteratively refine hypotheses to derive a physically interpretable equation for competitive adsorption on metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs)&#8212;an open problem our lab had struggled with for months. In a single 29&#8208;min session, o3 formulated the governing equations, generated fitting scripts, diagnosed shortcomings, and produced a compact three&#8208;parameter model that quantitatively matches experiments across a dozen carboxylic acids.








Abstract
Scientific modeling often requires navigating a trade&#8208;off between physical interpretability and empirical accuracy&#8212;a task that can take weeks of iteration, especially in systems with partial observability, structural complexity, and experimental errors. Here, we show how an agentic reasoning&#8208;and&#8208;coding large language model (LLM), OpenAI o3, autonomously solved a modeling challenge in surface chemistry that puzzled us for months: quantifying the competitive adsorption of carboxylic acids on metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs). With experimental data and a concise problem formulation, o3 rapidly formulated a physically grounded adsorption model, derived the mathematical equations, implemented the corresponding codes to fit the experimental data, revised its assumptions, and ultimately derived a competitive adsorption model with three parameters that matched experimental data across more than a dozen tested molecules. The resulting model&#8212;simple, mechanistically transparent, and quantitatively robust&#8212;incorporates both classical Langmuir competition and structural constraints such as site accessibility. Beyond addressing this particular challenge, our findings highlight a transformative shift in scientific methodology: from manual trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches to AI&#8208;driven hypothesis generation and model refinement. This represents a new paradigm in research, wherein language models surpass the traditional roles of machine learning in data analysis and computational support, actively participating in scientific reasoning and hypothesis development.

         <title>Switchable Phenanthroline&#8208;Cu Catalysts for Enantioselective Alkynylation and Amination of Cyclic Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformationally switchable chiral phenanthroline&#8208;Cu catalysts have been developed for the enantioselective ring&#8208;opening alkynylation and amination of cyclic diaryliodoniums. A broad range of axially chiral biaryls bearing either an alkynyl substituent or an amide/oxalamide group were synthesized in good to excellent yield (up to 99%), with excellent regio&#8208; (up to&#160;&gt;99:1) and enantioselectivity (up to 99.5:0.5 enantiomeric ratio [er]).

         <title>Bright Circularly Polarized Electrochemiluminescence from Heterobinuclear IrIII&#8211;AuI Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and bright circularly polarized electrochemiluminescence (CP&#8208;ECL) is achieved in a class of enantiopure hetobinuclear iridium(III)&#8211;gold(I) complexes owing to the combination of high ECL efficiency with stability, good emission dissymmetry factor and high brightness, thus paving the way to the next&#8208;generation of bright CP&#8208;ECL probes.








Abstract
The development of efficient circularly polarized electrochemiluminescence (CP&#8208;ECL) probes is still at its infancy and examples are still very limited. Yet, their achievement would enable gathering a readout that carries privileged information on the probe's chiral environment by monitoring luminescence polarization bias with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Notwithstanding, this is a highly challenging task and requires judicious chemical engineering of chiral ECL&#8208;active emitters. Herein, we aim at expanding the palette of CP&#8208;ECL luminophores by presenting a novel class of enantiopure heterobinuclear Ir(III)&#8211;Au(I) complexes, which are investigated thoroughly by means of chemical, structural, and (chiro&#8208;)optical techniques. The ground and excited state properties are also elucidated by using density functional theory (DFT) approaches including spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) perturbation. The chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes display luminescence with a polarization bias of the emitted light that is function of the helical arrangement of the coordination sphere around the Ir(III) center. Overall, the photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;active complexes unraveled in this work combine unparallelly high photoluminescence quantum yield in the orange region, excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness up to 4.5&#160;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 with a notable ECL activity. Finally, these features provide emitters with CP&#8208;ECL efficiency that encompass remarkably by a factor 3.5 that of the well&#8208;known benchmark tris&#8208;(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II).

         <title>Anchored Zn(002) Orientation with Rapid Interfacial Response Guiding High&#8208;Utilization Alloy Anode and Ah&#8208;Scale Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a stable cycling performance in Ah&#8208;level pouch cells under 90% depth of discharge and a low N/P ratio of 2.4, achieved through a (002)&#8208;textured Zn&#8211;Sn alloy anode with lattice orientation anchoring effect that enables rapid interfacial response. 








Abstract
Reversibility of zinc anode under high utilization and rational ampere&#8208;hour (Ah)&#8208;scale evaluation represents a key metrics for practical aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs), but it suffers from uncontrolled host&#8208;less plating/stripping and disordered interfacial behaviors. Herein, we develop a highly (002) plane&#8208;oriented alloy anode with lattice orientation anchoring effect and rapid interfacial response for Ah&#8208;scale AZMBs. The minimal Sn (200)&#8208;Zn (002) lattice mismatch and strong atomic bonding interactions synergistically drive epitaxial nucleation kinetics and orientation&#8208;anchored Zn (002) deposition. It also reduces the diffusion energy barrier of interfacial Zn2+, thereby facilitating the ordered ion migration and ensuring rapid ion transport channels at the interface. Consequently, the engineered symmetric cells deliver excellent cyclic stability of 890&#160;h at 80% DOD and 200&#160;h at 90% DOD, respectively. The full cells maintain cyclic stability over 5000 cycles. The pouch cells with approximately 4&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a N/P ratio of 2.56 maintain a capacity retention of 93% after 500 cycles. Remarkably, the Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells with anode areal capacity of 4.16&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, N/P ratio of 2.40, cathode loading of 20.67&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 can cycle steadily for over 200 cycles. This work contributes to a path for designing high&#8208;utilization zinc anodes for Ah&#8208;scale AZMBs.

         <title>Engineering Full&#8208;Spectrum Upconversion Through Coherent Energy Recycling in NaYF4:Yb,Tm/Cs4PbBr6 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermodynamics&#8208;controlled epitaxial growth strategy enables the precise coating of Cs4PbBr6 onto NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNPs, achieving structural evolution from core&#8208;shell to UCNP&#8208;in&#8208;LHP solids heterostructures. These high&#8208;quality heterostructures exhibit widely tunable upconversion emission across the entire visible spectrum&#8212;from blue to green to red&#8212;governed by a dynamic energy recycling mechanism between Tm3+ and the perovskite layer. 








Abstract
Hybrid heterojunctions integrating lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and lead&#8208;halide perovskites (LHPs) offer compelling opportunities for multimodal luminescence and tailored photon conversion. However, the synthesis of well&#8208;defined UCNP/LHP heterostructures is hindered by the rapid crystallization kinetics and ionic character of perovskites, while the energy transfer mechanisms&#8212;particularly the role of LHPs in modulating upconversion&#8212;remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a thermodynamics&#8208;controlled epitaxial growth strategy that enables the fabrication of high&#8208;quality NaYF4:Yb,Tm/Cs4PbBr6 heterostructures with tunable architecture&#8212;from core/shell to UCNP&#8208;in&#8208;LHP solids. Crucially, the Cs4PbBr6 layer acts not merely as a passive energy acceptor, but as a functional sub&#8208;energy level that facilitates back energy transfer to Tm3+ and redirects its excited&#8208;state population. This coherent energy recycling enables broadly tunable upconversion emission across the entire visible spectrum. Our findings provide a robust route to high&#8208;quality UCNP/LHP heterostructures and establish LHPs as active participants in the engineering of upconversion pathways.

         <title>Chemoenzymatically Synthesized O&#8208;Acetylated GD3 Gangliosides to Examine Viral Receptor Specificities in a Cellular Context</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
7&#8208;O&#8208;, 9&#8208;O&#8208;, and 7,9&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated GD3 gangliosides can be prepared by chemical assembly of a tetrasaccharide as &#945;&#8208;glycosyl fluoride that is coupled to sphingosine using a glycosynthase, followed by O&#8208;acetyl editing by coronaviral hemagglutinin&#8208;esterases (HEs). Cell surface remodeling of erythrocytes using the GD3 derivatives provides a tool to examine viral receptor specificities.








Abstract
Gangliosides are a class of sialic acid&#8208;containing glycosphingolipids involved in a wide range of biological processes. The terminal sialic acid of gangliosides can be O&#8208;acetylated at C7 and/or C9 hydroxyl, contributing to ganglioside structural complexity and function. It has been difficult to obtain panels of structurally well&#8208;defined O&#8208;acetylated gangliosides for binding and functional studies. We describe here a chemoenzymatic strategy that can provide, for the first time, 7&#8208;O&#8208;, 9&#8208;O&#8208;, and 7,9&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated GD3 gangliosides. It is based on the chemical assembly of a common tetrasaccharide precursor as &#945;&#8208;glycosyl fluoride that is coupled to sphingosine by a glycosynthase, followed by O&#8208;acetyl editing by coronaviral hemagglutinin&#8208;esterases (HEs). The resulting synthetic glycosphingolipids have been employed for cell surface remodeling of erythrocytes. Analysis by liquid chromatography and ion mobility mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;IM&#8208;MS) demonstrated successful integration of the glycosphingolipids into the plasma membrane with preservation of acetyl ester patterns. Using human coronavirus HKU1 spike&#8208;functionalized virus&#8208;like particles, we demonstrate that the resulting glycan&#8208;remodeled erythrocytes can be utilized in hemagglutination (HA) studies as a label&#8208;free method to investigate viral protein binding to individual glycoforms in a cellular environment.

         <title>Speciation&#8208;Dependent Solvent Extraction of Polyoxopalladates Toward Separation of Critical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Migration of metal ions from water to organic media is foundational for industrial separations and purification. Here, we design processes for oxocluster&#8208;based palladium solvent extraction, a crucial metal in drug production, catalysts, and microelectronics. Extraction is effective exclusively as polynuclear Pd&#8208;forms, which are tuned with capping groups. K+ shuttles anionic Pd&#8208;oxoclusters as ion&#8208;pairs across the interface more effectively than Na+.








Abstract
Innovating robust separation methods for critical elements extraction and reuse is important to sustain the global consumption of microelectronics, energy, and pharmaceuticals. Effective separations via liquid&#8208;liquid extraction (LLE) requires molecular&#8208;level understanding and optimization of solution speciation. Here, we design LLE for palladium based on polyoxopalladates (POPs), where Pd is critical for microelectronics, catalysts, and drug production. Mild solution conditions are designed to evaluate the role of templating heterometals and ligands (arsenate, phenylarsonate, phenylphosphonate, acetate, phosphate) that drive POP assembly. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, along with compositional analysis, respectively described speciation and extraction efficiency (including separation factors for competitive Pd&#8208;Ni separation). Most effective LLE of Pd (&gt;99.9%) are arsenate/phenylphosphonate/acetate capped hexamers or heptamers without templating metals. These fragments of the larger, prior&#8208;reported Pd12/Pd15/Pd84 POPs represent simple formulations, important for translation to scaled&#8208;up processes. Comparing alkali&#8208;acetate buffers highlight that potassium is more effective than lithium or sodium, presumably due to strong ion&#8208;pairing between Pd&#8208;oxoanions and the larger alkali, facilitating transport across the aqueous&#8208;organic interface. Pd and Au&#8208;Pd LLE studies yielded the first K+&#8208;charge balanced and K+&#8208;templated POPs, illustrating simply swapping the alkali from Na+ (usually employed) to K+ can enable isolation of new topologies and inspire new applications.

         <title>Gradient Adsorption Energy Strategy Unlocks Ultra&#8208;Long Stability and Efficient Electrocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis from Nitrate Over CoP/Cu3P</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modulating the cooperative catalytic sites in CoP/Cu3P for multi&#8208;step elementary reactions, a gradient absorption synergistic system including integrating strong, moderate and weak adsorption sites is constructed. The incorporated P atoms serve as an electron bridge between heterointerfaces, facilitating charge transfer and stabilizing the structure against phase reconstruction during 150 h operation. The suppressed structural evolution ensures exceptional long&#8208;term electrocatalytic stability.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NRA) is an important approach for achieving both ammonia synthesis and wastewater treatment. However, its multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;electron transfer process and the difficulty in synergistically regulating the adsorption energy of intermediates limit the reaction efficiency. In this study, a self&#8208;supported CoP/Cu3P composite nanotube array electrode (CoP/Cu3P&#8208;CF) was fabricated on copper foam through in situ growth and phosphidation. By precisely regulating synergistic catalytic sites for multiple elementary reactions, the catalyst simultaneously enhances both adsorption and desorption processes through a gradient adsorption energy strategy. The catalyst utilizes the synergistic effect of Cu and Co dual sites to enhance the adsorption and conversion of NO3&#8722; and the directed transformation of *NO2 intermediates to NH3, respectively, while P atoms act as electron transfer bridges to promote charge transport. At &#8211;0.3&#160;V vs. RHE, it achieved an exceptional ammonia production rate of 1.59&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 96.35%. The strong interfacial interaction between CoP and Cu3P effectively suppressed structural reconstruction, enabling stable operation for 150 h without significant performance degradation. Kelvin probe force microscopy and in situ characterization confirmed a broad adsorption energy distribution conducive to multi&#8208;site synergistic catalysis. This study provides new insights for the design and mechanistic understanding of highly active NRA catalysts.

Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology, a groundbreaking approach in drug discovery, leverages the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system to degrade disease&#8208;related proteins. Its efficacy mainly hinges on the linker design, which critically influences ternary complex (target protein&#8208;PROTAC&#8208;E3 ligase) stability and pharmacokinetics. However, optimizing linkers for diverse targets remains challenging due to complex structure&#8208;activity relationships and laborious synthesis processes. Herein, we developed a self&#8208;assembled hexamer&#8208;linker Nano&#8208;PROTACs, which was capable of self&#8208;regulating spatial distances, enabling efficient degradation of proteins with different sizes. This barrel&#8208;like hexamer&#8208;linker has a very wide range of universality, enabling the degradation of multiple size proteins (e.g., 22, 55 and 68&#160;kDa), with a degradation efficiency of up to 99%. More importantly, compared to a linear linker, the plasma stability of this self&#8208;assembled hexamer&#8208;linker increased by 48 times. Using Nano&#8208;PROTAC with &#8220;double&#8208;gated&#8221; system combining epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting and ROS&#8208;responsiveness, degradation of the challenging protein glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) was achieved on mouse models, inducing tumor&#8208;specific ferroptosis with reduced off&#8208;target toxicity. This spatially adaptable hexamer&#8208;linker Nano&#8208;PROTAC system offers a universal strategy to streamline PROTAC development, highlighting its transformative potential for targeted protein degradation therapeutics.

         <title>Conjugated Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Polymers with p&#8208;Block Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of various p&#8208;block element motifs on the photophysical properties of conjugated inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid polymers is surveyed regarding applications in organic electronics. Recent advances in the use of heavier elements as well as heavier multiple bonds and the development of diverse (post&#8208;)functionalization strategies suggest ample scope for exciting future developments.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers with small band gaps and the ensuing semiconductivity are increasingly used as active layers in organic electronics. In order to achieve purpose&#8208;built polymers with specific band gaps and optimized charge transport properties, covalent doping with inorganic main group heteroelements has proven to be a promising strategy during the past 20 years. This review highlights recent advances in the introduction of single heteroatoms of Group 13 to 15 into the organic conjugated main chain of such hybrid polymers, with a particular focus on the fine&#8208;tuning of the photophysical properties for applications in electronic devices. The emerging field of polymers containing p&#8208;block multiple bonds is covered in the second part, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of research in the arena of conjugated polymers incorporating main group motifs in the main chain. The electronic and structural properties are significantly altered by the interaction at the inorganic&#8208;organic interface and can be optimized using regio&#8208; or stereoisomers and targeted post&#8208;functionalization. A general trend toward the heavier elements is evident, pushing the door wide open to a vast uncharted terrain with huge potential for further developments in inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid polymers for electronics and sensing materials with advanced properties.

         <title>Csp, Csp2, and Csp3 Hydrocarbyl Group Migration from Pd(II) to P(III): Accessing Metallophosphoranes via Nonspectator Ligand Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined migration of Csp, Csp2, and Csp3 hydrocarbyls from Pd(II) compounds to a nontrigonal P(III) ligand scaffold is reported. The structural and spectroscopic features of the resulting complexes reveal a conserved Pd&#9472;P interaction. The results demonstrate the nonspectator role of structurally constrained tricoodinate P(III) ligands in palladium chemistry.








Abstract
Migration of palladium&#8208;bound hydrocarbyl ligands to tricoordinate phosphorus ligand P(N(o&#8208;N(2&#8208;pyridyl)C6H4)2) (L) is demonstrated across a series of Pd(II) organometallic complexes bearing Csp, Csp2, and Csp3 groups. Treatment of ligand L with cis&#8208;[(TMEDA)PdI(C6H5)], cis&#8208;[(TMEDA)PdBr(CH2C6H5)], [(&#951;3&#8208;C3H5)PdCl]2, and trans&#8208;[PdBr(C&#8801;C&#9472;C6H5)(PPh3)2], respectively, results in migration of the hydrocarbyl group from Pd to P, yielding isolable (&#963;4&#8208;P)&#9472;Pd palladaphosphoranes: LAllyl&#8226;PdCl, LBn&#8226;PdBr, LPh&#8226;PdI, and LCCPh&#8226;PdBr. The mechanistic pathway of the palladaphosphorane formation was investigated by in situ NMR experiments and DFT calculations, suggesting an &#945;&#8208;migration mechanism. Halide exchange with NaBr or NaI affords the corresponding bromide and iodide congeners without disrupting the palladaphosphorane connectivity. 31P NMR chemical shifts correlate systematically with the identity and hybridization of the hydrocarbyl group, and electronic structure analyses attribute observed trends to variations in the s/p hybrid compositions of the local P&#9472;C bond orbitals. This work establishes an underappreciated facet in the reactivity landscape of Pd complexes bearing tricoordinate phosphorus (&#963;3&#9472;P) ligands by demonstrating their ability to undergo nonspectator metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand group transfer, with implications for designing bifunctional ligand architectures capable of cooperative catalysis.

         <title>Coupled Engineering of Short&#8208;/Long&#8208;Range Disorder in Oxyhalides Unlocks Benchmark Sodium Superionic Conductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid quenching creates a strong temperature gradient, disrupting Nb&#8211;O and Nb&#8211;Cl coordination&#8212;especially via broken bridging oxygen&#8212;inducing octahedral distortion around Nb. This disorder breaks local polyhedral connectivity, forming a short&#8208;range disordered amorphous network. It lowers Na&#8314; migration barriers, weakens electrostatic confinement, and offers more ion pathways, yielding 1.51 mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 room&#8208;temperature conductivity, validating &#8220;quenching&#8594;distortion&#8594;disorder&#8594;enhanced transport&#8221; synergy.








Abstract
Oxyhalide&#8208;based sodium solid electrolytes (SSEs) distinguished by exceptionally high&#8208;voltage electrochemical stability and mechanical compliance, have commanded substantial research interest, but their practical implementation remains constrained by sub&#8208;optimal ionic conductivity (IC). Here, we demonstrate a concerted manipulation of short&#8208; and long&#8208;range structural disorder that substantially enhances Na+ transport in oxychlorides. Combined experimental characterization and machine learning molecular dynamics simulations unveil that, the sub&#8208;second quenching disrupts short&#8208;range ordering by fragmenting the original Nb&#9472;Cl coordination and inducing more Nb&#9472;O bonding, which triggers the distortion and connectivity breakage of NbO2Cl4 polyhedra. Such a unique structure endows the material with a record&#8208;high ionic conductivity of 1.51 mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 for NaNbOCl4, and 7.2 mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 for NaTaOCl4, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art oxyhalide&#8208;based SSEs. The as&#8208;achieved all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries using low&#8208;cost NaNbOCl4 as the electrolyte manifest remarkable capacity retention (82.61%) at 4&#160;V (versus Na+/Na) after 250 cycles at a 0.5C, highlighting exceptional cycling stability and rate performance. This work establishes a coupled short&#8208; and long&#8208;range disorder engineering strategy that unlocks unprecedented ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes, advancing next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage solutions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By harnessing chalcogen bonding (ChB) catalysis, an exclusive access into a highly stereoselective strain&#8208;release C&#8208;glycosylation pathway was discovered. This was surprisingly not replicable by the conceptually similar halogen bonding (XB) catalysis. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the stereoselectivity divergence can be traced to the privileged ChB activation of a downstream bicyclic intermediate by a phosphonochalcogenide (PCH) catalyst. 








Abstract
&#963;&#8208;hole&#8208;based noncovalent interactions are gaining intense attention as robust tools in stereoselective carbohydrate synthesis. However, the mechanistic understanding behind the differing performance between chalcogen bonding (ChB) catalysis versus halogen bonding (XB) catalysis in chemical glycosylations still remains unresolved. Herein, we disclose a remarkable instance whereby phosphonochalcogenide (PCH) catalysis displays pronounced selectivity and reactivity elevation in aryl&#8208;C&#8208;glycosylations compared to XB catalysis. Mechanistic studies revealed that the enhanced stereocontrol can be attributed to the differentiated downstream activation of a key bicyclic intermediate. Hammett analysis supported that ChB catalysis shifted the C&#8208;glycosylation toward the SN1 domain, while the XB catalysis proceeded with SN2 characteristics. DFT calculations further illuminated that the downstream ChB catalytic engagement involved all four selenium &#963;&#8208;holes engaging in two bifurcated ChB modes. This study thus sheds new light that the selectivity benefits of ChB catalysis could be accounted for by privileged mechanistic access into an otherwise inaccessible stereoselective pathway.

         <title>Unlocking the Orbital Interaction Mode in Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the OER performance of Li&#8211;O2 batteries primarily depends on the orbital interaction mode between the catalyst and the intermediates. In contrast to the strong Cd 4dxy&#8211;O 2Px/y orbital interaction mode between CdSe and LiO2, the weaker Cd 4dz2&#8211;O 2Py orbital interaction mode between CdSe/ZnS and LiO2 significantly reduces the charge activation energy barrier, thereby enhancing OER catalytic activity.








Abstract
Understanding electrocatalyst&#8208;intermediate orbital interaction in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) is critical for designing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries, yet remains a significant challenge. In this study, we employed a CdSe&#8208;based catalyst as a model cathode to deeply investigate the catalyst&#8211;intermediate interaction and its effect on OER activity. Compared to the 4d orbital electronic states of Cd in CdSe, electron transfer from CdSe to ZnS in the CdSe/ZnS heterojunction results in a downward shift of the Cd 4d suborbital energy levels. The differences in the Cd 4d orbital electronic states between CdSe and CdSe/ZnS cause distinct orbital interaction mode with LiO2 intermediate, ultimately leading to variations in OER activity. Specifically, compared to the strong Cd 4dxy&#8211;O 2Px/y orbital interaction mode between CdSe and LiO2, the weaker Cd 4dz2&#8211;O 2Py orbital interaction mode between CdSe/ZnS and LiO2 significantly reduces the activation energy of the rate&#8208;determining step, thereby enhancing OER activity. This finding provides theoretical guidance for the design of OER electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;O2 batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Quinoid Backbone Synergistic with Side&#8208;Chain Engineering Enables Ultrahigh&#8208;Temperature Conjugated Polymers for Bridging Solar&#8208; and Laser&#8208;Driven Photothermal Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative dual&#8208;quinoid backbone strategy, distinct from donor&#8211;acceptor or mono&#8208;quinoid designs, integrates quinoidal and proquinoidal units with side&#8208;chain engineering to deliver excellent photothermal performance under both solar and laser excitation. PAQM&#8208;TbT&#8208;2C8 reaches 356&#160;&#176;C and drives 2.78&#160;kg m&#8210;2 h&#8210;1 solar evaporation rate, setting records for organic materials and bridging solar and laser&#8208;driven applications.








Abstract
Organic photothermal materials often perform efficiently under either solar or laser irradiation, yet achieving dual high performance within one system remains a formidable challenge due to stringent molecular design requirements. Here, we present a dual&#8208;quinoid backbone strategy&#8212;incorporating quinoidal and proquinoidal units&#8212;synergistically combined with side&#8208;chain engineering in conjugated polymers. Two dual&#8208;quinoid polymers with linear or bulky alkyl side chains are synthesized and benchmarked against the mono&#8208;quinoid analogue PAQM&#8208;3T. Incorporation of proquinoidal unit enhances quinoidal resonance, diradical character, and reorganization energy, yielding broadened near&#8208;infrared absorption with a laser&#8208;resonant peak near 808&#160;nm, suppressed radiative loss, and superior photothermal conversion. Side&#8208;chain engineering further regulates backbone planarity and intramolecular rotation, with the bulky&#8208;chain derivative PAQM&#8208;TbT&#8208;2C8 exhibiting greater rotational freedom and weaker interchain interactions. Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation (1.2&#160;W cm&#8210;2), PAQM&#8208;TbT&#8208;2C8 achieves an ultrahigh temperature of 356.0&#160;&#176;C, one of the highest values reported among all photothermal material classes, and maintains excellent photostability. Beyond laser&#8208;driven high&#8208;temperature applications, PAQM&#8208;TbT&#8208;2C8 enables solar&#8208;driven water evaporation rate of 2.78&#160;kg m&#8210;2 h&#8210;1 under 1 sun, setting a new record for Janus interfacial evaporators employing pure organic photothermal absorbers. This synergistic molecular design enables multifunctional organic photothermal materials bridging solar energy harvesting with laser&#8208;driven thermal applications.

         <title>Microemulsion Engineering Reconciles Propylene Carbonate Electrolytes and Graphite Anodes for All&#8208;Climate Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study leverage microemulsion engineering to achieve compatibility of propylene carbonate (PC)/graphite (Gr) system. Insoluble glyceryl monostearate (GMS) and amphiphilic tetrahydrofuran (THF) self&#8208;assemble into core&#8208;shell micelles in the PC electrolyte medium. At the Gr anode, adsorbed GMS@THF micelles create a solvophobic barrier and effectively suppress the Li+&#8208;PC co&#8208;intercalation. This design enables Gr||LiFePO4 batteries operate from &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C to 100 &#176;C, providing a novel strategy for incompatible electrolyte/electrode systems and all&#8208;climate batteries.








Abstract
Propylene carbonate (PC)&#8208;based electrolytes are promising for all&#8208;climate lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their wide liquid range. However, detrimental Li+&#8208;PC co&#8208;intercalation causes severe graphite (Gr) anode exfoliation, remaining the biggest barrier for their practical application. Although the issue can be mitigated via solvation regulation, complex interfacial chemistry limits long&#8208;term cycling ability. Herein, we designed a PC&#8208;based microemulsion electrolyte to achieve PC/Gr compatibility through interfacial manipulation. Specifically, insoluble glyceryl monostearate (GMS) and amphiphilic tetrahydrofuran (THF) are introduced into the PC&#8208;based electrolyte. GMS self&#8208;assembles in THF to form core&#8208;shell GMS@THF micelles dispersed in the continuous PC electrolyte medium. This microemulsion structure generates abundant liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial tension at micelle/electrolyte interfaces, spontaneously directing micelles to the electrode interfaces during operation. At the Gr anode, adsorbed GMS@THF micelles leverage solvophobic effects to synergistically form PC&#8208;poor Li+ solvation sheaths and block free PC, effectively suppressing detrimental PC co&#8208;intercalation. This design enables Li||Gr cells achieve a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.8% and supports 1 Ah Gr||LiFePO4 pouch cells to operate over 4000 cycles. Remarkably, the pouch cells work well across extreme temperatures (&#8722;40&#8764;100 &#176;C cycling; &#8722;60&#8764;100 &#176;C operation), demonstrating exceptional all&#8208;climate capability. This microemulsion engineering establishes a universal paradigm for optimizing electrolyte/electrode interphases in the PC/Gr system.

Here, we achieved an irreversible emission transformation in zero&#8208;dimensional (TPA)CuI2 NCs (TPA&#160;=&#160;Tetrapropylammonium) via high pressure engineering, even at pressure as low as 0.6&#160;GPa.

Abstract
Pressure&#8208;driven irreversible emission transformation as an efficient means greatly facilitates the development of the rational structural design of high performance novel metastable states. However, the excessively required pressure can only be achieved by high&#8208;pressure devices, significantly inhibiting practical applications. Here, we achieved an irreversible emission transformation in 0D copper halides (TPA)CuI2 (TPA&#160;=&#160;Tetrapropylammonium) nanocrystals (NCs) via high pressure engineering, even at pressure as low as 0.6&#160;GPa (approximately 6000 atmospheres). The large steric hindrance of organic cations (TPA+) and enhanced hydrogen bonding increased the potential barrier of phase transition, resulting in an irreversibility. The quenched samples exhibited bright green emission after pressure treatment, greatly different from the initial dull white light. The (TPA)CuI2 NCs&#8208;based film can be utilized as flexible and water&#8208;resistant pressure imaging that just required macroscopic pressure, such as stamping or writing. Furthermore, the different recovery time upon applying different pressures provides dynamic passwords and time&#8208;sensitive intelligence&#8212;&#8212;eliminating the false and retaining the true. This work develops a promising pressure&#8208;sensing material which can be easily accessible in practical applications for schlagstelle inspection of pipeline inwall and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Operando Insights into Bridging Oxygen&#8208;Driven RuOx Lattice Collapse and its Mitigation Strategy for Durable Industrial PEMWE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A device&#8208;level diagnostic study reveals that RuOx anodes in PEMWE suffer from irreversible loss of bridging oxygen (Obridge), leading to deactivation. The Ru&#8211;O stabilization strategy was proposed by low&#8208;level Ir doping to suppress Obridge loss, which maintains stable ampere&#8208;level operation. This work links atomic&#8208;scale structural dynamics to performance loss, which establishes a new paradigm for diagnosing under real PEMWE conditions.








Abstract
Ruthenium oxide (RuOx) is a promising anode catalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), but its degradation mechanism, especially under practical ampere&#8208;level operation, remains elusive. Herein, we established a device&#8208;level diagnostic framework to investigate the evolution of RuOx. Operando PEMWE&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed a progressive negative shift of the Ru K&#8208;edge. Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis further showed a pronounced decrease in both Ru&#8211;O and Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Ru coordination, revealing that irreversible loss of bridging oxygen (Obridge) triggers the final catalyst deactivation. Guided by these insights, we demonstrated that low&#8208;level Ir doping in Ru0.9Ir0.1Ox could notably increase the Obridge vacancy formation energy and thus stabilize the Ru&#8211;O framework. Under identical PEMWE operating conditions, the Ru valence state and coordination environment in Ru0.9Ir0.1Ox remain relatively stable. In&#8208;cell electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analyses confirmed that this structural stabilization strategy effectively maintains low electrode kinetic and proton transport resistances across a range of cell voltages, enabling stable operation at industrially relevant ampere&#8208;level current densities. Finally, the resulting Ru0.9Ir0.1Ox catalyst achieves 1.74&#160;V at 3 A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and stably operates for 500 h at 1 A&#160;cm&#8722;2, outperforming most reported Ru&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Layered CuGe2Se3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly discovered CuGe2Se3 adopts a layered structure with surprisingly short Cu&#9472;Ge and Ge&#9472;Ge contacts, characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and solid&#8208;state (SS) NMR. Electronic structure analysis rationalizes the stability of this unique structural framework. CuGe2Se3 exhibits promising thermoelectric (TE) performance, with a high Seebeck coefficient (&#8764;374 &#181;V&#183;K&#8722;1) and ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8764;0.35 W&#183;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1) at 755&#160;K. 








Abstract
Unraveling the relationship between thermodynamic factors, interatomic interactions, and electronic structure remains a crucial yet elusive challenge in the discovery of novel materials in solid&#8208;state (SS) chemistry. In the quest for new thermoelectric (TE) materials, we overcame that fundamental problem for the case of CuGe2Se3, whose synthesis, unique crystal structure, and transport properties are reported herein. The giant two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure of CuGe2Se3, consisting of Se/(Cu&#9472;Ge)/Se and Se/(Ge&#9472;Ge)/Se slabs stacked along the c&#8208;axis, exhibits short Cu&#9472;Ge and Ge&#9472;Ge interactions, as evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and SS NMR spectroscopic studies. These homopolar bonds might be surprising, as such interactions are rarely observed in group IV&#8208;chalcogenides. The compound is thermally stable up to &#8764;823&#160;K. Transport properties measurements revealed a high Seebeck coefficient (&#8764;373.6 &#181;V&#183;K&#8722;1) and ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8764;0.35 W&#183;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1) at 755&#160;K, ascribed to its weak bonding interactions. We followed up with a theoretical analysis to gain insight into its structural peculiarities, focusing on vibrational properties and the nature of chemical bonding. The formation of Ge&#9472;Ge bonds is favored in light of the presence of multicenter bonds, which receive contributions from stereochemically non&#8208;active Ge lone pairs.

         <title>Sorp&#8208;Vection&#8208;Based Membrane Silicone Oil Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first Sorp&#8208;vection&#8208;based membrane separation for silicone oil purification, coupling sorption&#8208;driven selectivity with convective transport. Our strategy enables highly selective removal of residual cyclic siloxanes, particularly D4, overcoming the inherent trade&#8208;offs and limitations associated with conventional membrane processes in the silicone industry. 








Abstract
&#8220;Sorp&#8208;vection&#8221; is a membrane separation technique that synergistically combines sorption with convective flow mechanisms. Beyond its conceptual discussion, we demonstrate a sorp&#8208;vection separation achieved in a gas&#8211;liquid system, where permeation of a gas directly drives selective permeation of an organic solute across a dense polymer layer overcoming osmotic limitations of conventional membrane processes. Here, a long&#8208;standing challenge in silicone oil production is addressed, in which residual cyclic oligosiloxanes are removed from silicone oil streams through permeation of CO2 across an optimally crosslinked PDMS selective layer. A lab&#8208;scale 1st generation Sorp&#8208;vection system demonstrated, with a separation factor above 15 to remove D4 (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) from low&#8208;concentration feeds using both lab&#8208;grade silicone oil (Sigma&#8208;Aldrich) and an industrial&#8208;grade feed (DOW&#8208;SFD). Good agreement was found with a predictive model based on liquid D4 and high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight silicone oil sorption data in crosslinked PDMS. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study introduces the sorp&#8208;vection strategy, expanding it from conventional two&#8208;component systems to a three&#8208;component configuration in which convective flow is introduced as an independent driving entity. Addressing concentration polarization in next&#8208;generation versions of the sorp&#8208;vection process is expected to ensure stable long&#8208;term performance and to establish sorp&#8208;vection as a transformative approach for industrial purification.

A metal&#8208;free nitrosation process enables direct C&#8211;H functionalization of polyethylene (PE) with high selectivity, producing either oxime&#8208; or carbonyl&#8208;functionalized polymers. Using t&#8208;BuONO under visible light or thermal conditions, the process operates in both lab&#8208;scale and industrial settings. The resulting oxime groups serve as versatile intermediates, enabling scalable and sustainable PE upcycling. 








Abstract
Polyethylene (PE), the world's most produced synthetic polymer, is highly durable but resistant to chemical modification due to its inert carboncarbon backbone. This work presents a metal&#8208;free, nitrosation process for direct CH functionalization of PE, enabling selective formation of oxime&#8208; or carbonyl&#8208;functionalized polymers. The method operates under mild visible&#8208;light conditions in solution and through thermally driven reactive extrusion, making it suitable for both laboratory and industrial applications. The key reagent, tert&#8208;butyl nitrite (t&#8208;BuONO), produces an alkoxy radical (t&#8208;BuONO&#8226;) for CH activation and a persistent nitrosyl radical (NO&#8226;) that installs ketoxime functionalities. Mechanistic studies using quantum yield determination and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy confirm the energy&#8208;transfer activation of t&#8208;BuONO and hydrogen atom transfer pathways. Unlike previous strategies, this approach yields pure oxime or keto&#8208;functionalized PE's without metals or pre&#8208;functionalization. Moreover, oxime groups serve as intermediates convertible into esters, ethers, or urethanes, allowing control over polymer polarity and thermomechanical properties. Together, this strategy transforms a venerable small&#8208;molecule transformation into a scalable, selective, and tunable route for the upcycling of PE, and enables a selective and sustainable route to valorize one of the world's most ubiquitous, but most recalcitrant plastics.

         <title>Pollutant&#8208;Powered Oxygen Activation by Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Sustaining Catalytic Membranes for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a self&#8208;sustaining catalytic membrane that harnesses pollutants as electron donors to drive oxygen activation. This autonomous paradigm leverages the inherent chemical energy of wastewater, thereby eliminating chemical additives and reducing energy consumption compared to conventional UV&#8208; or electrochemical&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
Conventional catalytic water purification remains energy&#8208; and chemical&#8208;intensive due to reliance on external stimuli for oxidant activation. Here, we present a self&#8208;sustaining catalytic membrane (TMF&#8208;CM) incorporating Ti&#8208;doped Mn3O4/Fe3O4 catalysts with engineered oxygen vacancies, which harness pollutants as electron donors to drive enzyme&#8208;mimetic redox cycles. Through nanoconfinement within ceramic membrane pores, dissolved oxygen is autonomously activated by electrons derived from contaminants, enabling continuous regeneration of active sites without chemical additives. Mechanistic investigations, supported by spectroscopic and computational evidence, reveal that high&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo intermediates mediate contaminant oxidation while concurrently restoring oxygen vacancies, thereby sustaining catalytic cycles. During 10&#8208;day continuous testing in real wastewater, the TMF&#8208;CM system achieved over 90.1% contaminant removal and exhibited self&#8208;cleaning capability. This autonomous catalytic paradigm leverages the inherent chemical energy of wastewater, eliminating chemical additives and cutting energy consumption by 70%&#8211;98% compared to UV&#8208; or electrochemical&#8208;based systems. By integrating molecular oxygen activation with circular electron transfer, we establish a sustainable oxidation strategy that extends beyond conventional water treatment paradigms.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Enriched Pt&#8208;In Synergistic Sites for Highly Selective and Direct Photo&#8208;Reforming of PET Plastic Wastes into Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;site synergistic interface promotes interfacial charge redistribution on the catalyst surface, achieving efficient and highly selective photo&#8208;reforming of waste plastic into acetic acid and H2. The catalyst enables selective acetic acid production of beverage bottles without pretreatment, providing a sustainable route for simultaneous waste plastic valorization and H2 production.








Abstract
Photocatalytic selective upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into valuable C2 products is an ideal strategy. However, over&#8208;oxidation and nonselective activation of C&#9472;C/C&#9472;O bonds by active sites in the local microenvironment have limited prior studies to produce C2 products. By designing Pt/ZnO&#8208;ZIS catalysts that feature a dynamically coupled Pt&#8208;In dual&#8208;site synergistic interface, this study achieves in situ upcycling of PET wastes via tuning the electronic structure and chemical environment of the Pt&#8208;In active sites and optimizing the adsorption configuration of plastic wastes. The dual active sites (Pt&#8208;In), which are spatially adjacent yet functionally distinct, achieves an HOAc production rate of 882.46 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with nearly 100% selectivity. Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations reveal that the high selectivity is attributed to the Pt sites adsorbing and protecting the terminal hydroxyl group (&#8208;OH) oxidation, and then activating the C&#9472;O bond to undergo proton substitution. The electron&#8208;rich Pt sites further inhibit the over&#8208;oxidation of C&#9472;C bond, ensuring high selectivity of HOAc. Simultaneously, the In sites facilitate oxidation of &#8208;OH to form carboxyl species during the reaction. This study provides an insightful understanding of dual sites with dynamic reconstruction toward highly selective photo&#8208;reforming of plastic wastes at the atomic scale.

         <title>On the Nature of Improper Hydrogen Bonding in RCH2F and RCHF2 Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature of &#8216;improper&#8217; hydrogen bonds is explored in FnC&#9472;H&#8943;X systems, such as RCF2H interaction with chloride and water. It is noted that increased fluorination decreases the positive charge density on H but increases it on C, thus these interactions are dominated by electrostatic attraction to C over H. Such interactions map experimental blue and red shift IR phenomenon.








Abstract
The RCH2F and RCHF2&#160;groups are substituents of interest in medicinal and agrochemicals products. They have a polar aspect relative to the methyl (RCH3) or trifluoromethyl (RCF3) groups which results in a lowering of Log P's (water affinity). Here we use a computational approach to explore the nature of the interaction between RCH2F and RCHF2&#160;in methanes and ethanes with chloride ion (and water), as a hydrogen bonding acceptor. A key observation is that the hydrogen atoms geminal to the fluorine(s) become less positively charged with increasing fluorination, a trend anticipated to weaken, not strengthen, their hydrogen bonding interactions. However this study demonstrates a dominating role for the electrostatic interaction of the acceptor with the CF carbons and profiles a shift in negative charge density from hydrogen to the carbon and fluorine(s) as chloride ion (or water) approach. The common occurrence of blue shifts (shortening C&#9472;H length) in these &#8216;improper&#8217; or &#8216;non&#8208;classical&#8217; hydrogen bonds is also explored and is correlated with the electrostatic interactions between the acceptor and the carbon atoms. These observations are extended to C3&#9472;C6&#160;alicyclic rings containing these motifs and predict particularly strong interactions energies between chloride ion and specifically designed organo&#8208;fluoro alicycles.

         <dc:description>
A chiral narrow&#8208;band fluorophore undergoes aging&#8208;induced enhancement of fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals in the aggregate state, accompanied by a light&#8208;triggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) transition. The fusion strategy provides a straightforward and facile approach for constructing CPL materials with robust chiroptical performance.








Abstract
The development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials has garnered considerable interest owing to their promising applications in areas such as 3D displays and information encryption, with most efforts devoted to generating CPL activity and improving the dissymmetry factor (glum). However, the essential requirement of narrow&#8208;band emission for high&#8208;resolution organic optoelectronic applications is often overlooked. Here we employed the anthracene group as strong assembly unit and BODIPY as narrow&#8208;band fluorophore to construct with chiral binaphthyl moiety. The resulting compounds R/S&#8208;An&#8208;BDP displayed light&#8208;triggered transformation from aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) with CPL signals regulation. Moreover, R/S&#8208;An&#8208;BDP showed aging&#8208;driven narrow&#8208;band fluorescence with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 14&#160;nm and CPL activity with the |glum| value of 0.048 in the aggregate state, attributed to the combined effect of BODIPY and anthracene unit. These findings highlight a functional group fusion strategy for constructing CPL materials with large glum values and narrow emission, offering a promising approach towards high&#8208;performance CPL materials.

   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-An-BDP&lt;/b&gt; showed aging-driven narrow-band fluorescence with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 14&#160;nm and CPL activity with the |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| value of 0.048 in the aggregate state, attributed to the combined effect of BODIPY and anthracene unit. These findings highlight a functional group fusion strategy for constructing CPL materials with large &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values and narrow emission, offering a promising approach towards high-performance CPL materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Matching Effect Triggering Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Acidic and Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the relationship between spin&#8208;state modulation strategy of low&#8208;Pt&#8208;based catalyst and pH&#8208;dependent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathways can effectively alleviate oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates site&#8208;blocking effect, enhance ORR activity in acidic/alkaline conditions and further promote ORR kinetics in practical energy&#8208;storage/conversion devices.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts operable across broad pH ranges is hindered by strong adsorption of hydroxyl intermediates (*OH). This work introduces a conceptually novel strategy of spin&#8208;state modulation via interfacial engineering to regulate platinum nanocrystals anchored on atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C substrates (Pt/FeSA&#8208;NC). Based on density functional theory (DFT) predictions, we construct a spin&#8208;state&#8208;tunable architecture by precisely controlling Pt particle size (2&#8211;8&#160;nm), which induces spin&#8208;matching effects that effectively mitigate *OH over&#8208;binding in pH&#8208;dependent ORR path. Mechanistic studies indicate that the synergy between FeN4&#8208;mediated metal&#8208;support interactions and size&#8208;dependent spin polarization facilitates charge transfer, weakening *OH adsorption and promoting its desorption. In alkaline conditions, &#8764;2&#160;nm Pt nanoclusters with moderate spin density achieve a peak power density of 179&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 in Zn&#8208;air batteries with 150 h stability. Under acidic media, &#8764;8&#160;nm Pt nanoparticles with low&#8208;spin configuration deliver a mass activity of 0.65 A mgPt&#8722;1 and a peak power density of 730&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 in proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), outperforming commercial Pt/C and retaining 90% activity after 3000 cycles. This finding provides a spin&#8208;engineering paradigm for designing advanced electrocatalysts with ultralow Pt loading.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Nanodomains Regulation for Optimized Ionic Translocation Enabling High&#8208;Voltage and Practical Utility Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite polymer electrolyte featuring dual&#8208;domain&#8208;coupled secondary nanoconfinement is constructed via precise polymer&#8211;nanodomain engineering. The mesoporous framework and dynamic polymer segments form interconnected ion pathways. In addition, anchoring domains with high negative surface potentials preload Li+, enhancing ion density and conductivity. 








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (HVSSLMBs) integrate high&#8208;voltage cathodes (HVCs) with lithium metal anodes, offering great promise for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, high&#8208;voltage charging induces lattice oxygen oxidation at the cathode, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that degrade inorganic solid electrolytes. In addition, the low room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity and limited electrochemical stability of polymer electrolytes hinder their application with HVCs. Here, we design a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) with dual&#8208;domain&#8208;coupled secondary nanoconfinement via precise polymer&#8211;nanodomain engineering. This structure combines a mesoporous framework with dynamic segmental motion, forming interconnected ion channels between free and anchored domains. The anchoring domains with high negative surface potential preload lithium ions, thereby increasing the local ion density and promoting a continuous high&#8208;conductance path. Benefiting from the protection mechanism of the nanoconfined system, the chemical stability of the polymer is greatly improved, thus achieving operation at high voltage. Cells paired with 4.8&#160;V LRMO (Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2) retained 80.37% capacity after 200 cycles. Notably, this study reported the first&#8208;ever assembly of a large&#8208;format pouch cell combining a CPE with the LRMO cathode, delivering an impressive energy density of 419.47&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at a capacity of 4.61 Ah. This advancement marks a significant milestone in the application of HVSSLMBs.

         <title>Environment&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly and Coupled&#8208;Network Effect in Dynamic Replicating Nucleopeptide Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates the self&#8208;organization mechanism in nucleobase/peptide dynamic reaction networks, where environmentally responsive assemblies regulate network equilibria through cooperative/competitive replication behaviors, further achieving signal transduction across molecular networks through base&#8208;pairing.








Abstract
The development of complex, adaptive behaviors in chemical systems hinges on the intricate coupling between reaction networks and self&#8208;organizing processes. Self&#8208;assembling networks, particularly those capable of self&#8208;replication, provide a unique platform for studying how molecular interactions drive temporally evolving, system&#8208;level behaviors. While environmental factors are known to shape the dynamic evolution of such networks, most studies have focused on static or single&#8208;class systems, such as isolated peptides or nucleic acids. This approach overlooks two critical dimensions of complexity: 1) nonlinear interspecies dynamics in multicomponent systems, and 2) inter&#8208;network coupling phenomena. Here, we investigate dynamic nucleopeptide networks exhibiting environment&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly, demonstrating how nucleobases and short peptides dynamically synergize under specific conditions to form organized, self&#8208;replicating structures. And we reveal how such networks orchestrate the interplay between cooperative and competitive species to achieve dynamic adaptation to environmental parameters (e.g., pH, temperature, and ionic strength). Furthermore, inspired by nucleobases&#8217; genetic information function, we utilized the base&#8208;specific recognition in nucleopeptide assemblies for hierarchical network coupling&#8212;transmitting environmental signals from stimulus&#8208;sensitive to stimulus&#8208;insensitive systems. These findings offer new insights into temporal and cross&#8208;network regulation of self&#8208;assembly and reaction dynamics, providing a framework for designing adaptive, life&#8208;like chemical systems that evolve and communicate with environmental signals.

         <title>Electrooxidative Divergent Halocyclizations of Ambident Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrooxidation enables tunable halocyclization of ambident amides, yielding either C&#8211;O or C&#8211;N products through ionic or radical pathways, respectively. While detailed experimental and analytical mechanistic studies highlight mode&#8208;dependent selectivity, in silico experimentation provided insight into the energetic origin of this divergence.








Abstract
Herein, we report a divergent electrochemical halocyclization of ambident amides that enables selective formation of either C&#8211;O or C&#8211;N bonds. Unique chemoselectivity is governed by anodic oxidation conditions, in which haliranium&#8208;mediated C&#8211;O bond formation proceeds via chloride oxidation, while amidyl radicals guide C&#8211;N bond formation under basic conditions. Various approaches to understanding reaction mechanisms have been performed, including cyclic voltammetric analyses, experimental kinetic studies, and in silico experimentation. The developed electrooxidative synthetic method offers broad functional group tolerance, highlighting electrochemistry as a powerful tool for selective halocyclization.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a divergent electrochemical halocyclization of ambident amides that enables selective formation of either C&#8211;O or C&#8211;N bonds. Unique chemoselectivity is governed by anodic oxidation conditions, in which haliranium-mediated C&#8211;O bond formation proceeds via chloride oxidation, while amidyl radicals guide C&#8211;N bond formation under basic conditions. Various approaches to understanding reaction mechanisms have been performed, including cyclic voltammetric analyses, experimental kinetic studies, and in silico experimentation. The developed electrooxidative synthetic method offers broad functional group tolerance, highlighting electrochemistry as a powerful tool for selective halocyclization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarized N+&#8208;Mediated Charge&#8208;Transfer State Drives Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarized N&#8314; center establishes a charge&#8208;transfer (C&#8208;T) state, which promotes surface oxidation to steer the 2e&#8722; water oxidation pathway, suppresses H2O2 decomposition, and stabilizes the *OOH intermediate through electrostatic interactions, inhibiting further O&#9472;O bond cleavage.








Abstract
Achieving selective two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e&#8722; WOR) for sustainable hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis, while suppressing the competing four&#8208;electron oxygen evolution (4e&#8722; OER), represents a formidable challenge in artificial photosynthesis. The difficulty lies in the inherent vulnerability of the *OOH intermediate to over&#8208;oxidation or disproportionation, which triggers uncontrollable chain side reactions and naturally biases the reaction toward the less selective 4e&#8722; OER pathway. Here, we present a surface&#8208;engineering strategy utilizing a ZnCdS2 photocatalyst functionalized with polarized N&#8314; surfactants, enabling molecular&#8208;level control over interfacial water oxidation pathways by establishing a charge&#8208;transfer (C&#8208;T) excited state. The polarized N&#8314; centers effectively reconfigure the surface electronic states through molecular&#8208;scale polarization, achieving i) precise modulation of hole potentials and ii) stabilization of the *OOH intermediate, thereby promoting a direct 2e&#8722; WOR pathway. Without the use of any sacrificial reagents, this design achieves an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 2.37 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 (20.26 times of pristine ZnCdS2) statically and the scalable outlet concentration of 1.61&#160;mM through a serial micro&#8208;batch flow reactor. By bridging atomic&#8208;level charge control with macroscopic catalytic performance, our work offers a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept advance in C&#8208;T excited state driven photocatalysis, highlighting how surface electronic states can drive selective multi&#8208;electron reactions.

         <title>Bifunctional Cationic Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Proton Batteries with High&#8208;Rate and Ultra&#8208;Stable Cyclability</title>

Cationic covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework as a bifunctional host enables efficient proton transport and enhanced battery cyclability performance, outperforming the previously reported solid&#8208;state proton battery (PB) systems.








Abstract
Despite promising prospects afforded by high power density and abundant proton sources, proton batteries (PBs) face practical limitations. Liquid electrolytes induce anode dissolution and parasitic reactions, while solid electrolytes suffer from low proton conductivity and poor electrode compatibility. Herein, we introduce a bifunctional strategy for PBs using a cationic covalent organic framework (EB&#8208;COF). Synthesized from ethidium bromide (EB) and 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP), this bifunctional host simultaneously stabilizes phosphomolybdate (PMo12) clusters anode and confines H3PO4 as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte within its nanochannels. The resulting EB&#8208;COF:H3PO4 electrolyte exhibits superior proton conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1) and a wide electrochemical stability window (3.3&#160;V versus SCE). The assembled PB delivers exceptional rate capability and cycling stability, retaining 91% capacity over 15&#160;000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1, surpassing all reported solid&#8208;state PBs. This performance stems from excellent electrode&#8208;electrolyte compatibility and the high structural stability of the EB&#8208;COF:H3PO4 system. This study provides valuable insights for developing reliable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state PBs.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Hydroformylation of Alkenyl Boronic Esters</title>

         <dc:description>
We report the first enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydroformylation of alkenyl boronic esters. By employing either a &#8220;camouflage&#8221; or &#8220;direct&#8221; reductive asymmetric hydroformylation strategy, the enantiodivergent synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;boryl alcohols proceeds in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities with alkene 1,2&#8208;diboronic esters or alkenyl boronic esters as the starting materials and using rhodium/Ph&#8208;BPE as the catalyst.








Abstract
We herein report the first enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydroformylation of alkenyl boronic esters. By employing either &#8220;camouflage&#8221; or &#8220;direct&#8221; reductive AHF strategy, enantiodivergent synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;boryl alcohols has been developed for the first time in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities with alkene 1,2&#8208;diboronic esters or alkenyl boronic esters as the starting materials using rhodium/Ph&#8208;BPE as the catalyst. The method has enjoyed high chemo&#8208;selectivity, good functional group compatibility, and broad substrate scope. The chiral &#947;&#8208;boryl alcohol or diol products are versatile building blocks applicable to the synthesis of a series of APIs including (S)&#8208;tolterodine, (S)&#8208;dapoxetine, and (R)&#8208;atomaxetine. DFT calculation has revealed the origin of enantiodivergence of Rh&#8208;catalyzed reductive AHF of alkenyl boronic esters with Ph&#8208;BPE as the chiral ligand. The transformation is promised to provide great synthetic potential in both academia and industry.

         <title>Acceleration of [2]Catenane Formation by One of its Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This highlight underscores the most straightforward synthesis of [2]catenanes from readily available molecular precursors: The one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step catenane formation from a crown ether, a linear diamine, and a diester is accelerated by the preformed macrocycle, which stabilizes the two zwitterionic transition states involved in the course of consecutive amide bond formation, the first being a transient pseudorotaxane, the second trapping the crown ether by ring closing of the newly created macrocycle into a [2]catenane.








Abstract
[2]Catenanes were prepared from a crown ether, a diamine, and a diester in moderate to good yields in mild conditions by single&#8208;step, metal&#8208;free active template synthesis. The macrocycle first catalyzes the linear condensation of the diamine and the diester, then it accelerates the cyclization of the bifunctional thread and is incorporated in the catenane, as reported by Zhong et&#160;al. (https://doi.org/10.1002/anov.70004).

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Reversing Lanmodulin's Metal&#8208;Binding Sequence in Short Peptides Surprisingly Increases the Lanthanide Affinity (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 46/2025)</title>

Lanmodulin&#8208;inspired Lanthanide&#8208;binding peptides synthesised in reversed order have a higher affinity to lanthanides than the natural sequence, as reported by Lena Daumann et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202510453). As highlighted in this cover art the band of the cassette which gets rewound by the pencil symbolises the reversed peptides binding a trivalent europium. The original protein is shown as sketch in the back. That the higher affinity was a serendipitous finding is accentuated with the song title printed on the cassette.

A series of deep&#8208;ultraviolet transparent mixed&#8208;d0&#8208;metal oxyfluorides were designed and synthesized for high&#8208;performing optical nonlinearilities, as reported by Chao Wu, Chi Zhang et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202513438). By empolying a synergistic dual&#8208;site strategy, key three&#8208;parameters including second&#8208;harmonic generation, bandgap, and birefringence were synchronously optimized in the oxyfluorides. The work discloses the key role of distinct d0&#8208;metal polyhedra in optical activities.

Nanoscale ion&#8208;rich droplets formed by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation can be stabilized in nonaqueous media. Controlled water addition drives their coalescence and solidification into a monolithic amorphous inorganic solid, as reported by Jerry C. C. Chan et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202518706). The artwork depicts the guided pathway from fluid nanodroplets to a rigid, glassy material.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Degradable Polyketone Thermoplastic Elastomers with Biomass Sourced Composition (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 46/2025)</title>

         <dc:description>
In the Research Article by Ye Liu and co&#8208;workers (e202507976) a novel family of polyketone thermoplastic elastomers was synthesized through the carbonylative polymerization of ethylene and biomass&#8208;sourced polar monomers. Enabled by the alternating ketone sequence, these polyketone elastomers exhibit high strength and thermal resistance, while simultaneously achieving industrial durability and end&#8208;of&#8208;life degradability, which positions them as promising candidates for high&#8208;temperature and sustainable applications.

The image illustrates the core concept of the Communication (e202513917) by Stefano Di Stefano et al. The slug represents a Zn complex, the shell an enantiopure activated carboxylic acid. When the chiral shell is delivered to the slug, the whole snail assumes the chirality dictated by the shell. However, the little bird (the experimenter) controls the time spent by the snail in the chiral form, eventually degrading the shell, which is unraveled like a ball of yarn, leaving the slug in its initial form.

In their Research Article (e202516999), Xin Zhang et al. report that commercial DAST&#8208;type reagents can serve as versatile sulfur precursors in a modular three&#8208;component synthesis, diversifying their application beyond fluorination. This method provides efficient access to multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted S(IV)/S(VI) centers under ambient, mild conditions, and is demonstrated to be suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization and gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Three converging rivers in ink wash, symbolizing the three&#8208;component reactions.

         <title>Contemporary Strategies in SmI2 Catalysis: A Reagent Reborn</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rich chemistry of the single electron transfer reagent SmI2 has been widely exploited in synthesis. Recent years have seen significant progress in SmI2&#8208;catalysis, with provision of a suite of systems that may evolve to provide the efficiency, practicality, and generality needed for widespread adoption. This minireview provides a critical evaluation of strategies for SmII&#8208;catalysis and maps out a course that will complete the reinvention of SmI2 as a tool for sustainable catalysis.








Abstract
The strategies adopted in the development of SmII&#8208;catalyzed processes are critically evaluated. In particular, we examine promising approaches using stoichiometric sacrificial reductants, electrochemical methods, photochemical processes, and electron recycling through back electron transfer to Sm. While each strategy has considerable potential for facilitating catalytic SmII transformations, they also face specific challenges relating to efficiency, selectivity, scalability, and generality. We highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach, discuss recent advances, and identify challenges that remain. By offering an in&#8208;depth analysis of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in SmII catalysis, we aim to guide future research to complete the reinvention of SmI2 as a tool for sustainable catalysis.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Photoluminescence Based on Functionalized Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) based on quantum dot&#8208;molecule hybrid materials is overviewed, including the principles for designing efficient TADPL, strategies for facile regulation of TADPL lifetimes, the advantages of TADPL over molecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence, and relevant photochemical applications.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are promising light&#8208;harvesting materials that offer advantages of high extinction coefficients and tunable absorption/emission wavelengths. However, the exciton lifetime, another key property of these materials, is relatively short (nanoseconds) and is challenging to manipulate. In recent years, the hybrid structures of QD surface&#8208;functionalized with organic molecules have emerged a versatile platform to regulate the exciton lifetime. Through rapid triplet energy transfer (TET) and thermally activated reverse TET (rTET) between the QD exciton and the molecular triplet, the exciton lifetime can be prolonged to sub&#8208;milliseconds with thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) that resembles thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in molecules. Reported TADPL systems thus far have successfully covered the spectral range from violet to near&#8208;infrared. This review introduces the principles for constructing efficient TADPL systems and identifies three strategies that allow for facile regulation of TADPL lifetimes. The advantages of TADPL systems over TADF molecules are also highlighted, which include a smaller Stokes shift and a narrower emission linewidth. Applications of TADPL systems in triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation up&#8208;conversion and photochemical reactions are also reviewed, which are enabled by the substantial increase in exciton lifetime that facilitates efficient charge/energy transfer to substrate molecules via diffusion in solution. Finally, we summarize the current limitations of these materials and provide an outlook for future directions to be explored.

         <title>Biomedical Applications of Nanozymes: An Enzymology Perspective</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a lens of enzymology, this review compares nanozymes with enzymes using the Michaelis&#8208;Menten model and differences in KM and kcat along with catalysis in complex biological environment. The implications of these differences in biomedical applications of nanozymes are then described with a statistical analysis of the trend of therapeutic use of nanozymes. 








Abstract
Nanozymes are catalytic nanomaterials that transform enzyme substrates into their corresponding products, offering enhanced stability and a cost&#8208;effective alternative to traditional enzymes. As nanomaterials, they possess unique physicochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms distinct from those of enzymes. Such differences have profound, yet often neglected, implications in biomedical applications. In the context of enzymology, this review compares nanozymes and enzymes, with a focus on redox reactions. This review begins with the classification of nanozymes based on the types of reactions they catalyze, with the ability to exhibit multiple catalytic activities being a prevalent characteristic. The use of the Michaelis&#8208;Menten model for both enzymes and nanozymes is discussed in detail, and the Michaelis constant, maximum reaction rate, and turnover number values are compared. The performance of nanozymes in crowded environments and under extreme conditions is also compared to that of enzymes. We discuss the kinetic factors influencing nanozyme performance, the impact of active site shielding, and the activity under non&#8208;physiological conditions. We then compiled recent trends in the biomedical applications of nanozymes, focusing on both the production and scavenging of reactive oxygen species. This review links fundamental enzymology to nanozyme catalysis, providing a key reference for the rational use of nanozymes.

         <title>Revealing the Active State of a Cu/ZnO:Al Catalyst During Reverse Water&#8211;Gas Shift Reaction in an Operando Microwave Absorption Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the transformations of an industrially relevant CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 pre&#8208;catalyst during its activation and under operation in reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction. Changes of the dielectric properties induced by H2, which acts as an electron donor and oxygen provided by CO2 acting as an electron sink are correlated with the catalytic yield, which provides evidence for the importance of bulk properties for catalytic activity of this system.








Abstract
The industrially important Cu/ZnO:Al (CZA) catalyst is known as a dynamic system adapting to reaction conditions, which renders the application of in situ and operando methods key to establish structure function correlations. Herein, a CZA catalyst close to the industrially used compostion was studied using noninvasive and bulk&#8208;sensitive in situ/operando microwave cavity perturbation technique and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy during activation and reverse water gas shift reaction. The transient changes of catalytic activity track with the transients of the dielectric properties providing evidence for the importance of bulk properties for catalytic activity. Furthermore, convincing support for the redox reaction mechanism is obtained, and it is shown that H2 and CO2 uptake is not competing kinetically with each other. In addition, the reservoir of H2 and CO2 transiently present in the catalyst during catalysis is determined by the chemical potential of the respective reactant, which is directly coupled to the catalytic activity of the system. The findings fit the model of a Schottky barrier at the Cu/ZnO:Al interface, altered by the gas phase composition which in turn alters the catalytic properties of the system.

&lt;p&gt;We investigated the transformations of an industrially relevant CuO/ZnO/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; pre-catalyst during its activation and under operation in reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction. Changes of the dielectric properties induced by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which acts as an electron donor and oxygen provided by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acting as an electron sink are correlated with the catalytic yield, which provides evidence for the importance of bulk properties for catalytic activity of this system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industrially important Cu/ZnO:Al (CZA) catalyst is known as a dynamic system adapting to reaction conditions, which renders the application of in situ and &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; methods key to establish structure function correlations. Herein, a CZA catalyst close to the industrially used compostion was studied using noninvasive and bulk-sensitive in situ&lt;i&gt;/operando&lt;/i&gt; microwave cavity perturbation technique and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy during activation and reverse water gas shift reaction. The transient changes of catalytic activity track with the transients of the dielectric properties providing evidence for the importance of bulk properties for catalytic activity. Furthermore, convincing support for the redox reaction mechanism is obtained, and it is shown that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake is not competing kinetically with each other. In addition, the reservoir of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transiently present in the catalyst during catalysis is determined by the chemical potential of the respective reactant, which is directly coupled to the catalytic activity of the system. The findings fit the model of a Schottky barrier at the Cu/ZnO:Al interface, altered by the gas phase composition which in turn alters the catalytic properties of the system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development and Clinical Evaluation of a Multiplexed Health Surveillance Panel Using Ultra High&#8208;Throughput PRM&#8208;MS in an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Validating biomarkers of disease is necessary for clinical use. The Health Surveillance Panel (83 peptides from 57 proteins) was developed as a PRM assay and evaluated using the Stellar&#8208;MS platform. The assay was validated with a large clinical cohort of inflammatory bowel disease patients alongside quality controls. Analysis demonstrates strong performance, disease insight, and a preferred approach for future high&#8208;throughput biomarker validation.








Abstract
Despite advances in clinical proteomics, translating protein biomarker discoveries into clinical use remains challenging due to the technical complexity of the validation process. Targeted MS&#8208;based proteomic approaches such as parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) offer sensitive and specific assays for biomarker translation. In this study, we developed a multiplex PRM assay using the Stellar mass spectrometry platform to quantify 57 plasma proteins, including 24 FDA&#8208;approved biomarkers. Loading curves (11 points) were performed at 4 sample throughputs (100, 144, 180, and 300 samples per day) using independently optimized and scheduled PRM methods. Following optimization, an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort of plasma samples (493 IBD, 509 matched controls) was analyzed at a throughput of 180 samples per day. To monitor system performance, the study also included over 1000 additional injections for system suitability tests, low&#8208;, middle&#8208;, and high&#8208;quality controls, washes, and blanks. Using this approach, we observed high quantifiability (linearity, sensitivity, and reproducibility) in the PRM assay and consistent data acquisition across a large cohort. We also validated the candidate IBD markers, C&#8208;reactive protein and orosomucoid protein, identified in a recent discovery experiment.

         <dc:description>
A set of N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyldicarboxamide scaffolds were designed as customizable &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics, capable of reproducing a wide range of helical surfaces. With the biphenyl scaffolds, both pan&#8208;active and selective inhibitors of anti&#8208;apoptotic Bcl&#8208;2 proteins were developed, each exhibiting distinct binding profiles. This approach offers a powerful tool for distinguishing subtle differences in bound conformations with target proteins. 








Abstract
A novel strategy to replicate diverse &#945;&#8208;helical conformations found at the interfaces of protein&#8211;protein interactions is developed with a topologically tunable biphenyl scaffold. A set of N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenyldicarboxamide scaffolds were designed as customizable &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics, capable of reproducing a wide range of helical surfaces that may be difficult to be replicated with previously reported &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics. These scaffolds were evaluated for their capability to mimic the &#945;&#8208;helical BH3 domains of Bcl&#8208;2 family proteins. By modifying the substituents and their positions, both pan&#8208;active and selective inhibitors of anti&#8208;apoptotic Bcl&#8208;2 family members were developed, each exhibiting distinct binding profiles. This unique approach offers a powerful tool for mimicking naturally occurring &#945;&#8208;helices and distinguishing subtle differences in bound conformations with target proteins.

         <title>Reversing Lanmodulin's Metal&#8208;Binding Sequence in Short Peptides Surprisingly Increases the Lanthanide Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accidentally reversing the lanthanide&#8208;binding sequences of lanmodulin&#8208;inspired short peptides lead to the serendipitous discovery of a set of peptides with a one order of magnitude higher lanthanide&#8208;binding affinity than the uncapped peptides synthesised in the correct direction.








Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for a clean energy future, high tech, and medicine. For these applications the chemically similar elements need to be tediously separated. Recent discoveries that specific lanthanide&#8208;binding proteins such as lanmodulin (LanM) exist in nature have prompted the development of bio&#8208;inspired separation methods for REEs. Peptides hold great potential for tuning binding sites in various applications as they are easily synthesised, modifiable, and can be immobilised. Here we use the EF&#8208;hand binding site sequences of LanM, the naturally lanthanide&#8208;binding EF&#8208;hand protein from Methylorubrum extorquens AM1, as a blueprint for peptides with potential applications in REE recycling. We show with time&#8208;resolved laser&#8208;induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy the surprising result that reversing the natural sequence of LanM's metal&#8208;binding loops leads to an increased binding affinity of about one order of magnitude for three out of four natural sequences. Furthermore, we were able to identify structural features responsible for the affinity boost and were able to obtain &#8211; only by exchanging one amino acid &#8211; a linear uncapped 12&#8208;amino&#8208;acid peptide with a 150&#160;nM affinity for lanthanides.

         <title>Enhanced Emission in Core@Shell Heterostructure of 3D Halide Double Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Cs2AgBiCl6@Cs2NaInCl6 core@shell heterostructure shows tenfold PLQY enhancement with continuous increase over 200 days without any external stimuli. It exhibits long&#8208;lived STE emission which was earlier absent in individual components. This study marks a significant step toward exploring heterostructures of lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites for advanced optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Inorganic metal halide double perovskites (HDPs) have successfully addressed the toxicity and instability concerns of lead&#8208;based perovskites. However, they still have to bridge a significant gap to obtain the desired optical properties. The fabrication of core@shell heterostructures is a well&#8208;known method for tuning the optical properties of materials; a technique yet to be explored for metal HDP nanocrystals (NCs). Nevertheless, the growth of core@shell perovskite nanocrystals is difficult because of the softness and ionic nature of the perovskite lattice. Here, we present a facile colloidal technique for the growth of a lead&#8208;free Cs2NaInCl6 shell on the surface of Cs2AgBiCl6 cubic NCs. This process leads to ten&#8208;fold enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) immediately and the PLQY keeps increasing with time. Optical measurements reveal the formation of new emissive states attributed to alloy formed at interface and carrier dynamics are investigated using time resolved PL and transient absorption data. This method of heterostructure formation is a remarkable approach to tune the optical characteristics of lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites.

         <title>Synthesis, Biological Activity, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations of LNA&#8208;Charge Neutral Linkages for Enhanced Splice&#8208;Switching Antisense Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Splice&#8208;switching oligonucleotides are used to treat severe genetic conditions including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, but new chemistries are urgently required to improve their efficacy. In this work locked nucleic acid (LNA) is coupled to different charge neutral DNA backbones which are studied by structural, thermodynamic, and biological methods. The sulfamate linkage in particular shows great promise.








Abstract
Antisense oligonucleotides are promising therapeutic agents for a range of diseases, having found special clinical success for splice&#8208;switching genetic conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, novel chemistries are still required to discover modifications which improve their druggable properties. For in vitro studies, thermal duplex stability, resistance to enzymatic degradation and gymnotic cellular activity are important, and biodistribution, toxicology and potency must be optimised for clinical progression. We investigate the combination of locked nucleic acids (LNA) and charge neutral backbones in chimeric ASOs containing 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyl sugars and phosphorothioate backbones by evaluating their physical and biological properties. Backbones investigated are LNA&#8208;amide, LNA&#8208;carbamate, LNA&#8208;alkoxyamide, and LNA&#8208;sulfamate. Molecular dynamics simulations of these LNA&#8208;charge neutral backbones were conducted to explore the structural features which determine the experimentally observed thermal duplex stability and conformation. The LNA&#8208;sulfamate linkage is of particular interest, forming very stable duplexes with its RNA target and having comparable gymnotic activity to the previously investigated LNA&#8208;amide, while being synthetically more accessible. Together, our studies indicate that a multi&#8208;faceted approach to expanding the ASO chemical space, using a combination of computational and experimental methods, can build structure&#8208;activity relationships and discover novel promising backbones for future therapeutic use.

         <title>Mn(I)&#8208;Complex Catalyzed Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate to &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot PET upcycling converts waste plastic to &#945;&#8208;hydroxyacids (&#945;&#8208;HCAs) and H2. The system handles colored/additive&#8208;laden PET without preprocessing, producing glycolate (86%), lactate (85%), and pharmaceutically relevant &#945;&#8208;HCAs at 120&#8211;140 &#176;C. Real&#8208;world applicability is demonstrated with high yields across bottle/textile PET while generating quantitative terephthalic acid and clean hydrogen fuel.








Abstract
The chemical upcycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste into value&#8208;added products presents a promising strategy to address global plastic pollution. Here, we report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed, one&#8208;pot approach for tandem PET depolymerization and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) to selectively produce &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids (&#945;&#8208;HCAs), including glycolic, lactic, and higher&#8208;value derivatives, along with terephthalic acid (TPA) and H2 gas. Employing bench&#8208;stable (PNP)Mn(I)&#8208;pincer complexes, this cascade process operates under mild conditions (120&#8211;140 &#176;C) and accommodates a broad range of primary alcohol coupling partners, enabling the synthesis of valuable biodegradable polymer precursors (glycolic and lactic acid) and higher &#945;&#8208;HCAs. Notably, the system exhibits exceptional tolerance to common plastic additives and requires no energy&#8208;intensive pretreatment, achieving near&#8208;quantitative TPA recovery and significant H2 evolution. This work demonstrates how base&#8208;metal catalysis can bridge plastic waste remediation and sustainable chemical synthesis, offering a practical pathway toward circular polymer economies.

         <title>Restoring Porosity and Uncovering Flexibility in Pillared 3D&#8208;Linker Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores new design approaches towards robust frameworks which retain structural flexibility and porosity after activation. By incorporating bulky 3D&#8208;linkers as anionic pillars with zinc triazolate sheets, moisture&#8208;stable metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are synthesized. In situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and gas adsorption techniques reveal structural transformations that preserve dynamic porosity.








Abstract
Porous adsorbents have emerged as leading materials for carbon capture, where pressure&#8208;controlled regeneration offers a key advantage over energy&#8208;demanding temperature swing adsorption. Flexible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) comprised of pillared linkers are proposed to meet this need due to the unique ability to adjust their pores to maximize host&#8208;guest interactions. However, many pillared MOFs show structural collapse following activation. We highlight a new approach to constructing pillared MOFs which retain their porosity upon activation, while also showing flexibility and selective gas adsorption. Two different MOFs were formed using cubane&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (cdc) as a pillar linking zinc triazolate sheets, [Zn2(trz)2(cdc)] and [Zn2(trz)2(Br&#8208;cdc)], and their structural framework dynamics investigated using advanced characterization techniques. In situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction performed in parallel with gas adsorption experiments revealed specific, reversible structural transformations between a narrow pore and open pore phase of the MOFs. These new MOFs reveal a high enthalpy of CO2 adsorption, driven by interesting network flexibility previously unobserved in the collapsed benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate analogue. A combination of experimental techniques and in silico calculations revealed that the phase transformations are governed by local coordination flexibility around the open&#8208;metal site available in [Zn2(trz)2(cdc)].

         <title>Transient Induction of Chirality from an Activated Carboxylic Acid to a Zinc Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;controlled induction of chirality on a Zn2+ metal complex is achieved by means of an enantiomerically pure activated carboxylic acid (ACA). Such chirality induction is due to the interaction between the Zn2+ cation and the carboxylate group of the ACA conjugate base that acts as a ligand. As the decarboxylation proceeds, the complex becomes racemic again with no enantiomeric/diastereomeric excess of any chemical species present in solution. 








Abstract
Enantiomerically pure activated carboxylic acids (ACAs), (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acids, are exploited to program the induction of chirality onto a zinc metal complex over time. NMR analysis shows that binding of the enantiopure ACA conjugate base to the Zn2+ center breaks the symmetry of the complex and induces the formation of a single diastereoisomeric metal complex. Such a diastereoisomer is present only as long as the ACA is found in solution, and the ACA loading determines the time interval in which it persists in solution. At the end of the dissipative ACA cycle, no diastereoisomeric/enantiomeric excess is present anymore in the mixture. For the first time, a coordination process involving an ACA, more precisely its conjugate base, instead of an acid&#8211;base reaction, is exploited to drive a dissipative system.

This work explores how tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy achieves submolecular resolution in detecting vibrational overtones and combination bands. This breakthrough reveals site&#8208;specific anharmonicities and energy transfer pathways within single molecules, advancing chemical analysis with unprecedented spatial and spectral detail.








Abstract
Vibrational spectroscopy can reach atomic spatial resolution via highly confined optical probes, offering local chemical insight. Yet, overtones and combination bands have not fully benefited due to weak transition moments. Here, we show submolecular&#8208;resolution detection of intense overtones and combination bands using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) for an asymmetric perylene derivative on silicon. The Raman peaks, barely visible in tunneling regime, are &#8764;10 times enhanced when the tip&#8208;apex contacts the molecule. This point&#8208;contact&#8208;mode TERS enables analysis of two anharmonicities with submolecular contrast: one arising from deviations of potential energy surfaces from harmonic shape (mechanical anharmonicity), the other from high&#8208;order polarizability derivatives (electrical anharmonicity). Spatial variation of mechanical anharmonicity reveals a vibrational energy exchange channel at the submolecular scale, highlighting potential to map energy transfer in real space.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Ligated Boryl Radicals Enables Direct C&#9472;F Borylation and Cross&#8208;Couplings of Polyfluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a synergistic strategy combining photocatalytic direct C&#9472;F borylation of polyfluoroarenes with Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. The high nucleophilicity of amine&#8208;ligated boryl radicals enables efficient homolytic aromatic substitution of polyfluoroarenes, forming stable amine&#8211;borane adducts that resist protodeboronation and can be directly used in cross&#8208;coupling to access functionalized polyfluoroarenes.








Abstract
Polyfluoroarenes are privileged scaffolds in pharmaceutical and materials science, yet their synthesis remains challenging. Aromatic borylation offers a modular entry point for derivatization via Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, but progress is hindered by two persistent issues: the difficulty of direct borylation on electron&#8208;deficient polyfluoroarenes, and the pronounced susceptibility of the resulting boron species to rapid protodeboronation under standard cross&#8208;coupling conditions. Here, we present an orthogonal strategy that addresses both limitations. Amine&#8208;ligated boryl radicals enable direct radical C&#9472;F borylation of polyfluoroarenes under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. The resulting amine&#8211;borane adducts are crystalline, bench&#8208;stable, and resistant to protodeboronation, allowing their direct use in Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. This platform provides scalable and broadly applicable access to functionalized polyfluoroarenes and overcomes some of the synthetic constraints associated with these valuable motifs.

         <title>Microdroplet&#8208;Driven Synthesis of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microdroplet chemistry can achieve rapid synthesis at room temperature of copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;MOFs), which can catalyze microbubble interfacial nitrogen oxidation into nitric acid.








Abstract
We report a room&#8208;temperature synthesis of copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;MOFs) using microdroplet chemistry, offering a fast and energy&#8208;efficient alternative to conventional solvothermal methods that typically require high temperatures, extended reaction times, and suffer from inhomogeneous mixing. The unique microdroplet environment significantly accelerates reaction kinetics, enabling the formation of uniform octahedral crystals within 1&#160;h at ambient conditions. Comprehensive characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface area analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed the high crystallinity, thermal stability, and porous structure of the Cu&#8208;MOFs. Compared to conventionally prepared Cu&#8208;MOFs, those synthesized via microdroplet chemistry exhibit comparable surface areas with improved exposure of active sites. As a demonstration of their catalytic potential, the MOFs were employed in a microbubble&#8208;assisted air&#8211;water interface system for nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions. The system effectively converted atmospheric nitrogen into nitrate, showcasing the practical utility of these materials in green chemical transformations. This study shows that microdroplet and microbubble technologies are powerful and sustainable platforms for MOF synthesis and catalytic applications.

         <title>Difluoro Carbenes: From Genuine Gold Complexes to Unprecedented Metallacyclic Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to chelating ligands and enhanced backdonation, genuine gold(I) difluorocarbenes persistent for hours at &#8722;30 &#176;C or even 0 &#176;C have been obtained. In addition to classical Fisher&#8208;type electrophilic behavior, these complexes display unprecedented reactivity toward alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes. Most noticeable is the formation of Au(III) metallacycles as a general, productive, and divergent route to [1+2] and [1+4] cycloadducts.








Abstract
Difluorocarbene is a very powerful synthon in organic chemistry, but its reactivity is very challenging to tame. While a few recent studies have pinpointed the potential of transition metals such as Pd and Cu to stabilize and harness difluorocarbene, known examples are confined to relatively classical transformations. Here we report gold(I) difluorocarbenes persisting for hours at 0 &#176;C thanks to ligand&#8208;enhanced backdonation. These complexes exhibit unforeseen reactivity with alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes. The key intermediates, gold(III) metallacycles, have been spectroscopically and crystallographically characterized. Choosing the ligand at gold and operating conditions (thermal or photochemical) enable to direct C&#9472;C coupling to the desired product. This novel gold&#8208;mediated two&#8208;electron redox pathway was leveraged to prepare difluorocyclopentenes, overcoming the intrinsic challenge of [1+4] cycloaddition between carbenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes.

         <title>Enzymatic Flow Electrolyzer for CO2 and Waste Comproportionation to Formate and Its Use in Photocatalytic Alkene Hydrocarboxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flow electrolyzer employing formate dehydrogenase on a porous TiO2&#8208;carbon felt cathode is developed for paired electrolysis of CO2 and waste (plastic and biomass) to produce formate. The electrolyzer operates with an initial cell faradaic efficiency toward formate of almost 200% at a low cell voltage of &#8722;1.5 V, which also enables bias&#8208;free operation with a commercial solar cell. The electrogenerated formate is used directly for photocatalytic carbon chain extension of styrene to phenylpropanoic acid.








Abstract
Paired electrolysis enables the simultaneous coupling of CO2 reduction with anodic waste upcycling to form valuable products. However, achieving selective, efficient, and stable product formation and coupling to downstream valorization remains a challenge. In this study, W&#8208;containing formate dehydrogenase from Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough is immobilized onto a cathode made from carbon felt coated with porous TiO2 and paired with a commercial Ni foam anode to assemble a semiartificial flow electrolyzer for the simultaneous conversion of CO2 and waste (plastic and biomass) to the single product formate. The enzymatic flow electrolyzer achieved an initial cell faradaic efficiency toward formate of almost 200%, a maximum CO2 conversion yield of 18% and can operate at a low full&#8208;cell voltage of &#8722;1.5&#160;V for 122&#160;h, which allows for bias&#8208;free operation with a silicon photovoltaic cell. The aqueous formate produced in the enzymatic electrolyzer was subsequently&#160;utilized downstream as a C1 building block in the photocatalytic hydrocarboxylation of alkenes, providing a path for the domino valorization of CO2 and waste toward bulk and fine chemical synthesis.

         <title>Rapid Construction of a Tyr C6&#8211;Trp C5&#8242; Linkage: Application in the Total Synthesis of Micitide 982, a Noncanonical Cyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the total synthesis of micitide 982. The key advancement lies in the combination of Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and regioselective Larock macrocyclization, which enables the efficient construction of the highly strained Tyr C6&#8208;to&#8208;Trp C5&#8242; linkage, as well as the completion of micitide 982.








Abstract
In this study, a facile synthesis method for a highly strained Tyr C6&#8208;to&#8208;Trp C5&#8242; linkage was developed. This method enables the convergent introduction of arbitrary biaryls to peptide linkers through electrochemically assisted Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling, followed by regioselective Larock macrocyclization. Additionally, using this approach, the total synthesis of the ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) molecule micitide 982 was accomplished. Furthermore, this synthetic strategy allows for the incorporation of various biaryls.

         <title>Alkynyl&#8208;Germanium Architectures Through Electrochemical Low&#8208;Valent Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Conjunctive Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of alkynyl chlorides and chlorogermanes enables efficient C&#9472;Ge bond formation under mild conditions. This sustainable protocol tolerates a broad range of substrates, including aromatic and aliphatic alkynyl chlorides, and applies to late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. Mechanistic studies implicate a low&#8208;valent iron (LnFe&#8304;) species as the active catalyst.








Abstract
Catalytic cross&#8208;coupling by transition metals has transformed carbon&#8211;germanium (C&#9472;Ge) bond formation in organic synthesis. The formation of unsaturated C(sp)&#9472;Ge bonds, however, remains a largely uncharted frontier. We herein report the construction of congested alkynyl&#8211;germane architectures via iron&#8208;catalyzed coupling of alkynyl chlorides with chlorogermanes, affording a broad spectrum of germane products. The methodology also enables late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and drug&#8208;derived molecules bearing C(sp)&#9472;Ge bonds, thereby demonstrating its synthetic utility. The scalability of the reaction and the facile derivatization of the products further underscore the robustness and versatility of this protocol. Mechanistic investigations reveal that LnFe&#8304; species serve as the initiating catalyst and provide insights into the pathway of this new iron&#8208;catalyzed electrophile cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Structural Tweaking of Zwitterionic Metallosupramolecular Assemblies for Intense NIR Emission and High Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just by changing the structure from a monotopic to ditopic, the metallosupramolecular assemblies of the terpyridine appended zwitterionic squaraine derivatives, MSq and DSq exhibited distinct optoelectronic properties. The DSq zinc ion complex (DSq&#8722;Zn2+) exhibited strong NIR emission and weaker photoconductivity whereas MSq zinc ion complex (MSq&#8722;Zn2+) showed relatively weak NIR emission, but higher charge carrier mobility (2.5&#160;cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1), the highest reported for a supramolecular assembly till date. 








Abstract
Metal organic materials (MOMs) with intense NIR emission and charge transport are essential for biomedical and bioelectronic applications, particularly in devices for medical diagnostics. Metallosupramolecular assemblies guided by directional metal&#8722;ligand coordination is a viable option for creating MOMs with strong electronic communication required for targeted optical and electronic properties. Herein, we demonstrate that the zwitterionic metallosupramolecular assemblies of squaraine dyes can be structurally tweaked to exhibit exceptionally intense NIR emission on the one hand and charge carrier mobility on the other hand. We have designed a monotopic squaraine dye (MSq) and a ditopic squaraine dye (DSq) and their corresponding metallosupramolecular assemblies. Among these, the Zn2+ coordinated metallosupramolecular assemblies of DSq showed strong near infrared luminescence with a maximum at 666&#160;nm whereas the one generated with MSq exhibited a high charge carrier mobility 2.5&#160;cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 when compared to the parent squaraine dye. This value is the highest measured for a metallosupramolecular system known till date.

         <title>Interplay of Polar Order and Positional Order in Liquid Crystals&#8211;Observation of Re&#8208;entrant Ferroelectric Nematic Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In most systems the degree of order increases monotonically with decreasing temperature. Here we report that due to unfavourable dipole interactions within the smectic layers, the lamellar structure of a liquid crystal may be spontaneously destroyed by the development of polar, ferroelectric order. This leads to the re&#8208;entrant phenomenon, in which the liquid phase (nematic) is formed on cooling from the 1D crystal phase (smectic).








Abstract
We show that development of polar order may spontaneously destroy the lamellar structure of a liquid crystal. This results in an unusual sequence of phases, with the ferroelectric nematic phase appearing below a non&#8208;polar smectic phase. The effect is related to unfavourable dipole interactions within the smectic layers and can be explained by Landau theory, in which the temperature&#8208;dependent term is non&#8208;monotonic as it is renormalised by spontaneous electric polarisation.

         <title>Inverting the Circularly Polarized Luminescence Handedness of Chiral Supramolecular Polymers Using Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular polymerization of enantiopure triarylamine trisamide monomers bearing aggregation&#8208;induced emissive tetraphenylethene units, gave rise to a strong circularly polarized luminescence (with glum values as high as |1.8&#183;10&#8722;2|). Strikingly, upon fast versus slow cooling rates, these monomers formed distinct hierarchical self&#8208;assemblies (i.e., (P)&#8208;helices versus (M)&#8208;superhelices) that emitted circularly polarized light of opposite handedness.








Abstract
The supramolecular polymerization and chiroptical properties of two enantiopure triarylamine trisamide (TATA) monomers bearing aggregation&#8208;induced emissive tetraphenylethene (TPE) units are described. A monosubstituted and a trisubstituted monomer were synthesized and their self&#8208;assembly was investigated upon either fast or slow cooling of chlorobenzene solutions. Depending on the cooling rate, two distinct fluorescent self&#8208;assemblies of opposite supramolecular chiralities were obtained from each monomer. Both the TATA and the TPE units were found to play important roles in the self&#8208;assembly process and chiroptical properties. Remarkably, the self&#8208;assembly of the monosubstituted monomer gave rise to a strong circularly polarized luminescence originating from the TATA core (glum values as high as |1.8&#183;10&#8722;2| in solution) with opposite cooling&#8208;rate&#8208;dependent handedness.

Both the TATA and the TPE units were found to play important roles in the self-assembly process and chiroptical properties. Remarkably, the self-assembly of the monosubstituted monomer gave rise to a strong circularly polarized luminescence originating from the TATA core (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values as high as |1.8&#183;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;| in solution) with opposite cooling-rate-dependent handedness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Site Organoboron Catalysts Enable Sequence&#8208;Regulated Terpolymerization of Epoxides, CO2, and &#946;&#8208;Propiolactone via Intermolecular Chain Shuttling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chain shuttling terpolymerization of epoxides, CO2, and &#946;&#8208;propiolactone (BPL) is realized by using mixture of mononuclear (1) and dinuclear (2) organoboron catalysts, synthesizing gradient polycarbonate&#8208;grad&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hydroxypropiorate) (PC&#8208;grad&#8208;P3HP) terpolymers. This work establishes the first metal&#8208;free, chain&#8208;shuttling platform for sequence&#8208;regulated PC&#8208;PHA terpolymers, extending the scope of programmable biodegradable materials beyond metal&#8208;catalyzed systems.








Abstract
Sequence regulation in synthetic polymers is essential for tailoring material properties; however, achieving precise control in polycarbonate&#8208;polyhydroxyalkanoate (PC&#8208;PHA) terpolymers derived from epoxides, CO2, and &#946;&#8208;lactones remains challenging. Current metal&#8208;based catalysts lack multisite strategies for sequence diversification, limiting the formation of gradient architectures. This study employed mononuclear (catalyst 1) and dinuclear (catalyst 2) organoboron catalysts to mediate the terpolymerization of epoxides, CO2, and &#946;&#8208;propiolactone (BPL). Kinetic analysis, NMR spectroscopy, and a chain&#8208;shuttling approach with mixed catalysts were utilized to regulate sequences. Key findings indicated: i) Catalyst 1 preferentially promoted &#946;&#8208;propiolactone ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), forming tapered P3HP&#8208;b&#8208;PC blocks, whereas catalyst 2 enhanced epoxide/CO2 ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP), yielding PC&#8208;b&#8208;P3HP; ii) Boron centers kinetically suppressed ROP but increased ROCOP efficiency; iii) Mixed 1 and 2 catalysts enabled intermolecular chain shuttling, synthesizing gradient PC&#8208;grad&#8208;P3HP terpolymers; and iv) Terpolymer compositions modulated thermal properties from amorphous to crystalline. This work establishes the first metal&#8208;free, chain&#8208;shuttling platform for sequence&#8208;regulated PC&#8208;PHA terpolymers, extending the scope of programmable biodegradable materials beyond metal&#8208;catalyzed systems.

Abstract
2&#8208;Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes have been designed, synthesized, and validated biologically as isosteres of piperidine/pyridine. The key reaction step was the cyclization of cyclic alkenyl amines with the KOtBu/I2/CO2 combination. The method proved to be scalable (up to 20&#160;g) and general: it was also applied for the synthesis of 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, 2&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, 7&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, and 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octanes. Finally, combined with the nitrogen deletion tactic, this method also opened a practical way toward the previously hardly accessible 1,2&#8208;disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes&#8212;saturated analogues of ortho&#8208;benzenes.

         <title>Rapaprotin, an Endopeptidase&#8208;Activated Proteasome Inhibitor that Induces 26S Disassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapaprotin is a novel inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. The cyclic rapaprotin is a pro&#8208;drug. Upon entry into cancer cells, it undergoes cleavage by prolyl endopeptidase to give rise to the active linear rapaprotin&#8208;L, which induces the disassembly of the 26S proteasome and impairs its function. This unprecedented mechanism of action is attributable to the selectivity of rapaprotin for cancer cells and its synergy with existing proteasome inhibitory drugs.








Abstract
The 19S regulatory particle (RP) associates with the 20S core particle (CP) to form the 26S proteasome, an evolutionarily conserved holoenzyme that plays key roles in both physiological and pathological processes. Proteasome inhibitors that target the catalytic subunits within the 20S have proven to be valuable research tools and therapeutics for various cancers. Herein we report the discovery of rapaprotin, a 26S proteasome assembly inhibitor from our natural product&#8208;inspired hybrid macrocycle rapafucin library. Rapaprotin induces apoptosis in both myeloma and leukemia cell lines. Genome&#8208;wide CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 screen identified a cytosolic enzyme, prolyl endopeptidase (PREP) that is required for the pro&#8208;apoptotic activity of rapaprotin. Further mechanistic studies revealed that rapaprotin acts as a molecular transformer, changing from an inactive cyclic form into an active linear form, rapaprotin&#8208;L, upon PREP cleavage, to block 26S proteasome activity. Time&#8208;resolved cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) revealed that rapaprotin&#8208;L induces dissociation of the 19S RP from the 26S holoenzyme, which was verified in cells. Furthermore, rapaprotin exhibits a marked synergistic effect with FDA&#8208;approved proteasome inhibitors and resensitizes drug&#8208;resistant multiple myeloma cells from patients to bortezomib. Taken together, these results suggest that rapaprotin is a new chemical tool to probe the dynamics of the 26S proteasome assembly and a promising anticancer drug lead.

         <title>Degradable Polyketone Thermoplastic Elastomers with Biomass Sourced Composition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a sustainable synthesis of degradable thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) through the nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative polymerization of ethylene and biomass&#8208;derived polar monomers (PMs). The high&#8208;performance polyketone elastomers exhibit high strength and thermal resistance, while simultaneously achieving industrial durability and end&#8208;of&#8208;life degradability.








Abstract
Polyolefin elastomers (POEs) serve as versatile materials bridging rubber and plastic properties across a variety of industrial processes, but their environmental persistence stemming from inert hydrocarbon composition raises ecological concerns. Here, we present a sustainable synthesis of degradable thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) through the carbonylative polymerization of ethylene and biomass&#8208;derived polar monomers (PMs). A cost&#8208;effective and scalable nickel catalyst has overcome the dual poison to metal center resulted from polar acid or ester motif and CO, enabling the synthesis of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyketone materials with moderate strain recovery (SR) values ranging from 27% to 61%. The resulting polyketones exhibit high melting temperature (109&#160;&#176;C&#8211;244&#160;&#176;C) and tensile strength (14.9&#8211;41.6&#160;MPa), corresponding to thermally resistant TPEs. This study demonstrates one type of high&#8208;performance TPEs having biomass sourced composition that combine industrial durability with photodegradability.

The resulting polyketones exhibit high melting temperature (109&#160;&#176;C&#8211;244&#160;&#176;C) and tensile strength (14.9&#8211;41.6&#160;MPa), corresponding to thermally resistant TPEs. This study demonstrates one type of high-performance TPEs having biomass sourced composition that combine industrial durability with photodegradability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective &#945;&#9472;C&#9472;H Functionalization of Saturated Heterocycles via Copper&#8208;Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selective C&#945;&#9472;H functionalization of saturated heterocycles with chemically similar C&#9472;H bonds is realized for the first time by copper&#8208;photoredox catalysis. This undirected strategy exploits copper photocatalyst's ability to mediate both substrate activation and photoinduced energy transfer, offering excellent site&#8208;selectivity complementary to previous HAT events. Such a general and new protocol utilizes air as the HAT precursor and oxidant.








Abstract
Site&#8208;selective &#945;&#9472;C&#9472;H functionalization of saturated heterocycles is of particular importance in synthetic and medicinal chemistry, but the intrinsic chemical inertness of saturated heterocycles renders the transformation difficult. Furthermore, site&#8208;selectivity remains a significant challenge, especially among multiple C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds with comparable chemical properties. Herein, an unprecedented site&#8208;selective C&#945;&#9472;H functionalization of saturated heterocycles by copper&#8208;photoredox catalysis is described. This undirected approach exploits a novel copper photocatalyst to mediate both substrate activation and photoinduced energy transfer, enabling site&#8208;selective functionalization of cyclic C&#945;&#9472;H bonds in the presence of competitive C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds. Mechanistic studies reveal that the excellent site&#8208;selectivity stems from the coordination effect between the saturated heterocycle and copper/ligand complex, which makes the cyclic C&#945;&#9472;H bond more acidic and weaker in bond strength, thereby increasing the reactivity differences among similar C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds. The use of dual&#8208;role air bypasses exogenous HAT reagents and oxidants required in previous methods. This mild and sustainable protocol features broad substrate scope, excellent site&#8208;selectivity, and high functional group compatibility, providing a new and site&#8208;selective reactivity mode for rapid diversification of &#945;&#9472;C&#9472;H bonds.

         <title>Triangular Nanotoroids Self&#8208;Assembled from Polypeptide Homopolymers: The Formation Route and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangular nanotoroids are formed by polypeptides in solution via three successive steps, including self&#8208;assembly of the polypeptides into nanofibers, convolving of the nanofibers into circular nanotoroids, and folding of the circular nanotoroids into triangular nanotoroids with saddle&#8208;like and V&#8208;shaped nanotoroids as the intermediates. The driving force for these self&#8208;assembly behaviors is the decrease in interfacial area of the polypeptides, which compensates the increase in their interfacial energy under water additions.








Abstract
Polymer nanotoroids have attracted increasing attentions recently. The topology of the nanotoroids is mainly limited to circular form, while noncircular forms are rarely observed. The preparation method and formation mechanism for noncircular nanotoroids are not well governed. Reported here is a finding of triangular nanotoroids self&#8208;assembled from hydrophobic polypeptides in solution. With the addition of water, the polypeptides become less soluble in the solution, they self&#8208;assemble into nanofibers. When more water is introduced, the polypeptides tend to shrink to decrease their interfacial area, which generates internal twist stress driving the nanofibers convolve into circular nanotoroids. Under further water additions, the polypeptides further shrink to decrease their interfacial area. As a result, the circular nanotoroids bend and fold into triangular nanotoroids, with saddle&#8208;like and V&#8208;shaped nanotoroids as the intermediates. This work presents a first example regarding triangular nanotoroids formed by polymers, and demonstrates an effective way by generating internal stress to regulating the topology of the polymer nanotoroids.

         <title>Enhancing Ionic Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>

A one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process is developed to simultaneously synthesize a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point solid electrolyte and infiltrates it into polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide. This design enables fast ion transport, full activation of the Li2MnO3 phase, improved reversibility of oxygen redox, and outstanding electrochemical performance in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.

         <title>A Chemical Glycoproteomic Approach Decrypts Urinary Extracellular Vesicle Surfaceome for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Grading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for extracellular vesicle surface comprehensive one&#8208;pot proteomic exploration (EVscope) is developed. EVscope unlocks the high&#8208;resolution surfaceome profiling from small&#8208;volume biofluids within a short time and identifies prostate cancer biomarkers by generating the largest urine&#8208;derived EV surface protein dataset to date.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicle (EV) surface proteins serve as the fundamental signaling mediators, determining the communication function of EVs. The selective and in&#8208;depth exploration of EV surface proteome (surfaceome) is highly compelling but remains technically challenging due to the unique physicochemical properties of surface proteins. These hurdles are further compounded by the inherent heterogeneity of EVs and the low abundance of surface targets in biofluids. Herein, we developed a chemical glycoproteomic strategy, EVscope (EV surface comprehensive one&#8208;pot proteomic exploration), for comprehensively profiling the EV surfaceome. The hydrophilic and aromatic lipophilic group&#8208;modified magnetic beads enable bias&#8208;free EV isolation and in situ oxidation and labeling of cis&#8208;diols on surface proteins. Subsequent on&#8208;bead processes, including EV lysis, protein digestion, and surface glycopeptide enrichment, collectively maximize surfaceome coverage. Applied to urine samples from 368 individuals with prostate&#8208;related diseases, EVscope identified 1,121 EV surface proteins, establishing the largest urine&#8208;derived EV surfaceome dataset to date and identifying cathepsin L, integrin alpha 3, fibrinogen beta chain, and tetraspanin&#8208;1 as characteristic proteins with potential as noninvasive biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis and grading. In summary, this study establishes an innovative methodology for high&#8208;resolution EV surfaceome analysis, facilitating noninvasive biomarker discovery and enabling direct detection in population&#8208;scale screening.

         <title>Self&#8208;Consistent Cation&#8211;Anion Integration Eliminates Passivation Crosstalk for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied cation competition and interactions in conventional mixed passivation systems and proposed a self&#8208;consistent cation&#8211;anion integrated passivation strategy using designed PDA(TFA)2. This strategy enables chemical/field&#8208;effect passivation, interfacial bridging, and ion&#8208;migration suppression, yielding 23.23%&#8208;efficient 1.68&#8208;eV perovskite solar cells. Perovskite/silicon tandems reach 32.33% (certified 31.39%) with a record VOC of 1.992&#160;V.








Abstract
The wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) absorber in silicon/perovskite tandem solar cells face persistent challenges of interfacial defects and energy&#8208;level misalignment. Although dual&#8208;cation passivators have demonstrated the potential to address these issues simultaneously, their efficacy is hindered by cation competition for binding sites and modification conflicts, which limit further device improvement. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a self&#8208;consistent cation&#8211;anion integrated passivation (SCAP) strategy, designing a multifunctional passivator, PDA(TFA)2, where the bipolar trifluoroacetate (TFA) anion is paired with 1,3&#8208;propanediamine (PDA) cations. This SCAP approach eliminates cation competition by enabling defect and field&#8208;effect passivation in a unified framework. Specifically, the bipolar TFA anion efficiently passivates halide vacancies and bridges the perovskite and C60 interface, while the PDA cations induce surface dipoles and optimize band alignment. Therefore, optimized 1.68&#160;eV WBG perovskite solar cells achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.23% with an exceptional open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.27&#160;V. Furthermore, this strategy achieves a 32.33% PCE (31.47% certified stabilized PCE) for a 0.945&#160;cm2 monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem cell, delivering an ultra&#8208;high 1.992&#160;V open&#8208;circuit voltage. These findings underscore the transformative potential of the SCAP strategy in advancing the efficiency and stability of WBG perovskite photovoltaics, paving the way for next&#8208;generation tandem solar cells.

         <title>Concurrent Ferroptosis and Pyroptosis Induced by a Dual&#8208;Organelle&#8208;Targeted Type I/II AIE Photosensitizer for Bladder Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a dual&#8208;targeting aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer (AIE PS) that specifically accumulates in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#160;and lipid droplets (LDs). Upon irradiation, it produces multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS), inducing organelle disruption, lipid peroxidation, and concurrent ferroptosis and pyroptosis, ultimately activating potent anti&#8208;tumor immunity. 








Abstract
The therapeutic efficacy and cell death modalities of photodynamic therapy (PDT) highly depend on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation mediated by photosensitizers (PSs) and their subcellular localization. However, research exploring the potential mechanisms underlying ROS&#8208;induced ferroptosis and pyroptosis remains scarce. In this study, we develop a type I/II aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer (AIE PS), DFTBPPY (DY), that primarily accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs) to disrupt lipid homeostasis and induce concurrent cell death against bladder cancer. DY is selectively endocytosed by tumor cells and anchors in both ER and LDs. Upon laser irradiation, in situ DY can generate ROS to initiate oxidative stress and damage the functions of the ER and LDs. This disruption thereby initiates a lipid peroxidation&#8208;cascading cell death pathway involving ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and immunogenic cell death (ICD), leading to potent antitumor effects. Our findings demonstrate that DY, as a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted PS, enhances therapeutic outcomes by orchestrating concurrent cell death mechanisms, which represents a promising alternative therapeutic strategy and highlights the potential of lipid imbalance in concurrent cell death for bladder cancer.

         <title>Single Fusion Pore Analysis via Single Cell Amperometry Uncovers Impaired Pore Expansion That Restricts Insulin Exocytosis in Human Type 2 Diabetes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final step in insulin exocytosis from pancreatic beta cells is the formation of the fusion pore. We combined single&#8208;cell amperometry with microsensors and fluorescence microscopy to monitor insulin exocytosis from different perspectives. Our results reveal a link between impaired fusion pore function and diminished insulin secretion, highlighting an unexplored impact of diabetes and a potential therapeutic target.








Abstract
Insulin secretion from vesicles within pancreatic beta cells occurs through the rapid (&#8804;10 ms) process of exocytosis. A crucial final step in this process is the formation of a fusion pore, which connects the insulin vesicle interior to the extracellular space and insulin secretion rate. We employed real&#8208;time single&#8208;cell amperometry (SCA) with microsensors to quantitatively and dynamically monitor serotonin secretion (used as a proxy for insulin) and alterations in the dynamics of fusion pore formation, including opening, duration, and closing times, during single exocytosis events. Additionally, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy was used to track docked vesicles and optically measure insulin release. In beta cells from human organ donors with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the fusion pore opening was prematurely aborted, leading to diminished cargo release. Furthermore, the number of docked vesicles per beta cell differed between healthy donors and individuals with T2D. In conclusion, our combined super&#8208;sensitive optical and electrochemical analyses from a new perspective highlight a link between defective fusion pore dynamics and reduced insulin secretion (a hallmark of T2D) that has not been previously reported. These findings reveal the role of impaired fusion pore dynamics in T2D, independent of its underlying etiology, with potential therapeutic implications.

We present a strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic &#946;&#8208;lactamase production at the single&#8208;cell level using SRRRS, enabling PAK detection and SRRRS&#8208;imaging AST within 175&#160;min. This unique SRRRS approach reduces the detection limit of AMR bacteria to 100&#160;cfu mL&#8722;1, which is 3&#8211;4 orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional optical probes. This method offers a pivotal means for the appropriate and timely administration of antibiotics in clinical settings.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a formidable worldwide public health crisis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), the current gold standard for AMR detection, is essential for guiding antibiotic usage but requires days of bacterial culture. We herein report a stimulus&#8208;responsive resonance Raman scattering (SRRRS) imaging technique for real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic &#946;&#8208;lactamase expression at the single&#8208;cell level, allowing AMR detection and antibiotic screening within 2.5&#160;h. The detection limit of AMR bacteria can be down to 102&#160;cfu mL&#8722;1 using the SRRRS&#8208;imaging technique, which is 3&#8211;4 orders of magnitude lower than conventional optical probes. We further constructed a SRRRS&#8208;imaging&#8208;derived antibiotic breakpoints library for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa, PAK), enabling rapid susceptibility testing for 14 antibiotics within 3&#160;h without bacterial culture. Clinical validation with 30 intensive care unit patients demonstrated 93% accuracy, offering a transformative tool for guiding timely antibiotic prescriptions and improving outcomes in PAK&#8208;related infections.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes on a III&#8208;V Semiconductor: From Chain Formation to Ordered Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of GaAs, a model III&#8208;V semiconductor, with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes is demonstrated in a multidisciplinary experimental and theoretical approach. In this way, ordered monolayers consisting of chains of molecules binding covalently to the surface are obtained, which are found to strongly modify the surface properties as evident from large work function reductions.








Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are established ligands for various surfaces, known for their strong binding, ability to form self&#8208;assembled monolayers, and modular structure. However, semiconductor surface modification with NHCs is still in its infancy despite its technological importance. Although previous studies focused on silicon, III&#8208;V compound semiconductors offer direct bandgaps and high electron mobilities, making them ideal for (opto&#8208;)electronics. This study examines the adsorption of different NHCs on GaAs, a prototypical III&#8208;V material, using scanning tunneling microscopy, density functional theory, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low&#8208;energy electron diffraction, and reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy. Covalent binding to the surface and the formation of well&#8208;ordered NHC monolayers are observed, along with exceptionally large work function reductions. The unique structural features of NHCs enable precise control over film structure, ordering, and electronic properties.

         <title>Fully Sensitized Upconversion Nanoparticles as Efficient Catalysts for NIR&#8208;Driven UV Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>

Engineered NaYbF4:Tm3+@NaYF4 nanoparticles, featuring a fully sensitized Yb3+ lattice and an optimized core&#8211;shell architecture, convert five 980&#160;nm photons by sequential absorption into a single 345&#160;nm ultraviolet (UV) photon. This unprecedented anti&#8208;Stokes shift enables energy&#8208;demanding [2&#160;+&#160;2] photocycloadditions under mild, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitation&#8212;unlocking high&#8208;energy photochemistry with exceptional efficiency. 








Abstract
Biological photosynthesis harnesses energy from multiple photons to drive complex chemical transformations. In contrast, chemical photocatalysis typically relies on single&#8208;photon excitation, limiting its applicability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;demanding reactions. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), which can convert multiple low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons into a single higher&#8208;energy photon, offer a promising solution. We synthesized and systematically improved NaYbF4:Tm@NaYF4 nanoparticles, focusing on sensitizer concentration, dopant spacing, and shell thickness to enhance ultraviolet (UV) and blue emission. Compared to low doped NaYF4:Yb,&#160;Tm systems, our nanoparticles exhibited significantly improved brightness, with a 210&#8208;fold enhancement in UV emission at 345&#160;nm. Using these UCNPs as heterogeneous photocatalysts, we achieved efficient [2&#160;+&#160;2] photocycloadditions and Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reactions under 980&#160;nm excitation, with turnover numbers (TON) exceeding 290,000 and turnover frequencies (TOF) up to 8.52&#160;s&#8722;1. Additionally, the UCNP catalysts were readily recoverable. Our results provide a rational framework for tailoring UCNPs for energy&#8208;demanding photochemical reactions and establish their potential in synthetic and biomedical applications that require deep&#8208;tissue, low&#8208;phototoxicity excitation.

         <title>Imidazolium&#8208;Derived Porous Organic Polymer as Robust Platform for Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed N2O Hydrogenation and Alcohol Oxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous NHC&#8208;polymer with large surface area anchors Rh amide sites to yield a stable and highly active catalyst for efficient hydrogenation of N2O and selective alcohol dehydrogenation, outperforming molecular analogues. Spatially arranged NHC sites prevent Rh deactivation and leaching, enabling sustainable conversion of a climate&#8208;relevant gas into benign/valuable chemical products.








Abstract
The catalytic conversion of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas and ozone&#8208;depleting substance, offers a promising strategy for mitigating emissions but requires efficient catalysts that operate under mild conditions. Here, a porous organic polymer was designed as a functional platform for accommodating built&#8208;in catalytic sites. The polymer incorporates rigid 1,3&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazolium iodide units as stable precursors to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, providing suitable coordination sites to molecular catalysts, high surface area, and chemical robustness. Deprotonating these precursors generates free carbene ligands that effectively coordinate and immobilize a rhodium bis(olefin) amine complex. Upon activation with base, the air stable immobilized complex forms reactive metal&#8208;ligand cooperative Rh&#8211;N sites that convert nitrous oxide to nitrogen via in situ generated rhodium(I) hydride species. Exceptional performance was observed during catalytic hydrogenation of nitrous oxide under heterogeneous solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas conditions in batch reactors (using tetrahydrofuran or water) and under solid&#8211;gas conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst enabled the dehydrogenative coupling of primary alcohols (methanol, ethanol and benzyl alcohol) with nitrous oxide as a hydrogen acceptor, achieving turnover numbers that surpass all previously reported catalysts. These findings demonstrate the potential of porous organic polymer&#8211;metal complexes as robust, recyclable and efficient catalysts.

         <title>Dissimilar Reactions and Enzymes for Psilocybin Biosynthesis in Inocybe and Psilocybe Mushrooms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mushrooms have learned twice independently how to make the iconic magic mushroom natural product psilocybin. This article introduces the enzymes of the second pathway, found in a fiber cap mushroom. Curiously, the two pathways do not share any reaction, nor do the enzymes show a close relationship, but both pathways proceed via 4&#8208;hydroxytryptamine as a common intermediate.








Abstract
Psilocybin (4&#8208;phosphoryloxy&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethyltryptamine, 1) is the main indolethyl&#8208;amine natural product of psychotropic (so&#8208;called &#8220;magic&#8221;) mushrooms. The majority of 1&#8208;producing species belongs to the eponymous genus Psilocybe, for which the biosynthetic events, beginning from l&#8208;tryptophan (2), and the involved enzymes have thoroughly been characterized. Some Inocybe (fiber cap) species, among them Inocybe corydalina, produce 1 as well. In product formation assays, we characterized four recombinantly produced biosynthesis enzymes of this species in vitro: IpsD, a pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent l&#8208;tryptophan decarboxylase, the kinase IpsK, and two near&#8208;identical methyltransferases, IpsM1 and IpsM2. The fifth enzyme, the insoluble monooxygenase IpsH, was analyzed in silico. Surprisingly, none of the reactions intrinsic to the 1 pathway in Psilocybe species takes place in I. corydalina. Contrasting the situation in Psilocybe, the Inocybe pathway is branched and leads to baeocystin (4&#8208;phosphoryloxy&#8208;N&#8208;methyltryptamine, 3) as a second end product. Our results demonstrate that mushrooms recruited distantly or entirely unrelated enzymes to evolve the metabolic capacity for 1 biosynthesis twice independently.

Optimized ZnZrOx/SAPO&#8208;18 demonstrates 88.7% light olefins selectivity at 9.5% CO2 conversion, and the O/P ratio is as high as 17.7. Attributed to the acid site distribution and ellipsoidal cage of SAPO&#8208;18, the HCP species, represented by tetramethylbenzene and pentamethylbenzene, collectively enabling 68.4% propylene and butylene selectivity.








Abstract
Recycling CO2 to light olefins (C2 =${}^{=} $ &#8208; C4 =${}^{=} $) is a promising strategy for long&#8208;term carbon storage. However, selective hydrogenation to light olefins while suppressing alkane formation remains a challenge. This work presents an optimized ZnZrOx/SAPO&#8208;18 tandem catalyst, which achieves 88.7% light olefins selectivity at 9.5% CO2 conversion with C3 =${}^{=} $ +C4 =${}^{=} $ dominating 68.4% of the hydrocarbons. The catalyst exhibits resistance to over hydrogenation, yielding the&#160;(C2 =${}^{=} $ &#8722;C4 =${}^{=} $)/(C20&#8722;C40) (O/P) ratio of 17.7 and only&#160; 1.4% CH4 selectivity. Furthermore, the catalyst shows good stability over 100&#160;h on stream without obvious deactivation, owing to the synergistic effect between ZnZrOx and the reaction conditions, which facilitates the elimination of coke deposition. Hydrothermal treatment brings more Zn&#9472;O&#9472;Zr active sites and oxygen vacancies (Ov) on ZnZrOx, as well as the modulated Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in SAPO&#8208;18 suppresses the over&#8208;hydrogenation of olefins, and the AEI&#8208;type cage can contain expanded hydrocarbon pool (HCP) intermediates for enhanced C3 =${}^{=} $ +C4 =${}^{=} $ formation. This study advances the development of selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;olefin conversion technologies.

         <title>Active Transport of Macrocycles into Micelles Using Molecular Pumps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial molecular pumps attached to polymeric micelles were found capable of transporting charged macrocycles into the micelles. The pumps operate with only modestly reduced pumping efficiency as compared to nonmicellar counterparts, indicating that ring&#8208;threading molecular pumps can transport charged solutes into supramolecular assemblies, akin to nature's transmembrane transporters which actively transport solutes into and out of cells.








Abstract
During the past decade, researchers have designed and synthesised a variety of artificial molecular pumps capable of the active transport of macrocycles (rings) from free solution into mechanically interlocked states. In their ability to drive non&#8208;equilibrium transport, these artificial molecular pumps imitate natural transmembrane transporters, which are widespread in living organisms. Despite this resemblance, ring&#8208;threading molecular pumps have not previously been operated in aqueous supramolecular assemblies in imitation of their natural counterparts. Here, we demonstrate the active transport of charged macrocycles from aqueous solution into micellar assemblies of polymer chains, which remain stable after pumping has occurred. While micelles are used routinely to encapsulate and solubilise hydrophobic small molecules in aqueous solution, this report, by contrast, shows that artificial molecular pumps can harness external energy to drive hydrophilic molecules into micelles where they are stored at concentrations far from equilibrium.

         <title>Hydrophobic Polymer Zwitterions: Impacts of Silylsilane Substitution on Solution and Interfacial Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of a new class of zwitterion is described, specifically silylsilane&#8208;substituted sulfobetaine (SB) methacrylate monomers and polymers. The resultant hydrophobic polymer zwitterions (HPZs) exhibited exceptionally unusual solubility unusual relative to conventional zwitterionic polymers, owing to the dominance of the hydrophobic moieties on solution properties. The unique HPZ structure was found to translate to unusual surface and solution properties, including water&#8208;adhesive coatings and high aspect ratio structures in solution.








Abstract
A new class of zwitterionic polymer amphiphiles was prepared by synthesis and polymerization of novel silyl&#8208;substituted sulfobetaine (SB) methacrylate monomers. These silyl&#8208;SB methacrylates proved amenable to controlled free radical polymerization methods to afford hydrophobic polymer zwitterions (HPZs) with solubility properties not observed previously for polymer zwitterions (PZs) owing to the dominance of the alkylsilyl groups on solution behavior and surface properties. For example, the solubility profile of HPZs does not overlap with most conventional PZs&#8212;they are insoluble in aqueous solutions or trifluoroethanol and instead are soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform and tetrahydrofuran. Interestingly, HPZs exhibited an apparent propensity to form structures in which the zwitterionic components are shielded from the surrounding organic solvent in favor of displaying the alkylsilyl groups. In THF, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) results are characteristic of high aspect ratio (rod&#8208; or cylinder&#8208;like) structures. Moreover, as thin films HPZs imparted a marked effect on surface properties relative to typical zwitterionic coatings, where the dynamic interplay between hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties pins water to the surface. This affords surfaces that are simultaneously hydrophobic and water&#8208;adhesive, offering an alternative to the types of fluorocarbon&#8208;based structures under scrutiny as perfluoroalkyl substances (i.e., PFAS).

         <title>Enhanced Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via Isomerization Engineering of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomerization engineering is applied to design and synthesize carbazole&#8208;based SAMs. Benefiting from enhanced dipole moment, optimized energy alignment, and robust interfacial anchoring by isomeric SAMs, PPACz&#8208;based inverted PSCs achieved an impressive PCE of 26.1% with enhanced stability.








Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based SAMs show great promise as interfacial modifiers in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Their large dipole moments and covalent binding capabilities suppress charge recombination and enhance device stability. We designed two isomeric carbazole SAMs (EPACz and PPACz) by adjusting the phenyl ring position. PPACz exhibits a higher dipole moment (2.60&#160;D versus 1.77&#160;D for EPACz) and a narrower HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (2.39&#160;eV), enabling superior hole extraction. PPACz&#8208;based devices achieved an excellent PCE of 26.1% (versus 22.0% for EPACz), with 23.5% efficiency for 1&#160;cm2 devices. The stronger tridentate&#160;anchoring of PPACz to ITO (compared with EPACz) improves interfacial stability. Unencapsulated devices retained over 90% of their initial efficiency after 540&#160;h, demonstrating exceptional durability. This work provides key insights for designing high&#8208;performance SAMs in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds with High Efficiency and Alkyl Group Dihydroxylation of Complex Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The late&#8208;stage oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds is valuable for modulating properties and diversification. We report that perfluorinated ruthenium porphyrins catalyze the undirected C(sp3)&#9472;H oxidation of various natural products and drugs with high turnover numbers. In combination with directed C&#9472;H silylation, alkyl groups remote from existing functionality can be formally dihydroxylated.








Abstract
The late&#8208;stage oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds is highly valuable for modulating the solubility and binding of bioactive compounds and for diversification of complex molecules. Undirected methods for C(sp3)&#9472;H oxidation are valuable for the installation of hydroxyl groups at sites remote from other functional groups present in the molecule, but existing catalysts are limited by low turnover numbers and lengthy ligand syntheses. Perfluorinated ruthenium porphyrins are highly active catalysts for the oxidation of alkyl C&#9472;H bonds, but the scope of the transformation with complex molecules under conditions of limiting substrate has not been investigated. We report that carbonylruthenium(II) tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin [Ru(TPFPP)(CO)] catalyzes the selective oxidation of tertiary C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in a broad range of complex natural products and drugs, with turnover numbers as high as 1000, and the tolerance of the reaction to various functional groups was rapidly assessed by performing a model reaction in the presence of additives. We show how the combination of this undirected C(sp3)&#9472;H oxidation and a directed C(sp3)&#9472;H silylation and oxidation provides rapid access to highly oxidized, 1,2&#8208;diol derivatives of natural products by a formal dihydroxylation of an alkyl group.

&lt;p&gt;The late-stage oxidation of C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;)&#9472;H bonds is valuable for modulating properties and diversification. We report that perfluorinated ruthenium porphyrins catalyze the undirected C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;)&#9472;H oxidation of various natural products and drugs with high turnover numbers. In combination with directed C&#9472;H silylation, alkyl groups remote from existing functionality can be formally dihydroxylated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The late-stage oxidation of C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;)&#9472;H bonds is highly valuable for modulating the solubility and binding of bioactive compounds and for diversification of complex molecules. Undirected methods for C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;)&#9472;H oxidation are valuable for the installation of hydroxyl groups at sites remote from other functional groups present in the molecule, but existing catalysts are limited by low turnover numbers and lengthy ligand syntheses. Perfluorinated ruthenium porphyrins are highly active catalysts for the oxidation of alkyl C&#9472;H bonds, but the scope of the transformation with complex molecules under conditions of limiting substrate has not been investigated. We report that carbonylruthenium(II) tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin [Ru(TPFPP)(CO)] catalyzes the selective oxidation of tertiary C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;)&#9472;H bonds in a broad range of complex natural products and drugs, with turnover numbers as high as 1000, and the tolerance of the reaction to various functional groups was rapidly assessed by performing a model reaction in the presence of additives. We show how the combination of this undirected C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;)&#9472;H oxidation and a directed C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;)&#9472;H silylation and oxidation provides rapid access to highly oxidized, 1,2-diol derivatives of natural products by a formal dihydroxylation of an alkyl group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking the Deep&#8208;UV Transparency/Optical Nonlinearity Trade&#8208;Off: Three&#8208;Parameter Optimization in Oxyfluorides by Tailoring d0&#8208;Metal Incorporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic dual&#8208;site strategy for the construction of the first examples of deep&#8208;ultraviolet transparent mixed d0&#8208;metal oxyfluorides A5(NbOF4)(TaF7)2 (A&#160;=&#160;K, Rb, Cs, NH4), which exhibit second&#8208;harmonic generation responses at both visible and ultraviolet regions as well as sufficient birefringence, was reported.








Abstract
Achieving an optimal balance among key optical performance parameters (i.e., bandgap, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and birefringence) is critically important for addressing application constraints and advancing the development of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. We report herein the first examples of deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) transparent mixed d0&#8208;metal oxyfluorides A5(NbOF4)(TaF7)2 (ANTOF: A&#160;=&#160;K, Rb, Cs, NH4), synthesized through a synergistic dual&#8208;site strategy. Our synthetic strategy enables the targeted incorporation of highly distorted d0&#8208;metal octahedra into metal fluorides, creating two distinct d0&#8208;metal polyhedra with complementary microstructural features that can reconcile trade&#8208;offs in key optical properties. By introducing 4d0&#8208;Nb&#8208;based [NbO2F4] oxyfluoride octahedra into the centrosymmetric parent 5d0&#8208;Ta&#8208;based fluorides A2TaF7, the resultant ANTOFs not only crystallize with noncentrosymmetric polar structures but, more importantly, demonstrate exceptional performance, including record&#8208;high phase&#8208;matchable SHG responses for deep&#8208;UV transparent d0&#8208;metal oxyfluorides (3.3&#8722;3.8&#160;&#215;&#160;KH2PO4 @ 1064&#160;nm (visible region) and 0.33&#8722;0.38&#160;&#215;&#160;&#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 @ 532&#160;nm (UV region)), wide bandgaps (&gt; 6.36&#160;eV), and suitable birefringence (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.093&#8722;0.105 @ 546&#160;nm). Theoretical calculations and crystal structure analyses reveal that the superior linear and nonlinear optical properties of the ANTOFs originate from the dual&#8208;site synergy between the polarizable [NbO2F4] octahedra and the [TaF7] pentagonal bipyramids, in which ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer transitions are suppressed.

         <title>Chiral Hybrid Cu(I) Halide Scintillation Films with Polarization&#8208;Engineered Light Management for High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral crystal structure of R/S&#8208;2&#8208;MePiCuI, as well as the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra of these two hybrid halides, is presented. The R&#8208;2&#8208;MePiCuI thin film was further fabricated, which demonstrated excellent X&#8209;ray imaging performance with a high resolution of 20&#160;lp mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Scintillators are typically based on achiral structures, where the emitted light propagates isotropically, resulting in significant optical crosstalk and reduced image fidelity in X&#8208;ray imaging. In this study, we design the synthesis of a pair of chiral hybrid Cu(I) halide scintillators, R&#8208;2&#8208;MePiCuI and S&#8208;2&#8208;MePiCuI (R/S&#8208;2&#8208;MePi&#160;=&#160;R/S&#8208;2&#8208;methylpiperazine), exhibiting near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 99.08%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.21% and 98.38%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.19%, respectively, along with distinct circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and dissymmetry factors (glum) of&#160;+&#160;0.82&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 and &#8722;0.67&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. Furthermore, high&#8208;quality chiral Cu(I) halide thin films have been fabricated using a multi&#8208;source vacuum deposition (MSVD) technique, enabling dense and uniform scintillating layers. A polarized system is developed by combining the chiral thin film scintillator with polarization optics, enabling directional radioluminescence propagation and suppressing optical crosstalk. The resulting device achieves a high spatial resolution of 20 lp mm&#8722;1 and an ultralow detection limit of 99.22 nGy s&#8722;1. These findings establish chiral hybrid Cu(I) halides as promising candidates for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with synergetic light management.

         <title>Silylative Amide to Nitrile Conversion Mediated by Simple Lanthanide&#8211;Organoamides: Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described here is a LaNTMS mediated silylative conversion of primary amides to nitriles under neat reaction conditions. The reaction is highly efficient and selective under such solventless conditions, where all materials are commercially available, demonstrating the robustness and potential of lanthanide heteroatom catalysis.








Abstract
Efficient, selective, and environmentally benign catalytic nitrile synthesis is attractive for pharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals and materials, and large&#8208;scale industrial applications. In this regard, metal&#8208;catalyzed silylative conversion of primary amides to nitriles is emerging as a promising approach. This contribution reports the utilization of readily available lanthanide&#8208;organic amido precatalysts, Ln[N(SiMe3)2]3, Ln&#160;=&#160;lanthanide, to selectively convert primary alkyl and aryl/heterocyclic amides having diverse functional groups to nitriles, including pharma building blocks, in high yields using the silane reagents PhSiH3 and TMS&#8208;O&#8208;[Si(H)(Me)&#8208;O&#8208;]n&#8208;TMS in a solvent&#8208;free process. Kinetic and mechanistic data reveal the role of lanthanide amidates as the catalytically&#8208;active species, while DFT analysis indicates a catalytic pathway unlike that found in transition metal complex&#8208;catalyzed processes. Thus, the lanthanide amidate resting state actively participates in the catalysis, where rate&#8208;determining bound amidate silylation is activated by the metal center and influenced by the bound amidate electronic and steric characteristics. DFT analysis of the catalytic cycle reveals that the relative energies of three intermediate endergonic steps, hence the rate&#8208;determining step, depends on the silane concentration.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Borylation of &#945;&#8208;Benzoyl Alkyl Bromides by Zinc Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel zinc&#8208;catalyzed method for enantioconvergent borylation of alkyl halides has been developed. The radical reaction mechanism was elucidated through a combination of experiments and DFT calculations. This method represents the first instance of a zinc catalyst being employed for the enantioconvergent borylation of alkyl halides, exhibiting remarkable substrate compatibility. The chiral &#945;&#8208;boryl benzoates demonstrate considerable potential in synthesis, providing pathways and options for the synthesis and transformation of chiral compounds.








Abstract
The direct synthesis of chiral compounds from racemic alkyl halides is highly valued in organic synthesis. In this study, we present the first zinc&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent transformation of alkyl halides, which is enabled by substrate design and commercial diamine ligands. Chiral C&#9472;B bonds with dual transformable groups were successfully synthesized with high yield and enantioselectivity. This method also facilitates the construction of two convertible functional groups on the same carbon atom, thereby converting them into diverse chiral functional groups. Mechanistic study reveals that the Zn(II)&#8208;Bpin complex serves as the critical species for radical initiation, while the interaction between the ester group of the substrate and the catalyst is crucial in determining chirality. Notably, Zn(II) maintains its oxidation state throughout the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Dual Regulation of Reduction and Oxidation Center in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Boost CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;regulation strategy was proposed to simultaneously modulate the reduction center via heteroatom substitution and the oxidation center via TEMPO coordination in Co&#8208;porphyrin MOFs (Co&#8208;N4&#8208;MOFs) to afford a strong redox photocatalyst TEMPO@Co&#8208;SN3&#8208;PCN. Remarkably, the system with TEMPO@Co&#8208;SN3&#8208;PCN achieves a CO yield of 2000&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1, over 50 times higher than that with the conventional Co&#8208;N4&#8208;PCN.








Abstract
The efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction is governed by multiple critical factors, including visible&#8208;light absorption, charge separation, hole utilization, and CO2 adsorption/activation. However, simultaneous regulation of these factors in a single photocatalyst to facilitate CO2 photoreduction remains underexplored. Herein, we proposed a dual&#8208;regulation strategy to concurrently modulate the reduction center via heteroatom substitution and the oxidation center via 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidoxyl (TEMPO) coordination in cobalt porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Co&#8208;MOFs), resulting in series of strong redox photocatalysts (TEMPO@Co&#8208;XN3&#8208;MOF, X&#9552;N, O, and S) for efficient CO2 photoreduction. Remarkably, CO yield with the dual&#8208;regulated TEMPO@Co&#8208;SN3&#8208;PCN can reach 2000&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1, over 10 and 50 times higher than that with single&#8208;regulated Co&#8208;SN3&#8208;PCN and the typical Co&#8208;N4&#8208;PCN, respectively. Moreover, the photogenegrated hole can efficiently drive the photooxidation of lactic acid to pyruvic acid with a 85% yield, while the in situ&#8208;generated CO is directly utilized in a tandem carbonylation reaction to afford benzophenone with a 90% yield. Investigations reveal that the dual regulation of redox centers endows TEMPO@Co&#8208;SN3&#8208;PCN with efficient hole utilzation, efficient charge separation, strong CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby facilitating green&#8208;synthesis of pyruvic acid and carbonyl compounds via a negative carbon emission process.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction Induced Rigid&#8208;Flexible Coupling SEI for Ultrastable Sodium Storage of Microsized Sn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion&#8208;dipole interactions are regulated via mixing solvents with different solvation abilities, establishing an anion/solvent co&#8208;dominated solvation chemistry and therefore the hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic SEI with balanced rigidity and flexibility. This greatly enhances the practicality and durability of Sn anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Tin (Sn) anode has been considered as a promising candidate for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and suitable operating potential. However, they suffer from substantial volume variation during charge/discharge processes, which leads to fast capacity degradation. Herein, we propose a strategy combining solvents with different solvation abilities to regulate ion&#8208;dipole interactions, establishing an anion and solvent co&#8208;dominated solvation chemistry. This unique solvation chemistry triggers the cooperative decomposition of anions and solvents, generating a mechanically robust yet chemically stable organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) with balanced rigidity and flexibility. The stable SEI effectively mitigates volume variation during charge/discharge processes and suppresses successive electrolyte decomposition. Therefore, the microsized Sn anode exhibits superior cycling stability (high capacity retention of 83.31% after 1000 cycles) and rate performance (270.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4.0 A g&#8722;1). More importantly, the Sn||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell achieves a remarkable energy density of 235.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This study demonstrates the feasibility of rigid&#8208;flexible coupling SEI, providing a pathway to boost the sodium storage performance of anode materials with huge volume change.

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Intermediate Metastability for Tip&#8208;Directed Zinc Stripping and Suppressed Vanadium Dissolution Toward Long&#8208;Cycling Zinc&#8211;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a robust adhesion PAM&#8208;based gel electrolyte (PAM&#8208;IL) for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8211;vanadium batteries. Leveraging the steric hindrance and coordination effects, the PAM&#8208;IL facilitates uniform Zn2+ diffusion and even zinc stripping. Furthermore, the induced outer hydrophobic layer and inner cation&#8208;repelling layer impeded water molecule penetration and suppressed vanadium dissolution.








Abstract
The metastable adsorbed intermediates formed during the lattice detachment of Zn atoms and Vn+ ions govern the reaction kinetics and interfacial morphology evolution during dissolution. Resultant inhomogeneous Zn stripping and progressive V dissolution synergistically promote dead Zn formation and cathode material degradation, substantially impeding the commercialization of Zn&#8208;V batteries. Here, to facilitate Zn tip&#8208;stripping electrochemistry and suppressed vanadium dissolution, a robust adhesion ionic liquid ([BVIM]Br) modified PAM gel electrolyte (PAM&#8208;IL) was strategically designed. Leveraging steric hindrance of polymer segments and the directional coordination of anions and cations, the PAM&#8208;IL electrolyte delocalizes charge accumulation and suppresses overstabilization of tip&#8208;localized complexes, thereby reversing the adsorption asymmetry behavior (&#916;Gads&#8208;tip &gt; &#916;Gads&#8208;root) to achieve tip&#8208;targeted zinc stripping. Concurrently, strong ion&#8211;dipole interactions within PAM&#8208;IL elevate the activation barrier for V dissolution and combine with its butyl&#8208;functionalized hydrophobic moieties to impede water molecule penetration and suppress vanadium dissolution. Therefore, the as&#8208;prepared Zn||PAM&#8208;IL||NH4V4O10 batteries deliver a reversible capacity of 266.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles and retained a higher capacity retention (82.3%) after 250 cycles than aqueous electrolyte (28.1%) with extreme&#8208;low current density of 0.2 A g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the PAM&#8208;IL exhibits exceptional cycling stability over a wide temperature range, from 0 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C.

         <title>Photochemical Spin&#8208;State Switching of an All&#8208;Organic Molecular System with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light photochemical spin&#8208;state switching is achieved through a tailored design. The photoswitching core is substituted with the &#960;&#8208;acceptor indanedione resulting in a small optical bandgap in combination with torsional twisting of the substituent. This twisting is essential for the stability of the diradical state as it isolates the spin density in the periphery preventing immediate radical&#8211;radical recombination.








Abstract
Controlling the spin state of a molecule using the spatiotemporal properties of visible light is of interest for spintronic devices in information technology or (bio)medical applications. We, herein, report an all&#8208;organic visible light&#8208;induced photochromic system than can switch from a diamagnetic (singlet) to a paramagnetic (triplet) state. This is realized by precisely tuning orbital symmetry and internal molecular strain in a [5]helicene scaffold substituted with an indanedione &#960;&#8208;acceptor. Irradiation with visible light at cryogenic temperatures gives a kinetically meta&#8208;stable paramagnetic diradical state with a solvent&#8208;dependent ground&#8208;state multiplicity (triplet or singlet), which can be thermally switched back to its initial diamagnetic state.

         <title>Fluorescent Peptide Tracers for Simultaneous Oxytocin Receptor Activation and Visualization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Illuminating the Oxytocin Receptor: Here we present the development of fluorescent peptide tracers for the simultaneous visualization and activation of the oxytocin receptor, an important G protein&#8208;coupled receptor involved in health and disease. These tracers are powerful new tools to support various imaging and functional studies across biological systems.








Abstract
The oxytocin receptor (OTR) regulates critical physiological functions and has been implicated in a range of diseases, including psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder. However, a lack of reliable molecular tools hampers the progress in understanding OTR's mechanistic roles in (patho)physiological processes. In this work, we addressed this gap and developed potent, selective, and bright fluorescent peptide tracers that enable precise spatial and functional investigations of OTR actions. Our tracers showed efficient OTR labeling, activation, and internalization in cellular bioassays in both live and fixed overexpression and primary cell systems, including those subjected to immunocytochemical protocols, highlighting their versatility as reliable new imaging tools. Additionally, they facilitated single&#8208;molecule tracking of OTR with live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution microscopy and were able to separate OTR&#8208;positive cells from mixed oxytocin and vasopressin receptor&#8208;containing cell populations via fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting, underscoring their wider scope for live&#8208;cell applications. In summary, we developed versatile fluorescent tracers based on the endogenous ligand oxytocin for both live&#8208;cell and post&#8208;hoc imaging that have additional functional capabilities beyond traditional antibody labeling, offering new avenues to explore OTR's role in health and disease.

         <title>Heteromultivalency Enhances Resolution in Cellular Mechanical Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteromultivalent ligand engineering allows continuous avidity tuning through stoichiometrically controlled co&#8208;assembly of two ligands targeting distinct epitopes on the same receptor with different affinities. This strategy overcomes the discrete valency limitations of homovalent systems, revealing subtle mechanophenotypic differences and enabling force&#8208;sensitive cell sorting.








Abstract
Cells sense their microenvironment and neighboring cells by exerting finely tuned mechanical forces through receptor&#8211;ligand interactions, which shape mechanophenotypes critical to biological development, immunity, and disease. Profiling these mechanophenotypes requires ligands with variable avidities. However, conventional strategies based on discrete valency changes lack the precision for continuous modulation, limiting the resolution of subtle mechanotypic differences. Here, we introduce a bivariate strategy to construct heteromultivalent ligands that independently modulate both unit affinity and valency within a single DNA nanoscaffold. By co&#8208;assembling two aptamers with distinct binding affinities, each targeting different epitopes of the same receptor, we generate ligand architectures with tunable avidities through precise stoichiometric modulation. This strategy produces a continuous avidity spectrum, overcoming the limitations of traditional homovalent systems, which are constrained by the discrete nature of valency adjustments. These heteromultivalent ligands enhance the sensitivity of force measurements, revealing subtle mechanical differences in cells with varying epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expressions, and enabling efficient, sequential sorting of phenotypically similar subpopulations via simple flow rate adjustments. These findings underscore the critical importance of avidity modulation in multivalent interaction engineering and mechanical cell profiling, showcasing the advantages of molecularly assembled heteromultivalent interactions over conventional homovalent strategies.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Specific Installation of Aryl Groups in RNA via DNA&#8208;Catalyst Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA oligonucleotides carrying amine nucleophilic catalysts are employed to deliver aryl groups to complementary sites in RNA under physiological conditions. The strategy can be used to sequence&#8208;specifically label protein&#8208;coding RNAs, or to knock down expression selectively, with potential applications in basic transcriptome research and in future therapies.








Abstract
Installing functional groups at specific sites in existing RNA molecules remains a challenge for modification, labeling, and therapeutic strategies. Here, we describe the use of DNA oligonucleotides carrying a catalytic amine group to effect the aqueous SNAr arylation of 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups at sequence&#8208;complementary sites in RNAs. Chloro&#8208;pyrimidine electrophiles are shown to react with amino&#8208;DNA conjugates, resulting in a proposed transient ammonium aryl intermediate that can react with RNA near the DNA binding site, delivering the heterocycle to the RNA in high yields. In a test of utility, we construct an aryl electrophile carrying an azide group, and apply this strategy to fluorescently label messenger RNAs locally at the polyA tail. We also employ the approach to direct in vitro arylation in the coding region of a messenger RNA, knocking down protein expression selectively in the presence of another coding RNA. This sequence&#8208;directed catalytic strategy enables multiple applications in RNA labeling and modification.

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Formation Voltage on Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the trade&#8208;off between &#8220;high capacity/low cycling&#8221; of LRLO under high&#8208;voltage formation (HVF). The HVF protocol promotes the charge transfer of anions/cations which is attributed to the increased O5 (OLiyTM1) configuration due to the in&#8208;plane transition metal (TM) migration, thereby resulting in high capacity. While the aggravating TM migration further leads to severe Li/Ni disordering, while the surface/interface shows a negligible influence.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LRLO) cathodes are recognized for their high energy densities, primarily driven by oxygen&#8208;related anionic redox activities, yet substantial activation of this process simultaneously induces structural instability. The typical voltage range in academic studies spans 2.0&#8211;4.8&#160;V. Although 2.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V are generally considered in industrial applications for enhanced capacity retention and electrolyte compatibility, this moderate voltage window leads to reduced capacity. To address energy density limitations, several top battery suppliers propose to separately increase the formation voltage during the initial cycle to enhance capacity, while other companies (e.g., Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd., CATL) claim that this high&#8208;voltage formation protocol would exacerbate cycling capacity fading. Herein, we systemically demonstrate that high&#8208;voltage formation promotes substantial Li+ extraction from the transition metal (TM) layers, creating vacancies (in TM layer) that drive in&#8208;plane TM migration. This migration triggers a transformation in the OM6 (M, cation) configuration from O4 (OLixTM2) to O5 (OLiyTM1). Such evolution simultaneously enhances both anionic and cationic redox activity, collectively boosting capacity. Nonetheless, the induced in&#8208;plane TM migration would further aggravate out&#8208;of&#8208;plane TM migration, leading to progressive structural degradation, which has been elucidated as the main reason for cycling capacity fading.

Such evolution simultaneously enhances both anionic and cationic redox activity, collectively boosting capacity. Nonetheless, the induced in-plane TM migration would further aggravate out-of-plane TM migration, leading to progressive structural degradation, which has been elucidated as the main reason for cycling capacity fading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Metathesis: Mapping the Reactivity and Deactivation Pathways of an Iron Metallacyclobutane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene metathesis has long remained elusive. This study identifies &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination from an iron metallacyclobutane as a key deactivation pathway in iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene metathesis, through combined computational and experimental efforts. By elucidating spin&#8208;state, ligand, and steric effects novel reactivity descriptors are identified, that aid in designing next&#8208;generation iron&#8208;based metathesis catalysts.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene metathesis holds great promise as a sustainable alternative to its precious metal congeners, yet its development has been hindered by poor mechanistic understanding and rapid catalyst deactivation. Here, we report the combined computational and experimental identification of &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination as a key decomposition pathway from an iron metallacyclobutane, an essential intermediate in metathesis catalysis. Using our previously reported PCNHCP&#8208;ligated iron(0) complex [(PCNHCP)Fe(N2)2], we observe under metathesis conditions the formation of an iron(II) allyl hydride product, consistent with our computational predictions of a low&#8208;energy &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination pathway. Detailed spin&#8208;state&#8208;resolved DFT analysis reveals that while metallacyclobutane formation is feasible across multiple spin surfaces, subsequent reactivity is strongly governed by the singlet state. Coordination of N2 is shown to inhibit metathesis and promote decomposition by raising the transition&#8208;state barrier for cycloreversion while facilitating &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. Subsequent calculations show that upon suppressing this decomposition channel productive metathesis is restored. These findings offer mechanistically grounded design principles for next&#8208;generation iron&#8208;based metathesis catalysts and highlight the importance of spin&#8208;state control, ligand environment, and substrate selection in overcoming catalyst deactivation and provide a foray into productive iron catalyzed alkene metathesis.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Carboxylation of Primary Benzylamines with CO2 to Access &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
We report the first visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bond carboxylation of primary benzylamines with CO2, alongside a complementary protocol for the carboxylation of &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bond in amide derivatives, collectively furnishing a broad spectrum of &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Mechanistic studies reveal that the transformation proceeds via an intermolecular HAT pathway for primary benzylamines, whereas amides involve a 1,2&#8208;HAT mechanism.








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amino acid motifs, serving as essential building blocks, are ubiquitous in natural products, bioactive molecules and drugs. Despite significant advances in the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;AAs) using CO2 as carboxyl source, the direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H carboxylation of primary amines, which are important organic chemical feedstocks, remains an attractive yet formidable challenge. Herein, we report the first visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H carboxylation of primary benzylamines with CO2, wherein CO2 acts dually as a transient protecting group and as the carboxyl source. This strategy enables efficient synthesis of diverse &#945;&#8208;AAs under mild reaction conditions with a broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility. Mechanistic studies indicate that an intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) between the external HAT reagent and the carbamate intermediate, in situ&#8208;generated from primary amine and CO2, is followed by reduction and carboxylation to furnish &#945;&#8208;AAs. Moreover, a complementary protocol for carboxylation of &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in amides through an intramolecular 1,2&#8208;HAT pathway is also developed, obviating the need for an external HAT reagent and further expanding the synthetic utility of this methodology. These advances represent a versatile and practical platform for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;AAs from amine precursors using CO2.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Electrocatalysis Cascade Synthesis of Deuterated Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
At present, industrial production methods, such as the Haber&#8211;Bosch (H&#8211;B) process using N2 and D2, require harsh reaction conditions and complexity equipment, leading to a high production cost of ND3. This work demonstrates a two&#8208;step relay route to produce ND3 by using air and deuterium oxide (D2O) as raw materials, including plasma&#8208;driven air&#8208;to&#8208;NOx conversion and electrocatalytic NOx&#8211;&#8208;to&#8208;ND3 conversion, which can be directly driven by volatile green energy. 








Abstract
Deuterated ammonia (ND3) exhibits growing market demand in the fields of chemical analysis, pharmaceutical industry and semiconductor manufacturing. Currently, industrial production of ND3 relies on harsh conditions and complex processes, leading to high production cost and security risk. Herein, we propose a sustainable relay strategy to produce ND3 by using air and deuterium oxide (D2O) as raw materials, including plasma&#8208;driven air&#8208;to&#8208;NOx conversion and electrocatalytic NOx&#8211;&#8208;to&#8208;ND3 conversion. The insufficient supply of reactive deuterium (*D) leads to sluggish kinetics of electrocatalytic deuterium reaction. The well&#8208;designed F modified cobalt (F&#8211;Co) catalyst exhibits a remarkable yield of 0.75&#160;mmol h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 80.43% for ND3 at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The combined results of characterizations reveal that fluorine (F) atom can boost D2O dissociation and suppress competing deuterium evolution reaction, thereby providing abundant *D for deuteration reaction. Notably, a pilot&#8208;scale demonstration system, consisting of non&#8208;thermal plasma, flow electrolyzer, air stripping and ammonia absorber, is constructed to produce practicable ND3 solution (2.8 wt%) with &#8764;21.45&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 ND3 production capability by using air and D2O as sources.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Carbonyl Redox: A Ketene in Three Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of elusive ketene radical cation and radical anion, achieved using a ketene derived from a singlet carbene, is reported. These species exhibit distinct structural, spectroscopic, and reactivity properties compared to the neutral ketene. The findings demonstrate that singlet carbenes not only mimic transition metals in small molecule activation, but also in subsequent redox chemistry.








Abstract
Ketenes are among the most versatile compounds in organic chemistry, participating in a wide range of transformations, including cycloadditions, nucleophilic and electrophilic additions, and polymerizations. However, their redox chemistry, particularly the preparation of stable radical anions and radical cations, remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;derived ketene in three oxidation states, including its radical anion and cation, representing the first example of such species. These ketene radicals exhibit unique electronic properties: the radical anion adopts a bent geometry that places the radical out of conjugation with the CAAC substituent, while the radical cation results from oxidation of an electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl group.

&lt;p&gt;The isolation of elusive ketene radical cation and radical anion, achieved using a ketene derived from a singlet carbene, is reported. These species exhibit distinct structural, spectroscopic, and reactivity properties compared to the neutral ketene. The findings demonstrate that singlet carbenes not only mimic transition metals in small molecule activation, but also in subsequent redox chemistry.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ketenes are among the most versatile compounds in organic chemistry, participating in a wide range of transformations, including cycloadditions, nucleophilic and electrophilic additions, and polymerizations. However, their redox chemistry, particularly the preparation of stable radical anions and radical cations, remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)-derived ketene in three oxidation states, including its radical anion and cation, representing the first example of such species. These ketene radicals exhibit unique electronic properties: the radical anion adopts a bent geometry that places the radical out of conjugation with the CAAC substituent, while the radical cation results from oxidation of an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. Both radicals were characterized in detail using infrared (IR) and UV&#8211;vis electronic absorption spectroscopy, EPR spectroscopy, structural analysis, and computations, revealing parallels with the redox chemistry of transition metal carbonyl complexes. Reactivity studies indicate that the radical anion and radical cation react via nucleophilic and radical pathways, respectively, contrasting with the behavior of neutral ketenes. This work demonstrates a novel redox-based strategy for investigating uncharted transformations of ketenes, expanding their synthetic utility and opening new avenues for redox-organocatalysis of carbenes with small molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wide&#8208;Temperature Operation of High&#8208;Capacity Aqueous Chlorine Batteries Enabled by Complexation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>

A quaternary ammonium&#8208;stabilized Cl&#8722;/Cl2 redox system in acidic chloride electrolyte suppresses chlorine volatilization, diffusion, and disproportionation over a wide temperature range. When coupled with MoO3 anode for reversible proton storage, the full cell achieves high areal capacity, excellent coulombic efficiency, temperature resilience, and extended charge&#8211;discharge durations.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries based on the chloride/chlorine (Cl&#8722;/Cl2) redox couple offer high theoretical energy density but have been limited by the volatility/disproportionation of chlorine gas and its inherently poor electrochemical reversibility. Previous approaches have relied on operational constraints to achieve desirable efficiency&#8212;such as low temperatures (&lt;&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) and/or high charge/discharge rates (&gt;5C)&#8212;to mitigate chlorine evolution, but these strategies restrict areal capacity to &lt;1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and compromise practical viability. Here, we report a molecularly engineered Cl&#8722;/Cl2 redox system stabilized by quaternary ammonium complexation in an acidic chloride electrolyte, enabling both high areal capacity (7&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) and long charge/discharge durations (&#8764;7&#160;h) with &gt;98% coulombic efficiency. The optimized tetraamylammonium chloride (TAACl) forms phase&#8208;separated ionic liquid complexes (TAACl3 and TAACl5) with electrochemically generated Cl2, effectively suppressing chlorine volatilization, diffusion, and disproportionation. Paired with a MoO3 anode that reversibly stores protons via intercalation, the MoO3&#8208;TAACl full battery demonstrates robust performance across a wide temperature range (&#8722;45&#160;to 40&#160;&#176;C). At 25&#160;&#176;C, the battery retains &gt;99% coulombic efficiency over 3000 cycles and maintains excellent cycling stability (&gt;1000 cycles) even at 40&#160;&#176;C. Electrolyte optimization with high&#8208;concentration tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl) and H3PO4 further improves cycle life by enhancing redox kinetics and suppressing side reactions.

         <title>Thiazole&#8208;2&#8208;Carbaldehyde&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel aldehyde&#8208;substituted benzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d']bis(thiazole) monomer (BBTC) was synthesized (81% yield) and first used to construct an imine&#8208;linked COF. The imine linkages were transformed into imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;thione (BBTC&#8208;IT COF) via a carbene precursor (BBTC&#8208;INP COF), boosting photoluminescence quantum yields by 2620&#8208; and 1810&#8208;fold, respectively. BBTC&#8208;IT COF also effectively detected Hg2&#8314; (LOD: 60&#160;nM) via thione (C&#9552;S) binding sites.








Abstract
We first synthesize a novel aldehyde&#8208;substituted benzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d']bis(thiazole) monomer (BBTC) via a facile method with a high yield, and the BBTC is used for the first time as a building block for synthesis of imine&#8208;linked COFs. By using linkage transformation strategy, we further synthesize an imidazole N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene precursor COF (BBTC&#8208;INP COF) and the imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;thione COF (BBTC&#8208;IT COF). Interestingly, the BBTC&#8208;INP and BBTC&#8208;IT COFs exhibit 2620&#8208; and 1810&#8208;fold enhancements in photoluminescence quantum yields, respectively, compared to the parent BBTC COF. This linkage transformation not only optimizes the optical performance but also enables effective Hg2&#8314; detection through the strategic incorporation of thione (C&#9552;S) groups as specific binding sites. In particular, the BBTC&#8208;IT COF presents outstanding selectivity and sensitivity for toxic Hg2&#8314; detection, and the limit of detection reaches 60&#160;nM, highlighting the advantage of as&#8208;synthesized BBTC&#8208;IT COFs in fluorescence sensing applications. In short, this work reports a series of novel thiazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde&#8208;based COFs, which largely enriches the diversity of COFs and would also stimulate the synthesis of more BBTC&#8208;based COFs for different applications.

         <title>A Reusable Substrate for Capture and Red Light&#8208;Responsive Release of Circulating Rare Cells with High Cytoactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reusable substrate that leverages Ru complexes and photo&#8208;responsive ligand substitution is developed to capture cells with replaceable antibodies. Under red&#8208;light irradiation, the substrate achieves considerable capture and release efficiencies for different circulating rare cells with cytoactivity, offering a new platform for the development of responsive biomedical interfaces with high biosafety.








Abstract
Efficient and reusable biomedical interfaces are necessary for the isolation and nondestructive release of circulating rare cells in blood. However, photo&#8208;responsive release strategy, particularly that using red light, relies on photothermal effect, which could potentially affect cell activity through local overheating. To overcome this issue, we develop reusable functional substrates (RuSub&#8208;S&#8208;SA&#8208;Ab) based on ruthenium (Ru) complexes with photo&#8208;responsive ligand substitution to capture cells by using replaceable antibodies with high sensitivity and specificity. Our RuSub&#8208;S&#8208;SA&#8208;Ab achieved capture efficiencies&#160;&gt;85% for four different cell lines and release efficiencies of 90% under safe doses of red light (660&#160;nm, 100 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2,&#160;60&#160;s), thus offering a new platform for the development of responsive biomedical interfaces with high biosafety.

This work describes an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed, atroposelective hydroamination of internal alkynes for the diverse synthesis of axially chiral styrenes.

Abstract
Despite the significant potential of axially chiral enamines, their efficient synthesis remains a challenge. Herein, we report a new approach for the diverse synthesis of enamine&#8208;based axially chiral styrenes via a copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective hydroamination of internal alkynes. This method features good functional group tolerance, exclusive regio&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivity, and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee). Experimental and DFT studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism and rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the reaction is readily scalable to gram quantities, and the resulting products can be transformed into chiral N,P&#8208;ligands, thereby enriching the family of axially chiral ligands with new members.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant potential of axially chiral enamines, their efficient synthesis remains a challenge. Herein, we report a new approach for the diverse synthesis of enamine-based axially chiral styrenes via a copper-catalyzed atroposelective hydroamination of internal alkynes. This method features good functional group tolerance, exclusive regio- and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity, and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee). Experimental and DFT studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism and rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the reaction is readily scalable to gram quantities, and the resulting products can be transformed into chiral N,P-ligands, thereby enriching the family of axially chiral ligands with new members.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integration of Multiple Enzymes Within Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Cascade Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Conversion in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>

We report the construction of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks that integrate Ru&#8208;based photocatalysts with three enzymes of formate/formaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase via co&#8208;assembly for sustained CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion through photo&#8208;enzymatic cascade catalysis with high activity and recyclability.








Abstract
The integration of photocatalysts and enzymes within confined environments offers a promising approach to developing artificial photosynthetic systems for sustainable CO2 conversion. However, the efficient coupling of photocatalysts with multiple enzymes to enable photo&#8208;enzymatic cascade catalysis remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the construction of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) that integrate Ru&#8208;based photocatalysts with three&#8208;enzyme cascades of formate dehydrogenase (FDH), formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FaldDH), and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) via in situ co&#8208;assembly in water. The RuHOF exhibits exceptional nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) photo&#8208;regeneration activity (4.5&#160;mM&#160;h&#8722;1), while the FDH@RuHOF hybrid converts CO2 to formic acid with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 681 h&#8722;1 (238 &#181;M&#160;h&#8722;1) over 24 h. By engineering FDH/FaldDH/ADH@RuHOF ternary systems, we achieve sustained CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion through photo&#8208;enzymatic cascade catalysis, delivering 2.2&#160;mM methanol production with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of 5.5% (92 &#181;M&#160;h&#8722;1) over 24&#160;h with 85% activity retention after five catalytic cycles. This work opens a promising avenue for the development of efficient multi&#8208;enzyme cascade artificial photosynthetic systems toward steady and recyclable CO2 valorization.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Chemically Recyclable Polyamides via Substituent Effects&#8208;Enabled Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The joint presence of ketone and diester functionalities in dimethyl acetone&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylate enhances its reactivity toward amines compared to the individual reactivity of each group, due to substituent effects. This increased reactivity enables the efficient synthesis of polyamides under mild conditions, and the resulting polymers are chemically recyclable.








Abstract
Imination and amidation are two fundamental condensation reactions central to modern chemical synthesis, and devising energy&#8208;efficient ways to trigger them is highly relevant in advancing low&#8208;carbon manufacturing, with most approaches relying on the use of catalysts. Here, we revisit the dimethyl acetone&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylate (DADC) chemistry, and show that it can react with a broad range of small&#8208;molecule and macromolecular amines at moderate temperatures (80&#8210;120&#160;&#176;C) in the absence of any catalysts. This represents a significant reduction in processing temperatures compared to traditional polycondensation methods for polyamide synthesis, which often require temperatures exceeding 230&#160;&#176;C. Mechanistic and model studies reveal that the high reactivity of DADC toward amines arises from its synergistic substituent effects; Specifically, the two ester groups in the symmetric &#946;&#8208;position of DADC&#8217;s ketone facilitate initial imination via conjugation and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects, generating a &#946;&#8208;enamino intermediate. This &#946;&#8208;enamine subsequently engages in intramolecular hydrogen bonding with one ester group, reducing steric hindrance on the remaining ester and thus promoting its amidation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the DADC&#8208;synthesized polyamides are thermally reprocessable, and chemically recyclable under either acidic or basic conditions at mild temperatures, and the chemical recycling is possible both for the neat polymer and its mixture with other plastics.

         <title>Selective Atomic Incorporation: Synergistically Tailoring Adsorbate Evolution and Lattice Oxygen Pathways for Enhanced Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hindered by sluggish kinetics and intricate catalytic mechanisms, remains a key bottleneck in water splitting. In this work, selectively doping single&#8208;atomic Ir into NiMoO4 enables a synergistic adsorbate evolution mechanism and lattice oxygen mechanism (AEM&#8208;LOM), achieving superior performance: low overpotential (253 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2), remarkable stability (&gt;1000 h), and practical applicability in water electrolyzers.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a key bottleneck in water splitting, hindered by sluggish kinetics and complex catalytic mechanisms. Here, we synergistically tailor adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) for enhanced water oxidation by selectively doping atomic Ir into binary metal oxide NiMoO4. Microscopic characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that atomic Ir preferentially occupies the octahedral Mo sites in NiMoO4.&#160;The selective Ir incorporation upshifts O 2p orbital energy, activating lattice oxygen bridging Ni and Ir (Ni&#9472;O&#9472;Ir). This enables synergistic AEM and LOM activation, validated by in situ spectroscopy/mass spectrometry and chemical probes. Benefiting from the synergistic mechanism, the optimized Ir&#8208;NMO (NM98I2O) catalyst exhibits superior OER performance: low overpotential (253&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), exceptional stability (&gt;1000&#160;h continuous operation), and good practicality in water electrolyzers.

         <title>Nanocellular Organelle Engineering for Optimizing Reaction Microenvironments in Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the high catalytic efficiency of natural enzymes in confined spaces, we develop a nanocellular organelle engineering strategy by encapsulating metal&#8211;organic frameworks into the hollow interior of mesoporous carbon spheres, where electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction as a probe reveals that the spatial confinement effect optimizes the reaction microenvironment via NO2&#8722; enrichment and local pH elevation, enabling highly selective nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, thereby offering a distinct route for directional conversion of small molecules.








Abstract
Certain natural catalysts, biological enzymes, tend to be confined within cellular organelles to achieve high catalytic efficiency in small molecule conversion due to the optimized reaction environment within their internal space. Inspired by this, we implement nanocellular organelle engineering using a &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; strategy to encapsulate ZIF&#8208;67 with metal&#8211;ligand coordination motifs into hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (ZIF&#8208;67@HMCS) for catalytic process intensification. As a proof of concept, we employed the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) as a probe and found that the spatial confinement effect within the hollow mesoporous architecture enriches the intermediate NO2&#8722; and elevates the local pH, thereby constructing a favorable reaction microenvironment that promotes deep reduction while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, ultimately enabling efficient conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3. In a neutral electrolyte medium, the ZIF&#8208;67@HMCS model electrocatalyst attains the highest Faraday efficiency for NH3 (FENH3) at 97.6%, maintains FENH3 above 80% over a wide potential window (&#8764;0.5&#160;V), and delivers over 90% FENH3 even at low substrate concentrations (200&#8211;5000&#160;ppm). This nanocellular organelle engineering activates the electrocatalytic properties of metal&#8211;organic frameworks through a novel spatial confinement effect, while also offering profound insights into nature&#8208;inspired reaction microenvironment optimization for targeted small molecule conversions.

In a neutral electrolyte medium, the ZIF-67@HMCS model electrocatalyst attains the highest Faraday efficiency for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FE&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt;) at 97.6%, maintains FE&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt; above 80% over a wide potential window (&#8764;0.5&#160;V), and delivers over 90% FE&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt; even at low substrate concentrations (200&#8211;5000&#160;ppm). This nanocellular organelle engineering activates the electrocatalytic properties of metal&#8211;organic frameworks through a novel spatial confinement effect, while also offering profound insights into nature-inspired reaction microenvironment optimization for targeted small molecule conversions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking DAST&#8208;Type Reagents for Modular Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have unlocked commercial DAST&#8208;type reagents as versatile sulfur precursors for the modular synthesis of multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted S(IV)/S(VI) centers, expanding their utility beyond classical fluorination. This practical strategy, operating under ambient and mild conditions, enables late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules and gram&#8208;scale synthesis. A highly reactive S(IV)&#8211;F species is identified as the key intermediate. 








Abstract
Multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted sulfur centers are increasingly significant in drug discovery, yet their modular synthesis remains challenging. Current strategies employing sulfinylamines, sulfurdiimides, or SOF4 suffer from inherent limitations. To address this, a general and practical strategy for constructing diverse sulfur centers bearing multiple oxygen or nitrogen substituents is urgently needed. Herein, we report a modular synthesis of such motifs using commercially available DAST&#8208;type reagents as underexplored sulfur precursors. This methodology expands the utility of classical fluorination agents as sulfur sources, operates under ambient and mild conditions, and enables rapid access to diverse S(IV) and S(VI) architectures through sequential substitution and further flexible transformations. The practicality of this approach is highlighted by late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules and gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Mechanistic studies support the proposed highly reactive S(IV)&#8208;F intermediate.

         <title>On the Viability of Carbonyl Hydroboration Catalysed by Aluminium Hydrides</title>

The hydroboration of carbonyl compounds by pinacolborane catalysed by {HC(MeCDippN)2}Al(OSO2CF3)H represented a landmark in main group catalysis, advancing a now widely&#8208;accepted mechanistic paradigm. In contradiction of the original study, we show that: i) turnover via Al&#9472;O/B&#9472;H metathesis does not occur; ii) when using purified HBpin, the &#8216;catalysed&#8217; reaction with acetophenone shows no conversion; and iii) the catalytically active species is a BH3 adduct. 








Abstract
The hydroboration of aldehydes and ketones by pinacolborane (HBpin) catalysed by (Nacnac)DippAl(OTf)H ((Nacnac)Dipp&#160;=&#160;HC(MeCDippN)2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6; Tf&#160;=&#160;SO2CF3) was first reported in 2015. This study represented a landmark in main group catalysis, and advanced a widely&#8208;accepted and oft&#8208;cited mechanistic paradigm. However, in contradiction of that study, we show here that: i) the mechanism proposed, involving turnover via Al&#9472;O/B&#9472;H metathesis at the intermediate (Nacnac)DippAl(OTf)(OCH2Ph), does not occur; ii) when using pre&#8208;purified HBpin, the hydroboration reaction with acetophenone &#8216;catalysed&#8217; by (Nacnac)DippAl(OTf)H (reportedly giving 51% conversion over 6&#160;h at 2&#160;mol% loading), actually shows no conversion; and iii) the active species in catalysis is a BH3 adduct derived either from the use of impure HBpin, or from the degradation of HBpin by the action of aluminium species present in the reaction mixture. More broadly, our study i) calls into question the nature of the true catalyst species in reports of carbonyl hydroboration by aluminium complexes (since Al&#9472;O/B&#9472;H metathesis proceeds spontaneously in the reverse direction to that necessitated catalytically); and ii) presents further evidence that the hydroboration of benzaldehyde by HBpin is not a good catalytic probe, given the significant rate of the uncatalysed background reaction.

         <title>Tetra&#8208;N&#8208;Fused Indolocarbazole Multiple Resonance Emitters Enabling Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Pure Green Emission with High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>

New linear and bent tetra&#8208;N&#8208;fused indolocarbazole isomers (l&#8208;N4ICz and s&#8208;N4ICz) exhibited distinct photophysical properties and device performance, with l&#8208;N4ICz&#8208;based devices achieving pure green emission characterized by a full width at half maximum of 19&#160;nm, a CIEy coordinate of 0.7, a high external quantum efficiency of 30.1%, and minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Developing efficient narrowband emitters beyond the blue region remains challenging for indolocarbazole&#8208;based multiple resonance (ICz&#8208;MR) systems, primarily due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between spectral red&#8208;shifting and linewidth broadening. To address this, we pioneer tetra&#8208;N&#8208;fused ICz isomers (l&#8208;N4ICz and s&#8208;N4ICz) with four consecutive para&#8208;positioned nitrogen atoms, forming extended &#960;&#8208;systems via alternating six&#8208;/five&#8208;membered ring fusion. The linear isomer l&#8208;N4ICz achieves sharp green photoluminescence peaking at 506&#160;nm with a full width at half maxima (FWHM) of merely 14&#160;nm&#8212;surpassing the bent analogue&#8212;alongside suppressed spectral shoulders and higher photoluminescence efficiency. Theoretical studies reveal the critical role of orbital symmetry engineering of adjacent segments in governing the optoelectronic properties of isomers. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with l&#8208;N4ICz deliver pure&#8208;green electroluminescence with an ultra&#8208;narrow FWHM of 19&#160;nm and the first chromaticity y&#8208;coordinate reaching 0.7 among ICz&#8208;MR systems, alongside a peak external quantum efficiency of 30.1%, which remains at &gt;20% even under extremely high luminance over 200&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. The same device also sets a benchmark long operational lifetime of 2327 h to decay to 90% of the initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. These findings highlight the great potential of multi&#8208;N&#8208;fused ICz&#8208;MR structures for highly efficient, stable, and narrow electroluminescence.

         <title>A Spin Descriptor Map Predicts NiFe2O4 for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Cyclohexanone Oxime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;locking mechanism is proposed, in which medium&#8208;spin magnetic sites stabilize the *NHO intermediate and weaken *NH2OH adsorption, thereby enhancing the selectivity of cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis. Key descriptors&#8212;spin magnetic moment (&#181;s), N&#8211;O&#8211;catalyst angle (&#952;), and charge state (q)&#8212;are identified, with (&#181;s&#183;&#952;)3 and (cos &#952;/q) serving as predictive metrics. Then, NiFe2O4 is predicted and confirmed to achieve optimal Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of NO to NH2OH governs the performance of cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis. However, the spin state transition during the NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH process, which is directly related to reaction pathways, has long been ignored. Here, we propose a spin locking mechanism via density functional theory and sure independence screening and sparsifying operator. Magnetic sites with medium spin states stabilize the *NHO intermediate by locking the spin configuration of NO to weaken *NH2OH adsorption for high selectivity. The spin magnetic moment (&#181;S), the angle between *N&#8211;O and the catalyst (&#952;), and the charge state (q) are key factors, providing a screening range of the predictive metrics (&#181;S&#183;&#952;)3 and (cos &#952;/q). The theoretically selected NiFe2O4 delivers 70% Faradaic efficiency for cyclohexanone oxime, and weakened *NH2OH adsorption is revealed by in situ spectroscopy. This work highlights the importance of spin regulation in adjusting the selectivity of electrosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;A spin-locking mechanism is proposed, in which medium-spin magnetic sites stabilize the *NHO intermediate and weaken *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH adsorption, thereby enhancing the selectivity of cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis. Key descriptors&#8212;spin magnetic moment (&lt;i&gt;&#181;s&lt;/i&gt;), N&#8211;O&#8211;catalyst angle (&lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;), and charge state (&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;)&#8212;are identified, with (&lt;i&gt;&#181;s&lt;/i&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and (cos &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;) serving as predictive metrics. Then, NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is predicted and confirmed to achieve optimal Faradaic efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selective hydrogenation of NO to NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH governs the performance of cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis. However, the spin state transition during the NO-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH process, which is directly related to reaction pathways, has long been ignored. Here, we propose a spin locking mechanism via density functional theory and sure independence screening and sparsifying operator. Magnetic sites with medium spin states stabilize the *NHO intermediate by locking the spin configuration of NO to weaken *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH adsorption for high selectivity. The spin magnetic moment (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), the angle between *N&#8211;O and the catalyst (&lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;), and the charge state (&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;) are key factors, providing a screening range of the predictive metrics (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and (cos &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;). The theoretically selected NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; delivers 70% Faradaic efficiency for cyclohexanone oxime, and weakened *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH adsorption is revealed by in situ spectroscopy. This work highlights the importance of spin regulation in adjusting the selectivity of electrosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The First Ferrocene&#8208;Based Molecular Ferroelectric Accompanied by Spatial Symmetry Operation Breaking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first single&#8208;component, neutral chiral ferrocene&#8208;based molecular ferroelectric, Fe(Cp)2&#8208;CHOL, which exhibits a rare reversible phase transition between two polar space groups (C2 and P21) while retaining the same chiral polar point group. Its ferroelectricity is confirmed via PFM and P&#8208;V hysteresis measurements, and its non&#8208;centrosymmetric nature is supported by SHG measurement. This work opens new pathways for designing chiral ferrocene&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials with switchable spontaneous polarization have attracted significant interest over the past decades. Molecular ferroelectrics particularly offer unique advantages such as structural tunability, inducible intrinsic homochirality, and ease of processing, features often unattainable in inorganic ceramics. Ferrocene derivatives have been widely used in pharmaceuticals, sensing, and solar energy conversion. However, developing a single&#8208;component ferrocene&#8208;based ferroelectric remains a major challenge. In this work, we report, for the first time, a chiral, single&#8208;component ferrocene&#8208;based ferroelectric, Fe(C5H5)(C5H4COO&#8208;CHOL), via the homochirality strategy. Notably, this compound undergoes a reversible structural phase transition at 193&#160;K, switching from the polar space group C2 to another polar space group, P21, while maintaining the same point group. This transition only involves a symmetry operation change from a 2&#8208;fold rotation and screw rotation (C2) to a single 2&#8208;fold screw axis (P21). The ferroelectric nature was confirmed through piezoresponse force microscopy and polarization&#8208;electric field hysteresis loop measurements. Its non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure was validated by a polarized second&#8208;harmonic generation measurement. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a homochiral, single&#8208;component ferrocene&#8208;based ferroelectric undergoing phase transitions involving only spatial symmetry operation breaking. This work broadens the collection of chiral and ferrocene&#8208;based ferroelectrics and offers valuable insights for designing new ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Efficient C&#8722;N Coupling via Oxidation State Inversion in Asymmetric Copper&#8211;Zinc Amorphous&#8208;Like Atomic Clusters Driving Photoelectrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;inversed Cu&#8211;Zn amorphous&#8208;like ultra&#8208;small atomic clusters photocathode enables enhanced photoelectrochemical urea synthesis. The oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;inverted Cu&#948;&#8314;&#8211;Zn&#948;&#8314; dual sites steer nitrate activation toward non&#8208;canonical *NO intermediates, establishing distinct pathways that diverge from conventional routes to drive effective C&#8211;N coupling.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) coupling of CO2 and nitrate presents a sustainable strategy for urea synthesis under ambient conditions. However, the complexity of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process restricts the selective formation of the key intermediates, impeding efficient C&#8211;N coupling. Here, copper&#8211;zinc amorphous&#8208;like ultra&#8208;small atomic clusters are developed for efficient urea synthesis. The atomically disordered arrangement in the amorphous&#8208;like structure breaks the periodicity constraints of crystalline counterpart, enabling asymmetric Cu&#948;+&#8211;Zn&#948;+ coordination featuring oxidation state inversion, where the Cu oxidation state elevates within a narrow valence range (0 &lt; &#948; &lt; 1) and the Zn oxidation state reduces compared to the crystalline counterpart. More importantly, the oxidation state inversion generates electron&#8208;deficient Cu centers that stabilize the formation of new *NO intermediates, which are identified as a key intermediate that facilitates coupling with *CO species adsorbed on the electron&#8208;rich Zn sites, effectively reducing the activation barrier for C&#8211;N coupling involved in the formation of *OCNO. Under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation, the PEC system demonstrated well&#8208;balanced performance, achieving a high production rate of 64.03 mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at a low external potential of &#8722;0.1&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, with a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 46.60% and an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion efficiency of 17.6% at monochromatic illumination.

         <title>trans&#8208;Silaboration of Terminal Alkynes Enabled by Development of a New Si&#9472;B Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a novel air&#8208;stable Si&#9472;B reagent, TBSQ, by installation of a 8&#8208;quinolinyl directing group on silicon atom. By employment of TBSQ, we successfully solved the puzzle on how to implement the trans&#8208;silaboration of termial alkynes, exclusively delivering diverse trans&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;2&#8208;silyl alkenes. Importantly, this transformation features broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. The silyl group and boryl group on products can be easily distinguished by a variety of stepwise derivatization.








Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;silaboration of alkynes is a powerful strategy for regio&#8208; and stereoselective yielding versatile 1&#8208;boryl&#8208;2&#8208;silyl alkenes, which are ubiquitous synthons leveraging the orthogonal reactivity of boron and silicon for diverse downstream transformations. However, it dominantly features cis&#8208;selectivity. trans&#8208;Selective silaboration remains underdeveloped to date, especially for sterically hindered terminal alkynes. Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed trans&#8208;silaboration of terminal alkynes using a novel Si&#9472;B reagent, TBSQ, bearing an 8&#8208;quinolinyl directing group on silicon. This strategy provides exclusive E&#8208;selectivity across a broad substrate scope, including bulky alkynes. Mechanistic studies suggest a combined cis&#8208;addition/Z&#8594;E isomerization pathway, with the directing group playing a crucial role. The resulting trans&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;2&#8208;silyl alkenes serve as valuable building blocks for selective downstream functionalization toward pharmaceutically relevant molecules.

         <title>Bismuth&#8211;Selenopeptides Combine Potent Bioactivity with Exceptional Kinetic Inertness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major obstacle for bismuth peptides and proteins, in which Bi(III) is coordinated by three cysteine residues, is their kinetic lability when challenged with strong metal chelators. By simply replacing cysteines with selenocysteines, we significantly increased kinetic stability, extending the lifetime to several days. We further applied this strategy to a small protein containing six (seleno)cysteines, enabling coordination of two bismuth atoms.








Abstract
Bismuth peptides and proteins are emerging as versatile tools for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. Bismuth(III) binds three cysteine residues in peptides and proteins with remarkable selectivity. While the thermodynamic stability of these bismuth complexes is outstanding, their kinetic lability imposes limitations. Introducing bismuth selenopeptides, we demonstrate that selenocysteine binds bismuth with substantially higher kinetic stability than cysteine. This effect was quantified by directly comparing a peptide containing three cysteine residues with an identical peptide containing three selenocysteines. Bismuth selenopeptides are not only inert to strong chelators such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) but also to the natural metal&#8208;binding protein transferrin present in human plasma. We further demonstrate biological utility by developing bismuth selenopeptides that selectively bind and inhibit unrelated target proteins. To extend this concept to a more complex system, we investigated the human epidermal growth factor (EGF), a small protein comprising three disulfide bonds. We established that precisely two bismuth atoms bind to the six cysteine or selenocysteine residues in EGF and seleno&#8208;EGF, respectively. In the presence of EDTA, bismuth seleno&#8208;EGF remains fully intact, unlike its cysteine&#8208;based analog, consistent with observations from smaller peptides. Structural models confirm full preservation of the native EGF fold.

&lt;p&gt;A major obstacle for bismuth peptides and proteins, in which Bi(III) is coordinated by three cysteine residues, is their kinetic lability when challenged with strong metal chelators. By simply replacing cysteines with selenocysteines, we significantly increased kinetic stability, extending the lifetime to several days. We further applied this strategy to a small protein containing six (seleno)cysteines, enabling coordination of two bismuth atoms.

         <title>Constructing Sari&#8208;Topology Covalent Organic Frameworks from Pseudo&#8208;C5&#8208;Symmetric Core for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented sari topologic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on pseudo&#8208;fivefold symmetric building blocks have been first demonstrated. Both COFs showed high crystallinities, surface areas, and highly catalytic activities toward electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Developing new topologies for two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) remains challenging due to the scarcity of geometrically comparable building blocks. Herein, we report the construction of COFs exhibiting an unprecedented topology (named as sari) using a pseudo fivefold symmetric building block. The synthesized COFs, TTCD&#8211;DA&#8211;COFand TTCD&#8211;BA&#8211;COF, demonstrate high crystallinity, substantial surface areas, unique trapezoidal pores, and high electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Remarkably, without additional heteroatom doping or metal incorporation beyond the intrinsic imine nitrogen, both COFs exhibit favorable ORR performance.The TTCD&#8211;DA&#8211;COF (shorter linker) achieves superior ORR performance compared to TTCD&#8211;BA&#8211;COF (longer linker), featuring an onset potential (EO) of 0.85&#160;V, a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.78&#160;V, and a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.013&#160;s&#8722;1 at a potential of 0.75&#160;V. Theoretical calculations attribute this enhanced activity to the easier formation of an OOH* intermediate on specific carbon atoms within the imine&#8208;linkages of TTCD&#8211;DA&#8211;COF. This work not only expands the COF structures but also establishes a novel strategy for designing highly efficient metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts through linker&#8208;modulated electronic control.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regiodivergent Allyl&#8208;Propargyl Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions for the Construction of 1,4&#8208;Enallenes and 1,5&#8208;Enynes</title>

         <dc:description>
The chemo&#8208; and regiodivergent allyl&#8208;propargyl cross&#8208;coupling reactions of propargyl carbonates with allyl boronates has been realized. The role of ligands in determining both the chemoselectivity and regioselectivity is of particular importance, as they modulate the 1,1&#8242;&#8208; or 3,3&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination mode from the same &#951;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;allenylpalladium intermediate.








Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent transformations represent a vital strategy for the efficient production of structurally diverse molecules from the same readily available precursors. Herein, we report the palladium/phosphine&#8208;catalyst&#8208;driven chemo&#8208; and regiodivergent allyl&#8208;propargyl cross&#8208;coupling of propargyl carbonates with allyl boronates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the bidentate phosphine ligand plays a crucial role in determining the relative favorability of possible reductive elimination modes from the &#414;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#414;1&#8208;allenyl palladium intermediate species. Specifically, MeO&#8208;BIPHEP facilitates the 1,1&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination to form the 1,4&#8208;enallenes; in contrast, XantPhos favors the formation of 1,5&#8208;enynes through a 3,3&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination pathway.

Multi&#8208;spiral donor engineering unlocks narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with external quantum efficiency of 39.1% and full&#8208;width half&#8208;maximum of 25&#160;nm. Orthogonal spiral donors suppress aggregation while boosting efficiency&#8212;a leap toward high&#8208;performance OLEDs.








Abstract
The pursuit of narrowband multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with both high efficiency and color purity remains a critical challenge in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). A novel molecular design paradigm is proposed by hybridizing di&#8208;/tri&#8208;spiral donors in polycyclic heteroaromatic frameworks. The orthogonal, sterically hindered spiral donors disrupt molecular planarity, which can simultaneously suppress the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and spectral broadening. These emitters exhibit narrowband emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 22&#8211;24&#160;nm and high photoluminescence quantum yields of &#8764;100%. The tri&#8208;spiral donor configuration further improves horizontal dipole orientation for the enhanced light outcoupling. As a result, the optimal Ts&#8208;NBN&#8208;based OLED achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency of 39.1% with the CIE y value of 0.70.

         <title>Formation of Monolithic Magnesium&#8211;Calcium Carbonates Through Aggregation of Carbonate&#8208;Cluster Nanodroplets</title>

Schematic illustrating the formation of monolithic amorphous magnesium&#8211;calcium carbonate through the aggregation of nanodroplets. The color coding indicates that the Mg content may differ between the surface and the core. The two solid&#8208;state packings of Mg&#8208;rich and Mg&#8208;deficient domains shown on the right are structurally equivalent. Each tiny cube represents an amorphous domain with distinct Mg content. The cubes serve as a convenient visual guide to the space&#8208;filling feature of the amorphous domains.








Abstract
Mineral nucleation is a fundamental process of paramount importance to various fields, including geology, biomineralization, and industrial manufacturing. Recently, studies on the biominerals of calcium carbonate and phosphate have revealed the presence of a dense liquid phase prior to the formation of an amorphous solid phase. Here, we show that liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation occurs in a non&#8208;aqueous solution where magnesium and calcium carbonates are dissolved in ethanol with excess triethylamine. The nanodroplets can be kinetically trapped by triethylamine. We found that molecular complexes of triethylamine, CO2, and ethanol molecules are in constant exchange with sizable carbonate clusters. We argue that nanodroplets comprising highly solvated carbonate clusters are the key entities in the nucleation process. Remarkably, the coalescence of the nanodroplets leads to the formation of a monolithic magnesium&#8208;calcium carbonate containing two distinct domains with different Mg content.

         <title>Engineering Localized Aromaticity in Amine&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Narrowband Fluorescence Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering localized aromaticity in amine&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons effectively suppresses molecular vibration coupling and reduces the intensity of shoulder peaks in emission spectra, thereby giving rise to highly efficient yellow and red narrowband fluorophores for the assembly of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
The development of narrowband fluorescent emitters remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in organic optoelectronics. Herein, we present an aromaticity engineering approach based on a perylene core to construct highly efficient narrowband fluorescent emitters. Replacement of one naphthalene unit with a carbazole moiety enhances the localization of aromaticity, while extension of the &#960;&#8211;conjugation further attenuates the aromaticity of the remaining naphthalene ring. This dual modulation effectively suppresses emission shoulder bands, yielding spectrally pure fluorescence. Consequently, the centrosymmetric c&#8208;NaDTCz and the axially symmetric a&#8208;NaDTCz exhibit sharp emissions at 536 and 600&#160;nm, with narrow full widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 17 and 30&#160;nm, respectively. When applied in OLEDs, the c&#8208;NaDTCz&#8208;based device displays sharp yellow emission peaking at 548&#160;nm with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.1%, while a&#8208;NaDTCz delivers narrowband red electroluminescence at 610&#160;nm, achieving a record&#8208;high EQE of 27.8% for conventional red fluorescent emitters.

         <dc:description>
A modular approach for construction of multi&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;fluoropyrrole is established via a Lewis acid mediated defluorinative fluoro&#8208;aza&#8208;Nazarov cyclization. With this method, a wide range of tetra&#8208;/penta&#8208;substituted fluoropyrroles are synthesized in a highly efficient manner. A Pd&#8208;catalyzed protocol is also developed as an alternative for access to tri&#8208;substituted fluoropyrrole through an allyl&#8208;Pd involved cycloisomerization.








Abstract
A highly efficient approach toward polysubstituted &#946;&#8208;fluoropyrroles is described herein. Starting from &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which is easily available from corresponding difluorinated silyl enol ether, an unprecedented defluorinative fluoro&#8208;aza&#8208;Nazarov cyclization mediated by TiCl4 is successfully developed, which enables expedient construction of fluorine&#8208;containing tetra&#8208;/penta&#8208;substituted pyrroles in moderate to excellent yields. The protocol features the use of inexpensive Lewis acid, insensitivity to steric hindrance and compatibility with substrates of different substitution patterns. Furthermore, a two&#8208;step sequence and also a one&#8208;pot protocol were established for synthesizing tri&#8208;substituted pyrroles bearing a 3&#8208;fluorine substituent, utilizing a Pd&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative fluoro&#8208;aza&#8208;Nazarov cyclization. This methodology provides a modular solution for the rapid assembly of structurally complex &#946;&#8208;fluoropyrrole scaffolds, which are notoriously difficult targets using previous methods. Mechanistic studies indicated a Ti&#8208;mediated allylic C&#9472;F bond activation pathway, triggering the unprecedented defluorinative Nazarov&#8208;type cyclization.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Metallene Aerogels: A New Balancer for *H Production and Consumption in Nitrate Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy metallene aerogels (HEMAs) are employed for nitrate reduction (NO3RR) for the first time. Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of NH3 reach up to 99.5% and 4117.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 on PdCuSnCoNi HEMAs. Detailed studies indicate that PdCuSnCoNi HEMAs can balance *H production and consumption, as well as adjust the adsorption of key intermediates (*NO2, *NO) for the NH3 synthesis.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy metallene aerogels (HEMAs), synergizing high&#8208;entropy metallenes and metallic aerogels, face challenges in achieving single&#8208;phase structures due to multi&#8208;metallic nucleation/growth disparities, hindering two&#8208;dimensional anisotropic growth and three&#8208;dimensional assembly of multi&#8208;component nanocrystals. Herein, the universal preparation of HEMAs was achieved by a seed&#8208;mediated synthetic route for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). PdCuSnCoNi HEMAs exhibit maximum Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of NH3 up to 99.5% and 4117.8&#160;&#181;g&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat.&#8722;1, surpassing those of Pd metallene aerogels (MAs). In situ attenuated total reflection infrared absorption spectroscopy, online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculations reveal kinetic match for *NO3 to *NO2 and *NO2 to *NH3, with the energy barrier for *NO2 formation (potential&#8208;determining step) being lower than that for *H to H2, balancing production and consumption of *H and facilitating NH3 generation on PdCuSnCoNi HEMAs. This study paves the way for efficient NO3RR catalysts and guides rational design for diverse electrocatalytic systems.

         <dc:description>
By adjusting the concentration of the F&#8208;GQD solution, we achieved a tunable range of laser emission wavelengths from 638 to 751&#160;nm with continuous tunability between 709 and 751&#160;nm. We also achieved single&#8208;longitudinal&#8208;mode near&#8208;infrared laser emission from solid&#8208;state GQDs.








Abstract
Understanding the lasing mechanism of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) is crucial for enhancing their gain characteristics and developing high&#8208;performance laser devices. In this study, we investigated ultrafast excited&#8208;state dynamics to determine whether Auger recombination is the primary factor influencing the laser emission of GQDs. By effectively inhibiting Auger recombination through halogen&#8208;doping of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) GQDs, we could extend the Auger lifetime from 183.41 to 239.41&#160;ps, prolong the gain lifetime from 170.65 to 216.42&#160;ps, and significantly reduce the laser threshold from 159.69 to 14.07 mJ cm&#8722;2. Notably, fluorine&#8208;doped GQDs exhibited a tunable emission spectrum from 638 to 751&#160;nm and demonstrated exceptional stability under ambient conditions. High&#8208;gain NIR composite films were fabricated by combining fluorine&#8208;doped GQDs and polyimide. Based on this, high&#8208;quality planar distributed Bragg reflector microcavities with resonant peaks matching the amplified spontaneous emission peaks of the films were prepared. Upon integration with the film, solid&#8208;state GQDs could achieve single&#8208;longitudinal&#8208;mode (SLM) NIR laser emission at 711&#160;nm with a linewidth of 0.068&#160;nm. This advancement can facilitate the sustainable development of miniaturized lasers.

         <title>Bifunctional Probes Reveal the Rules of Intracellular Ether Lipid Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article introduces the first bifunctional ether lipids that were used for comparative studies of ester and ether lipid transport in mammalian cells. We find differential recognition of alkyl ether and vinyl ether lipids (plasmalogens) by lipid transfer proteins indicating distinct functional roles within cells. The new probes will advance the understanding of ether lipid biology in mechanistic detail.








Abstract
Ether&#160;glycerophospholipids bear a&#160;long chain alcohol attached via&#160;an&#160;alkyl or vinyl&#160;ether bond at the sn1 position&#160;of the glycerol backbone.&#160;Ether lipids&#160;play&#160;a significant role in&#160;physiology&#160;and human health.&#160;However, their cellular functions remain largely unknown due to a lack of tools for identifying their subcellular localization and interacting proteins. Here, we address this methodological gap by synthesizing minimally modified bifunctional ether lipid probes by introducing&#160;diazirine and alkyne groups.&#160;To interrogate the subcellular kinetics of intracellular ether lipid transport in mammalian cells, we used a combination of fluorescence imaging, machine learning&#8208;assisted image analysis, and mathematical modelling. We find that&#160;alkyl&#8208;linked&#160;ether&#160;lipids are transported up to twofold faster than vinyl&#8208;linked species (plasmalogens), pointing to yet undiscovered cellular lipid transport machinery able to&#160;distinguish between linkage types differing by as little as two hydrogen atoms. We find that ether lipid transport predominantly occurs via non&#8208;vesicular pathways, with varying contributions from vesicular mechanisms between cell types. Altogether, our results suggest that differential recognition of alkyl&#8208; and vinyl ether lipids by lipid transfer proteins contributes to their distinct biological functions. In&#160;the future, the probes reported here will enable studying ether lipid biology in much greater detail through identification of interacting proteins and in&#8208;depth characterization of intracellular ether lipid dynamics.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Allyl Radicals and Heterocoupled Dimer: Synthesis, Characterization, and Near&#8208;Infrared Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein three emissive allyl radicals via conjugated extension of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide and 1,3,5&#8208;trichlorobenzene protection. p&#8208;Tolyl and triphenylamine substitutions successfully produce stable allyl monoradicals, ARS&#8208;Ph and ARS&#8208;TPA, respectively. Whereas chlorine substituent affords an unexpected heterocoupled diradicaloid ARS&#8208;HD. Notably, ARS&#8208;TPA exhibits NIR fluorescent emission at 860 nm.








Abstract
Air&#8208;stable luminescent monoradical remains rare. Herein, we report novel stable allyl radicals (ARS) achieved by conjugated extension of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide and steric protection of 1,3,5&#8208;trichlorobenzene. The reactivity and photophysical properties of these allyl radicals are strongly dependent on protecting groups. Introducing p&#8208;tolyl group or triphenylamine afforded air&#8208;stable monoradical ARS&#8208;Ph and ARS&#8208;TPA, respectively. ARS&#8208;Ph displays doublet luminescence at 752&#160;nm with negligible photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY). ARS&#8208;TPA exhibits NIR fluorescence at 860&#160;nm with a PLQY of 11.7%. Whereas, chlorine&#8208;protected ARS&#8208;Cl proved inaccessible, an unsymmetric heterocoupled dimer ARS&#8208;HD was isolated as a luminescent singlet diradicaloid with emission at 790&#160;nm and a PLQY of 0.8%. Natural transition orbital analysis reveals the local excitation nature of ARS&#8208;Ph, excited charge&#8208;transfer characteristics of ARS&#8208;TPA and ARS&#8208;HD. Huang&#8208;Rhys factor and reorganization energy analyses of ARS&#8208;TPA disclose the critical effects of the vibrational decoupling and structure rigidity for its enhanced emission intensity and spectral sharpness. Remarkably, under continuous 365&#160;nm light, ARS&#8208;Ph, ARS&#8208;TPA, and ARS&#8208;HD exhibit excellent luminescent photostability in ambient conditions with half&#8208;lives of 19.7, 42.6, and 21.4 h, respectively. Our study presents a straightforward strategy for developing air&#8208;stable luminescent allyl radicals, expanding the family of luminescent radical materials.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Anchoring Single&#8208;Atom Pt for Three&#8208;Phase Interface&#8208;Assisted Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atoms Pt was bonded by N/O&#8208;coordination sites within triazine&#8208;based COFs to maximize atomic utilization and generate highly dispersed HER active centers. Coupling with a gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface&#8208;assisted photocatalytic system that promotes gas diffusion and effectively suppresses the ORR backward reaction, this system achieves one of the highest OWS performances among reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts under visible light.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS) due to their high crystallinity, porosity and tunable structures. However, current COF&#8208;based systems rely on cocatalysts, which suffer from low atomic utilization and poor distribution due to aggregation. In addition, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) backward reaction severely undermines catalytic efficiency and stability in long time reaction. Herein, we present a strategy that combines atomically dispersed Pt sites anchored via N/O coordination within triazine&#8208;based COFs and a gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface&#8208;assisted photocatalytic system to enhance both performance and durability. As a result, the Pt&#8208;TBPyT&#8208;COF achieves superior OWS performance with H2 and O2 evolution rates of 469.8 and 234.9 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, respectively, and an apparent quantum yield of 8.91% at 450&#160;nm. Notably, the OWS via gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface&#8208;assisted method effectively suppresses ORR backward reaction and reaches average rates as high as 568.7 and 284.3 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 for H2 and O2 in 5&#160;h, respectively, and maintained stable photocatalytic activity over a 30&#160;h continuous reaction. Further, density functional theory calculations and in situ experiments reveal that the single&#8208;atoms Pt coordination accelerates *H desorption, while the triazine units in COFs benefits charge separation and reduced energy barriers of OER rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Realizing High Performance Four&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries with Acidic Eutectic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acidic deep eutectic solvent (ZPDES) was engineered with H3PO4 and ZnCl2 to realize the high performance four&#8208;electron redox Zn&#9472;I2 batteries. The ZPDES confers suppressed corrosion behaviors of protons and Cl&#8722;, accelerates the redox kinetics of I&#8722;/I0/I+ and guides Zn (002) deposition with protons, thus realizing the Zn&#9472;I2 battery with high specific capacity, excellent cycling stability even under low N/P ratios.








Abstract
Achieving multi&#8208;electron redox reaction via halide ions and protons is promising for Zn&#9472;I2 batteries, yet their practical application is hindered by halide ion and proton corrosion, sluggish iodine redox kinetics and poor redox reversibility. Here, a deep eutectic solvent (ZPDES) composed with concentrated ZnCl2 and H3PO4 is engineered as the electrolyte for high performance Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. The chloride atom (Cl) and active hydrogen of H3PO4 in DES form hydrogen bonds (Cl&#8943;H&#9472;O) to mitigate the corrosion of Cl&#8722; and protons. Therefore, while achieving four&#8208;electron transfer by Cl&#8722;, the protons in DES can accelerate redox reaction kinetics and reduce I3&#8722; formation for improved reversibility. Moreover, the proton can promote the (002) texture formation and reduce by&#8208;products on Zn anode. As a result, the Zn&#9472;I2 battery with ZPDES delivers a high specific capacity of 576&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 320 cycles, and maintains a capacity retention of 100% over 20,000 cycles at 7 A g&#8722;1.

The ZPDES confers suppressed corrosion behaviors of protons and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, accelerates the redox kinetics of I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and guides Zn (002) deposition with protons, thus realizing the Zn&#9472;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery with high specific capacity, excellent cycling stability even under low N/P ratios.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving multi-electron redox reaction via halide ions and protons is promising for Zn&#9472;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, yet their practical application is hindered by halide ion and proton corrosion, sluggish iodine redox kinetics and poor redox reversibility. Here, a deep eutectic solvent (ZPDES) composed with concentrated ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is engineered as the electrolyte for high performance Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. The chloride atom (Cl) and active hydrogen of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in DES form hydrogen bonds (Cl&#8943;H&#9472;O) to mitigate the corrosion of Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and protons. Therefore, while achieving four-electron transfer by Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the protons in DES can accelerate redox reaction kinetics and reduce I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; formation for improved reversibility. Moreover, the proton can promote the (002) texture formation and reduce by-products on Zn anode. As a result, the Zn&#9472;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery with ZPDES delivers a high specific capacity of 576&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 320 cycles, and maintains a capacity retention of 100% over 20,000 cycles at 7 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Divergent Synthesis via Photochemical Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent Synthesis: A time&#8208;dependent photochemical rearrangement driven by energy transfer catalysis under visible light has been developed. Remarkably, by simply adjusting the reaction time, we can selectively synthesize two distinct types of fluorinated strained rings using the same photocatalyst. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies reveal that this photochemical rearrangement follows a kinetically controlled pathway.








Abstract
Divergent synthesis is a powerful and economical approach in synthetic chemistry and materials science. However, achieving precise control over divergent reactions using only reaction time as a variable is still rare. Herein, we show a time&#8208;dependent photochemical rearrangement driven by energy transfer catalysis under visible light. Remarkably, by simply adjusting the reaction time, we can selectively synthesize two distinct types of fluorinated strained rings using the same photocatalyst. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies reveal that this photochemical rearrangement follows a kinetically controlled pathway, involving a sequence of steps: diradical formation, 1,4&#8208;aryl migration, and 1,3&#8208;diradical formation. Interestingly, when the reaction time is extended, the newly formed difluoromethyl cyclopropanes can reversibly revert to the starting materials. This indicates that the final product is not simply kinetically or thermodynamically favored in the ground state potential energy surface. Instead, the excited state introduces additional complexity to the situation, as the starting materials are then fully converted into 1,1&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes through an excited&#8208;state thermodynamic control pathway&#8212;defined as the product distribution being governed by the relative thermodynamic stabilities of intermediates on the excited&#8208;state potential energy surface (PES), in contrast to conventional ground&#8208;state thermodynamic control, which relies on singlet ground&#8208;state PES stabilities under thermal conditions.

         <title>Structural Transformation and Photochromism of Chiral Hybrid Metal Halides for Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 46, November 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprotonated, monoprotonated, and biprotonated chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs) with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) were fabricated that showed photochromic and pH&#8208;controlled circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with the switching of the RTP. The dissymmetry factors (glum) became increasingly larger as the numbers of protons increased as a result of hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;enhanced chirality amplification.








Abstract
Chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs) have emerged as promising systems for stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, chiral OIMHs featuring both photochromic CPL and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have rarely been reported. Herein, we adopted multi&#8208;protonation effect to construct chiral OIMHs using axially chiral bipyridyl molecules (R&#8208;L/S&#8208;L). Nonprotonated (R&#8208;0H&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cl/S&#8208;0H&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cl), monoprotonated (R&#8208;1H&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cl/S&#8208;1H&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cl), and biprotonated (R&#8208;2H&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cl/S&#8208;2H&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cl) chiral OIMHs with RTP were facilely synthesized. Benefiting from the protonation&#8208;enhanced charge transfer (CT), OIMHs exhibited stable photochromism with the crystal color change and luminescence switching, leading to photochromic CPL. The reversible structural transformation between monoprotonated and biprotonated hybrids can be achieved through the regulation of HCl&#8211;NH3 vapor or aqueous solution, accompanied by the switching of circularly polarized RTP behaviors. Importantly, the dissymmetry factors (glum) values can be greatly enhanced, which are proportional to the amount of proton, resulting from hydrogen bonding&#8208;enhanced chirality amplification. With multi&#8208;photoresponsive advantages, these hybrids demonstrated potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and encoding. This work thus provides new insight into developing solid&#8208;state photochromism in OIMHs and lays the groundwork for designing chiral OIMHs with stimulus&#8208;responsive CPL and RTP.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Photoredox Catalysis Beyond the Singlet Bottleneck Through Triplet Charge Recombination and Magnetic Field Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy combining triplet charge recombination in micellar nanoreactors with magnetic field regulation achieves a 300% enhancement in photocatalytic efficiency. The magnetic field suppresses detrimental back electron transfer by regulating the spin dynamics of key radical&#8208;ion&#8208;pair intermediates. This work establishes a transformative framework for manipulating photoredox pathways to achieve high&#8208;performance catalysis.








Abstract
Organic photosensitizers with redox&#8208;active excited states have revitalized photoredox catalysis, but their efficiency is often hindered by spontaneous back electron transfer (BET), particularly in singlet&#8208;driven pathways. Enhancing triplet utilization is therefore critical for improving catalytic performance but remains challenging, especially without structural modifications to the catalyst. Here, using phenothiazine&#8208;type photosensitizers as a model system, we demonstrate a synergistic strategy that enhances reaction efficiency by almost 300%. Triplet charge recombination (TCR) is shown to be significantly promoted within the nonpolar micellar core, enhancing triplet generation and facilitating efficient triplet&#8208;substrate interactions. Furthermore, an external magnetic field is introduced along the triplet pathway to depress BET by inhibiting spin conversion of radical&#8208;ion&#8208;pair intermediates from triplet to singlet. The developed kinetic modeling provides quantitative insights and mechanistic validation of the magnetic field effect. This work establishes a powerful synergistic strategy to control photoredox mechanisms, offering a new framework for advancing catalytic performance.

         <title>An All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8211;Cu Battery via Cuprous/Lithium&#8208;Ion Halide Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work synthesizes a Cu&#8314; halide solid electrolyte (Cu2ZrCl6) with low migration energy barrier for ion conduction and high Cu&#8314; conductivity/solubility and constructs a model of synergistic migration and ion exchange of Cu&#8314; and Li&#8314; in related electrolytes. Therefore, the first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;copper battery (ASSLCB) is assembled (delivering 360 mAh g&#8722;1 reversible capacity), with a cathode&#8208;free counterpart also designed.








Abstract
The Cu cathode has great potential due to its low cost and high capacity. However, the limited ionic conductivity of the electrolyte for Cu ions and poor solubility of Cu species severely hinder the rapid development of Li&#8211;Cu batteries. Herein, we synthesized a Cu+ halide solid electrolyte (Cu2ZrCl6, CZC) by mechanochemical method, which exhibited a high room&#8208;temperature Cu+ conductivity (about 14 mS cm&#8722;1) and high solubility of Cu species. The Cu||CZC||Cu symmetric battery demonstrated the ability to maintain stable Cu+ plating/stripping over 1000 h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. We further constructed a model of the synergistic migration and ion exchange of Cu+ and Li+ in CZC and Li2ZrCl6 electrolytes. Based on this, we assembled the first all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;copper battery (ASSLCB), which delivered a high reversible specific capacity of 360 mAh g&#8722;1 (1.7&#8211;3.8&#160;V versus Li&#8314;/Li, at 37&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and exhibited outstanding cycling performance across 50 cycles at a current of 62.5&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Additionally, we designed a cathode&#8208;free ASSLCB, utilizing aluminum foil as the current collector to demonstrate the deposition and dissolution of pure copper metal. This study provides a new design concept for Cu+ conductors and lays a foundation for the future research of ASSLCBs.

Herein, we synthesized a Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; halide solid electrolyte (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, CZC) by mechanochemical method, which exhibited a high room-temperature Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity (about 14 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high solubility of Cu species. The Cu||CZC||Cu symmetric battery demonstrated the ability to maintain stable Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; plating/stripping over 1000 h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We further constructed a model of the synergistic migration and ion exchange of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in CZC and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes. Based on this, we assembled the first all-solid-state lithium&#8211;copper battery (ASSLCB), which delivered a high reversible specific capacity of 360 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (1.7&#8211;3.8&#160;V versus Li&#8314;/Li, at 37&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and exhibited outstanding cycling performance across 50 cycles at a current of 62.5&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, we designed a cathode-free ASSLCB, utilizing aluminum foil as the current collector to demonstrate the deposition and dissolution of pure copper metal. This study provides a new design concept for Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductors and lays a foundation for the future research of ASSLCBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Electric Fields in Cyclooctatetrathiophene&#8208;Based COF/ ZnIn2S4 Z&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction Boost Photocatalytic Seawater Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dual&#8208;electric&#8208;field&#8208;engineered heterostructure, JUC&#8208;704@ZIS, is constructed using a synergistic strategy of intramolecular electric field via sulfur&#8208;isomeric COTh building blocks and Z&#8208;scheme interfacial electric field. This heterostructure achieves exceptional cocatalyst&#8208;free photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance in seawater.








Abstract
The development of efficient photocatalysts for seawater&#8208;based photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) represents a crucial step toward sustainable green hydrogen production. While covalent organic frameworks (COFs) show great potential due to their structural tunability and optoelectronic properties, their practical application is limited by inherent challenges of low charge mobility and rapid carrier recombination. Herein, we present an innovative dual&#8208;electric&#8208;field strategy that synergistically combines intramolecular charge asymmetry with Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction engineering to overcome these limitations. Through precise molecular design, we developed two isomeric cyclooctatetrathiophene building blocks with distinct sulfur spatial arrangements, enabling the construction of COFs with controlled asymmetric charge distributions that generate strong intramolecular electric fields. These COFs were further integrated with ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) via in situ growth to form intimate Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, creating complementary interfacial electric fields. The resulting JUC&#8208;X@ZIS (X&#160;=&#160;702, 703, or 704) systems exhibit remarkable charge separation efficiency, with the optimized JUC&#8208;704@ZIS (1:8) achieving an exceptional cocatalyst&#8208;free PHE rate of 9.46&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in seawater, outperforming most reported COF&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the spatial positioning of sulfur atoms governs both the charge asymmetry and dual electric field formation, providing new molecular&#8208;level insights for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Directed Evolution of a Nonheme Iron Enzyme to Access Chiral &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives by 1,3&#8208;Migratory Nitrene C(sp3)&#9472;H Insertion</title>

A nonheme iron enzyme, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtLDOX), was repurposed to catalyze the enantioselective synthesis of a series of chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives via a 1,3&#8208;migratory nitrene C&#9472;H insertion process involving hydrogen atom transfer and radical rebound steps.








Abstract
Nonheme iron enzymes are among nature's most versatile catalysts for molecular functionalization. Engineering nonheme enzymes for abiological reactions unlocks new catalytic possibilities beyond the limits of natural evolution. In this work, we engineered a nonheme enzyme, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtLDOX), to catalyze an asymmetric 1,3&#8208;migratory nitrene C(sp3)&#9472;H insertion reaction. Through directed evolution, the final optimized AtLDOX_LS variant efficiently delivers a range of chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acids derivatives with exceptional activity and enantioselectivity (up to 81% yield, 850 total turnover number, and 98:2 enantiomeric ratio). Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of radical intermediates for this transformation. This work advances the biocatalytic toolbox for radical involved transformations and broadens the scope of enzymatic migration chemistry.

         <title>Covalently Anchored Cationic Groups Tailor Electric Double Layer for Supporting&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Free CO2 Reduction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic groups covalently anchored around molecular catalytic sites generate a strong local electric field and modulate the double&#8208;layer structure. Their electrostatic effect stabilizes polar intermediates of CO2 reduction, lowers H+ concentration in the diffuse layer, and disrupts the interfacial hydrogen bond network for H+ transport, enabling CO2 electroreduction in acidic media free of any supporting electrolyte.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in acidic media without supporting electrolytes&#8212;including dissolved alkali salts or cationic polyelectrolytes coated on the catalyst surface&#8212;remains highly challenging. A promising strategy is to covalently anchor cationic groups near catalytic sites, generating local electric fields to stabilize polar intermediates. Here, we employed carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;immobilized cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP) derivatives as model catalysts, functionalized with quaternary ammonium groups at distinct positions of the phenyl rings. Using vibrational Stark and Tafel analyses, we probed how these cationic groups shape the electric double&#8208;layer and CO2RR performance. When anchored at ortho&#8208;sites, the cationic groups induced a strong local electric field near the Co site, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 94% in pure acidic electrolyte. These cationic groups at the ortho&#8208;sites demonstrated greater ability to promote acidic CO2RR compared to alkali cations or cationic polyelectrolyte modification layers. This enhancement is attributed to the covalent anchoring approach, which enables the creation of a higher cation density around the catalytic site, thereby more substantially increasing the local electric field strength.

         <title>Rechargeable Aprotic Zinc&#8211;Oxygen Batteries with Reversible ZnO Formation on Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible redox mechanism between O2 and ZnO (discharge products) of a novel aprotic zinc&#8211;oxygen (Zn&#8208;O2) battery chemistry. This discovery indicates that ZnO&#8212;typically an insulating byproduct in traditional Zn&#8208;O2 batteries&#8212;acts as an independent and reversible discharge product of oxygen cathodes for the first time. The unique electrolyte environment promotes the selective formation of defect&#8208;rich ZnO featuring abundant oxygen vacancies, enhancing the ease of Zn&#9472;O bond cleavage and O2 release during charging.








Abstract
Mastering the redox reactions of oxygen&#8212;a naturally abundant and high&#8208;energy material&#8212;holds transformative potential to address the limitations in energy density, cost, and resource availability of current batteries. Despite their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, conventional aqueous zinc&#8211;oxygen (Zn&#8208;O2) batteries were born with poor rechargeability. Critically, whether reversible oxygen electrochemistry can be established in aprotic Zn&#8208;based electrolytes remains an open question. Herein, we show that ZnO, traditionally regarded as an insulating byproduct, can be harnessed as an exclusive and reversible cathode product, hence opening access to a rechargeable Zn&#8208;O2 battery chemistry. At the heart of this O2/ZnO redox is the combined use of high&#8208;donicity aprotic electrolytes and Ru&#8208;based catalysts, which enables selective oxygen reduction to form a chemically inert (toward electrolytes) but defect&#8208;rich ZnO phase, whose oxygen vacancies promote low&#8208;polarization Zn&#9472;O bond breaking upon recharge to release O2. The resulting reversibility of the oxygen cathode, coupled with stable Zn plating/stripping at the anode, ensures a prolonged cycle lifespan exceeding 1000&#160;h for aprotic Zn&#8208;O2 cells. A semi&#8208;solid pouch cell with an energy density of 120&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 is further achieved using a high utilization&#8208;rate (40%) Zn anode. This work advances oxygen redox understanding and balances rechargeability with energy density in Zn batteries.

         <title>Heteromultivalent Nanogels as Highly Potent Inhibitors of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteromultivalent polyglycerol nanogel system integrates fucose/galactose and short&#8208;chain antibacterial peptides to achieve strong bactericidal and anti&#8208;biofilm effects at low concentration by efficient multivalent binding with bacterial lectins.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of microbial resistance requires new antibacterial concepts for selective targeting and killing of pathogenic bacteria. Here, we report the synthesis of a heteromultivalent nanogel system against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). These nanogels are based on biocompatible polyglycerols and functionalized with sugar ligands fucose (Fuc) or galactose (Gal) for P. aeruginosa targeting. With a further modification of these nanogels with BMAP&#8208;18 short chain peptides (GRFKRFRKKFKKLFKKLS), we have achieved&#160;&gt;&#160;99.99% inactivation of planktonic and&#160;&gt;&#160;99.9% inactivation of biofilm&#8208;coated P. aeruginosa within 12 h of treatment. Additionally, the system demonstrates broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial potential, effectively inhibiting Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This modular design offers a promising strategy for the development of next&#8208;generation antimicrobial therapies targeting biofilm&#8208;associated infections and MDR bacteria.

         <title>Metalloid Coordination Reinforcing Electronic Synergy in Dual&#8208;Atom Sites for Large&#8208;Scale CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B,N co&#8208;coordination reinforces electronic interactions between NiFe dual sites more than common N coordination. NiFe/BNC sustains &gt;95% CO FE at ampere&#8208;level currents in 100 cm2 MEA CO2 electrolyzer. The reinforced interaction induces asymmetric charge distribution, facilitating *COOH formation on Ni and CO desorption on Fe sites. This metalloid B coordination strategy also works for other DACs like Ni&#8211;Cu, Ni&#8211;Co, and Ni&#8211;Mn cases.








Abstract
Reinforcing electronic synergy in dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) is critical yet challenging for boosting electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) performances. Herein, we develop a versatile strategy introducing metalloid B to construct B,N co&#8208;coordination dual sites featuring polarized (N&#8211;B)n bridges, enforcing electron delocalization between metal centers in DACs. Taking NiFe DACs as an example, the as&#8208;obtained NiFe/BNC achieves 99% CO Faraday efficiency (FECO) and 55.7% full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell, markedly outperforming the common N&#8208;coordinated counterpart (NiFe/NC) and representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. Moreover, upon scaling the cell area to 100 cm2, this catalyst maintains &gt;95% FECO during high&#8208;current electrolysis at 1&#8211;6 A. Even at &#8722;53 &#176;C, it sustains &gt;98% FECO across 50&#8208;250&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, confirming the feasibility for in situ fuel production on Mars. Systematic investigations reveal B,N co&#8208;coordination induces reversed electron transfer (Fe&#8594;Ni), distinct from weakly interacting NiFe/NC. This facilitates *COOH formation on electron&#8208;enriched Ni sites and accelerated CO desorption from electron&#8208;deficient Fe sites, synergistically enhancing ECR. Simultaneously, B sites promote water dissociation by adsorbing *OH intermediates, further boosting overall performance. Notably, this strategy shows broad versatility across Ni&#8211;Fe, Ni&#8211;Cu, Ni&#8211;Co, and Ni&#8211;Mn systems, opening new avenues for advanced DAC design.

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting at the Integrated Rh&#8211;MoRhOx Cluster Heterostructure on InGaN/GaN Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated Rh&#8211;MoRhOx cluster heterostructures on InGaN/GaN nanowires facilitate efficient charge extraction and spatially coupled hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, thereby fundamentally accelerating the overall water splitting kinetics.








Abstract
The quest for efficient solar&#8208;driven water splitting, a promising avenue for clean fuel production, faces challenges due to limited solar energy conversion efficiency. Traditional approaches study the overall water splitting as two spatially separate half reactions on two unrelated sites, hindering full utilization of photogenerated charge and water molecules. To overcome these limitations, an integrated cluster heterostructure catalyst on InGaN/GaN semiconductor nanowires is proposed for the effective utilization of photogenerated charge carriers and water molecules on the same redox localization. By establishing the fast charge extraction kinetics based on InGaN/GaN nanowires, the integration of Rh and MoRhOx clusters on the nanowire surface enables simultaneous and fast hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions at the cluster heterostructure. Furthermore, the integrated strategy can enhance the charge redistribution across the heterostructure between the two clusters, further optimizing adsorption of reaction intermediates on each cluster for boosted photocatalytic water splitting activity. Consequently, the integrated heterostructure triggers a 40&#8208;fold increased hydrogen production efficiency in an artificial leaf system. This study provides valuable insights for the rational design of advanced heterostructured photocatalysts for water splitting and beyond.

         <title>Dual Self&#8208;Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization towards Cationic Polypeptoids with Stable Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes dual self&#8208;promoted polymerization to construct helical cationic polymers. Unlike conventional polypeptides where cationic side chains typically disrupt helicity, these cationic polypeptoids exhibit remarkably stable helices.








Abstract
Cationic helices play crucial roles in various biological processes. While polypeptides containing lysine and guanidine side chains are among the most prevalent cationic polymers, their helical structures are often unstable due to side&#8208;chain electrostatic repulsion. Here, bulky, chiral tertiary amine side chains were incorporated into polypeptoids by controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization, inducing achiral backbones into stable helices. Despite the highly steric side chains, the cyclic monomer underwent efficient polymerization via a dual self&#8208;promoted mechanism involving side chain&#8208;mediated proton transfer and helix&#8208;induced acceleration. Subsequent quaternization yielded structurally diverse polyproline&#8208;I&#8208;like helical cationic polypeptoids. Unlike conventional polypeptides where cationic side chains typically disrupt helicity, these cationic polypeptoids exhibited remarkably stable helices. The cationic side chains stabilize the helices by enforcing cis&#8208;amide backbone conformations through two key interactions: 1) C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bonding between side chains and backbone; 2) steric hindrance of side chains. Preliminary studies demonstrated that cationic helical polypeptoids exhibited significantly lower cytotoxicity and faster cellular uptake kinetics compared to the conventional cationic polypeptide poly(l&#8208;lysine). The dual self&#8208;promoted synthesis, coupled with cationic side chain&#8208;mediated helix stabilization, provides new insights for designing advanced functional polymers. Moreover, these cationic polypeptoids, with robust helices, low cytotoxicity and high cellular uptake, hold great promise for various biological applications.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Mixed Cations in the Electrochemical Double Layer Enables Highly Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a remarkable Faradaic efficiency for CH4 (FECH4) of 88.7% with a current density of 461.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 was achieved at&#160;&#8722;1.3&#160;V vs. RHE over CuCeSiOx electrode in a ternary electrolyte of 1&#160;M tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) + 5&#160;mM KCl.

Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 methanation is crucial for sustainable carbon recycling, transforming a greenhouse gas into a valuable fuel. However, achieving high selectivity toward CH4, particularly at high current densities, remains a significant challenge. In this study, a remarkable Faradaic efficiency for CH4 (FECH4) of 88.7% with a current density of 461.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 was achieved at&#160;&#8722;1.3&#160;V vs. RHE over CuCeSiOx electrode in a ternary electrolyte of 1&#160;M tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) + 5&#160;mM KCl, setting a new record for CO2 electroreduction to CH4.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanation is crucial for sustainable carbon recycling, transforming a greenhouse gas into a valuable fuel. However, achieving high selectivity toward CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, particularly at high current densities, remains a significant challenge. In this study, a remarkable Faradaic efficiency for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (FE&lt;sub&gt;CH4&lt;/sub&gt;) of 88.7% with a current density of 461.0&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved at&#160;&#8722;1.3&#160;V vs. RHE over CuCeSiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; electrode in a ternary electrolyte of 1&#160;M tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) + 5&#160;mM KCl, setting a new record for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. By employing other Cu-based catalysts, high CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity can also be obtained in this ternary electrolyte.

         <title>Chiral Bifacial Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors with Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity: A Homochiral Strategy to Improve Organic Solar Cell Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop new bifacial chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). Through comparative investigations of four NFAs including meso, racemic, and chiral entries, we demonstrate the superiority of homochiral NFAs for the first time. In addition, pristine chiral NFAs films and bulk heterojunction (BHJ) with PBDB&#8208;T exhibit high spin polarization values of 50%&#8211;70% in the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effects. 








Abstract
Asymmetric design has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance the performance of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Although most asymmetric NFAs focus on lateral (i.e., left&#8211;right) asymmetry, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy has remained underexplored, despite its ability to induce both a vertical dipole moment and molecular chirality, thereby potentially enabling functionalities such as chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS). With this perspective, we develop chiral and bifacial NFAs, (S,S)&#8208;IE4F, and (R,R)&#8208;IE4F, featuring an indacenodithiophene (IDT) core bearing a hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) group and a hydrophobic phenyl group on the bridging sp3&#8208;carbons. Their racemic counterpart (rac&#8208;IE4F) and a non&#8208;bifacial achiral isomer (meso&#8208;IE4F) are also synthesized as the controls. Compared to meso&#8208;IE4F, the bifacial isomers exhibit higher solubility, more favorable molecular packing for carrier transport, and larger dipole moments. Notably, neat (S,S)/(R,R)&#8208;IE4Fs and their bulk heterojunctions with PBDB&#8208;T exhibit pronounced CISS effect, with spin polarizations of &#8764;70% and &#8764;50%, respectively. Consequently, OSCs based on homochiral bifacial IE4Fs achieve a power conversion efficiency of 8.17%, three times higher than that of meso&#8208;IE4F. This study highlights the impact of isomerization in NFAs and provides a new molecular design strategy for homochiral asymmetric NFAs.

         <title>Quantifying Effective Dehydrated Ion Sizes Based on Pore&#8208;Ion Steric Properties to Predict Separation Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A correlation relationship between ion trans&#8208;membrane energy barriers and physical pore&#8208;ion parameters was established. The diffusion rates linked to the effective dehydration radius were successfully proved to predict the separation ratio between alkali&#8208;metal ions, indicating the crucial role of hydration structure changes in controlling the ion trans&#8208;membrane process.








Abstract
Designing selective membranes for sieving specific solutes requires a deep understanding of fundamental structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationships, in which ion hydration properties under nanoconfined environment are the pivot for nanofiltration (NF) models and high&#8208;performance membrane synthesis. Herein, four nanochannels of similar components and structures but various sizes were constructed, and the transport manners of typical cations were tested for analyzing the effects of size&#8208;related dehydration process. Notably, dehydration extent reversed the ion transport rates in the nanochannels, while the trans&#8208;membrane energy barrier increased until a plateau was reached with the shrinkage of pore sizes, where the transformation from dehydration to deformation occurred in ion partitioning into the membrane pores as evidenced by theoretical calculations. Through quantitatively assessing sieving&#8208;related features of channels and cations, a correlation relationship between trans&#8208;membrane energy barriers and physical pore&#8208;ion parameters was obtained and then effective dehydrated sizes were calculated accordingly for replacing Stokes radius in diffusion description models. The diffusion rates linked to the effective radius were successfully proved to predict the separation ratio between alkali&#8208;metal ions, indicating the crucial role of hydration structure changes in controlling the ion trans&#8208;membrane process.

         <title>Electroactive Model&#8208;Guided Design of Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Heterojunctions for Enhanced Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mathematically guided strategy has been developed to predict optimal shell thickness in core&#8211;shell heterojunctions using a universal electroactive model. The model is broadly applicable to various c&#8208;MOFs, offering a predictive framework for engineering high&#8208;performance redox&#8208;active heterojunctions. This approach enables the rational design of c&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based heterostructures with a high photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Heterojunction engineering in nanomaterials has been a cornerstone of research in diverse fields owing to its profound impact on charge transport and interfacial properties. However, despite recent insights suggest that precise control over the heterostructures is critical for optimal functionality, a universally guideline defining the optimal heterostructures remains elusive. Herein, we proposed a novel &#8220;electroactive model guidance&#8221; approach to guide the nanostructures design in redox&#8208;active conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) based p&#8208;n heterojunction for high performance photocatalyst. Chosen Cu2O@c&#8208;MOFs core&#8208;shell heterostructures as model, we optimized the shell thickness based on a mathematical electroactive model. The optimized structure achieved a tenfold photocurrent enhancement compared to pristine Cu2O&#8212;a record&#8208;high for heterojunctions. The heterojunctions with optimal shell thicknesses exhibited outstanding degradation efficiency for tetracycline, with a catalytic degradation efficiency up to 99.35% and exhibited the rate constant of 0.065 min&#8722;1, this represents the highest rate constant, reported to date for such systems. Furthermore, the universality of this theoretical model extends to other c&#8208;MOFs, such as Cu&#8208;OHPTP and Cu&#8208;DBC, which similarly exhibit significantly enhanced performance. This work not only provides a robust framework for the rational design of redox&#8208;active semiconductor heterojunction but also offers valuable insights into optimizing their functional properties for advanced applications.

         <title>Dynamics and Mechanism of Off&#8208; to On&#8208;Switching in Dreiklang a Decoupled Reversibly Switchable Fluorescent Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dreiklang is a reversibly switchable fluorescent protein with a unique photohydration/dehydration mechanism. Using complementary transient absorption and femtosecond&#8212;microsecond transient IR, we follow the off&#8208;to&#8208;on photo&#8208;dehydration. A multistep process is revealed, where a hundreds&#8208;of&#8208;picoseconds photoreaction is followed by microsecond structural reorganization, providing new mechanistic insight.








Abstract
Dreiklang is a reversibly switchable (rs) fluorescent protein (FP) with a unique off&#8208;state, a UV absorbing hydrated form of the typical FP chromophore. Here we report ultrafast dynamics of the off&#8208; to on&#8208;state transition in Dreiklang using complementary ultrafast optical and vibrational transient absorption to resolve chromophore driven protein structural dynamics. This approach allows observation of the real&#8208;time response in a protein to bond breaking and forming events. The excited electronic state decays in a nonsingle exponential fashion in tens to hundreds of picoseconds, undergoing photodehydration with a yield of several per&#8208;cent. The primary photoproduct formed is identified as the cis protonated form of the FP chromophore, initially in a perturbed H&#8208;bonded environment. This primary product relaxes on a few microseconds timescale by a mechanism involving changes to a glutamic acid residue and modifications of the amide backbone, possibly involving a carbonyl to imine tautomerization. The temporal and spectral resolution of Dreiklang's photodehydration provides data against which to test quantum chemical calculations of reaction dynamics in proteins and suggests a route to modifying and potentially enhancing its photoswitching properties.

This primary product relaxes on a few microseconds timescale by a mechanism involving changes to a glutamic acid residue and modifications of the amide backbone, possibly involving a carbonyl to imine tautomerization. The temporal and spectral resolution of Dreiklang's photodehydration provides data against which to test quantum chemical calculations of reaction dynamics in proteins and suggests a route to modifying and potentially enhancing its photoswitching properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
