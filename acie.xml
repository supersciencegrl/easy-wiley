         <title>Short Guanidinium&#8208;Functionalized Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s Displaying Potent Therapeutic Efficacy on Drug&#8208;Resistant Fungal Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, guanidinium&#8208;pendent poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s were designed as synthetic mimics of host defense peptides to display potent antifungal properties, owing to the enhanced penetrating efficiency into fungal cells. Short guanidinium&#8208;pendent poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s display strong therapeutic potential as a class of promising antifungal agents.







Abstract
New antifungals are urgently needed to combat invasive fungal infections, due to limited types of available antifungal drugs and frequently encountered side effects, as well as the quick emergence of drug&#8208;resistance. We previously developed amine&#8208;pendent poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POXs) as synthetic mimics of host defense peptides (HDPs) to have antibacterial properties, but with poor antifungal activity. Hereby, we report the finding of short guanidinium&#8208;pendent POXs, inspired by cell&#8208;penetrating peptides, as synthetic mimics of HDPs to display potent antifungal activity, superior mammalian cells versus fungi selectivity, and strong therapeutic efficacy in treating local and systemic fungal infections. Moreover, the unique antifungal mechanism of fungal cell membrane penetration and organelle disruption explains the insusceptibility of POXs to antifungal resistance. The easy synthesis and structural diversity of POXs imply their potential as a class of promising antifungal agents.

         <title>Enhanced Overall Water Splitting by a Zirconium&#8208;Doped TaON&#8208;Based Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the invention of an amorphous Ta2O5&#8901;3.3&#8201;H2O nanopowder precursor together with Zr doping as the main strategies, detrimental TaIII defect species and grain boundaries were eliminated in the resultant TaON particles. These effects have improved the photocatalytic overall water splitting efficiency of TaON by an order of magnitude.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;powered one&#8208;step&#8208;excitation overall water splitting (OWS) using semiconducting materials is a simple means of achieving scalable and sustainable hydrogen production. While tantalum oxynitride (TaON) is one of the few photocatalysts capable of promoting OWS via single&#8208;step visible&#8208;light excitation, the efficiency of this process remains extremely poor. The present work employed 15&#8197;nm amorphous Ta2O5&#8901;3.3&#8201;H2O nanoparticles as a new precursor together with Zr doping and an optimized nitridation duration to synthesize a TaON&#8208;based photocatalyst with reduced particle sizes and low defect densities. Upon loading with Ru/Cr2O3/IrO2 cocatalysts, this material exhibited stoichiometric water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen, with an order of magnitude improvement in efficiency. Our findings demonstrate the importance of inventing/selecting the appropriate synthetic precursor and of defect control for fabricating active OWS photocatalysts.

         <title>Reactivity Differences Enable ROS for Selective Ablation of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two compounds were developed to demonstrate that the reactive difference of ROS may induce selective ablation of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. One mainly produces O2.&#8722; which has an excellent selectivity to Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, while the other has a higher generation of 1O2 which shows no selectivity toward bacteria. This difference may pave a new way to engineer photodynamic agents for selectively ablating Gram&#8208;positive bacteria.







Abstract
An effective strategy to engineer selective photodynamic agents to surmount bacterial&#8208;infected diseases, especially Gram&#8208;positive bacteria remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed two examples of compounds for a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study where reactive differences in reactive oxygen species (ROS) can induce selective ablation of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Sulfur&#8208;replaced phenoxazinium (NBS&#8208;N) mainly generates a superoxide anion radical capable of selectively killing Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, while selenium&#8208;substituted phenoxazinium (NBSe&#8208;N) has a higher generation of singlet oxygen that can kill both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. This difference was further evidenced by bacterial fluorescence imaging and morphological changes. Moreover, NBS&#8208;N can also successfully heal the Gram&#8208;positive bacteria&#8208;infected wounds in mice. We believe that such reactive differences may pave a general way to design selective photodynamic agents for ablating Gram&#8208;positive bacteria&#8208;infected diseases.

         <title>Thionolactone as a Resin Additive to Prepare (Bio)degradable 3D Objects via VAT Photopolymerization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) UV&#8208;printing produces cross&#8208;linked materials that are stable and non&#8208;degradable. The introduction of a thionolactone dopant (2&#8197;wt&#8201;% of dibenzo[c,e]&#8208;oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT)) to acrylate&#8208;based resins produced via radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization confers (bio)degradability through the thioester units in the network. The resin was used in different setups, including commercial 3D printers, and the objects were shown to degrade in basic solution under mild conditions.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing and especially VAT photopolymerization leads to cross&#8208;linked materials with high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Nevertheless, these properties are incompatible with requirements of degradability and re/upcyclability. We show here that thionolactone and in particular dibenzo[c,e]&#8208;oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) can be used as an additive (2&#8197;wt&#8201;%) to acrylate&#8208;based resins to introduce weak bonds into the network via a radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization process. The low amount of additive makes it possible to modify the printability of the resin only slightly, keep its resolution intact, and maintain the mechanical properties of the 3D object. The resin with additive was used in UV microfabrication and two&#8208;photon stereolithography setups and commercial 3D printers. The fabricated objects were shown to degrade in basic solvent as well in a homemade compost. The rate of degradation is nonetheless dependent on the size of the object. This feature was used to prepare 3D objects with support structures that could be easily solubilized.

         <title>The Stannum&#8211;Ene Reactions of Benzyne and Cyclohexyne with Superb Chemoselectivity for Cyclohexyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stannum&#8211;ene reactions of both benzyne and cyclohexyne were realized, which is particularly suitable for cyclohexyne with a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity.







Abstract
The stannum&#8211;ene reactions of both benzyne and cyclohexyne were realized, which is particularly suitable for cyclohexyne with a broad substrate scope and excellent chemoselectivity. Our DFT calculations via distortion/interaction analysis revealed that both stannum&#8211; and hydrogen&#8211;ene reactions with cyclohexyne have later transition states due to their higher distortion energies in the transition states than those in benzyne reactions, which lead to enhanced Pauli repulsion as the decisive factor in the interaction energy accompanied with enlarged energy gap between two types of ene reactions. Therefore, excellent chemoselectivity was disclosed in the cyclohexyne&#8211;ene reaction.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Shizukaol J, Trichloranoid C and Trishizukaol A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through application of a convergent strategy, the asymmetric total synthesis of three oligomeric lindenane sesquiterpenoids has been achieved concisely in 15, 16 and 18 linear steps, respectively. Furthermore, a biological evaluation revealed that two compounds in this study exhibited unexpected toxicity against tumor cell lines, which might be of high interest for pharmaceutical research.







Abstract
The asymmetric total synthesis of three lindenane sesquiterpenoid oligomers, shizukaol J, trichloranoid C and trishizukaol A, has been accomplished concisely in 15, 16 and 18 longest linear steps, respectively. The expeditious construction of molecular architectures was facilitated by Nelson's catalytic asymmetric ketene&#8211;aldehyde cycloaddition, a sequence of allylic alkylation/reduction/acidic cyclization to forge a lactone, and a double aldol condensation cascade to construct the 5/6 bicyclic system. Diastereoselective nucleophilic substitution promoted by a phase transfer catalyst constructed the C11 quaternary stereogenic center, thus prompting synthetic efficacy toward shizukaol J. The synthesis of trichloranoid C and trishizukaol A was achieved after a cascade involving furanyl diene formation and a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, as well as a one&#8208;pot sequence involving furan oxidation and global deprotection. Furthermore, our biological evaluation revealed that two compounds exhibited unexpected toxicity against tumor cell lines.

         <title>Discovery of Two Polymorphs of TiP4N8 Synthesized from Binary Nitrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary TiIV nitridophosphate TiP4N8 has been prepared under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions and subsequent annealing in silica ampoules. DFT calculations confirm the measured band gaps and predict the thermochemistry of two polymorphs. The synthesis of TiP4N8 shows a promising route to new ternary nitrides with semiconducting properties.







Abstract
TiP4N8 was obtained from the binary nitrides TiN and P3N5 upon addition of NH4F as a mineralizer at 8&#8197;GPa and 1400&#8201;&#176;C. An intricate interplay of disorder and polymorphism was elucidated by in situ temperature&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, STEM&#8208;HAADF, and the investigation of annealed samples. This revealed two polymorphs, which consist of dense networks of PN4 tetrahedra (degree of condensation &#954;=0.5) and either augmented triangular TiN7 prisms or triangular TiN6 prisms for &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;TiP4N8, respectively. The structures of TiP4N8 exhibit body&#8208;centered tetragonal (bct) framework topology. DFT calculations confirm the measured band gaps of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;TiP4N8 (1.6&#8211;1.8&#8197;eV) and predict the thermochemistry of the polymorphs in agreement with the experiments.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Stabilized Silylzinc Pivalates for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbosilylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of salt&#8208;stabilized solid silylzinc pivalate prepared from the silyllithium reagents via transmetalation with Zn(OPiv)2 is reported. These silylzinc pivalates showed enhanced air and moisture stability and unique reactivity in the nickel&#8208;catalyzed regioselective alkyl and benzylsilylation of alkenes. Kinetic experiments highlighted the crucial involvement of OPiv&#8208;coordination in improving the reactivity of silylzinc pivalates.







Abstract
We herein report the preparation of solid and salt&#8208;stabilized silylzinc pivalates from the corresponding silyllithium reagents via transmetalation with Zn(OPiv)2. These resulting organosilylzinc pivalates show enhanced air and moisture stability and unique reactivity in the silylative difunctionalization of alkenes. Thus, a practical chelation&#8208;assisted nickel&#8208;catalyzed regioselective alkyl and benzylsilylation of alkenes has been developed, which provides an easy method to access alkyl silanes with broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility. Kinetic experiments highlight that the OPiv&#8208;coordination is crucial to improve the reactivity of silylzinc pivalates. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage functionalizations of druglike molecules and versatile modifications of the products illustrate the synthetical utility of this protocol.

         <title>Reversible Supramolecular Polymorphism in Solution and Solid Matrix by Manipulating Sidegroup Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deterministic approach towards reversible supramolecular polymorphism is presented. By exploiting specific solvent&#8211;solute interactions, perylene bisimide molecules with a trans&#8208;azobenzene sidegroup exhibit a rich diversity of supramolecular polymorphs. The H&#8208;bonding interaction involving azo N atoms can be reversibly modulated using solution temperature and pH, which paves the way for reversible transformation between different polymorphs.







Abstract
Reversible switching between supramolecular polymorphs offers a great way to introduce stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Supramolecular polymorphism is usually achieved through pathway complexity, or by exploiting solvent&#8211;solute interactions. But, steering a self&#8208;assembly along a specific pathway to form a kinetically&#8208;stable aggregate is not easy. Also, changing solvent to switch between polymorphs is impractical. We present a perylene bisimide molecule with a trans&#8208;azobenzene sidegroup that assembles into three supramolecular polymorphs with distinct colors, morphologies, packing and aggregation mechanism. Optical absorption and FTIR spectroscopy reveal the importance of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between protic solvent and azo N that controls the planarity of the azobenzene group and influences molecular packing. This interaction can be further modulated using temperature, and solution pH to reversibly switch between the three polymorphs, in solution as well as in solid silica&#8208;gel matrix.

         <title>Exploring the Circular Polarization Capacity from Chiral Cellulose Nanocrystal Films for a Photo&#8208;Controlled Chiral Helix of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transmitted circularly polarized light (CPL) and CPL emission were obtained from chiral cellulose nanocrystal films, and these CPL&#8208;active materials were applied for the photo&#8208;induced chiral alignment of supramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) is key to asymmetric photochemistry as it could impart the chiral organization information into chemical products. Here, we demonstrate the circular polarization capacity of chiral cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) films to trigger photo&#8208;alignment of achiral supramolecular polymers into helical structures. Right&#8208;handed transmitted (T&#8208;) CPL was generated from self&#8208;assembled CNC films, which induced amorphous azobenzene (Azo) supramolecular polymers into chiral structures. The chiral induction effect of T&#8208;CPL is enhanced on Azo polymers with longer spacers. The absorptive dissymmetry factor (gabs) values of liquid&#8208;crystal supramolecular polymers can be amplified significantly (over 10&#8197;times) after T&#8208;CPL irradiation. Moreover, by integrating carbon dots into CNC films, CPL emission with a considerable luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) up to &#8722;0.66 was achieved, and it could be used for the photo&#8208;alignment of Azo polymers with high chiroptical properties. This work provides new insight for the photo modulation of supramolecular polymers by CPL&#8208;active materials.

&lt;p&gt;Transmitted circularly polarized light (CPL) and CPL emission were obtained from chiral cellulose nanocrystal films, and these CPL-active materials were applied for the photo-induced chiral alignment of supramolecular polymers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized light (CPL) is key to asymmetric photochemistry as it could impart the chiral organization information into chemical products. Here, we demonstrate the circular polarization capacity of chiral cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) films to trigger photo-alignment of achiral supramolecular polymers into helical structures. Right-handed transmitted (T-) CPL was generated from self-assembled CNC films, which induced amorphous azobenzene (Azo) supramolecular polymers into chiral structures. The chiral induction effect of T-CPL is enhanced on Azo polymers with longer spacers. The absorptive dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;) values of liquid-crystal supramolecular polymers can be amplified significantly (over 10&#8197;times) after T-CPL irradiation. Moreover, by integrating carbon dots into CNC films, CPL emission with a considerable luminescence dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) up to &#8722;0.66 was achieved, and it could be used for the photo-alignment of Azo polymers with high chiroptical properties. This work provides new insight for the photo modulation of supramolecular polymers by CPL-active materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;Substituted 1,2&#8208;Amino Alcohols from Simple Aldehydes and Amines by One&#8208;Pot Sequential Enzymatic Hydroxymethylation and Asymmetric Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step enzymatic cascade reaction was developed for the synthesis of N&#8208;substituted chiral 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols from simple aldehydes and amines by coupling hydroxymethylation and reduction amination reactions. This methodology was then applied to rapidly access a key building block of various tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids of pharmaceutical importance.







Abstract
The chiral N&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohol motif is found in many natural and synthetic bioactive compounds. In this study, enzymatic asymmetric reductive amination of &#945;&#8208;hydroxymethyl ketones with enantiocomplementary imine reductases (IREDs) enabled the synthesis of chiral N&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols with excellent ee values (91&#8211;99&#8201;%) in moderate to high yields (41&#8211;84&#8201;%). Furthermore, a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step enzymatic process involving benzaldehyde lyase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxymethylation of aldehydes and subsequent asymmetric reductive amination was developed, offering an environmentally friendly and economical way to produce N&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols from readily available simple aldehydes and amines. This methodology was then applied to rapidly access a key synthetic intermediate of anti&#8208;malaria and cytotoxic tetrahydroquinoline alkaloids.

         <title>Dynamic Full&#8208;Color Tuning of Organic Chromophore in a Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive 2D Flexible MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart luminescent material was constructed by anchoring an organic chromophore into the 2D coordination space of a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework. Thermo&#8208;, piezo&#8208;, and solvato&#8208;fluoro&#8208;chromisms were simultaneously achieved within a single material, featuring dynamic full&#8208;color tunability, excellent reversibility, and linear sensor response.







Abstract
Developing universal stimuli&#8208;responsive materials capable of emitting a broad spectrum of colors is highly desirable. Herein, we deliberately grafted a conformation&#8208;adaptable organic chromophore into the established coordination space of a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). In terms of the coupled structural transformations and the space confinement, the chromophore in the MOF matrix underwent well&#8208;regulated conformational changes under physical and chemical stimuli, simultaneously displaying thermo&#8208;, piezo&#8208;, and solvato&#8208;fluoro&#8208;chromism with color tunability over the visible range. Owing to the resilient nature and the reduced dimensionality of the selected coordination space, all three color modulations behaved in a sensitive and self&#8208;reversible manner, each following a linear correlation of the emission maximum with stimulus. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction of the variable&#8208;temperature structures and solvent&#8208;inclusion crystals elucidated the intricate color varying mechanisms.

         <title>Triphase Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Silver&#8208;Decorated Titanium Oxide at a Gas&#8211;Water Boundary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triphase photocatalytic CO2 reduction system was developed by supporting Ag&#8208;TiO2 nanoparticles at a gas&#8211;water boundary. The as&#8208;formed triphase interface with a hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic abrupt interfacial wettability ensures the fast supply of CO2, contributing to an enhanced CO2 reduction rate and selectivity. The system also shows feasibility in CO2&#8208;diluted conditions, typically hindered by the poor CO2 mass transfer in conventional systems.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive process to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals. But this reaction is often restricted by the poor mass transfer of CO2 in the liquid phase. Here, we have developed a triphase photocatalytic CO2RR system by supporting Ag&#8208;decorated TiO2 nanoparticles at a gas&#8211;water boundary with hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic abrupt interfacial wettability. Such a triphase system allows the rapid delivery of gas&#8208;phase CO2 to the surface of photocatalysts while maintaining an efficient water supply and uncovered active sites. Ag&#8208;TiO2 supported at the gas&#8211;water boundary showed a CO2 reduction rate of 305.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, without hole scavengers, approximately 8 times higher than the nanoparticles dispersed in the liquid phase. Even using diluted CO2 (10&#8201;%) as the reactant, the CO2RR activity was superior to most reported Ag&#8208;TiO2 based photocatalysts using pure CO2. The findings provide a general strategy to promote the interfacial CO2 mass transfer to improve photoactivity and selectivity.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Chemically Responsive Switchable Gas Valves with Protonation&#8208;Induced Liquid Gating Self&#8208;Adaptive Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;adaptive CO2 gas valve composed of chemically responsive liquid gating systems is reported, and the transmembrane critical pressures of the liquid gate vary upon the presence of CO2, due to the superamphiphiles assembled by poly(propylene glycol) bis(2&#8208;aminopropyl ether) and oleic acid in gating liquids that are protonated specifically by CO2.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage technologies are promising to limit CO2 emission from anthropogenic activities, to achieve carbon neutrality goals. CO2 capture requires one to separate CO2 from other gases, and therefore a gas flow system that exhibits discernible gating behaviors for CO2 would be very useful. Here we propose a self&#8208;adaptive CO2 gas valve composed of chemically responsive liquid gating systems. The transmembrane critical pressures of the liquid gate vary upon the presence of CO2, due to the superamphiphiles assembled by poly(propylene glycol) bis(2&#8208;aminopropyl ether) and oleic acid in gating liquids that are protonated specifically by CO2. It is shown that the valve can perform self&#8208;adaptive regulation for specific gases and different concentrations of CO2. This protonation&#8208;induced liquid gating mechanism opens a potential platform for applications of CO2 separators, detectors, sensors and beyond.

         <title>Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Allylation of Glycinate with Switched Chemoselectivity Enabled by Customized Bifunctional Pyridoxal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifunctional chiral pyridoxal derivative 1 with a bigger catalytic cavity than that of previous pyridoxal catalysts promoted direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C allylation of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinates with Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman acetates. In this way, the chemoselectivity for glycinates was switched from intrinsic N&#8208;allylation to &#945;&#8208;C allylation to produce chiral glutamic acid esters with excellent stereoselectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 97&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Owing to the strong nucleophilicity of the NH2 group, free&#8208;NH2 glycinates react with MBH acetates to usually deliver N&#8208;allylated products even in the absence of catalysts. Without protection of the NH2 group, chiral pyridoxal catalysts bearing an amide side chain at the C3 position of the naphthyl ring switched the chemoselectivity of the glycinates from intrinsic N&#8208;allylation to &#945;&#8208;C allylation. The reaction formed chiral multisubstituted glutamic acid esters as SN2&#8242;&#8211;SN2&#8242; products in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 86&#8201;% yield, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 97&#8201;% ee). As compared to pyridoxal catalysts bearing an amide side arm at the C2 position, the pyridoxals in this study have a bigger catalytic cavity to enable effective activation of larger electrophiles, such as MBH acetates and related intermediates. The reaction is proposed to proceed via a cooperative bifunctional catalysis pathway, which accounts for the high level of diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol of the pyridoxal catalysts.

         <title>Ferroelectric Lithography in Single&#8208;Component Organic Enantiomorphic Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of di(benzylamino)&#8208;substituted muconic derived organic enantiomers were discovered as the first muconic&#8208;based ferroelectrics. They show remarkable ferroelectric lithography with the desired domain structure such as the panda&#8208;like one being precisely achieved by applying a local electric field on a predefined pattern in the thin films, which is rarely found in organic ferroelectrics.







Abstract
Organic ferroelectrics are flexible, lightweight, and bio&#8208;friendly, promising for bio&#8208;harmonized electronic devices, while their ferroelectric lithography remains relatively unexplored. Here, by introducing homochirality and ZE photoisomerization, we obtained a pair of organic enantiomorphic ferroelectrics, di(benzylamino)&#8208;substituted derivatives of muconic acids, the first ferroelectrics in the muconic family. Their ferroelectric and chiral features were confirmed by the polarization&#8211;electric field hysteresis loops and circular dichroism spectra, respectively. Piezoresponse force microscopy measurements demonstrate that the desired domain structure can be precisely achieved by applying a local electric field on a predefined pattern in their thin films. Moreover, thermogravimetric analyses reveal that their ferroelectricity can persist up to above 550&#8197;K. The precise pattern lithography and excellent thermal stability make them competitive candidates for ferroelectric lithography.

         <title>From Structural Design to Functional Construction: Amine Molecules in High&#8208;Performance Formamidinium&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural design of amine molecules is effective for functional construction of perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layer in perovskite solar cells. High&#8208;efficiency and robust perovskite solar cells can be achieved through crystal regulation of formamidinium&#8208;based perovskites and improvement of the specific perovskite properties including defect condition, charge transfer, and moisture resistance.







Abstract
Formamidinium (FA) based perovskites are considered as one of the most promising light&#8208;absorbing perovskite materials owing to their narrower band gap and better thermal stability compared to conventional methylammonium&#8208;based perovskites. Constant improvement by using various additives stimulates the potential application of these perovskites. Amine molecules with different structures have been widely used as typical additives in FA&#8208;based perovskite solar cells, and decent performances have been achieved. Thus, a systematic review focusing on structural regulation and functional construction of amines in FA&#8208;based perovskites is of significance. Herein, we analyze the construction mechanism of different structural amines on the functional perovskite crystals. The influence of amine molecules on specific perovskite properties including defect conditions, charge transfer, and moisture resistance are evaluated. Finally, we summarize the design rules of amine molecules for the application in high&#8208;performance FA&#8208;based perovskites and propose directions for the future development of additive molecules.

         <title>Oxidative Coupling of Methane: Examining the Inactivity of the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalyst at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction, the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst enriched with Q2 units in the SiO2 carrier achieves 23&#8201;% CH4 conversion and 72&#8201;% C2&#8211;3 selectivity at 660&#8201;&#176;C. A large number of Q2 units in MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 is a trigger for markedly lowering the light&#8208;off temperature of the Mn3+&#8596;Mn2+ redox cycle because of the easy formation of MnSiO3.







Abstract
Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) catalyzed by MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 has great industrial promise to convert methane directly to C2&#8211;3 products, but its high light&#8208;off temperature is the most challenging obstacle to commercialization and its working mechanism is still a mystery. We report the discovery of a low&#8208;temperature active and selective MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst enriched with Q2 units in the SiO2 carrier, being capable of converting 23&#8201;% CH4 with 72&#8201;% C2&#8211;3 selectivity at 660&#8201;&#176;C. From experiments and theoretical calculations, a large number of Q2 units in the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst is a trigger for markedly lowering the light&#8208;off temperature of the Mn3+&#8596;Mn2+ redox cycle involved in the OCM reaction because of the easy formation of MnSiO3. Notably, the MnSiO3 formation proceeds merely through the SiO2&#8208;involved reaction in the presence of Na2WO4: Mn7SiO12+6&#8201;SiO2&#8596;7&#8201;MnSiO3+1.5&#8201;O2. The Na2WO4 not only drives the light&#8208;off of this cycle but also gets it working with substantial selectivity toward C2&#8211;3 products. Our findings shine a light on the rational design of more advanced MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4 based OCM catalysts through establishing new Mn3+&#8596;Mn2+ redox cycles with lowered light&#8208;off temperature.

         <title>A Highly Fluorescent Dinuclear Aluminium Complex with Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly emissive dinuclear complex based on abundant and cheap aluminium is reported. It features pronounced fluorescence in solution, in the solid state, and when embedded in non&#8208;woven fabrics.







Abstract
The high natural abundance of aluminium makes the respective fluorophores attractive for various optical applications, but photoluminescence quantum yields above 0.7 have yet not been reported for solutions of aluminium complexes. In this contribution, a dinuclear aluminium(III) complex featuring enhanced photoluminescence properties is described. Its facile one&#8208;pot synthesis originates from a readily available precursor and trimethyl aluminium. In solution, the complex exhibits an unprecedented photoluminescence quantum yield near unity (&#934;absolute 1.0&#177;0.1) and an excited&#8208;state lifetime of 2.3&#8197;ns. In the solid state, J&#8208;aggregation and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching are noted, but still quantum yields of 0.6 are observed. Embedding the complex in electrospun non&#8208;woven fabrics yields a highly fluorescent fleece possessing a quantum yield of 0.9&#177;0.04.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclophenacene&#8208; and Chiral&#8208;Type Cyclophenylene&#8208;Naphthylene Belts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a [20]cyclophenacene&#8208;type cyclophenylene&#8208;naphthylene (CPN) belt and the enantioselective synthesis of chiral&#8208;type CPN belts have been achieved by the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of naphthalene&#8208;embedded cyclic polyynes. However, the synthesis of a depth&#8208;expanded CPN belt was unsuccessful. Theoretical calculations clarified that the reactivity depends on the stability of the transition state which is subject to ring strain.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a [20]cyclophenacene&#8208;type cyclophenylene&#8208;naphthylene (CPN) belt and the enantioselective synthesis of chiral&#8208;type CPN belts (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) by the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of naphthalene&#8208;embedded cyclic polyynes. The synthesis of a depth&#8208;expanded CPN belt was also attempted, but the final intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition was unsuccessful. Theoretical calculations clarified that the reactivity depends on the stability of the transition state in the initial oxidative cycloaddition step which is subject to molecular strain. The cylindrical structures of these CPN belts were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. As a result of &#960;&#8208;extension through the introduction of naphthalenes in the chiral&#8208;type CPN belts, the anisotropy dissymmetry factors of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence are amplified compared with the corresponding zigzag&#8208;type chiral cyclophenylene belts.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a diterpene natural product that potentiates the activity of &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and its stereochemical confirmation via X&#8208;ray crystallography is reported. In addition, analog synthesis and subsequent structure&#8211;activity relationship studies propose a mode of action involving mecA and suggest simplification of the scaffold is possible.







Abstract
Over the past decades, antibiotic resistance has grown to a point where orthogonal approaches to combating infections caused by resistant bacteria are needed. One such approach is the development of non&#8208;microbicidal small molecules that potentiate the activity of conventional antibiotics, termed adjuvants. The diterpene natural product 12(S),16&#1013;&#8208;dihydroxycleroda&#8208;3,13&#8208;dien&#8208;15,16&#8208;olide, which we refer to as (&#8722;)&#8208;LZ&#8208;2112, is known to synergize with oxacillin against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). To explore this activity, (&#8722;)&#8208;LZ&#8208;2112 was synthesized and the structure confirmed through X&#8208;ray analysis. Preliminary structure&#8211;activity relationship studies following the synthesis of several analogs identified key structural elements responsible for activity and indicate that scaffold simplification is possible. A preliminary mode of action study suggests mecA plays a role in the adjuvant activity of (&#8722;)&#8208;LZ&#8208;2112.

         <title>Oxidative Additions of C&#8722;F Bonds to the Silanide Anion [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide anion, [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;, digresses from the archetypical proclivity of nucleophilic substitutions, being capable of oxidative additions to aryl&#8208; and alkenylfluorides. Thus, tetraorganofluorosilicate salts devoid of chelating ligands, which had only been observed as reactive intermediates before, were isolated and fully characterized.







Abstract
Compounds exhibiting main group elements in low oxidation states were found to mimic the reactivity of transition metal complexes. Like the latter, such main group species show a proclivity of changing their oxidation state as well as their coordination number by +2, therefore fulfilling the requirements for oxidative additions. Prominent examples of such main group compounds that undergo oxidative additions with organohalides R&#8722;X (R=alkyl, aryl, X=F, Cl, Br, I) are carbenes and their higher congeners. Aluminyl anions, which like carbenes and silylenes oxidatively add to strong &#963;&#8208;bonds in R&#8722;X species, have been recently discovered. We present the first anion based upon a Group 14 element, namely the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide anion, [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;, which is capable of oxidative additions towards C&#8722;F bonds. This enables the isolation of non&#8208;chelated tetraorganofluorosilicate salts, which to the best of our knowledge had only been observed as reactive intermediates before.

         <title>Conjugate&#8208;Driven Electron Density Delocalization of Piperidine Nitroxyl Radical for Stable Aqueous Zinc Hybrid Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acetylamino and imidazole co&#8208;functionalized 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl (MIAcNH&#8208;TEMPO) catholyte for aqueous zinc hybrid flow batteries (AZHFBs) is reported. The &#8220;p&#8211;&#960;&#8221; and &#8220;&#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8221; double&#8208;conjugate structure design delocalizes the electron density of the N&#8722;O head and thus inhibits electrophilic/nucleophilic attacks corresponding to N&#8722;O./+N=O forms. The applied 1.5&#8197;M MIAcNH&#8208;TEMPO&#8208;based AZHFB exhibits a high capacity retention rate of 99.95&#8201;% per day at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Stable and soluble redox&#8208;active nitroxyl radicals are highly desired for high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life aqueous zinc hybrid flow batteries (AZHFBs). Here we report a &#8220;&#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8221; conjugated imidazolium and &#8220;p&#8211;&#960;&#8221; conjugated acetylamino co&#8208;functionalized 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl (MIAcNH&#8208;TEMPO) as stable catholyte for AZHFBs. The incorporation of double&#8208;conjugate substituents could delocalize the electron density of the N&#8722;O head and thus remarkably stabilize the radical and oxoammonium forms of TEMPO, avoiding the side reaction of ring&#8208;opening. Consequently, the applied MIAcNH&#8208;TEMPO/Zn AZHFB demonstrates the hardly time&#8208;dependent stability with a constant capacity retention of 99.95&#8201;% per day over 16.7&#8197;days at a high concentration catholyte of 1.5&#8197;M and high current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This proposed molecular engineering strategy based on electron density regulation of redox&#8208;active structures displays an attractive efficacy and thus represents a remarkable advance in high&#8208;performance AZHFBs.

The &#8220;p&#8211;&#960;&#8221; and &#8220;&#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8221; double-conjugate structure design delocalizes the electron density of the N&#8722;O head and thus inhibits electrophilic/nucleophilic attacks corresponding to N&#8722;O&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;N=O forms. The applied 1.5&#8197;M MIAcNH-TEMPO-based AZHFB exhibits a high capacity retention rate of 99.95&#8201;% per day at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stable and soluble redox-active nitroxyl radicals are highly desired for high-capacity and long-life aqueous zinc hybrid flow batteries (AZHFBs). Here we report a &#8220;&#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8221; conjugated imidazolium and &#8220;p&#8211;&#960;&#8221; conjugated acetylamino co-functionalized 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (MIAcNH-TEMPO) as stable catholyte for AZHFBs. The incorporation of double-conjugate substituents could delocalize the electron density of the N&#8722;O head and thus remarkably stabilize the radical and oxoammonium forms of TEMPO, avoiding the side reaction of ring-opening. Consequently, the applied MIAcNH-TEMPO/Zn AZHFB demonstrates the hardly time-dependent stability with a constant capacity retention of 99.95&#8201;% per day over 16.7&#8197;days at a high concentration catholyte of 1.5&#8197;M and high current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This proposed molecular engineering strategy based on electron density regulation of redox-active structures displays an attractive efficacy and thus represents a remarkable advance in high-performance AZHFBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Osmotic Energy Conversion Enabled by Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Membranes with Record Output Power Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process for simultaneous and direct conversion of energy from the low&#8208;gradient heat and salinity differences into electricity was developed using ionic covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework membranes. A higher membrane charge density enables greater ion&#8208;transport resistance. The optimal thermo&#8208;osmotic energy conversion device offers a power density of 231&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 with a temperature difference.







Abstract
A vast amount of energy can be extracted from the untapped low&#8208;grade heat from sources below 100&#8201;&#176;C and the Gibbs free energy from salinity gradients. Therefore, a process for simultaneous and direct conversion of these energies into electricity using permselective membranes was developed in this study. These membranes screen charges of ion flux driven by the combined salinity and temperature gradients to achieve thermo&#8208;osmotic energy conversion. Increasing the charge density in the pore channels enhanced the permselectivity and ion conductance, leading to a larger osmotic voltage and current. A 14&#8208;fold increase in power density was achieved by adjusting the ionic site population of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes. The optimal COF membrane was operated under simulated estuary conditions at a temperature difference of 60&#8197;K, which yielded a power density of &#8776;231&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2, placing it among the best performing upscaled membranes. The developed system can pave the way to the utilization of the enormous supply of untapped osmotic power and low&#8208;grade heat energy, indicating the tremendous potential of using COF membranes for energy conversion applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Auto&#8208;Tandem Palladium Catalysis for 2,4&#8208;Dienyl Carbonates: Ligand&#8208;Controlled Divergent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diastereodivergent assembly of polyhydro&#8208;1,6&#8208;naphthyridines from o&#8208;TosylNH aldimines and 2,4&#8208;dienyl carbonates has been realized by ligand&#8208;controlled auto&#8208;tandem palladium catalysis, through an N&#8208;allylation, vinylogous addition, &#960;&#8208;&#963;&#8208;&#960; isomerization, and N&#8208;allylation cascade. Further tuning of the ligands even allowed regiodivergent azetidine or chemodivergent &#946;&#8208;H elimination products to be obtained.







Abstract
Developing new asymmetric auto&#8208;tandem catalysis processes, especially in a divergent manner, is highly attractive but extremely challenging. Presented herein is a palladium&#8208;catalyzed auto&#8208;tandem reaction between 2,4&#8208;dienyl carbonates and o&#8208;TsNH arylimines or trifluoroacetophenones that proceeds through a consecutive N&#8208;allylation, vinylogous addition, &#960;&#8208;&#963;&#8208;&#960; isomerization, and another N&#8208;allylation sequence. Importantly, switchable diastereodivergent synthesis could be achieved by tuning the chiral bisphosphine ligands, which led to the construction of a broad spectrum of fused tetrahydroquinoline architectures with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity. Ligand control even enabled effective access to regiodivergent azetidine or chemodivergent &#946;&#8208;H elimination with fair enantioselectivity, further showing the versatility of the current auto&#8208;tandem catalysis.

         <title>Fully Conjugated Tetraoxa[8]circulene&#8208;Based Porous Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraoxa[8]circulenes (TOCs) are a class of hetero[8]circulenes bearing mixed aromatic/antiaromatic motifs. Whereas small molecule TOCs have been investigated experimentally and computationally, polymeric TOCs (pTOCs) have so far only been explored computationally. Herein, the first pTOCs are reported as a new class of low&#8208;band&#8208;gap porous organic semiconductors and their pristine and doped electronic properties are discussed.







Abstract
Tetraoxa[8]circulenes (TOCs) are a class of hetero[8]circulenes featuring a planar cyclooctatetraene core with a mixed aromatic/antiaromatic motif that governs their electronic properties. Polymeric TOCs (pTOCs) have been the subject of several computational simulations because they are predicted to be low&#8208;band&#8208;gap semiconductors, but they have not been available synthetically yet. Here, we report the first example of pTOCs, a new family of porous semiconductors, synthesized under ionothermal conditions through the intermolecular cyclization of 1,4,5,8&#8208;anthracene tetrone. pTOCs are porous, with surface areas up to 1656&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, and exhibit light&#8208;switchable and tunable semiconducting properties.

         <title>Short Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Actinobolin: Simple Entry to Complex Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors of Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bactobolins are complex inhibitors of protein synthesis that target a novel site of the bacterial ribosome. A simple synthetic process by which (&#8722;)&#8208;quinic acid, L&#8208;threonine and L&#8208;alanine are combined to yield (+)&#8208;actinobolin is reported. The modularity of the approach unlocks new possibilities in analog synthesis.







Abstract
We report a concise synthesis of the naturally occurring protein synthesis inhibitor (+)&#8208;actinobolin (1). The densely functionalized and stereochemically complex molecular structure of 1 was assembled from (&#8722;)&#8208;quinic acid, L&#8208;threonine, and L&#8208;alanine as the principal components. Our route is based around a convergent strategy that features conjugate addition of an &#945;&#8208;amino radical in the key fragment&#8208;coupling step. The dramatically simplified synthesis of (+)&#8208;actinobolin proceeding in 9 steps with 18&#8201;% overall yield has practical implications for analog preparation, as demonstrated herein.

         <title>Characterization of Multifunctional and Non&#8208;stereoselective Oxidoreductase RubE7/IstO, Expanding the Functional Diversity of the Flavoenzyme Superfamily</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional, non&#8208;stereoselective FMN&#8208;dependent enzyme, RubE7/IstO, catalyzes both the reduction of three spatially different bonds and dehydrogenation of a tropolone ring. The crystal structure of IstO revealed that a big catalytic pocket permits free rotation of the substrate, resulting in nonselective reduction reactions. Molecular docking and site mutation studies showed that His106 is important for the reversible dehydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes enable a broad range of redox transformations and generally act as monofunctional and stereoselective catalysts. Herein, we report the investigation of a multifunctional and non&#8208;stereoselective FMN&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase RubE7 from the rubrolone biosynthetic pathway.

The crystal structure of IstO (a RubE7 homologue) with 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolution reveals the location of the active site at the interface of two monomers, and the size of active site is large enough to permit both flipping and free rotation of the substrate, resulting in multiple nonselective reduction reactions.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional, non-stereoselective FMN-dependent enzyme, RubE7/IstO, catalyzes both the reduction of three spatially different bonds and dehydrogenation of a tropolone ring. The crystal structure of IstO revealed that a big catalytic pocket permits free rotation of the substrate, resulting in nonselective reduction reactions. Molecular docking and site mutation studies showed that His106 is important for the reversible dehydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Isoselective Hydroformylation of Propylene by Iodide&#8208;Assisted Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The commercially important but elusive isoselective hydroformylation of propylene is reported to undergo readily in the presence of a simple catalytic system consisting of palladium(II) iodide and electron&#8208;rich alkyl phosphines in common solvents and at industrially relevant temperatures. The assistance of the iodide ligands is shown to play a key role in the process by increasing both the isoselectivity and the activity of the catalyst.







Abstract
Isobutanal is a high value bulk material that, in principle, could be produced with 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economy by isoselective hydroformylation of propylene with syngas. However, leading industrial Rh&#8208; and Co&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation methods preferentially form n&#8208;butanal over the iso&#8208;product, and methods offering isoselectivity remain underdeveloped. Here we report an iodide&#8208;assisted Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of propylene that produces isobutanal with unprecedented levels of selectivity. The method involves PdI2, simple alkyl monophosphines, such as tricyclohexylphosphine, and common green solvents, enabling the title reaction to occur with isoselectivity in up to 50&#8201;:&#8201;1 iso/n product ratios under industrially relevant conditions (80&#8211;120&#8201;&#176;C). The catalytic and preliminary mechanistic experiments indicate a key role of the iodide anions in both the catalytic activity and the isoselectivity.

         <title>Phase Separation of Oppositely Charged Polymers Regulates Bioinspired Silicification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired silicification process is reported, which is triggered by the phase separation of oppositely charged polymers. Since ionic strength is controlling the electrostatic phase separation process, it can be used to tune the morphology and structure of the silica precipitates.







Abstract
In nature, simple organisms evolved mechanisms to form intricate biosilica nanostructures, far exceeding current synthetic manufacturing. Based on the properties of extracted biomacromolecules, polycation&#8211;polyanion pairs were suggested as moderators of biosilica formation. However, the chemical principles of this polymer&#8208;induced silicification remain unclear. Here, we used a biomimetic polycation&#8211;polyanion system to study polymer&#8208;induced silicification. We demonstrate that it is the polymer phase separation process, rather than silica&#8211;polymer interactions, which controls silica precipitation. Since ionic strength controls this electrostatic phase separation, it can be used to tune the morphology and structure of the precipitates. In situ cryo electron microscopy highlights the pivotal role of the hydrated polymer condensates in this process. These results pave the road for developing nanoscale morphologies of bioinspired silica based on the chemistry of liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation.

         <title>A Crystalline Partially Fluorinated Triazine Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A partially fluorinated, metal&#8208;free, imine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional triazine covalent organic framework (TF50&#8208;COF) photocatalyst was developed. Fluorine (F)&#8208;substituted and nonsubstituted units were integrated in equimolar amounts on the edge aromatic units, where they mediated two&#8208;electron O2 photoreduction. F&#8208;substitution created an abundance of Lewis acid sites, which regulated the electronic distribution of adjacent carbon atoms and provided highly active sites for O2 adsorption, and widened the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive range of the catalyst, while enhancing charge separation. Varying the proportion of F maximized the interlayer interactions of TF50&#8208;COF, resulting in improved crystallinity with faster carrier transfer and robust photostability. The TF50&#8208;COF catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and stability in O2 photoreduction into H2O2, with a high H2O2 yield rate of 1739 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 5.1% at 400 nm, exceeding the performance of previously reported nonmetal COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to assemble artificial systems that mimic aspects of natural light&#8208;harvesting functions is fascinating and attractive for materials design. Given the complexity of such a system, a simple design pathway is desirable. Here, we argue that associative phase separation of oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can provide such a path in an environmentally benign medium: water. We find that complexation between an exciton&#8208;donor and acceptor CPE leads to formation of a complex fluid. We interrogate exciton transfer from the donor to the acceptor CPE within the complex fluid and find that transfer is highly efficient. We also find that excess molecular ions can tune the modulus of the inter&#8208;CPE complex fluid. Even at high ion concentrations, CPEs remain complexed with significantly delocalized electronic wavefunctions. Our work lays the rational foundation for complex, tunable aqueous light&#8208;harvesting systems via the intrinsic thermodynamics of associative phase separation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxide and anhydride is a powerful strategy for preparing various isotactic polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers. However, the previous binary systems suffered from slow rates at low loadings, poor enantioselectivities and transesterification reactions at enhanced temperatures. Herein, we report novel dinuclear aluminium complexes with multiple chiralities and ammonium salts anchored on ligand frameworks. These bifunctional catalysts exhibit high activities and enantioselectivities for epoxides/anhydrides copolymerizations at harsh conditions via intramolecularly synergistic catalysis, affording polyesters with unprecedented molecular weights and narrow distributions. Notably, no transesterification reactions were observed, significantly different from the binary catalyst/cocatalyst pairs. This study represents a rare example regarding temperature independent asymmetric induction for preparing chiral polymers from achiral monomers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a chiral symmetry breaking method for monoacylated  meso  diols. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of monoacylated 1,4&#8208;anhydroerythritols,  meso  cyclic diols with a  cis  configuration, revealed that the O&#8208;(4&#8208;anisoyl) derivative crystallized as a racemic conglomerate of the  P  2  1  2  1  2  1  crystal system. It was confirmed that the substrate racemized by intramolecular transfer of the acyl group in the presence of a catalytic amount of base. Evaporating the solvent gradually from the solution or Viedma ripening to promote crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization efficiently led to enantiomer crystals. These results provide the first successful example of asymmetric expression and amplification by deracemization of sugar derivatives without an external chemical chiral source. Furthermore, we applied this methodology to acyclic  meso  &#8208;1,2&#8208;diols. Three O&#8208;monoacylated substrates were successfully deracemized to 99% ee by Viedma ripening. We also developed asymmetric desymmetrization of  meso  &#8208;1,2&#8208;diols by combining acylation and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring a Nanochaperone to Regulate &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein misassembly leads to the formation of dysfunctional and toxic molecular species relating to neurodegeneration in Parkinson&#8217;s disease and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Here, we tailored a nanochaperone (&#945;S&#8208;nChap) for &#945;&#8208;synuclein to regulate its assembly. The &#945;S&#8208;nChap is capable of i) specifically recognizing &#945;&#8208;synuclein; ii) dynamically capturing and stabilizing monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and retarding oligomerization; iii) tightly capturing oligomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein to prevent fibrillization; and iv) transporting &#945;&#8208;synuclein oligomers to the lysosomal degradation system. The regulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein assembly by &#945;S&#8208;nChap was studied  in vitro  . Moreover, the role of &#945;S&#8208;nChap preventing &#945;&#8208;synuclein pathology in cells and protecting neurons from apoptosis was investigated. The strategy of tailoring a nanochaperone to regulate aberrant assembly of pathogenic proteins provides important insights into protein misfolding diseases. We foresee that &#945;S&#8208;nChap has therapeutic value for Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</dc:description>

         <title>A high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free rechargeable sodium battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low&#8208;cost and scalable sodium ion (Na&#8208;ion) batteries serve as an ideal alternative to the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. To compensate the shortage of energy density, the most accessible solution is developing a high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free configuration composing a lightweight Al current collector on the anode and a high&#8208;voltage sodiumized cathode. However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high&#8208;voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. Upon the request, a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It successfully suppresses trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5 V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91%). Therefore, we harvest anode&#8208;free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372 W h kg&#8208;1 for 4.0 and 4.25 V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250 cycles) for 4.0 V&#8208;class anode&#8208;free cells and a substantially reduced cost in a sustainable way.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Vibrational Energy Sensors for Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vibrational energy transfer (VET) is emerging as key mechanism for protein functions, possibly playing an important role for energy dissipation, allosteric regulations, and enzyme catalysis. A deep understanding of VET is required to elucidate its role in such processes. Ultrafast vis&#8208;pump/IR&#8208;probe spectroscopy can detect pathways of VET in proteins. However, the requirement of having a VET&#8208;donor and a VET&#8208;sensor installed simultaneously limits the possible targets; to increase their number we compare six infrared labels regarding their utility as VET&#8208;sensors. We compare these labels in terms of their FTIR&#8208;spectra and VET signature in VET&#8208;donor/VET&#8208;sensor dipeptides in different solvents. Furthermore, we incorporated four of these labels in PDZ3, to assess their capabilities in more complex systems. Our results show that different IR&#8208;labels can be used interchangeably, allowing for free choice of the right label depending on the system under investigation and the methods available.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal Bismuth Chalcohalide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a colloidal approach to synthesize bismuth chalcohalide nanocrystals (BiEX NCs, in which E = S, Se and X = Cl, Br, I). Our method yields orthorhombic elongated BiEX NCs, with BiSCl crystallizing in a previously unknown polymorph. The BiEX NCs display composition dependent band gap spanning the visible spectral range and absorption coefficients exceeding 10  5  cm  &#8208;1  . The BiEX NCs show chemical stability at standard laboratory conditions and form colloidal inks in different solvents. These features enable the solution processing of the NCs into robust solid films yielding stable photoelectrochemical current densities under solar&#8208;simulated irradiation. Overall, our versatile synthetic protocol may prove valuable in accessing colloidal metal chalcohalide nanomaterials at large and contributes to establish metal chalcohalides as a promising complement to metal chalcogenides and halides for applied nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing multivalent aptamer&#8208;receptor binding on the cell surface with programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalent interactions of biomolecules play pivotal roles in physiological and pathological settings. Whereas the directionality of the interactions is crucial,&#160;the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic multivalent ligand&#8208;receptor systems generally lack programmable approaches for orthogonal directionality. Here, we report the design of programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (aptPANs) to direct multivalent aptamer&#8208;receptor binding on the cell interface. The positions of the aptamer motifs can be prescribed on tetrahedral DNA frameworks to realize atom&#8208;like orthogonal valence and direction, enabling the construction of multivalent molecules with fixed aptamer copy numbers but different directionality. These directional&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible aptPAN molecules exhibit the adaptability to the receptor distribution on cell surfaces. We demonstrate the high&#8208;affinity tumor cell binding with a linear aptPAN oligomer (~13&#8208;fold improved compared to free aptamers), which leads to ~50% suppression of cell growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Pictet&#8208;Spengler Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides Catalyzed by a Single H&#8208;Bond Donor Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction (PSR) with aldehydes is well known. However, PSR involving ketones as electrophilic partners is far&#8208;less developed. We report herein the first examples of catalytic enantioselective PSR of tryptamines with &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. A new class of easily accessible prolyl&#8208;urea organocatalysts bearing a single H&#8208;bond donor function catalyzes the title reaction to afford 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Kinetic isotope effect using C2&#8208;deuterium labelled tryptamine indicates that the rearomatization of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate&#8208; and the enantioselectivity determining step.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric Pictet-Spengler reaction (PSR) with aldehydes is well known. However, PSR involving ketones as electrophilic partners is far-less developed. We report herein the first examples of catalytic enantioselective PSR of tryptamines with &#945;-ketoamides. A new class of easily accessible prolyl-urea organocatalysts bearing a single H-bond donor function catalyzes the title reaction to afford 1,1-disubstituted tetrahydro-&#946;-carbolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Kinetic isotope effect using C2-deuterium labelled tryptamine indicates that the rearomatization of the pentahydro-&#946;-carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate- and the enantioselectivity determining step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aqueous CO2 Reduction on Si Photocathodes Functionalized by Cobalt Molecular Catalysts/Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising approach for renewable fuel production. We herein report a novel strategy for preparation of hybrid photocathodes by immobilizing molecular cobalt catalysts on TiO2&#8208;protected n+&#8208;p Si electrodes (Si|TiO2) coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Upon loading a composite of CoII(BrqPy) (BrqPy = 4 ,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;2,2:6,2:6,2&#8208;quaterpyridine) catalyst and CNT on Si|TiO2, a stable 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density of &#8208;1.5 mA cm&#8208;2 was sustained over 2 h in neutral aqueous solution with unity Faradaic efficiency and selectivity for CO production at a bias of zero overpotential (&#8208;0.11 V vs. RHE), associated with a turnover frequency (TOFCO) of 2.7 s&#8208;1. Extending the photoelectrocatalysis to 10 h, a remarkable turnover number (TONCO) of 57000 was obtained. The high performance shown here is substantially improved from the previously reported photocathodes relying on covalently anchored catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Protein Modification with Reducing Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein glycosylation plays critical roles in many biological processes. However, the fundamental study and application of glycobiology are hindered by the heterogeneousness of oligosaccharides in natural glycoproteins and the difficulty in constructing glycoproteins of human design. Herein, we describe a semisynthetic method to site&#8208;specifically modify proteins with reducing carbohydrates. The method involves the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified aspartate, which was subsequently quantitatively converted into alanine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydrazide (A&#946;z), and chemoselective conjugation of A&#946;z with a range of readily available reducing carbohydrates. The resulting A&#946;z&#8208;linked GlcNAc is a close mimic of native N&#8208;GlcNAc and could be installed on various proteins, including IL&#8208;17A and RNase A. Notably, A&#946;z&#8208;linked GlcNAc on proteins reacted with biantennary oligosaccharide oxazoline derivatives through endoglycosidase&#8208;catalyzed transglycosylation reactions to enable the assembly of homogeneous glycans on proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Optimization of Compositions of High&#8208;entropy Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy oxides are oxides consisting of five or more metals incorporated in a single lattice, and the large composition space suggests that properties of interest can be readily optimised. For applications within catalysis, the different local atomic environments result in a distribution of binding energies for the catalytic intermediates. Using the oxygen evolution reaction on the rutile (110) surface as example, here we outline a strategy for the theoretical optimization of the composition. Density functional theory calculations performed for a limited number of sites are used to fit a model that predicts the reaction energies for all possible local atomic environments. Two reaction pathways are considered; the conventional pathway on the coordinatively unsaturated sites and an alternative pathway involving transfer of protons to a bridging oxygen. An explicit model of the surface is constructed to describe the interdependency of the two pathways and identify the composition that maximizes catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization and Hydrogenation of Carbon Chains Derived from CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective reactions that combine H  2  , CO and organic electrophiles (aldehyde, ketones, isocyanide) to form hydrogenated C  3  and C  4  carbon chains are reported. These reactions proceed by CO homologation mediated by [W(CO)  6  ] and an aluminum(I) reductant, followed by functionalization and hydrogenation of the chain ends. A combination of kinetics (rates, KIEs) and DFT calculations has been used to gain insight into a key step which involves hydrogenation of a metallocarbene intermediate. These findings expand the extremely small scope of systems that combine H  2  and CO to make well&#8208;defined products with complete control over chain length and functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Total Synthesis of Erectones A and B, and the Revised Structure of Hyperelodione D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of biomimetic synthesis seeks to apply biosynthetic hypotheses to the efficient construction of complex natural products. This approach can also guide the revision of incorrectly assigned structures. Herein, we describe the evolution of a concise total synthesis and structural reassignment of hyperelodione D, a tetracyclic meroterpenoid derived from a  Hypericum  plant, alongside some biogenetically related natural products, erectones A and B. The key step in the synthesis of hyperelodione D forms six stereocentres and three rings in a bioinspired cascade reaction that features an intermolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, an intramolecular Prins reaction and a terminating cycloetherification.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling to access medicinally relevant di(hetero)arylmethanes is reported.&#160;The method is reductant&#8208;free, and involves a sulfinate transfer reagent and a Pd&#8208;catalyst mediating the union of two electrophilic coupling partners; a (hetero)aryl halide and a benzyl halide. We establish for the first time that benzyl sulfinates, generated&#160;in situ, undergo efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with (hetero)aryl halides to generate di(hetero)arylmethanes. The reaction can be extended to benzylic pseudohalides derived from benzyl alcohols.The reactions are straightforward to perform and scalable, and&#160;all reaction components are commercially available.</dc:description>

The combination of three natural product fragments in 20&#8208;membered macrocyclic pseudo&#8208;natural products led to the discovery of inducers of a novel LC3 lipidation phenotype.







Abstract
Design and synthesis of pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) through recombination of natural product (NP) fragments in unprecedented arrangements enables the discovery of novel biologically relevant chemical matter. With a view to wider coverage of NP&#8208;inspired chemical and biological space, we describe the combination of this principle with macrocycle formation. PNP&#8208;macrocycles were synthesized efficiently in a stereoselective one&#8208;pot procedure including the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of different dipolarophiles with dimeric cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived azomethine ylides formed in situ. The 20&#8208;membered bis&#8208;cycloadducts embody 18 stereocenters and an additional fragment&#8208;sized NP&#8208;structure. After further functionalization, a collection of 163 macrocyclic PNPs was obtained. Biological investigation revealed potent inducers of the lipidation of the microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) protein, which plays a prominent role in various autophagy&#8208;related processes.

With a view to wider coverage of NP-inspired chemical and biological space, we describe the combination of this principle with macrocycle formation. PNP-macrocycles were synthesized efficiently in a stereoselective one-pot procedure including the 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions of different dipolarophiles with dimeric cinchona alkaloid-derived azomethine ylides formed in situ. The 20-membered bis-cycloadducts embody 18 stereocenters and an additional fragment-sized NP-structure. After further functionalization, a collection of 163 macrocyclic PNPs was obtained.

         <title>Shape Permanence in Diarylethene&#8208;Functionalized Liquid&#8208;Crystal Elastomers Facilitated by Thiol&#8208;Anhydride Dynamic Chemistry</title>

Diarylethene is incorporated in liquid&#8208;crystalline elastomers to generate phototropic deformation upon exposure to UV light. Thiol&#8208;anhydride bonds within the network structure allow for alignment of the liquid crystalline elastomer and shape retention after initial deformation.







Abstract
Diarylethene&#8208;functionalized liquid&#8208;crystalline elastomers (DAE&#8208;LCEs) containing thiol&#8208;anhydride bonds were prepared and shown to undergo reversible, reprogrammable photoinduced actuation. Upon exposure to UV light, a monodomain DAE&#8208;LCE generated 5.5&#8201;% strain. This photogenerated strain was demonstrated to be optically reversible over five cycles of alternating UV/Visible light exposure with minimal photochrome fatigue. The incorporation of thiol&#8208;anhydride dynamic bonds allowed for retention of actuated states. Further, re&#8208;programming of the nematic director was achieved by heating above the temperature for bond exchange to occur (70&#8201;&#176;C) yet below the nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) such that order was maintained between mesogens. The observed thermal stability of each of the diarylethene isomers of over 72&#8197;h allowed for decoupling of photo&#8208;induced processes and polymer network effects, showing that both polymer relaxation and back&#8208;isomerization of the diarylethene contributed to LCE relaxation over a period of 12&#8197;hours after actuation unless bond exchange occurred.

         <title>Passerini&#8211;Smiles Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Ketophosphonates: Platform for Phospha&#8208;Brook/Smiles Embedded Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>

Passerini&#8211;Smiles reactions of &#945;&#8208;ketophosphonates with 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;nitrophenols afford substrates for complex cascades tuned by further Smiles, Truce&#8211;Smiles and phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangements. DFT studies confirm the proposed reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
The Passerini&#8211;Smiles reactions of &#945;&#8208;ketophosphonates with nitrophenols has been used as a platform to observe complex cascades involving multiple Smiles transfers coupled with phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. When using 4&#8208;nitrophenols a rare 1,3&#8208;Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is observed leading to diarylacetamide derivatives. 2&#8208;Nitro&#8208;derivatives lead to a completely different reactivity pattern that may be explained by a nitro to nitroso conversion followed by a &#963;&#8211;&#960; metathesis. All mechanistic assumptions are confirmed by DFT calculations performed on both families of adducts. The potential of this work has been further demonstrated by the use of N&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;ketoamides as alternative starting materials for these cascades as well as the disclosure of new aza&#8208;Nazarov access to hydroxy&#8208;indolones.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Mediated Enantioselective Photoredox Allylation of Aldehydes with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical stereoselective photoredox nickel&#8208;mediated allylation of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes is reported (89&#8211;94&#8201;% e.e.). The reaction proceeds under visible&#8208;light irradiation using the available organic dye 3DPAFIPN as photocatalyst in combination with a chiral IndaBOX nickel complex and Hantzsch's ester; that is, replacing stoichiometric metal reductants such as Zn and Mn.







Abstract
Here we report a practical, highly enantioselective photoredox allylation of aldehydes mediated by chiral nickel complexes with commercially available allyl acetate as the allylating agent. The methodology allows the clean stereoselective allylation of aldehydes in good to excellent yields and up to 93&#8201;% e.e. using a catalytic amount of NiCl2(glyme) in the presence of the chiral aminoindanol&#8208;derived bis(oxazoline) as the chiral ligand. The photoredox system is constituted by the organic dye 3DPAFIPN and a Hantzsch's ester as the sacrificial reductant. The reaction proceeds under visible&#8208;light irradiation (blue LEDs, 456&#8197;nm) at 8&#8211;12&#8201;&#176;C. Compared to other published procedures, no metal reductants (such as Zn or Mn), additives (e.g. CuI) or air&#8208;sensitive Ni(COD)2 are necessary for this reaction. Accurate DFT calculations and photophysical experiments have clarified the mechanistic picture of this stereoselective allylation reaction.

         <title>A Br&#248;nsted Acidic Gallium Hydride: Facile Interconversion of NNNN&#8208;Macrocycle Supported [GaI]+ and [GaIIIH]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of an NNNN&#8208;macrocycle chelated gallium(I) cation provides a rare dicationic gallium(III) hydride. This process is easily reversed by treatment of the Br&#248;nsted acidic (pKa=24.5) hydride with a neutral base. Similar facile redox cycling was not observed for analogous aluminium, indium, or thallium systems.







Abstract
Protonolysis of [Cp*M] (M=Ga, In, Tl) with [(Me4TACD)H][BAr4Me] (Me4TACD=N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane; [BAr4Me]&#8722;=[B{C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;(CH3)2}4]&#8722;) provided monovalent salts [(Me4TACD)M][BAr4Me], whereas [Cp*Al]4 yielded trivalent [(Me4TACD)AlH][BAr4Me]2. Protonation of [(Me4TACD)Ga][BAr4Me] with [Et3NH][BAr4Me] gave an unusually acidic (pKa(CH3CN)=24.5) gallium(III) hydride dication [(Me4TACD)GaH][BAr4Me]2. Deprotonation with IMe4 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;ylidene) returned [(Me4TACD)Ga][BAr4Me]. These reversible processes occur with formal two&#8208;electron oxidation and reduction of gallium. DFT calculations suggest that gallium(I) protonation is facilitated by strong coordination of the tetradentate ligand, which raises the HOMO energy. High nuclear charge of [(Me4TACD)GaH]2+ facilitates hydride&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer during deprotonation. Attempts to prepare a gallium(III) dihydride cation resulted in spontaneous dehydrogenation to [(Me4TACD)Ga]+.

&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Protonation of [(Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TACD)Ga][BAr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;] with [Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH][BAr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;] gave an unusually acidic (p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)=24.5) gallium(III) hydride dication [(Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TACD)GaH][BAr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Deprotonation with IMe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1,3,4,5-tetramethyl-imidazol-ylidene) returned [(Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TACD)Ga][BAr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;]. These reversible processes occur with formal two-electron oxidation and reduction of gallium. DFT calculations suggest that gallium(I) protonation is facilitated by strong coordination of the tetradentate ligand, which raises the HOMO energy. High nuclear charge of [(Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TACD)GaH]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; facilitates hydride-to-metal charge transfer during deprotonation. Attempts to prepare a gallium(III) dihydride cation resulted in spontaneous dehydrogenation to [(Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TACD)Ga]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Polymer Network with Distinctive Topology Transformations for Shape&#8208; and Molecular Architecture Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic covalent polymer network was designed to allow independent programming of the macroscopic shape and mechanical properties via two orthogonal topological transformations.







Abstract
Bond exchange in a typical dynamic covalent polymer network allows access to macroscopic shape reconfigurability, but the network architecture is not altered. An alternative possibility is that the network architecture can be designed to switch to various topological states corresponding to different material properties. Achieving both in one network can expand the material scope, but their intrinsically conflicting mechanisms make it challenging. We design a dynamic covalent network that can undergo two orthogonal topological transformations, namely transesterification on the branched chains and olefin metathesis on the mainframe. This allows independent control of the macroscopic shape and molecular architecture. With this design, we illustrate a bottlebrush network with programmable shape and spatially definable mechanical properties. Our strategy paves a way to on&#8208;demand regulation of network polymers.

         <title>Raman Fiber Photometry for Understanding Mitochondrial Superoxide Burst and Extracellular Calcium Ion Influx upon Acute Hypoxia in the Brain of Freely Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective non&#8208;metallic Raman probe and Raman fiber photometry were developed, for simultaneous real&#8208;time quantitation of mitochondrial O2.&#8722;, Ca2+ and pH at the same location in six brain regions of free&#8208;moving animal. Using our powerful tools, it was discovered that hypoxic brain injury was caused by O2.&#8722;&#8208;induced mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, which was regulated by ASIC1a, and the overload Ca2+ came from influx of extracellular Ca2+.







Abstract
Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneous quantitation of multiple molecules in mitochondria across the whole brain of freely moving animals is the key bottleneck for understanding the physiological and pathological roles that mitochondria play in the brain events. Here we built a Raman fiber photometry, and created a highly selective non&#8208;metallic Raman probe based on the triple&#8208;recognition strategies of chemical reaction, charge transfer, and characteristic fingerprint peaks, for tracking and simultaneous quantitation of mitochondrial O2.&#8722;, Ca2+ and pH at the same location in six brain regions of free&#8208;moving animal upon hypoxia. It was found that mitochondrial O2.&#8722;, Ca2+ and pH changed from superficial to deep brain regions upon hypoxia. It was discovered that hypoxia&#8208;induced mitochondrial O2.&#8722; burst was regulated by ASIC1a, leading to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and acidification. Furthermore, we found the overload of mitochondrial Ca2+ was mostly attributed to the influx of extracellular Ca2+.

         <title>Ligand Engineering toward the Trade&#8208;Off between Stability and Activity in Cluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diphenylphosphonate&#8208;protected silver nanoclusters, [Ag21(H2BTCA)3(O2PPh2)6]SbF6 (1) and [Ag21(C&#8801;CC6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;R2)6(O2PPh2)10]SbF6 (2), have identical icosahedral kernels but different number of free electrons. Cluster 2 exhibits much higher activity than the more stable 1 in the catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol. This work shows that the electronic structures of metal nanoclusters can be modulated via different combinations of ligands.







Abstract
We report the structures, stability and catalysis properties of two Ag21 nanoclusters, namely [Ag21(H2BTCA)3(O2PPh2)6]SbF6 (1) and [Ag21(C&#8801;CC6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;R2)6(O2PPh2)10]SbF6 (2) (H4BTCA=p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene, R=OMe). Both Ag21 structures possess an identical icosahedral kernel that is surrounded by eight peripheral Ag atoms. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis and ESI&#8208;MS revealed that 1 is an 8&#8208;electron cluster and 2 has four free electrons. Theoretical results show that the P&#8208;symmetry orbitals are found as HOMO&#8208;1 and HOMO states in 1, and the frontier unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2) show D&#8208;character, indicating 1 is a superatomic cluster with an electronically closed shell 1S21P6, while 2 has an incomplete shell configuration 1S21P2. These two Ag21 clusters show superior stability under ambient conditions, and 1 is robust even at 90&#8201;&#176;C in toluene and under oxidative conditions (30&#8201;% H2O2). Significantly, 2 exhibits much higher activity than 1 as catalyst in the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol. This work demonstrates that ligands can influence the electronic structures of silver clusters, and further affect their stability and catalytic performance.

         <title>Sensitive Logic Nanodevices with Strong Response for Weak Inputs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a &#8220;weak&#8208;inputs&#8208;strong&#8208;outputs&#8221; strategy was proposed to guide the construction of different sensitive logic nanodevices that have a strong response for weak input signals by coupling an input&#8208;induced reversible DNA computing platform with a hybridization chain reaction&#8208;based signal amplifier.







Abstract

         <title>Synergy Effect of a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Ionic Compound: Dual Interfacial Energy Level Regulation and Passivation to Promote Voc and Stability of Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic multifunctional additive (QAPyBF4) was developed and introduced into perovskite solar cells (PSCs). QAPyBF4 passivated defect states in the perovskite layer, adjusted energy level alignment at the perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interfaces, and prevented the decomposition of perovskite crystals. Therefore, a planar PSC with QAPyBF4 delivered an efficiency of 23.1&#8201;% with a remarkable Voc of 1.2&#8197;V and operational stability.







Abstract
Defects and energy offsets at the bulk and heterojunction interfaces of perovskite are detrimental to the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed an amphiphilic &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic compound (QAPyBF4), implementing simultaneous defects passivation and interface energy level alignments. The p&#8208;type conjugated cations passivated the surface trap states and optimized energy alignment at the perovskite/hole transport layer. The highly electronegative [BF4]&#8722; enriched at the SnO2 interface featured desired band alignment due to the dipole moment of this interlayer. The planar n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSC had an efficiency of 23.1&#8201;% with Voc of 1.2&#8197;V. Notably, the synergy effect elevated the intrinsic endothermic decomposition temperature of the perovskite. The modified devices showed excellent long&#8208;term thermal (85&#8201;&#176;C) and operational stability at the maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h at 45&#8201;&#176;C under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination with no appreciable efficiency loss.

A cyanide&#8208;bridged mixed&#8208;valence chain complex of {[(Tp)Fe(CN)3]2Co(BIT)}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;CH3OH (1; Tp=hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate and BIT=3,4&#8208;bis&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)thiophene) was synthesized by assembling asymmetric electron transfer&#8208;active {Fe2Co} units with BIT ligands. It showed reversible multi&#8208;phase transitions accompanied by photo&#8208;switchable single&#8208;chain magnet properties and a dielectric anomaly.







Abstract
Manipulation of multi&#8208;functions in molecular materials is promising for future switching and memory devices, although it is currently difficult. Herein, we assembled the asymmetric {Fe2Co} unit into a cyanide&#8208;bridged mixed&#8208;valence chain {[(Tp)Fe(CN)3]2Co(BIT)}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3OH (1) (Tp=hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate and BIT=3,4&#8208;bis&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)thiophene), which showed reversible multi&#8208;phase transitions accompanied by photo&#8208;switchable single&#8208;chain magnet properties and a dielectric anomaly. Variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray structural studies revealed thermo&#8208; and photo&#8208;induced selective electron transfer (ET) between the Co and one of the Fe ions. Alternating&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility studies revealed that 1 displayed on and off single&#8208;chain magnet behavior by alternating 946&#8208;nm and 532&#8208;nm light irradiation. A substantial anomaly in the dielectric constant was discovered during the electron transfer process, which is uncommon in similar ET complexes. These findings illustrate that 1 provided a new platform for multi&#8208;phase transitions and multi&#8208;switches adjusted by selective metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal ET.

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Encoded Integration of Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is reported that integrates silica&#8208;metal (Au/Ag) heterostructures by programming the density and length of protruding dsDNA strands on a DNA origami template. The binding energy differences between silica/metal clusters and DNA molecules achieve a heterogeneous integration process.







Abstract
Integrating dissimilar materials at the nanoscale is crucial for modern electronics and optoelectronics. The structural DNA nanotechnology provides a universal platform for precision assembly of materials; nevertheless, heterogeneous integration of dissimilar materials with DNA nanostructures has yet to be explored. We report a DNA origami&#8208;encoded strategy for integrating silica&#8208;metal heterostructures. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal distinctive mechanisms for the binding and aggregation of silica and metal clusters on protruding double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) strands that are prescribed on the DNA origami template. In particular, the binding energy differences of silica/metal clusters and DNA molecules underlies the accessibilities of dissimilar material areas on DNA origami. By programming the densities and lengths of protruding dsDNA strands on DNA origami, silica and metal materials can be independently deposited at their predefined areas with a high vertical precision of 2&#8197;nm. We demonstrate the integration of silica&#8208;gold and silica&#8208;silver heterostructures with high site addressability. This DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy is thus applicable for integrating various types of dissimilar materials, which opens up new routes to bottom&#8208;up electronics.

         <title>Fluorescence Colour Control in Perylene&#8208;Labeled Polymer Chains Trapped by Nanotextured Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical tweezer technique using nanotextured Si (black&#8208;Si) can efficiently trap polymer chains. By increasing the laser intensity, the local concentration of perylene&#8208;labelled water&#8208;soluble polymer chains increased inside the trapping potential. Accordingly, the excimer fluorescence of perylene increased while the monomer fluorescence decreased. Based on the behaviour, we can control the fluorescence colour; blue, green, yellow&#8208;green, yellow, and orange.







Abstract
The ability to modulate, tune, and control fluorescence colour has attracted much attention in photonics&#8208;related research fields. Thus far, it has been impossible to achieve fluorescence colour control (FCC) for material with a fixed structure, size, surrounding medium, and concentration. Here, we propose a novel approach to FCC using optical tweezers. We demonstrate an optical trapping technique using nanotextured Si (black&#8208;Si) that can efficiently trap polymer chains. By increasing the laser intensity, the local concentration of perylene&#8208;labelled water&#8208;soluble polymer chains increased inside the trapping potential. Accordingly, the excimer fluorescence of perylene increased while the monomer fluorescence decreased, evidenced by a fluorescence colour change from blue to orange. Using nanostructure&#8208;assisted optical tweezing, we demonstrate control of the relative intensity ratio of fluorescence of the two fluorophores, thus showing remote and reversible FCC of the polymer assembly.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Deuteration of Benzylic C&#8211;H Bonds via Reversible &#951;6&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel rhodium&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange of primary, secondary, and tertiary benzylic C&#8722;H bonds by means of an &#951;6&#8208;coordination strategy is reported. The method, which features high regioselectivity and stereoretention, shows broad functional group tolerance and has been used in late&#8208;stage labeling of pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
We report a convenient method for benzylic H/D exchange of a wide variety of substrates bearing primary, secondary, or tertiary C&#8722;H bonds via a reversible &#951;6&#8208;coordination strategy. A doubly cationic [CpCF3RhIII]2+ catalyst that serves as an arenophile facilitates deprotonation of inert benzylic hydrogen atoms (pKa&gt;40 in DMSO) without affecting other hydrogen atoms, such as those on aromatic rings or in &#945;&#8208;positions of carboxylate groups. Notably, the H/D exchange reactions feature high stereoretention. We demonstrated the potential utility of this method by using it for deuterium labeling of ten pharmaceuticals and their analogues.

         <title>Master of Chaos and Order: Opposite Microstructures of PCL&#8208;co&#8208;PGA&#8208;co&#8208;PLA Accessible by a Single Catalyst**

Opposite microstructures accessible by a single catalyst: An iron guanidine complex produces defined block copolymers of lactide, &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone and glycolide under solvent&#8208;free conditions at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Increasing the reaction temperature leads to enhanced transesterifications producing random&#8208;like copolymers. &#1013;&#8208;Caprolactone was identified as crucial driver to obtain polymer chains with highly dispersed repeating unit distributions.







Abstract
One catalyst, two reaction set&#8208;ups, three monomers and unlimited macromolecular microstructural designs: The iron guanidine complex [FeCl2(TMG5NMe2asme)] (1) polymerizes lactide faster than the industrially used Sn(Oct)2 and shows high activity towards glycolide and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone. Its distinguished features enable the synthesis of both block and random&#8208;like copolymers in the melt by a simple change of the polymerization set&#8208;up. Sequential addition of monomers yields highly ordered block copolymers including the symmetrical PLA&#8208;b&#8208;PGA&#8208;b&#8208;PCL&#8208;b&#8208;PGA&#8208;b&#8208;PLA pentablock copolymers, while polymerizations of monomer mixtures feature enhanced transesterifications and pave the way to di&#8208; and terpolymers with highly dispersed repeating unit distributions. A robust catalyst active under industrially applicable conditions and producing copolymers with desired microstructures is a major step towards biocompatible polymers with tailor&#8208;made properties as alternatives for traditional plastics on the way towards a sustainable, circular material flow.

         <title>Modular Halogenation, &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation, and Acylation by a Remarkably Versatile Polyketide Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oocydin&#8208;type complex polyketides feature a wide array of structural moieties, resembling the versatility of a Swiss army knife. These include a vinyl chloride, vicinal bis&#8208;oxygens, an O&#8208;acetylation, and other features. Here it is shown that a functionally greatly expanded polyketide synthase with numerous non&#8208;canonical features assembles these compounds entirely in a modular fashion.







Abstract
Bacterial multimodular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large enzymatic assembly lines that synthesize many bioactive natural products of therapeutic relevance. While PKS catalysis is mostly based on fatty acid biosynthetic principles, polyketides can be further diversified by post&#8208;PKS enzymes. Here, we characterized a remarkably versatile trans&#8208;acyltransferase (trans&#8208;AT) PKS from Serratia that builds structurally complex macrolides via more than ten functionally distinct PKS modules. In the oocydin PKS, we identified a new oxygenation module that &#945;&#8208;hydroxylates polyketide intermediates, a halogenating module catalyzing backbone &#947;&#8208;chlorination, and modular O&#8208;acetylation by a thioesterase&#8208;like domain. These results from a single biosynthetic assembly line highlight the expansive biochemical repertoire of trans&#8208;AT PKSs and provide diverse modular tools for engineered biosynthesis from a close relative of E.&#8197;coli.

         <title>Surface Modification of Nano&#8208;Cu2O for Controlling CO2 Electrochemical Reduction to Ethylene and Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) with controllable production of important carbon resources was achieved by a surface modification strategy of nano&#8208;Cu2O catalysts. Through facet controlling the highest C2H4 selectivity among Cu2O&#8208;based catalysts was achieved, while the products were completely converted to syngas with an appropriate H2:CO ratio via a MOF coating on the surface of the nano&#8208;Cu2O.







Abstract
In the surroundings of carbon neutrality, nano&#8208;Cu2O is considered a promising catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR), whose improvements in product selectivity still require considerable efforts. Here, we present an efficient strategy for controlling the ECO2RR product by modifying the surface of nano&#8208;Cu2O, i.e., by controlling the exposed facets via a reductant&#8208;controlled method to achieve the highest C2H4 selectivity (Faradic efficiency=74.1&#8201;%) for Cu2O&#8208;based catalysts in neutral electrolytes, and introducing a well&#8208;suited metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) coating on the surface of nano&#8208;Cu2O to obtain syngas completely with an appropriate H2:CO ratio. Detailed mechanism and key intermediate have been illustrated by DFT calculations. Our systematic strategy is expected to control the ECO2RR product, improve the selectivity, and provide a reliable method for CO2 management and the green production of important carbon resources.

</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quinolizine restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV)&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) system was constructed and used to visualize both single&#8208;molecule motion and macroscopic molecular motion.

Molecular motions are ubiquitous in nature and they immutably play intrinsic roles in all actions. However, exploring appropriate models to decipher molecular motions is an extremely important but very challenging task for researchers. Considering aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens possess their unique merits to visualize molecular motions, it is particularly fascinating to construct new AIE systems as models to study molecular motion. Herein, a novel quinolizine (QLZ) AIE system was constructed based on the restriction intramolecular vibration (RIV) mechanism. It was demonstrated that QLZ could act as an ideal model to visualize single&#8208;molecule motion and macroscopic molecular motion via fluorescence change. Additionally, further elaborate tailoring of this impressive core achieved highly efficient reactive oxygen species production and realized fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy applications, which confirms the great application potential of this new AIE&#8208;active QLZ core. Therefore, this work not only provides an ideal model to visualize molecular motion but also opens a new way for the application of AIEgens.

         <title>Deoxygenative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aromatic Amides with Polyfluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An attractive deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of amides with polyfluoroarenes was successfully achieved. Aromatic amides act as readily available carbene precursors through a Sm/SmI2&#8208;mediated deoxygenation process, and the insertion of the carbene into the C&#8722;H bond of polyfluoroarene affords architecturally complex and functionally diverse &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines in a single step.







Abstract
Considering the ubiquitous nature and ready synthesis of amides, and the great significance of organofluorine&#8208;containing species, the cross&#8208;coupling of amides and polyfluoroarenes, leading to new carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming methodologies, would find useful applications in synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and rapid generation of molecular diversity. Herein, we present a novel synthesis of &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines via Sm/SmI2&#8208;mediated deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of aromatic amides with polyfluoroarenes through direct C&#8722;H functionalization. The structural and functional diversity of these readily available precursors provides a versatile and flexible strategy for the streamlined synthesis of &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines. Combining experimental and theoretical studies, a novel plausible mechanism of the &#945;&#8208;aminocarbene&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H insertion has been revealed, which may stimulate future work for the development of novel methods in amine synthesis.

         <title>Systematic Interrogation of Cellular Signaling in Live Cells Using a Membrane&#8208;Anchored DNA Multitasking Processor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cell membrane&#8208;anchored DNA multitasking processor acting as a &#8220;traffic light&#8221; for interrogation of cellular signaling is reported. Enhanced and controllable modulation of c&#8208;Met signaling was achieved by membrane&#8208;anchoring of a DNA processor. The multitasking capability of the DNA processor allowed monitoring signaling change directly, providing a powerful chemical tool for fundamental cell biology research and precision medical applications.







Abstract
Systematic interrogation of correlative signaling components in their native environment is of great interest for dissecting sophisticated cellular signaling. However, it remains a challenge because of the lack of versatile and effective approaches. Herein, we propose a cell membrane&#8208;anchored DNA multitasking processor acting as a &#8220;traffic light&#8221; for integrated analyses of cellular signal transduction. Enhanced and controllable inhibition of c&#8208;Met signaling was achieved by membrane&#8208;anchoring of DNA processors. Moreover, the multitasking capability of the DNA processor allowed the monitoring of correlative VEGF secretion induced by c&#8208;Met activity regulation directly. By exploiting versatile aptameric nucleic acids, this modular designed DNA multitasking processor dissected how cell surface receptors coordinated with related components in live cells systematically. Therefore, it provides a powerful chemical tool for both fundamental cell biology research and precision medicine applications.

         <title>Transforming Escherichia coli Proteomembranes into Artificial Chloroplasts Using Molecular Photocatalysis</title>

Two cofactors: Like the chloroplasts of green plants, a hybrid system consisting of heterodinuclear photocatalysts and inverted E. coli vesicles generates reduced nicotinamides and adenosine triphosphate simultaneously.







Abstract
During the light&#8208;dependent reaction of photosynthesis, green plants couple photoinduced cascades of redox reactions with transmembrane proton translocations to generate reducing equivalents and chemical energy in the form of NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate), respectively. We mimic these basic processes by combining molecular ruthenium polypyridine&#8208;based photocatalysts and inverted vesicles derived from Escherichia coli. Upon irradiation with visible light, the interplay of photocatalytic nicotinamide reduction and enzymatic membrane&#8208;located respiration leads to the simultaneous formation of two biologically active cofactors, NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and ATP, respectively. This inorganic&#8208;biologic hybrid system thus emulates the cofactor delivering function of an active chloroplast.

         <dc:description>
The development of substrate mimetics for an asparaginyl ligase, a highly efficient transpeptidase, including a C&#8208;terminal reversed sequence mimetic of the native N&#8208;terminal substrate is reported. This retro substrate mimetic can be introduced onto recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides, enabling enzyme&#8208;catalyzed protein or peptide C&#8208;to&#8208;C ligation.







Abstract
Transpeptidase&#8208;catalyzed protein and peptide modifications have been widely utilized for generating conjugates of interest for biological investigation or therapeutic applications. However, all known transpeptidases are constrained to ligating in the N&#8208;to&#8208;C orientation, limiting the scope of attainable products. Here, we report that an engineered asparaginyl ligase accepts diverse incoming nucleophile substrate mimetics, particularly when a means of selectively quenching the reactivity of byproducts released from the recognition sequence is employed. In addition to directly catalyzing formation of l&#8208;/d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;amino acid junctions, we find C&#8208;terminal Leu&#8208;ethylenediamine (Leu&#8208;Eda) motifs to be bona fide mimetics of native N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;Leu sequences. Appending a C&#8208;terminal Leu&#8208;Eda to synthetic peptides or, via an intein&#8208;splicing approach, to recombinant proteins enables direct transpeptidase&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;to&#8208;C ligations. This work significantly expands the synthetic scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed protein transpeptidation reactions.

         <title>Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO by In Situ Formation of a Hybrid Catalytic System Based on Molecular Iron Quaterpyridine Covalently Linked to Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent&#8208;linked C3N4&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;decorated iron quaterpyridine hybrid catalyst was initially developed by in situ Schiff base reaction, achieving high CO generation and selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The enhanced catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the accelerated photoinduced electron transfer and utilization via the formed covalent linkage.







Abstract
Efficient and selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction was obtained within a hybrid system that is formed in situ via a Schiff base condensation between a molecular iron quaterpyridine complex bearing an aldehyde function and carbon nitride. Irradiation (blue LED) of an CH3CN solution containing 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (BIH), triethylamine (TEA), Feqpy&#8208;BA (qpy&#8208;BA=4&#8208;([2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;:6&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quaterpyridin]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzaldehyde) and C3N4 resulted in CO evolution with a turnover number of 2554 and 95&#8201;% selectivity. This hybrid catalytic system unlocks covalent linkage of molecular catalysts with semiconductor photosensitizers via Schiff base reaction for high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic reduction of CO2, opening a pathway for diverse photocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;A covalent-linked C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-aldehyde-decorated iron quaterpyridine hybrid catalyst was initially developed by in situ Schiff base reaction, achieving high CO generation and selectivity for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. The enhanced catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the accelerated photoinduced electron transfer and utilization via the formed covalent linkage.

         <title>An Efficient Rechargeable Aluminium&#8211;Amine Battery Working Under Quaternization Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient rechargeable Al battery was built based on the electrochemical amine quaternization reaction, in which nitrogen (radical) cations (R3N.+ or R4N+) function as the redox&#8208;active sites to store the anionic Al complex. The constructed Al&#8211;amine battery exhibits a high reversible capacity, fast charge capability, and superior stability against long&#8208;term cycling and self&#8208;discharge.







Abstract
Rechargeable aluminium (Al) batteries (RABs) have long&#8208;been pursued due to the high sustainability and three&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer properties of Al metal. However, limited redox chemistry is available for rechargeable Al batteries, which restricts the exploration of cathode materials. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient Al&#8211;amine battery based on a quaternization reaction, in which nitrogen (radical) cations (R3N.+ or R4N+) are formed to store the anionic Al complex. The reactive aromatic amine molecules further oligomerize during cycling, inhibiting amine dissolution into the electrolyte. Consequently, the constructed Al&#8211;amine battery exhibits a high reversible capacity of 135&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 along with a superior cycling life (4000&#8197;cycles), fast charge capability and a high energy efficiency of 94.2&#8201;%. Moreover, the Al&#8211;amine battery shows excellent stability against self&#8208;discharge, far beyond conventional Al&#8211;graphite batteries. Our findings pave an avenue to advance the chemistry of RABs and thus battery performance.

         <title>Steering the Glycerol Electro&#8208;Reforming Selectivity via Cation&#8211;Intermediate Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycerol oxidation selectivity can be efficiently steered via cation&#8211;intermediate interactions, resulting in highly selective glycerol electro&#8208;reforming into hydrogen and formate. This work emphasizes the significance of engineering the microenvironment at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface for efficient electrochemical processes.







Abstract
Electro&#8208;reforming of renewable biomass resources is an alternative technology for sustainable pure H2 production. Herein, we discovered an unconventional cation effect on the concurrent formate and H2 production via glycerol electro&#8208;reforming. In stark contrast to the cation effect via forming double layers in cathodic reactions, residual cations at the anode were discovered to interact with the glycerol oxidation intermediates to steer its product selectivity. Through a combination of product analysis, transient kinetics, crown ether trapping experiments, in situ IRRAS and DFT calculations, the aldehyde intermediates were discovered to be stabilized by the Li+ cations to favor the non&#8208;oxidative C&#8722;C cleavage for formate production. The maximal formate efficiency could reach 81.3&#8201;% under &#8776;60&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in LiOH. This work emphasizes the significance of engineering the microenvironment at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface for efficient electrolytic processes.

         <title>Screening Heteroatom Configurations for Reversible Sloping Capacity Promises High&#8208;Power Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a heteroatom configuration screening strategy upon P/O&#8208;doping, irreversible configurations of C&#8722;O and PO3&#8722; were removed, while the configurations like C=O and PO43&#8722;/PO23&#8722; as well as the free radicals could be retained or even enhanced. The Na storage mechanisms were also studied using the resulting carbon. This work inspires the design and understanding of the &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon anodes towards high&#8208;power Na&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Heteroatom doping has been proved to effectively enhance the sloping capacity, nevertheless, the high sloping capacity almost encounters a conflict with the disappointing initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, we propose a heteroatom configuration screening strategy by introducing a secondary carbonization process for the phosphate&#8208;treated carbons to remove the irreversible heteroatom configurations but with the reversible ones and free radicals remaining, achieving a simultaneity between the high sloping capacity and ICE (&#8776;250&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 80&#8201;%). The Na storage mechanism was also studied based on this &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon to reveal the reason for the absence of the plateau. This work could inspire to distinguish and filter the irreversible heteroatom configurations and facilitate the future design of practical &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon anodes towards high&#8208;power Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Discovery of an Ultra&#8208;rapid and Sensitive Lysosomal Fluorescence Lipophagy Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of brand&#8208;new large Stokes shift and highly stable fluorescent dyes were constructed. In particular, the Q&#8208;P&#8208;ARh fluorescent dye as a near&#8208;infrared emission lysosomal&#8208;specific probe with ultra&#8208;low concentration and ultra&#8208;fast staining characteristics for the complete lipophagy process imaging is presented.







Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive dynamic tracking of lysosomes and their interactions with other organelles is important for the study of lysosomal function and related diseases. However, many fluorescent dyes developed so far to target lysosomes cannot be used to monitor these processes due to the high concentrations required for imaging, long cell penetration times, and non&#8208;ideal photostability. In this regard, we synthesized three lysosomal targeting probes with large Stokes shifts, good stability, and high brightness. The Q&#8208;P&#8208;ARh dye, developed by us for the first time, can stain lysosomes at ultra&#8208;low concentrations (1.0&#8197;nM) without affecting the physiological functions of the lysosomes. More importantly, its excellent anti&#8208;interference ability and ultrafast lysosomal staining ability (within 1.0&#8197;min) clearly monitored the entire dynamic process of lipophagy. Ultimately, this method can greatly contribute to the study of autophagy pathways. This novel fluorescence platform shows great promise for the development of biological probes for application in pathological environments.

         <title>Symmetrically Tetra&#8208;functionalized Pillar[6]arenes Prepared by Fragment Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for synthesizing partially functionalized pillar[6]arenes is reported. It emphasizes the advantages of fragment coupling over one&#8208;pot synthesis in terms of preparing highly modifiable macrocycles for supramolecular chemistry. Moreover, one of the synthesized pillar[6]arenes, COOEtEtXP[6], exhibits cyan luminescence due to the through&#8208;space conjugation, which opens up new possibilities for designing luminescent macrocycles.







Abstract
Due to the highly symmetrical structures generated from one&#8208;pot syntheses, the partial functionalization of macrocycles is usually beset with low yields and onerous purifications of the target multifunctional macrocycles. To improve this situation, taking pillar[6]arenes as an example, a two&#8208;step fragment coupling method has been developed for synthesizing symmetrically tetra&#8208;functionalized pillar[6]arenes, namely X&#8208;pillar[6]arenes. This method is simple and versatile, which makes hetero&#8208;fragment coupling and pre&#8208;functionalization available. Nine new macrocycles and a pillar[6]arene&#8208;based cage have been prepared. In addition, one of the newly synthesized macrocycles, COOEtEtXP[6], exhibits a strong cyan luminescence in the solid state under irradiation by 365&#8197;nm UV light. This emission originates from intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation. Meanwhile, formation of a supramolecular polymer by multiple non&#8208;covalent intra/intermolecular interactions helps rigidify the structure and make COOEtEtXP[6] an efficient solid&#8208;state emitter. It is believed that this fragment coupling can also be used to realize the multi&#8208;functionalization of other macrocycles.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Metal&#8211;Nucleobase Frameworks for Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8211;nucleobase frameworks were reported for the highly efficient separation of a Xe/Kr mixture with high IAST selectivity and Henry's selectivity. The selective binding of Xe arises from the enhanced polarization in the confined electric field produced by the electron&#8208;rich anions and the electron&#8208;deficient purine heterocyclic rings.







Abstract
Xe/Kr separation is an industrially important but challenging process owing to their inert properties and low concentrations in the air. Energy&#8208;effective adsorption&#8208;based separation is a promising technology. Herein, two isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8211;nucleobase frameworks (HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;201 and HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;202) are capable of separating Xe/Kr under ambient conditions and strike an excellent balance between capacity and selectivity. The Xe capacity of HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;201a reaches 3.01&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1.0&#8197;bar, while IAST selectivity and Henry's selectivity are 21.0 and 21.6, respectively. Direct breakthrough experiments confirmed the excellent separation performance, affording a Xe capacity of 25.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 from a Xe/Kr mixed&#8208;gas at dilute concentrations. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the selective binding arises from the enhanced polarization in the confined electric field produced by the electron&#8208;rich anions and the electron&#8208;deficient purine heterocyclic rings.

         <title>HFIP Mediates a Direct C&#8722;C Coupling between Michael Acceptors and Eschenmoser's salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Michael acceptors efficiently couple with Eschenmoser's salt in hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) without the need for additives or catalysts. The role of iodide and the solvent HFIP in this transformation have been studied in detail experimentally and computationally to obtain a full mechanistic picture. The products were further transformed through rearrangements and Michael additions.







Abstract
A direct C&#8722;C coupling process that merges Michael acceptors and Eschenmoser's salt is presented. Although reminiscent of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction, this process requires no Lewis base catalyst. The underlying mechanism was unveiled by a combination of kinetic, isotopic labelling experiments as well as computational investigations, which showcased the critical role of HFIP as a superior mediator for proton&#8208;transfer events as well as the decisive role of the halide counterion.

Hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks self&#8208;assembled from metal&#8211;nucleobase complexes and hexafluoro anions are reported by Wei Zhou, Zongbi Bao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202117609). Amino&#8208;rich ligands provide multiple H&#8208;bonding sites to stabilize the frameworks. In the confined channels, the electron&#8208;rich anions combined with the electron&#8208;deficient purine rings generate a micro&#8208;electric field to polarize and lock Xe atoms, thus achieving highly efficient Xe/Kr separation under ambient conditions.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Fold&#8208;in Synthesis of a Pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 11/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene , the largest hetero[n]circulene, has been synthesized by a fold&#8208;in approach, as reported by Takayuki Tanaka and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202116789). The molecule exhibits a saddle&#8208;distorted structure in the solid state, reminiscent of a camel's back. The dynamic behavior was analyzed experimentally and theoretically, revealing a low transition state for the saddle&#8208;to&#8208;saddle inversion. In contrast, a planar, star&#8208;shaped conformer is energetically much higher, like a star in the sky.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene&lt;/b&gt; , the largest hetero[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]circulene, has been synthesized by a fold-in approach, as reported by Takayuki Tanaka and co-workers in their Communication &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202116789"&gt;(e202116789)&lt;/a&gt;. The molecule exhibits a saddle-distorted structure in the solid state, reminiscent of a camel's back. The dynamic behavior was analyzed experimentally and theoretically, revealing a low transition state for the saddle-to-saddle inversion. In contrast, a planar, star-shaped conformer is energetically much higher, like a star in the sky.

Perovskites The &#960;&#8208;conjugated ionic compound QAPyBF4 was used as a perovskite modulator in the Research Article by Juin&#8208;Jei Liou, Taiho Park, Zong&#8208;Xiang Xu, and co&#8208;workers (e202117303). Experimental investigations showed that p&#8208;type conjugated cations [QAPy]2+ adsorb on the perovskite surface with under&#8208;coordinated Pb cations and highly electronegative [BF4]&#8722; anions enriched at the SnO2 interface. This spontaneous diffusion effect of cation and anion improves the band alignment at two adjacent perovskite interfaces and reduces recombination losses.

The iron guanidine catalyst shows extraordinary copolymerization activity towards lactide, glycolide, and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone, as reported by Sonja Herres&#8208;Pawlis, Moshe Kol, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202112853). Depending on the reaction temperature and the mode of monomer addition, it either forms up to pentablock copolymers in a highly defined way or promotes transesterifications to such a high degree that random copolymers are produced. Therefore, it is a rare example of a catalyst mastering both microstructures: ordered and chaotic.

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Perovskite Solar Cells: A New Tool for Improving Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites hold great potential for next&#8208;generation solar cells. However, their poor stability in air and moisture still hinders their practical implementation. Preliminary data have shown that halogen bonding affords improved crystallization and stability, reduction of the surface trap states, and the possibility of forming ordered structures, paving the way towards the development of highly stable PSCs.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites (HOIHPs) have recently emerged as a flourishing area of research. Their easy and low&#8208;cost production and their unique optoelectronic properties make them promising materials for many applications. In particular, HOIHPs hold great potential for next&#8208;generation solar cells. However, their practical implementation is still hindered by their poor stability in air and moisture, which is responsible for their short lifetime. Optimizing the chemical composition of materials and exploiting non&#8208;covalent interactions for interfacial and defects engineering, as well as defect passivation, are efficient routes towards enhancing the overall efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Due to the rich halogen chemistry of HOIHPs, exploiting halogen bonding, in particular, may pave the way towards the development of highly stable PSCs. Improved crystallization and stability, reduction of the surface trap states, and the possibility of forming ordered structures have already been preliminarily demonstrated.

This Review outlines the structure&#8211;immunogenicity correlation of subunit vaccines developed against S.&#8197;pyogenes, highlighting the different glycotope constructs and carrier systems used as well as shedding light on some recent interventions which were developed to overcome the limitations of carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine development.

Streptococcus pyogenes is a primary infective agent that causes approximately 700&#8197;million human infections each year, resulting in more than 500&#8201;000 deaths. Carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccines are proven to be one of the most promising subunit vaccine candidates, as the bacterial glycan pattern(s) are different from mammalian cells and show increased pathogen serotype conservancy than the protein components. In this Review we highlight reverse vaccinology for use in the development of subunit vaccines against S.&#8197;pyogenes, and report reproducible methods of carbohydrate antigen production, in addition to the structure&#8211;immunogenicity correlation between group&#8197;A carbohydrate epitopes and alternative vaccine antigen carrier systems. We also report recent advances used to overcome hurdles in carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine development.

         <title>Insight into Structural Evolution, Active Sites, and Stability of Heterogeneous Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural evolution is crucial to the development of active sites for renewable energy&#8208;conversion technologies involving heterogeneous electrocatalysis. In this Minireview, fundamental concepts related to structural evolution are described. A critical overview of multiple triggers, reversibility and operando characterizations is presented, and the application of structural evolution in important electrocatalytic reactions is presented.







Abstract
Studying structure&#8211;activity correlations of electrocatalysts is essential for improving the conversion of electrical to chemical energy. Recently, increasing evidence obtained by operando characterization techniques reveal that the structural evolution of catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates brings about the formation of real active sites. Hence, it is time to summarize structural evolution related research advances and envisage future developments. In this Minireview, we first introduce the fundamental concepts associated with structural evolution (e.g., catalysts, active sites/centers and stability/lifetime) and their relevance. Then, the multiple triggers of structural evolution and advanced operando characterizations are discussed. Significantly, a brief overview of structural evolution and its reversibility in heterogeneous electrocatalysis is provided, especially for the representative electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) processes. Lastly, key challenges and opportunities in this exciting field are highlighted.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Functionalization of Recombinant Spider Silk Janus Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus fibers were created by applying two different recombinant spider silk constructs that were electrospun in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement. Subsequent gold coupling via thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry allowed for highly selective deposition of a conductive gold layer only on the cysteine&#8208;modified silk protein side. The study demonstrates the high potential of tailored silk design to generate multi&#8208;functional nanomaterials for various applications.







Abstract
Biotechnological production is a powerful tool to design materials with customized properties. The aim of this work was to apply designed spider silk proteins to produce Janus fibers with two different functional sides. First, functionalization was established through a cysteine&#8208;modified silk protein, ntagCyseADF4(&#954;16). After fiber spinning, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were coupled via thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry. Significantly reduced electrical resistivity indicated sufficient loading density of AuNPs on such fiber surfaces. Then, Janus fibers were electrospun in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement, with &#8220;non&#8208;functional&#8221; eADF4(C16) on the one and &#8220;functional&#8221; ntagCyseADF4(&#954;16) on the other side. Post&#8208;treatment was established to render silk fibers insoluble in water. Subsequent AuNP binding was highly selective on the ntagCyseADF4(&#954;16) side demonstrating the potential of such silk&#8208;based systems to realize complex bifunctional structures with spatial resolutions in the nano scale.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Three&#8208;Dimensional MXene/Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composites for High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for synthesizing uniform 3D MXene/MOF composites was proposed. The metal ions cross&#8208;linked with the surface termination groups of Ti3C2TX nanosheets, which destroyed the electrostatic repulsion between the nanosheets, and thereafter became the nucleation site for the in situ growth of MOF particles on Ti3C2TX nanosheets. The composites combined the advantages of MOF and MXene to enhance stability and improve conductivity.







Abstract
In this study, we propose a versatile method for synthesizing uniform three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes)/metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) composites (Ti3C2TX/Cu&#8208;BTC, Ti3C2TX/Fe,Co&#8208;PBA, Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;8, and Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67) that combine the advantages of MOFs and MXenes to enhance stability and improve conductivity. Subsequently, 3D hollow Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67/CoV2O6 composites with excellent electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;transport properties derived from Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67 were synthesized. The specific capacitance of the Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67/CoV2O6 electrode was 285.5&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is much higher than that of the ZIF&#8208;67 and Ti3C2TX/ZIF&#8208;67 electrode. This study opens a new avenue for the design and synthesis of MXene/MOF composites and complex hollow structures with tailorable structures and compositions for various applications.

         <title>Moderated Basicity of Endohedral Amine Groups in an Octa&#8208;Cationic Self&#8208;Assembled Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>

An endohedrally functionalized self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 cage complex with 12 internal amines in the cavity acts as an acid host, and shows differential basicity, moderated by the cage superstructure.







Abstract
A self&#8208;assembled FeII4L6 cage was synthesized with 12 internal amines in the cavity. The cage forms as the dodeca&#8208;ammonium salt, despite the cage carrying an overall 8+ charge at the metal centers, extracting protons from displaced water in the reaction. Despite this, the basicity of the internal amines is lower than their counterparts in free solution. The 12 amines have a sliding scale of basicity, with a &#8776;6&#8197;pKa unit difference between the first and last protons to be removed. This moderation of side&#8208;chain basicity in an active site is a hallmark of enzymatic catalysis.

         <title>Structurally Nontraditional Bipolar Hosts for RGB Phosphorescent OLEDs: Boosted by a &#8220;Butterfly&#8208;Shaped&#8221; Medium&#8208;Ring Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;medium&#8208;ring&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design structurally nontraditional host molecules. A brand&#8208;new type of bipolar hosts with a twisted &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped&#8221; heptagonal acceptor (EtBP), which features an electron&#8208;deficient benzophenone fragment with a flexible ethylidene bridge, enables the assembly of high&#8208;performance RGB phosphorescent OLEDs.







Abstract
The emitting layer based on a host&#8211;guest system plays a crucial role in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). While emitters have witnessed rapid progress in structural diversity, hosts still rely heavily on traditional structures and are underdeveloped. Herein a &#8220;medium&#8208;ring&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design structurally nontraditional host molecules, which are not only rotatable enough to suppress close &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, thus reducing exciton annihilation, but also rigid enough to prevent excessive conformational flipping, thus inhibiting non&#8208;radiative decay. Accordingly, a brand&#8208;new type of bipolar hosts with a twisted &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped heptagonal acceptor (EtBP), which features an electron&#8208;deficient benzophenone fragment with a flexible ethylidene bridge, has been developed. With satisfactory morphological stability and well&#8208;balanced hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting properties, the EtBP&#8208;based bipolar hosts enable high&#8208;performance RGB phosphorescent OLEDs with small efficiency roll&#8208;off, which are superior to those of acyclic benzophenone&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Directed Formation of Anisotropic Kettlebell and Tadpole Nanostructures in the Absence of a Swelling&#8208;Induced Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic kettlebell and tadpole polymer nanostructures formed through a single protrusion from spheres. This method obviates the commonly used solvent swelling&#8208;induced method to form anisotropic particles by driving tail assembly through enhanced chain mobility by tuning the glass transition temperature of the polymer core. Further, the kettlebells could be isolated and transformed to tadpoles on&#8208;demand with temperature.







Abstract
Anisotropic Janus (&#8220;snowman&#8221;) nanoparticles with a single protrusion are currently made via the solvent swelling&#8208;induced method. Here, we demonstrate without the aid of toxic solvents a generally applicable method for the formation of anisotropic polymer nanoparticles directly in water by controlling polymer mobility through tuning its glass transition temperature (Tg). Spherical structures, formed immediately after the emulsion polymerization, transformed into uniform tadpoles (with head diameter &#8776;60&#8197;nm and tail length &#8776;130&#8197;nm) through the protrusion of a single cylindrical tail when cooled to a temperature above the Tg of the polymer. Cooling the spheres to below the Tg produced kinetically trapped kettlebell structures that could be freeze&#8208;dried and rehydrated without any structural change. These unique kettlebells could transform into uniform tadpoles by heating above the Tg, representing a triggered and on&#8208;demand structural reorganization.

         <title>Organoplatinum(II) Cruciform: A Versatile Building Block to Fabricate 2D Microcrystals with Full&#8208;Color and White Phosphorescence and Anisotropic Photon Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controllable preparations of two&#8208;dimensional phosphorescent crystals remain a challenging task. In stark contrast to the conventional one&#8208;dimensional assemblies of square&#8208;planar platinum complexes, organoplatinum(II) complexes with a cruciform shape form two&#8208;dimensional microcrystals with full&#8208;color and white phosphorescence by unique molecular stackings, opening a new avenue for the preparations of phosphorescent micro/nanostructures for advanced photonic applications.







Abstract
Conventional square&#8208;planar platinum complexes typically form one&#8208;dimensional assemblies as a result of unidirectional metallophilic and/or &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; intermolecular interactions. Organoplatinum(II) complexes with a cruciform shape are presented herein to construct two&#8208;dimensional (2D) microcrystals with full&#8208;color and white phosphorescence. These 2D crystals show unique monocomponent &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking, from either the cyclometalating or noncyclometalating ligand, and the bicomponent alternate &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking from both ligands along different facet directions. Anisotropic tri&#8208;directional waveguiding is further implemented on a single hexagonal microcrystal. These results demonstrate the great capability of the organoplatinum(II) cruciform as a general platform to fabricate 2D phosphorescent micro&#8208;/nanocrystals for advanced photonic applications.

         <title>A Plausible Prebiotic One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Orotate and Pyruvate Suggestive of Common Protometabolic Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prebiotic synthesis of the nucleobase orotate, and the citric acid cycle intermediate pyruvate, proceeds in a single pot from two small glycine derivatives, hydantoin and glyoxylate, under mild aqueous conditions. These findings support a co&#8208;evolution of pathways to core protometabolites and nucleic acid building blocks in a common environment. Additionally, open&#8208;chain thiohydantoin derivatives enable a synthesis of thioorotate nucleosides.







Abstract
A reaction between two prebiotically plausible building blocks, hydantoin and glyoxylate, generates both the nucleobase orotate, a precursor of biological pyrimidines, and pyruvate, a core metabolite in the citric acid cycle and amino acid biosynthesis. The reaction proceeds in water to provide significant yields of the two widely divergent chemical motifs. Additionally, the reaction of thiohydantoin and glyoxylate produces thioorotate in high yield under neutral aqueous conditions. The use of an open&#8208;chain thiohydantoin derivative also enables the potential pre&#8208;positioning of a nucleosidic bond prior to the synthesis of an orotate nucleoside. The observation that diverse building blocks of modern metabolism can be produced in a single reaction pot, from common reactants under mild conditions, supports the plausibility of orthogonal chemistries operating at the origins of chemical evolution.

         <title>Synthesis of C&#8208;Oligosaccharides through Versatile C(sp3)&#8722;H Glycosylation of Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation of glycosides is disclosed. This saccharide assembly by C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation featured excellent site&#8208; and stereoselectivity and enabled the efficient synthesis of diverse C&#8208;disaccharides and C&#8208;trisaccharides.







Abstract
C&#8208;oligosaccharides are pharmacologically relevant because they are more hydrolysis&#8208;resistant than O&#8208;oligosaccharides. Despite indisputable advances, C&#8208;oligosaccharides continue to be underdeveloped, likely due to a lack of efficient and selective strategies for the assembly of the interglycosidic C&#8722;C linkages. In contrast, we, herein, report a versatile and robust strategy for the synthesis of structurally complex C&#8208;oligosaccharides via catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activations. Thus, a wealth of complex interglycosidic (2&#8594;1)&#8208; and (1&#8594;1)&#8208;C&#8208;oligosaccharides becomes readily available by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H glycoside glycosylation. The isolation of key palladacycle intermediates and experiments with isotopically&#8208;labeled compounds identified a trans&#8208;stereoselectivity for the C(sp3)&#8722;H glycosylation. The glycoside C(sp3)&#8722;H activation manifold was likewise exploited for the diversification of furanoses, pyranoses and disaccharides.

     alt="Synthesis of C-Oligosaccharides through Versatile C(sp3)&#8722;H Glycosylation of Glycosides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The palladium-catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H glycosylation of glycosides is disclosed. This saccharide assembly by C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H glycosylation featured excellent site- and stereoselectivity and enabled the efficient synthesis of diverse &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-disaccharides and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-trisaccharides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C-&lt;/i&gt;oligosaccharides are pharmacologically relevant because they are more hydrolysis-resistant than &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-oligosaccharides. Despite indisputable advances, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-oligosaccharides continue to be underdeveloped, likely due to a lack of efficient and selective strategies for the assembly of the interglycosidic C&#8722;C linkages. In contrast, we, herein, report a versatile and robust strategy for the synthesis of structurally complex &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-oligosaccharides via catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H activations. Thus, a wealth of complex interglycosidic (2&#8594;1)- and (1&#8594;1)-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-oligosaccharides becomes readily available by palladium-catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H glycoside glycosylation. The isolation of key palladacycle intermediates and experiments with isotopically-labeled compounds identified a &lt;i&gt;trans-&lt;/i&gt;stereoselectivity for the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H glycosylation. The glycoside C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H activation manifold was likewise exploited for the diversification of furanoses, pyranoses and disaccharides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photoinduced Dual&#8208;Wavelength Approach for 3D Printing and Self&#8208;Healing of Thermosetting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
RAFT polymerization was successfully applied to visible light&#8208;induced (405&#8197;nm) 3D printing to produce high&#8208;resolution objects with self&#8208;healing capabilities. The self&#8208;healing process is based on the reactivation of RAFT agent embedded in the 3D printed thermosets under UV light (365&#8197;nm) and can be performed at room temperature without prior deoxygenation. The fractured materials can fully recover their initial tensile strength within 30&#8197;min.







Abstract
Vat photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing techniques have been widely used to produce high&#8208;resolution 3D thermosetting materials. However, the lack of repairability of these thermosets leads to the production of waste. In this study, reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agents are incorporated into resin formulations to allow visible light (405&#8197;nm) mediated 3D printing of materials with self&#8208;healing capabilities. The self&#8208;healing process is based on the reactivation of RAFT agent embedded in the thermosets under UV light (365&#8197;nm), which enables reformation of the polymeric network. The self&#8208;healing process can be performed at room temperature without prior deoxygenation. The impact of the type and concentration of RAFT agents in the polymer network on the healing efficiency is explored. Resins containing RAFT agents enable 3D printing of thermosets with self&#8208;healing properties, broadening the scope of future applications for polymeric thermosets in various fields.

         <dc:description>
A series of platinum(II)&#8208;tethered chalcogenoviologens with three&#8208;in&#8208;one functions was prepared. When bacteria were used as a natural sacrificial agent, PtL+&#8208;SeV2+ could realize not only bacteria&#8208;triggered one&#8208;component solar H2 production but also antibacterial action. This system laid the foundation for solving various real&#8208;life problems via a simple system.







Abstract
Multifunctional solar energy conversion offers a feasible strategy to solve energy, environmental and water crises. Herein, a series of platinum(II)&#8208;tethered chalcogenoviologens (PtL+&#8208;EV2+, E=S, Se, Te) is reported, which integrate the functions of photosensitizer, electron mediator and catalyst. PtL+&#8208;EV2+ (particularly for PtL+&#8208;SeV2+)&#8208;based one&#8208;component solar H2 production could be triggered not only by EDTA, but also by facultative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria relying on a simplified mechanism, along with efficient antibacterial activities. In addition, by using real pool water, PtL+&#8208;SeV2+ achieved multiple functions, including H2 production, antibacterial action and acid removal, which supplied a new strategy to solve various problems in real life via a single system.

         <title>Inhibition of ACE2&#8208;Spike Interaction by an ACE2 Binder Suppresses SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Entry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein could be limited in inhibiting viral entry via the RBD&#8211;ACE2 interaction due to the emerging spike mutations. Instead, targeting ACE2 with a small molecule could suppress the entry of ancestral and variant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 into the host cells, without impairing the enzymatic activity of ACE2, which is necessary for the physiological function of the host cells.







Abstract
The emergence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants is a significant concern in developing effective therapeutics and vaccines in the middle of the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here, we have identified a novel small molecule that inhibited the interactions between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBDs and ACE2 by modulating ACE2 without impairing its enzymatic activity necessary for normal physiological functions. Furthermore, the identified compounds suppressed viral infection in cultured cells by inhibiting the entry of ancestral and variant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Our study suggests that targeting ACE2 could be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry into host cells and prevent the development of COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Chiral Arylene Diimide Phosphors: Circularly Polarized Ambient Phosphorescence from Bischromophoric Pyromellitic Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appending pyromellitic diimide phosphors to an enantiomeric diaminocyclohexane core results in a chiral bischromophoric phosphor that shows circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) under ambient conditions. Solution&#8208;processable PMMA films of the bischromophoric phosphors show mirror&#8208;imaged cyan CPP with a high phosphorescence quantum yield (18&#8201;% in air and 46&#8201;% under vacuum) and a significant luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|=4.0&#215;10&#8722;3).







Abstract
Chiral organic phosphors with circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPP) provide new prospects to the realm of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, owing to the long&#8208;lived triplet states and persistent emission. Although several molecular designs show efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), realization of ambient organic CPP remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a chiral bischromophoric phosphor design to realize ambient CPP emission by appending molecular phosphors to a chiral diaminocyclohexane core. Thus, solution&#8208;processable polymer films of the trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DAC) chiral cores with heavy&#8208;atom substituted pyromellitic diimide phosphors, exhibits one of the most efficient exclusive CPP emissions with high phosphorescence quantum yield (&#8776;18&#8201;% in air and &#8776;46&#8201;% under vacuum) and significant luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;4.0&#215;10&#8722;3).

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Zero and Low&#8208;Valent Metal Nodes Connected by Tetratopic Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, tetratopic phosphine linkers were used to realize MOFs with Pd0 and Pt0 metal nodes, which represent the first MOFs constructed using only metal&#8211;phosphine coordination bonds. In addition, a RhI coordination solid was synthesized, highlighting the versatility of these phosphine linkers. A total of six new materials are reported using unique triphenylphosphine&#8208;modulated syntheses and their luminescent properties are described.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed with M0 nodes are attractive targets due to the reactivity of these low&#8208;valent metals, but examples of these MOFs remain exceedingly rare. The rational design of three&#8208;dimensional MOFs with Pd0 and Pt0 nodes using tetratopic phosphine ligands is reported. Five new MOFs have been synthesized by systematic variation of the phosphine ligands and metal precursors employed, and these represent the first examples of MOFs constructed using phosphine&#8211;metal bonds as the sole structural component. The MOFs display solid&#8208;state luminescence, with emission maxima that are significantly red&#8208;shifted compared to Pd(PPh3)4. In addition, a RhI low&#8208;valent coordination solid based on the same linker design is reported, which displays solid&#8208;state luminescence that is not observed for the molecular analogue.

A pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene has been synthesized as the largest fully conjugated hetero[n]circulene via a fold&#8208;in oxidative fusion reaction of a cyclic pentapyrrole precursor. This circulene takes a saddle&#8208;distorted structure with bond lengths of the central ten&#8208;membered&#8208;ring in the range of 1.455&#8211;1.493&#8197;&#197;.

Abstract
A pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene has been synthesized as the largest fully conjugated hetero[n]circulene via a fold&#8208;in oxidative fusion reaction of an ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged cyclic pyrrole pentamer.

Relatively broad absorption and fluorescence spectra were observed, which reflects its flexible structure, in accordance with the low&#8208;temperature NMR spectra and theoretical calculations. The energy barrier for saddle&#8208;to&#8208;saddle interconversion was estimated to be quite small (&#8776;3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1).

         <title>Discrete Stacked Dimers of Aromatic Oligoamide Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking of aromatic foldamer helices in water gives rise to thermodynamically and kinetically stable discrete dimers. The association can be used to convey helix handedness from one helix to the next and be designed to form heterodimers exclusively.







Abstract
Tight binding was observed between the C&#8208;terminal cross section of aromatic oligoamide helices in aqueous solution, leading to the formation of discrete head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimers in slow exchange on the NMR timescale with the corresponding monomers. The nature and structure of the dimers was evidenced by 2D NOESY and DOSY spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The binding interface involves a large hydrophobic aromatic surface and hydrogen bonding. Dimerization requires that helices have the same handedness and the presence of a C&#8208;terminal carboxy function. The protonation state of the carboxy group plays a crucial role, resulting in pH dependence of the association. Dimerization is also influenced by neighboring side chains and can be programmed to selectively produce heteromeric aggregates.

         <title>Light/Force&#8208;Sensitive 0D Lead&#8208;Free Perovskites: From Highly Efficient Blue Afterglow to White Phosphorescence with Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 0D lead&#8208;free perovskites (PA6InCl9 and PA4InCl7) exhibit ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) sensitive to light and force, respectively. The activated PA6InCl9 shows highly efficient blue RTP with a &#934;P of 43&#8201;% and a lifetime of 1.2&#8197;s. After the introduction of Sb3+, pure white phosphorescence with near&#8208;unity quantum yield and a color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) of near 90 can be achieved through the combination of blue RTP of PA6InCl9 and orange RTP of Sb3+.







Abstract
Herein, new types of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) perovskites (PA6InCl9 and PA4InCl7) with blue room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) were obtained from InCl3 and aniline hydrochloride. These are highly sensitive to external light and force stimuli. The RTP quantum yield of PA6InCl9 can be enhanced from 25.2&#8201;% to 42.8&#8201;% upon illumination. Under mechanical force, PA4InCl7 exhibits a phase transform to PA6InCl9, thus boosting ultralong RTP with a lifetime up to 1.2&#8197;s. Furthermore, white and orange pure RTP with a quantum yield close to 100&#8201;% can be realized when Sb3+ was introduced into PA6InCl9. The white pure phosphorescence with a color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) close to 90 consists of blue RTP of PA6InCl9 and orange RTP of Sb3+. Thus, this work not only overcomes long&#8208;standing problems of low quantum yield and short lifetime of blue RTP, but also obtains high&#8208;efficiency white RTP. It provides a feasible method to realize near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency and has great application potential in the fields of optical devices and smart materials.

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;Templated Palladium Nanoparticles for Water Purification by Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density palladium nanocatalyst is successfully immobilized on bulk electrodes via a 3D&#8208;structured amyloid fibrils template. The novel hybrid electrodes exhibit superior electroreduction performance for detoxification of wastewater and drinking water.







Abstract
Electrocatalysis offers great promise for water purification but is limited by low active area and high uncontrollability of electrocatalysts. To overcome these constraints, we propose hybrid bulk electrodes by synthesizing and binding a Pd nanocatalyst (nano&#8208;Pd) to the electrodes via amyloid fibrils (AFs). The AFs template is effective for controlling the nucleation, growth, and assembly of nano&#8208;Pd on the electrode. In addition, the three&#8208;dimensional hierarchically porous nanostructure of AFs is beneficial for loading high&#8208;density nano&#8208;Pd with a large active area. The novel hybrid cathodes exhibit superior electroreduction performance for the detoxification of hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), 4&#8208;chlorophenol, and trichloroacetic acid in wastewater and drinking water. This study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design of an AFs&#8208;templated nano&#8208;Pd&#8208;based hybrid electrode, which constitutes a paradigm shift in electrocatalytic water purification, and broadens the horizon of its potential engineered applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Cyclopropanation and Epoxidation via a Catalytically Formed Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic asymmetric installation of a chiral auxiliary gives access to enantioenriched oxazolidines bearing a tetra&#8208;substituted olefin from readily available propargylic amines. In this work, we extend the use of the catalytically formed chiral auxiliary, previously limited to hydrogenation, to asymmetric cyclopropanation and epoxidation using simple and robust reaction conditions for accessing highly substituted products.







Abstract
For the enantioselective diversification of a single starting material, a different chiral catalyst is usually required for each transformation. Herein, we extend the concept of catalytically formed chiral auxiliary from hydrogenation to the asymmetric cyclopropanation and epoxidation of tetra&#8208;substituted olefins, alleviating the need for different chiral catalysts in the alkene functionalization step. The chiral auxiliary is catalytically constructed from propargylic amines in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective carboetherification step using a commercially available trifluoroacetaldehyde hemiacetal tether. The installed auxiliary is then controlling the stereochemistry of the cyclopropanation and the epoxidation using standard highly reactive reagents to give enantioenriched spirocyclic aminomethylcyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Reductive Cyclization/Coupling of 1,6&#8208;Dienes: An Enantioselective Approach to Chiral Tertiary Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric reductive cyclization/coupling reaction of 1,6&#8208;dienes and alkyl bromides is reported. A chiral tertiary alcohol and a quaternary stereocenter are constructed by a single operation with excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
We have developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric reductive cyclization/coupling of 1,6&#8208;dienes. The reaction provides an efficient method for constructing a chiral tertiary alcohol and a quaternary stereocenter by a single operation. The method has excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity, a broad substrate scope, as well as good tolerance of functional groups. Preliminary mechanism studies show that alkyl nickel(I) species are involved in the reaction.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adjusting Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Capture of Trace Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;adjusting metal&#8211;organic framework has been proposed for capturing trace Xe and Kr from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior endows ATC&#8208;Cu the highest Xe and Kr capacity at 0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, as well as a benchmark for capturing low concentration Xe and Kr. The mechanism of the self&#8208;adjusting behavior has been studied through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments and computational calculations.







Abstract
The capture of the xenon and krypton from nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas is essential to the treatment of radioactive waste. Although various porous materials have been employed to capture Xe and Kr, the development of high&#8208;performance adsorbents capable of trapping Xe/Kr at very low partial pressure as in the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a self&#8208;adjusting metal&#8208;organic framework based on multiple weak binding interactions to capture trace Xe and Kr from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior of ATC&#8208;Cu and its mechanism have been visualized by the in&#8208;situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and theoretical calculations. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior endows ATC&#8208;Cu unprecedented uptake capacities of 2.65 and 0.52&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Xe and Kr respectively at 0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, as well as the record Xe capture capability from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. Our work not only provides a benchmark Xe adsorbent but proposes a new route to construct smart materials for efficient separations.

         <title>Direct and Catalytic C&#8208;Glycosylation of Arenes: Expeditious Synthesis of the Remdesivir Nucleoside**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 11, March 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars is presented. A silylium&#8208;catalyzed and completely stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation initially yields the open&#8208;chain polyols, which are cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;&#8208;furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;&#8208;anomer. The utility of the method is showcased in the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS&#8208;441524 by a subsequent Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.







Abstract
Since early 2020, scientists have strived to find an effective solution to fight SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, in particular by developing reliable vaccines that inhibit the spread of the disease and repurposing drugs for combatting its effects on the human body. The antiviral prodrug Remdesivir is still the most widely used therapeutic during the early stages of the infection. However, the current synthetic routes rely on the use of protecting groups, air&#8208;sensitive reagents, and cryogenic conditions, thus impeding a cost&#8208;efficient supply to patients. We have, therefore, focused on the development of a straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars. Here we report a silylium&#8208;catalyzed and completely stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation that initially yields the open&#8208;chain polyols, which can be selectively cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;&#8208;furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;&#8208;anomer. The method significantly expedites the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS&#8208;441524 after a subsequent Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.

         <title>Deep Downregulation of PD&#8208;L1 by Caged Peptide&#8208;Conjugated AIEgen/miR&#8208;140 Nanoparticles for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Downregulating programmed cell death ligand 1(PD&#8208;L1) protein levels in tumor cells is an effective way to achieve immune system activation for oncology treatment, but current strategies are inadequate. Here, we design a caged peptide&#8208;AIEgen probe (GCP) to self&#8208;assemble with miR&#8208;140 forming GCP/miR&#8208;140 nanoparticles. After entering tumor cells, GCP/miR&#8208;140 disassembles in the presence of Cathepsin B (CB) and releases caged GO203 peptide, miR&#8208;140 and PyTPA. Peptide decages in the highly reductive intracellular environment and binds to mucin 1 (MUC1), thereby downregulating the expression of PD&#8208;L1. Meanwhile, miR&#8208;140 reduces PD&#8208;L1 expression by targeting downregulation of PD&#8208;L1 mRNA. Under the action of PyTPA&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT), tumor&#8208;associated antigens are released, triggering immune cell attack on tumor cells. This multiple mechanisms&#8208;based strategy of deeply downregulating PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells activates the immune system and thus achieve effective immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconfiguration and Reorganization of Bottlebrush Polymer Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottlebrush random copolymers (BRCPs), having randomly distributed hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains, may reconfigure into hydrophilic&#8208;rich and hydrophobic&#8208;rich conformations at liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces to reduce interfacial energy.&#160; Both the degree of polymerization (  N  BB  ) and extent of grafting in these BRCPs were found to impact surface coverage and assembly kinetics.&#160; The time&#8208;dependence of the interfacial tension is described as the sum of two exponential relaxation functions characterizing BRCP diffusion, interfacial adsorption, and reorganization.&#160; Interfacial tension (&#947;) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) results showed that higher molecular weight BRCPs require longer time to adsorb to the water&#8208;oil interface, but less time for interfacial reorganization.&#160; Overall, this work describes fundamental principles of BRCP assembly at liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces, with implications pertaining to polymer design with enhanced understanding of emulsification, adhesion, and related properties in fluids and at interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Cystine Knot Peptides with Tuneable Activity and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knottins are topologically complex peptides that are stabilised by a cystine knot and have exceptionally diverse functions, including protease inhibition. However, approaches for tuning their activity  in situ  are limited. Here, we demonstrate separate approaches for tuning the activity of knottin protease inhibitors using light or streptavidin. We show that the inhibitory activity and selectivity of an engineered knottin can be controlled with light by activating a second mode of action that switches the inhibitor ON against new targets. Guided by a knottin library screen, we also identify a position in the inhibitor&#8217;s binding loop that permits insertion of a biotin tag without impairing activity. Using streptavidin, biotinylated knottins with nanomolar affinity can be switched OFF in activity assays, and the anticoagulant activity of a factor XIIa inhibitor can be rapidly switched OFF in human plasma. Our findings expand the scope of engineered knottins for precisely controlling protein function.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Covalent Triazine Frameworks in NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 Eutectic Salt for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Salt&#8208;melt polycondensation of aromatic nitriles in the presence of ZnCl  2  , which serves as both molten salts and Lewis acid catalyst, usually generates covalent triazine&#8208;based frameworks (CTFs). However, undesired carbonization is allowed when the cyclitrimerization is performed at a temperature above 300  o  C. Herein, a ternary NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl  2  eutectic&#8208;salts with melting points as low as ca. 200  o  C was used for the ionothermal synthesis of CTF&#8208;based photocatalysts. The lower melting point than that of pure ZnCl  2  (  T  mp  = 318  o  C) provides a mild salt&#8208;melt condition, which largely avoids carbonization of the polymeric backbone and proceeds the polycondensation process. Accordingly, the corresponding CTF&#8208;ES  200  shows much enhanced optical and electronic properties, and thus, achieving a remarkable photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic (2+1) Cycloaddition of Thioketones to Synthesize Tetrasubstituted Thiiranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the first example of enantioselective (2+1) cycloaddition of thioketones with &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides for the direct synthesis of tetrasubstituted thiiranes. In the presence of chiral  N,N'  &#8208;dioxide/cobalt(&#921;&#921;) complexes (2&#8208;5 mol%), excellent efficiency (up to 99% yield within 15 mins), and high stereoselectivity (up to &gt;19:1 dr and 97% ee) are available. Elaborations of thiiranes via desulfuration have also been conducted to deliver tetrasubstituted olefins. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the reaction initiates from a doublet state cobalt(&#921;&#921;) carbenoid, which is followed by a quartet cobalt(&#921;&#921;)&#8208;bound thiocarbonyl ylide pathway. This work provides a route for the selective construction of tetrasubstituted thiiranes and olefins that are otherwise difficult to access.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pair of Atypical KAS III Homologues with Initiation and Elongation Functions Program the Polyketide Biosynthesis in Asukamycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III (KAS III) is a class of important C&#8208;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes that mostly catalyze the initiation of polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, we elucidated an unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) system that involves two unique KAS IIIs (AsuC3 and C4) in the biosynthesis of the upper triene chain of asukamycin. Significantly, AsuC3 and C4 have both initiation and iterative elongation activity, while being functionally biased toward the elongation and initiation steps, respectively. Mutational analysis revealed that their catalytic activities rely on the catalytic triad Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Asn. Unlike other KAS IIIs, AsuC3 and C4 are very promiscuous and can accept various lengths of acyl&#8208;CoAs with either cyclic, branched or linear acyl moieties. By cooperation with the permissive ketoreductase (AsuC7) and dehydratase (AsuC8/C9), a large variety of polyenes can be efficiently synthesized. This study significantly broadens the understanding of KAS IIIs and polyketide biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Substrate&#8208;Controlled Carbonylative Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Keto Amides and Amides from Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed highly selective double carbonylation of alkyl bromides and amines has been developed. Desired &#945;&#8208;keto amides were obtained as the only products. Subsequently, under different conditions, the double and mono&#8208;carbonylation of alkyl iodides with amines were also achieved.







Abstract
Controllable production of &#945;&#8208;keto amides and amides from the same substrates is an attractive goal in the field of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed (double&#8208;)carbonylation. Herein, a novel copper&#8208;catalyzed highly selective double carbonylation of alkyl bromides has been developed. Moderate to good yields of &#945;&#8208;keto amides were obtained as the only products. In the case of alkyl iodides, double&#8208; and mono&#8208;carbonylation can be achieved controllably under different conditions.

         <title>Reversible Uptake of CO2 by Pincer Ligand Supported Dimetallynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible uptake of CO2 by dimetallynes featuring ancillary hemi&#8208;labile pincer ligands is reported. Insertion into the Ge&#8722;Ge/Sn&#8722;Sn bonds yields species containing an E(CO2)E unit, with the mode of ligation of the CO2 fragment being dependent on the Group 14 element. The thermodynamics of CO2 uptake can be established through VT&#8197;NMR, and the chemical consequences of reversibility demonstrated by thermodynamically&#8208;controlled exchange reactions.







Abstract
We report on the reversible uptake of carbon dioxide by dimetallynes featuring ancillary hemi&#8208;labile pincer ligands. Insertion into the Ge&#8722;Ge/Sn&#8722;Sn bonds yields species containing an E(CO2)E unit, with the mode of ligation of the CO2 fragment determined crystallographically being found to be dependent on the identity of the Group 14 element. The thermodynamics of CO2 uptake/loss can be established through VT&#8197;NMR (&#916;H&#176;=+24.6(2.3)&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#916;S&#176;=+64.9(3.8)&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1, &#916;G&#176;298=+5.3(1.9)&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the loss of CO2 in the Ge case), and the chemical consequences of reversibility demonstrated by thermodynamically&#8208;controlled exchange reactions.

         <title>Rational Design of Phe&#8208;BODIPY Amino Acids as Fluorogenic Building Blocks for Peptide&#8208;Based Detection of Urinary Tract Candida Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design and synthesis of the first fluorogenic Phe&#8208;based BODIPY amino acids, and their application to produce peptide&#8208;based agents for rapid and wash&#8208;free labelling of fungal cells is described. This technology has been exploited to develop a sensitive and low&#8208;cost fluorescence&#8208;based assay for the detection of Candida albicans in human urine using simple benchtop spectrophotometers.







Abstract
Fungal infections caused by Candida species are among the most prevalent in hospitalized patients. However, current methods for the detection of Candida fungal cells in clinical samples rely on time&#8208;consuming assays that hamper rapid and reliable diagnosis. Herein, we describe the rational development of new Phe&#8208;BODIPY amino acids as small fluorogenic building blocks and their application to generate fluorescent antimicrobial peptides for rapid labelling of Candida cells in urine. We have used computational methods to analyse the fluorogenic behaviour of BODIPY&#8208;substituted aromatic amino acids and performed bioactivity and confocal microscopy experiments in different strains to confirm the utility and versatility of peptides incorporating Phe&#8208;BODIPYs. Finally, we have designed a simple and sensitive fluorescence&#8208;based assay for the detection of Candida albicans in human urine samples.

         <title>Fast and Durable Intraoperative Near&#8208;infrared Imaging of Ovarian Cancer Using Ultrabright Squaraine Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new squaraine fluorophore OCTL14 displays ultrabright optical properties and optimal pharmacokinetics, allowing high contrast and durable near&#8208;infrared imaging for fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery of ovarian cancer. The primary mechanisms of the tumor targetability of OCTL14 involve its rapid diffusion across tumor vasculature and cellular uptake via organic cation transporters and retention in the lysosome.







Abstract
The residual tumor after surgery is the most significant prognostic factor of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery is actively utilized for tumor localization and complete resection during surgery. However, currently available contrast&#8208;enhancing agents display low on&#8208;target binding, unfavorable pharmacokinetics, and toxicity, thus not ideal for clinical use. Here we report ultrabright and stable squaraine fluorophores with optimal pharmacokinetics by introducing an asymmetric molecular conformation and surface charges for rapid transporter&#8208;mediated cellular uptake. Among the tested, OCTL14 shows low serum binding and rapid distribution into cancer tissue via organic cation transporters (OCTs). Additionally, the charged squaraine fluorophores are retained in lysosomes, providing durable intraoperative imaging in a preclinical murine model of ovarian cancer up to 24&#8197;h post&#8208;injection. OCTL14 represents a significant departure from the current bioconjugation approach of using a non&#8208;targeted fluorophore and would provide surgeons with an indispensable tool to achieve optimal resection.

         <title>Dominance of Cyclobutadienyl Over Cyclopentadienyl in the Crystal Field Splitting in Dysprosium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclobutadienyl ligands produce stronger crystal field splitting than cyclopentadienyl ligands in dysprosium organometallic sandwich complexes, leading to improved performance as single&#8208;molecule magnets.







Abstract
Replacing a monoanionic cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand in dysprosium single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with a dianionic cyclobutadienyl (Cb) ligand in the sandwich complexes [(&#951;4&#8208;Cb&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;)Dy(&#951;5&#8208;C5Me4tBu)(BH4)]&#8722; (1), [(&#951;4&#8208;Cb&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;)Dy(&#951;8&#8208;Pn&#8224;)K(THF)] (2) and [(&#951;4&#8208;Cb&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;)Dy(&#951;8&#8208;Pn&#8224;)]&#8722; (3) leads to larger energy barriers to magnetization reversal (Cb&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=C4(SiMe3)4, Pn&#8224;=1,4&#8208;di(tri&#8208;isopropylsilyl)pentalenyl). Short distances to the Cb&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242; ligands and longer distances to the Cp ligands in 1&#8211;3 are consistent with the crystal field splitting being dominated by the former. Theoretical analysis shows that the magnetic axes in the ground Kramers doublets of 1&#8211;3 are oriented towards the Cb&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242; ligands. The theoretical axiality parameter and the relative axiality parameter Z and Zrel are introduced to facilitate comparisons of the SMM performance of 1&#8211;3 with a benchmark SMM. Increases in Z and Zrel when Cb&#8242;&#8242;&#8242; replaces Cp signposts a route to SMMs with properties that could surpass leading systems.

&lt;p&gt;Replacing a monoanionic cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand in dysprosium single-molecule magnets (SMMs) with a dianionic cyclobutadienyl (Cb) ligand in the sandwich complexes [(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-Cb&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;)Dy(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Linker Molecules Convert Commercial Fluorophores into Tailored Functional Probes during Biolabelling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore functionality with a click: A new biolabelling strategy using bespoke linker structures is introduced that allows to convert commercially available fluorophores into functional probes with high photostability (self&#8208;healing dyes) or dyes with the ability to sense bivalent metal ions resulting in blinking emission.







Abstract
Many life&#8208;science techniques and assays rely on selective labeling of biological target structures with commercial fluorophores that have specific yet invariant properties. Consequently, a fluorophore (or dye) is only useful for a limited range of applications, e.g., as a label for cellular compartments, super&#8208;resolution imaging, DNA sequencing or for a specific biomedical assay. Modifications of fluorophores with the goal to alter their bioconjugation chemistry, photophysical or functional properties typically require complex synthesis schemes. We here introduce a general strategy that allows to customize these properties during biolabelling with the goal to introduce the fluorophore in the last step of biolabelling. For this, we present the design and synthesis of &#8216;linker&#8217; compounds, that bridge biotarget, fluorophore and a functional moiety via well&#8208;established labeling protocols. Linker molecules were synthesized via the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) which facilitates a modular design of linkers with diverse functional properties and bioconjugation&#8208; and fluorophore attachment moieties. To demonstrate the possibilities of different linkers experimentally, we characterized the ability of commercial fluorophores from the classes of cyanines, rhodamines, carbopyronines and silicon&#8208;rhodamines to become functional labels on different biological targets in vitro and in vivo via thiol&#8208;maleimide chemistry. With our strategy, we showed that the same commercial dye can become a photostable self&#8208;healing dye or a sensor for bivalent ions subject to the linker used. Finally, we quantified the photophysical performance of different self&#8208;healing linker&#8211;fluorophore conjugates and demonstrated their applications in super&#8208;resolution imaging and single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Mediated Protein Shuttling between Coacervate&#8208;Based Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteins can be sequestered and released from artificial cells by attachment of DNA strands and using DNA strand displacement reactions. The DNA elements use a combined regulation mechanism of electrostatic interactions and specific sequence recognition. This provides control over rate of protein release, amount of protein released, and the multiplexity of release.







Abstract
The regulation of protein uptake and secretion is crucial for (inter)cellular signaling. Mimicking these molecular events is essential when engineering synthetic cellular systems. A first step towards achieving this goal is obtaining control over the uptake and release of proteins from synthetic cells in response to an external trigger. Herein, we have developed an artificial cell that sequesters and releases proteinaceous cargo upon addition of a coded chemical signal: single&#8208;stranded DNA oligos (ssDNA) were employed to independently control the localization of a set of three different ssDNA&#8208;modified proteins. The molecular coded signal allows for multiple iterations of triggered uptake and release, regulation of the amount and rate of protein release and the sequential release of the three different proteins. This signaling concept was furthermore used to directionally transfer a protein between two artificial cell populations, providing novel directions for engineering lifelike communication pathways inside higher order (proto)cellular structures.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Tunable Chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine Ligands: Application to the Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Arylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine scaffold SBpy was rationally designed and enabled a general and highly enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl halides to aldehydes. This approach is more step&#8208;economic than conventional strategies and allowed the preparation of various diaryl carbinols without the need to use preformed metallic reagents.







Abstract
A new class of chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligands, SBpy, featuring minimized short&#8208;range steric hindrance and structural tunability was rationally designed and developed, and the effectiveness was demonstrated in the first highly enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl halides to aldehydes. In comparison with known approaches using preformed aryl metallic reagents, this reaction is more step&#8208;economical and functional group tolerant. The reaction mechanism and a model of stereocontrol were proposed based on experimental and computational results.

         <title>Spontaneous Membranization in a Silk&#8208;Based Coacervate Protocell Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic alginate/silk coacervate&#8208;based protocell model capable of reversible reconfigurations between semipermeable coacervate vesicles and membrane&#8208;less coacervate droplets is described. Membranization can be reversibly controlled by compositional changes or chemical/enzymatic pH manipulation to adjust the alginate/silk charge ratio. These results open new perspectives in the design of hybrid protocell models with dynamical structural properties.







Abstract
Molecularly crowded coacervate micro&#8208;droplets are useful protocell constructs but the absence of a physical membrane limits their application as cytomimetic models. Auxiliary surface&#8208;active agents have been harnessed to stabilize the coacervate droplets by irreversible shell formation but endogenous processes of reversible membranization have received minimal attention. Herein, we describe a dynamic alginate/silk coacervate&#8208;based protocell model in which membrane&#8208;less droplets are reversibly reconfigured and inflated into semipermeable coacervate vesicles by spontaneous self&#8208;organization of amphiphilic silk polymers at the droplet surface under non&#8208;neutral charge conditions in the absence of auxiliary agents. We show that membranization can be reversibly controlled endogenously by programming the pH within the protocells using an antagonistic enzyme system such that structural reconfigurations in the protocell microstructure are coupled to the trafficking of water&#8208;soluble solutes. Our results open new perspectives in the design of hybrid protocell models with dynamical structural properties.

Previously, we reported an ultra&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive (UPS) nanoprobe library with sharp pH response using copolymerization of two tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomers with distinct p  K  a  . Currently, we generalize the UPS nanoparticle library with tunable pH transitions (pH  t  ) by copolymerization of a tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomer with a series of non&#8208;ionizable monomers. The pH  t  of nanoparticles is fine&#8208;tuned by the non&#8208;ionizable monomers with different hydrophobicity. Each non&#8208;ionizable monomer presents a constant contribution to pH tunability regardless of tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomers. Based on this strategy, we produced two libraries of nanoprobes with continuous pH  t  covering the entire physiological pH range (5.0&#8211;7.4) for fluorescent imaging of endosome maturation and cancers. This generalized strategy provides a powerful toolkit for biological studies and cancer theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Prodrugs of Persulfide and Sulfide: Is There a Pharmacological Difference between the Two in the Context of Rapid Exchanges among Various Sulfur Species in vivo?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide and persulfide are chemically different and one might expect persulfide to be more effective in mediating sulfur signaling because persulfide can directly modify protein cysteine residue. However, rapid scrambling, and interconversions occur among sulfur species. Then there is the question of whether the chemical reactivity differences between sulfide and persulfide would translate into pharmacological differences. Utilizing a delivery system to generate pure hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrogen persulfide (H2S2), and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine persulfide (N&#8208;CysSSH), we examined the activities of sulfide and persulfide in vitro and in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs exhibited increased activities than H2S prodrug. Especially, H2S2 prodrug offers much&#8208;elevated analgesic effects than H2S prodrug in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs also possess a reduced level of toxicity than H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Mushroom Polyketide Synthases Produce the Universal Anthraquinone Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(Pre&#8208;)anthraquinones are widely distributed natural compounds and occur in plants, fungi, microorganisms, and animals, with atrochrysone (  1  ) as the key biosynthetic precursor. Chemical analyses established mushrooms of the genus  Cortinarius  &#8211;the webcaps&#8211; as producers of atrochrysone&#8208;derived octaketide pigments. However, more recent genomic data did not provide any evidence for known atrochrysone carboxylic acid (  4  ) synthases nor any other PKS producing oligocyclic metabolites. Here, we describe an unprecedented class of non&#8208;reducing polyketide synthases (PKS).  In vitro  assays with recombinant enzyme in combination with  in&#160;vivo  product formation in the heterologous host  Aspergillus niger  established CoPKS1 and CoPKS4 of  C.&#160;odorifer  as members of a new class of atrochrysone carboxylic acid synthases. CoPKS4 catalyzed both hepta&#8208; and octaketide synthesis and yielded 6&#8208;hydroxymusizin (  6  ), along with  4  . These first oligocyclic mushroom PKSs illustrate how the biosynthesis of bioactive natural metabolites independently evolved in various groups of life.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of a Nitrogenase Iron Protein Substituted with a Synthetic [Fe4Se4] Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Fe protein of nitrogenase plays multiple roles in substrate reduction and cluster maturation via its redox active [Fe4S4] cluster. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a water&#8208;soluble [Fe4Se4] cluster that is used to substitute the [Fe4S4] cluster of the Azotobacter vinelandii Fe protein (AvNifH). Biochemical, EPR and XAS/EXAFS analyses demonstrate the ability of the [Fe4Se4] cluster to adopt the super&#8208;reduced, all&#8208;ferrous state upon its incorporation into AvNifH. Moreover, these studies reveal that the [Fe4Se4] cluster in AvNifH already assumes a partial all&#8208;ferrous state ([Fe4Se4]0) in the presence of dithionite, where its [Fe4S4] counterpart in AvNifH exists solely in the reduced state ([Fe4S4]1+). Such a discrepancy in the redox properties of the AvNifH&#8208;associated [Fe4Se4] and [Fe4S4] clusters can be used to distinguish the differential redox requirements for the substrate reduction and cluster maturation of nitrogenase, pointing to the utility of chalcogen&#8208;substituted FeS clusters in future mechanistic studies of nitrogenase catalysis and assembly.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) activatable fluorescent probes can potentially provide a high target&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deep tissue penetration. However, most of the reported NIR&#8208;II activatable small&#8208;molecule probes exhibit poor versatility owing to the lack of a general and stable optically tunable group. In this study, we designed NIRII&#8208;HDs, a novel dye scaffold optimized for NIR&#8208;II probe development. In particular, dye NIRII&#8208;HD5 showed the best optical properties such as proper p  K  a value, excellent stability, and high NIR&#8208;II brightness, which can be beneficial for in vivo imaging with high contrast. To demonstrate the applicability of the NIRII&#8208;HD5 dye, we designed three target&#8208;activatable NIR&#8208;II probes for ROS, thiols, and enzymes. Using these novel probes, we not only realized reliable NIR&#8208;II imaging of different diseases in mouse models but also evaluated the redox potential of liver tissue during a liver injury  in vivo  with high fidelity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosylation is catalyzed by glycosyltransferases using sugar nucleotides or occasionally lipid&#8208;linked phosphosugars as donors. However, only very few common sugar nucleotides that occur in humans can be obtained readily, while the majority of sugar nucleotides that exist in bacteria, plants, archaea, or viruses cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by either enzymatic or chemical synthesis. The limited availability of such rare sugar nucleotides is one of the major obstacles that has greatly hampered progress in glycoscience. Herein we describe a general cofactor&#8208;driven cascade conversion strategy for the efficient synthesis of sugar nucleotides. The described strategy allows the large&#8208;scale preparation of rare sugar nucleotides from common sugars in high yields and without the need for tedious purification processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Boron Carbide on Titanium Dioxide Nanobelt Arrays for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalytic NO Reduction to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic NO reduction is regarded as an attractive strategy to degrade NO contaminant into useful NH3, but the lack of efficient and stable electrocatalysts to facilitate such multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer processes impedes its applications. Here, we report on developing amorphous B2.6C supported on a TiO2 nanoarray on a Ti plate (a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti) as an NH3&#8208;producing nanocatalyst with appreciable activity and durability toward the NO electroreduction. It shows a yield of 3678.6 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a FE of 87.6%, superior to TiO2/Ti (563.5 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, 42.6%) and a&#8208;B2.6C/Ti (2499.2 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, 85.6%). An a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Zn&#8211;NO battery achieves a power density of 1.7 mW cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 1125 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. An in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms is gained by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

It shows a yield of 3678.6 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a FE of 87.6%, superior to TiO2/Ti (563.5 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, 42.6%) and a-B2.6C/Ti (2499.2 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, 85.6%). An a-B2.6C@TiO2/Ti-based Zn&#8211;NO battery achieves a power density of 1.7 mW cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 1125 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. An in-depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms is gained by theoretical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Reduction with NIR Light of Nucleus Targeting Pt(IV) Nanoparticles for Combined Tumor&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy and Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of Pt(IV) prodrugs which are selectively reduced within cancerous cells into their Pt(II) therapeutically active species has received increasing attention within the last decade. Despite recent research progress, the majority of investigated compounds are excited using ultraviolet or blue light. As the light penetration depth is low at these wavelengths, the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors is limited. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of Pt(IV) functionalized nanoparticles that could be excited within the NIR region at 808 nm is reported. The polymer backbone which can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles was functionalized with Pt(IV) complexes for chemotherapy, photosensitizers for photodynamic immunotherapy, and nucleus/cancer&#8208;targeting peptides. Upon irradiation, the Pt(IV) center is reduced to Pt(II) and the axially coordinated ligands are released, presenting a multimodal treatment. While selectively accumulating in tumorous tissue, the nanoparticles demonstrated to eradicate a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer tumor inside a mouse model.</dc:description>

         <title>Superstable and Intrinsically Self&#8208;healing Fibrous Membrane with Bionic Confined Protective Structure for Breathable Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considerable efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of electronic skin that can imitate the self&#8208;healing and sensing function of biological skin. Almost all self&#8208;healing electronic skins are composed of airtight elastomers or hydrogels, which will cause skin inflammation. Fibrous membranes are ideal materials for preparing highly sensitive breathable electronic skin. However, the development of intrinsically self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes with high stability is still a challenge. Here, a novel interface protective strategy is reported to develop intrinsically self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes with a bionic confined structure for the first time, which were further assembled into an all&#8208;fiber structured electronic skin through interfacial hydrogen bonding. The electronic skin is multifunctional with self&#8208;powering, self&#8208;healing, breathability, stretchability, and thermochromism functionalities, which is highly promising for application in intelligent wearable sensing systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Dynamic Microbial Fe(III) Respiration Metabolism with a Living Cell&#8208;Compatible Electron&#8208;Sensing Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monitoring the microbial metabolism is vital for biomanufacturing processes optimization. However, it remains a grand challenge to offer insight into the microbial metabolism due to particularly complex and dynamic processes. Here, we report an electron&#8208;sensing probe Zn  2  GeO  4  :Mn@Fe  3+&#160;  for real&#8208;time and dynamic monitoring of Fe(III) respiration metabolism. The quenched persistent luminescence of ZGO:Mn@Fe  3+&#160;  is recovered when Fe  3+&#160;  accepted electrons from the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolism, enabling the real&#8208;time monitoring of microbial metabolism. The probe shows the capability to verify the role of related biomolecules in microbial Fe(III) respiration metabolism, to track the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolic response to environmental stress and microbial co&#8208;culture interactions. Furthermore, the Zn  2  GeO  4  :Mn@Fe  3+&#160;  probe provides guidance for improving biosynthesis efficiency by monitoring Fe redox recycling in microbial co&#8208;culture.</dc:description>

Starting from readily accessible 3&#8208;substituted indoles, a dearomatization of the indole core was accomplished upon irradiation at &#955; = 420 nm in the presence of thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (10 mol%) as the sensitizer. Based on mechanistic evidence (triplet energy determination, deuteration experiments, by&#8208;product analysis) it is proposed that the reaction proceeds by energy transfer via a 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;diradical intermediate. The latter intermediates are formed by excited state hydrogen atom transfer from suitable alkyl groups within the C3 substituent to the indole C2 carbon atom. Subsequent ring closure proceeds with pronounced diastereoselectivity to generate a 4&#8208; or 5&#8208;membered spirocyclic dearomatized product with several options for further functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Two&#8208;Phase Approach to Fusicoccane Synthesis To Uncover a Compound That Reduces Tumourigenesis in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;phase route for the synthesis of fusicoccane diterpenes enabled the total synthesis of alterbrassicicene D (1) and 3(11)&#8208;epoxyhypoestenone (2) and the structural determination of 2. The route yielded 15&#8197;g of 3 in eight steps from (R)&#8208;limonene and 720&#8197;mg of the penultimate intermediate in a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free manner. This penultimate intermediate was found to have tumourigenesis&#8208;abolishing potential.







Abstract
Alterbrassicicene D (1) and 3(11)&#8208;epoxyhypoestenone (2) were synthesised via a two&#8208;phase approach featuring concise construction of the 5&#8208;8&#8208;5 tricyclic intermediate and a tandem base&#8208;mediated epoxide opening&#8211;transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade to forge the complex skeleton of 2. The route is scalable and we generated 15&#8197;g of the tricyclic intermediate in 8 steps from (R)&#8208;limonene and 720&#8197;mg of the penultimate bioactive intermediate in a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free manner. Our synthesis enabled the structural determination of 2 and provided materials for preliminary anticancer evaluation. The penultimate intermediate showed therapeutic potential in terms of its ability to dramatically reduce the tumourigenic potential of PANC&#8208;1 pancreatic cancer cells according to a limiting dilution tumour&#8208;initiating assay. Our synthetic approach will facilitate unified access to naturally occurring fusicoccanes and their derivatives for anticancer evaluation.

&lt;p&gt;Alterbrassicicene D (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and 3(11)-epoxyhypoestenone (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) were synthesised via a two-phase approach featuring concise construction of the 5-8-5 tricyclic intermediate and a tandem base-mediated epoxide opening&#8211;transannular oxa-Michael addition cascade to forge the complex skeleton of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. The route is scalable and we generated 15&#8197;g of the tricyclic intermediate in 8 steps from (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-limonene and 720&#8197;mg of the penultimate bioactive intermediate in a protecting-group-free manner. Our synthesis enabled the structural determination of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and provided materials for preliminary anticancer evaluation. The penultimate intermediate showed therapeutic potential in terms of its ability to dramatically reduce the tumourigenic potential of PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells according to a limiting dilution tumour-initiating assay. Our synthetic approach will facilitate unified access to naturally occurring fusicoccanes and their derivatives for anticancer evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Acridinium Salts by the Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Cyclization of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Iminiums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of catalyst stereocontrol in Friedel&#8211;Crafts 6&#960; electrocyclizations through ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums was demonstrated. Upon stereoconvergent activation using chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts (HB*), enantioselectivity was governed by means of ion&#8208;pairing catalysis. Combined with a stereospecific oxidation, atropisomeric acridinium salts were accessible with up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7 e.r. and 96&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Quinone methides are fundamental intermediates for a wide range of reactions in which catalyst stereocontrol is often achieved by hydrogen bonding. Herein, we describe the feasibility of an intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts 6&#960; electrocyclization through ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums stereocontrolled by a contact ion pair. A disulfonimide catalyst activates racemic trichloroacetimidate substrates and imparts stereocontrol in the cyclization step, providing a new avenue for selective ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminium functionalization. A highly stereospecific oxidation readily transforms the enantioenriched acridanes into rotationally restricted acridiniums. Upon ion exchange, the method selectively affords atropisomeric acridinium tetrafluoroborate salts in high yields and an enantioenrichment of up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7 e.r. We envision that ion&#8208;pairing catalysis over ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums enables the selective synthesis of a diversity of heterocycles and aniline derivatives with distinct stereogenic units.

         <title>Selective Electrooxidation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Alcohols to Aldehydes in a Neutral Medium: Promoted Water Dissociation over a Nickel&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
Selective oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to produce 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) was achieved in neutral medium over single&#8208;atom Ru supported on NiO (Ru1&#8208;NiO). Single&#8208;atom Ru sites boost HMF oxidation by facilitating water dissociation, which generates electrophilic OH* as a key reactant. The substrate scope was extended to produce aldehydes from various biomass&#8208;derived alcohols. Key: Ni (light gray), Ru (green), O (red), C (dark gray), H (white).







Abstract
The biomass&#8208;derived alcohol oxidation reaction (BDAOR) holds great promise for sustainable production of chemicals. However, selective electrooxidation of alcohols to value&#8208;added aldehyde compounds is still challenging. Herein, we report the electrocatalytic BDAORs to selectively produce aldehydes using single&#8208;atom ruthenium on nickel oxide (Ru1&#8208;NiO) as a catalyst in the neutral medium. For electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), Ru1&#8208;NiO exhibits a low potential of 1.283&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and an optimal 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) selectivity of 90&#8201;%. Experimental studies reveal that the neutral electrolyte plays a critical role in achieving a high aldehyde selectivity, and the single&#8208;atom Ru boosts HMF oxidation in the neutral medium by promoting water dissociation to afford OH*. Furthermore, Ru1&#8208;NiO can be extended to selective electrooxidation of a series of biomass&#8208;derived alcohols to corresponding aldehydes, which are conventionally difficult to obtain in the alkaline medium.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Covalent Organic Frameworks for Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework photocatalyst (COF&#8208;TfpBpy) showed excellent activity for H2O2 photosynthesis with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.57&#8201;% at 298&#8197;K and 1.08&#8201;% at 333&#8197;K. The photocatalytic process involves a 2&#8201;e&#8722; water oxidation and 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction from water and air. The photocatalytic H2O2 solution can be directly used for Rhodamine B degradation and sterilization of E.&#8197;coli.







Abstract
Synthesizing H2O2 from water and air via a photocatalytic approach is ideal for efficient production of this chemical at small&#8208;scale. However, the poor activity and selectivity of the 2&#8201;e&#8722; water oxidation reaction (WOR) greatly restricts the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production. Herein we prepare a bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework photocatalyst (denoted as COF&#8208;TfpBpy) for H2O2 production from water and air. The solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency at 298&#8197;K and 333&#8197;K is 0.57&#8201;% and 1.08&#8201;%, respectively, which are higher than the current reported highest value. The resulting H2O2 solution is capable of degrading pollutants. A mechanistic study revealed that the excellent photocatalytic activity of COF&#8208;TfpBpy is due to the protonation of bipyridine monomer, which promotes the rate&#8208;determining reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722; WOR) and then enhances Yeager&#8208;type oxygen adsorption to accelerate 2&#8201;e&#8722; one&#8208;step oxygen reduction. This work demonstrates, for the first time, the COF&#8208;catalyzed photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and air; and paves the way for wastewater treatment using photocatalytic H2O2 solution.

         <title>Construction of an Autocatalytic Hybridization Assembly Circuit for Amplified In Vivo MicroRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reproducing dandelion&#8208;like autocatalytic hybridization assembly (AHA) circuit was proposed for in vivo amplified bioimaging research where the initiator promoted the autonomous cross&#8208;activation of the cascade hybridization reaction (CHR) and catalytic DNA assembly (CDA) components.







Abstract
Lowly expressed analyte in complex cytoplasmic milieu necessitates the development of non&#8208;enzymatic autocatalytic DNA circuits with high amplification and anti&#8208;interference performance. Herein, we engineered a versatile and robust stimuli&#8208;responsive autocatalytic hybridization assembly (AHA) circuit for high&#8208;performance in vivo bioanalysis. Under a moderately confined condition, the initiator motivated the autonomous and cooperative cross&#8208;activation of cascade hybridization reaction and catalytic DNA assembly for generating an exponentially amplified readout without the parasite steric hindrance and random diffusion side effects. The AHA circuit was systematically investigated by a series of experimental studies and theoretical simulations. The successively guaranteed target recognition and synergistically accelerated signal&#8208;amplification enabled the sensitive and selective detection of analyte, and realized the robust miRNA imaging in living cells and mice. This autocatalytic DNA circuit could substantially expand the toolbox for accurate diagnosis and programmable therapeutics.

         <dc:description>The syntheses, reactivity and electronic structure analyses of [Ru(PPh  3  )  2  (ZnMe)  4  H  2  ],  1a  , and [Ru(PPh  3  )  2  (ZnPh)  4  H  2  ],  2b  , are reported.  1a  exhibits an 8&#8208;coordinate Ru centre with axial phosphines and a symmetrical (2:2) arrangement of ZnMe ligands in the equatorial plane. The ZnMe ligands in  1a  undergo facile, sequential exchange with ZnPh  2  to give  2b  , which shows a 3:1 arrangement of ZnPh ligands. Both  1a  and  2b  exist in equilibrium with their respective 3:1 and 2:2 isomers. Mechanisms for ZnMe/ZnPh exchange and isomerisation are proposed using DFT calculations. The relationships of these {Ru(ZnR)  4  H  2  } species to isoelectronic group 8 transition metal polyhydrides and related Schlenk equilibria in the Negishi reaction are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Coupling of 1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;Boronic Esters at the more</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;boronic esters are useful synthetic intermediates particularly as the two boronic esters can be selectively functionalized. Usually, the less hindered primary boronic ester reacts, but herein, we report a coupling reaction that enables the reversal of this selectivity. This is achieved through the formation of a boronate complex with an electron&#8208;rich aryllithium which, in the presence of an electron&#8208;deficient aryl nitrile, leads to the formation of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex. Following visible&#8208;light photoinduced electron transfer, a primary radical is generated which isomerizes to the more stable secondary radical before radical&#8211;radical coupling with the arene radical&#8211;anion, giving &#946;&#8208;aryl primary boronic ester products. The reactions proceed under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. This method also allows stereodivergent coupling of cyclic  cis  &#8208;1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters to provide  trans  &#8208;substituted products, complementing the selectivity observed in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Emission of Phosphonium Fluorophores Harnessed by the Pathways of Photoinduced Counterion Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties of a series of multipolar donor&#8211;acceptor phosphonium fluorophores (D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;)nA+[X&#8722;] have been investigated. These dyes exhibit steady&#8208;state panchromatic luminescence attributed to the photoinduced counterion migration. The intra&#8208;ion&#8208;pair dynamics and the fluorescence response can be rationally tuned on the molecular level that might broaden the scope of functionalities and stimulate the development of new ionic systems.







Abstract
In the emerging field of intramolecular charge transfer induced counterion migration, we report the new insights into photophysical features of luminescent donor&#8211;acceptor phosphonium dyes (D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;)nA+[X&#8722;] (&#960;=&#8722;(C6H4)x&#8722;). The unique connectivity of the phosphorus atom affords multipolar molecules with a variable number of arms and the electronic properties of the acceptor group. In the ion&#8208;paired form, the transition from dipolar to quadrupolar configuration enhances the low energy migration&#8208;induced band by providing the additional pathways for anion motion. The multipolar architecture, adjustable lengths of the &#960;&#8208;spacers and the nature of counterions allow for efficient tuning of the emission and achieving nearly pure white light with quantum yields around 30&#8201;%. The methyl substituent at the phosphorus atom reduces the rate of ion migration and suppresses the red shifted bands, simultaneously improving total emission intensity. The results unveil the harnessing of the multiple emission of phosphonium fluorophores by anion migration via structure and branching of donor&#8211;acceptor arms.

         <title>Predicting the Solubility of Inorganic Ions Pairs in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using alkali&#8208;polyoxometalate salts, a previously&#8208;undescribed solubility trend in polyoxometalate chemistry was discovered, termed anomalous solubility. Mapping charge&#8208;density on inorganic polyatomic anions along with an artificial neural network accurately describes and predicts solubility trends of alkali&#8208;anion pairs. Solubility experiments to validate computation leads to new POMs discovery.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs), ranging in size from 1 to 10&#8217;s of nanometers, resemble building blocks of inorganic materials. Elucidating their complex solubility behavior with alkali&#8208;counterions can inform natural and synthetic aqueous processes. In the study of POMs ([Nb24O72H9]15&#8722;, Nb24) we discovered an unusual solubility trend (termed anomalous solubility) of alkali&#8208;POMs, in which Nb24 is most soluble with the smallest (Li+) and largest (Rb/Cs+) alkalis, and least soluble with Na/K+. Via computation, we define a descriptor (&#963;&#8208;profile) and use an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict all three described alkali&#8208;anion solubility trends: amphoteric, normal (Li+&gt;Na+&gt;K+&gt;Rb+&gt;Cs+), and anomalous (Cs+&gt;Rb+&gt;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+). Testing predicted amphoteric solubility affirmed the accuracy of the descriptor, provided solution&#8208;phase snapshots of alkali&#8211;POM interactions, yielded a new POM formulated [Ti6Nb14O54]14&#8722;, and provides guidelines to exploit alkali&#8211;POM interactions for new POMs discovery.

         <title>Fluorination and Betaine Modification Augment the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier&#8208;Crossing Ability of Cylindrical Polymer Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that fluorination augments the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetration of cylindrical polymer brushes by altering the surface state, and betaine modification achieves this function via a betaine transporter BGT1 expressed on brain capillaries.







Abstract
Blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing ability of drugs is of paramount importance for the treatments of central nervous system diseases. However, the known methods for drug transport across the BBB are generally complicated and inefficient, and exhibit serious side effects in some cases. Herein, we report an exciting finding that fluorination and betaine modification can significantly augment the BBB&#8208;crossing ability of cylindrical polymer brushes (CPBs), which was demonstrated by the comparison with the CPBs modified with alkyl and poly(ethylene glycol) chains, respectively. We surmise that fluorination enhances the BBB penetration of the CPBs by increasing the hydrophobicity and reducing the surface energy, and betaine medication achieves this function via a betaine transporter BGT1 expressed on brain capillaries. By means of an in vitro BBB model, we demonstrated that the CPBs penetrated the BBB through transendothelial transport. This work provides a novel strategy for enhancing the BBB&#8208;crossing ability of nanomaterials.

         <title>Helicity Modulation in NIR&#8208;Absorbing Porphyrin&#8208;Ryleneimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereochemistry and curvature of porphyrin&#8208;based nanographenes change in response to coordination of metal ions and heat. By judicious choice of ionic radii, peripheral substituents and apical ligands, it is possible to control the thermodynamics and kinetics of isomerization, to achieve conversion between achiral and chiral structures.







Abstract
Peripheral substitution of a &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrin with bulky groups produces a curved chromophore with four helical stereogenic units. The curvature and stereochemistry of such porphyrins can be controlled by varying the substituents, coordinated metal ions, and apical ligands. In particular, when the achiral saddle&#8208;shaped free bases are treated with large metal ions, i.e., CdII or HgII, the resulting complexes convert to chiral propeller&#8208;like configurations. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses show that apical coordination of a water molecule is sufficient to induce a notable bowl&#8208;like distortion of the cadmium complex, which however retains its chiral structure. For phenyl&#8208; and tolyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, the conversion is thermodynamically controlled, whereas complexes bearing bulky 4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl groups transform into their chiral forms upon heating. In the latter case, the chiral Hg porphyrin was converted into the corresponding free base and other metal complexes without any loss of configurational purity, ultimately providing access to stable, enantiopure porphyrin propellers.

         <dc:description>
A highly efficient atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bipyrroles bearing an N&#8722;N linkage from simple hydrazine and 1,4&#8208;diones is presented. Further product derivatizations led to axially chiral bifunctional compounds with high potential in asymmetric catalysis. For this chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed double Paal&#8211;Knorr reaction, an intriguing Fe(OTf)3&#8208;induced enantiodivergence was also observed.

         <title>DREAMTIME NMR Spectroscopy: Targeted Multi&#8208;Compound Selection with Improved Detection Limits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DREAMTIME NMR overcomes spectral overlap and increases sensitivity, opening a new world for targeted NMR detection. A user can define any unique suite of compounds and isolate them without complex sample preparation. DREAMTIME can be directly joined to any existing NMR experiment (1D, nD or MRI) and holds promise for all areas of science from chemical engineering, through environmental monitoring, to medical diagnosis.







Abstract
NMR/MRI are critical tools for studying molecular structure and interactions but suffer from relatively low sensitivity and spectral overlap. Here, a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) approach, termed DREAMTIME, is introduced that provides &#8220;a molecular window&#8221; inside complex systems, capable of showing only what the user desires, with complete molecular specificity. The user chooses a list of molecules of interest, and the approach detects only those targets while all other molecules are invisible. The approach is demonstrated in whole human blood and urine, small living aquatic organisms in 1D/2D NMR, and MRI. Finally, as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, once overlap is removed via DREAMTIME, a novel &#8220;multi&#8208;focusing&#8221; approach can be used to increase sensitivity. In human blood and urine, sensitivity increases of 7&#8211;12 fold over standard 1H NMR are observed. Applicable even to unknowns, DREAMTIME has widespread application, from monitoring product formation in organic chemistry to monitoring/identifying suites of molecular targets in complex media or in vivo.

         <title>Reversibly Photoswitching Upconversion Nanoparticles for Super&#8208;Sensitive Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An upconverting nanoparticle probe can be switched on and off by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for multiple cycles of photoacoustic imaging (PA). Through reversible modulation of the probe PA activation state, a background&#8208;free PA signal can be recovered in imaging 0.05&#8197;nM of the probe in hemoglobin (Hb) solution and 104 labeled cancer cells subcutaneously implanted in mice.







Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) imaging uses light excitation to generate the acoustic signal for detection and improves tissue penetration depth and spatial resolution in the clinically relevant depth of living subjects. However, strong background signals from blood and pigments have significantly compromised the sensitivity of PA imaging with exogenous contrast agents. Here we report a nanoparticle&#8208;based probe design that uses light to reversibly modulate the PA emission to enable photoacoustic photoswitching imaging (PAPSI) in living mice. Such a nanoprobe is built with upconverting nanocrystals and photoswitchable small molecules and can be switched on by NIR light through upconversion to UV energy. Reversibly photoswitching of the nanoprobe reliably removed strong tissue background, increased the contrast&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and thus improved imaging sensitivity. We have shown that PAPSI can image 0.05&#8197;nM of the nanoprobe in hemoglobin solutions and 104 labeled cancer cells after implantation in living mice using a commercial PA imager.

         <title>Combining a Genetically Engineered Oxidase with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) for Highly Efficient Biocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immobilization of d&#8208;amino acid oxidase in crystalline frameworks at high protein loading is reported. A biocomposite of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (BioHOF&#8208;1) shows excellent retention of activity. Fusion to the positively charged module Zbasic2 (Z&#8208;DAAO) promotes incorporation of the active enzyme. Protein engineering can facilitate development of framework&#8208;based enzyme composites, as shown with three further examples of industrial enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymes incorporated into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) via bottom&#8208;up synthesis are promising biocomposites for applications in catalysis and sensing. Here, we explored synthetic incorporation of d&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO) with the metal&#8208;free tetraamidine/tetracarboxylate&#8208;based BioHOF&#8208;1 in water. N&#8208;terminal enzyme fusion with the positively charged module Zbasic2 strongly boosted the loading (2.5&#8208;fold; &#8776;500&#8197;mg enzyme gmaterial&#8722;1) and the specific activity (6.5&#8208;fold; 23&#8197;U&#8201;mg&#8722;1). The DAAO@BioHOF&#8208;1 composites showed superior activity with respect to every reported carrier for the same enzyme and excellent stability during catalyst recycling. Further, extension to other enzymes, including cytochrome P450 BM3 (used in the production of high&#8208;value oxyfunctionalized compounds), points to the versatility of genetic engineering as a strategy for the preparation of biohybrid systems with unprecedented properties.

Read all about it in @angew_chemEvidence for iron in its unusual oxidation state +I is found from a study on a series of iron&#8211;oxalate complexes in solution and involving a combination of infrared free liquid matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, cryogenic ion trap vibrational spectroscopy and ab initio calculations.







Abstract
Exotic oxidation states of the first&#8208;row transition metals have recently attracted much interest. In order to investigate the oxidation states of a series of iron&#8211;oxalate complexes, an aqueous solution of iron(III) nitrate and oxalic acid was studied by infrared free liquid matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization as well as ionspray mass spectrometry. Here, we show that iron is not only detected in its common oxidation states +II and +III, but also in its unusual oxidation state +I, detectable in both positive&#8208;ion and in negative&#8208;ion modes, respectively. Vibrational spectra of the gas phase anionic iron oxalate complexes [FeIII(C2O4)2]&#8722;, [FeII(C2O4)CO2]&#8722;, and [FeI(C2O4)]&#8722; were measured by means of infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and their structures were assigned by comparison to anharmonic vibrational spectra based on second&#8208;order perturbation theory.

         <title>Allosteric Binding&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Mechanical&#8208;Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, polymer mechanochemistry has attracted much scientific interest due to its potential to develop degradable polymers. When the two ends of a polymer chain experience a linear pulling stress, molecular strain builds up, at sufficiently strong force, a bond scission of the weakest covalent bond results. In contrast, bond&#8208;breaking events triggered by conformational stress are much less explored. Here, we discovered that a Zn salen complex would undergo conformational switching upon allosteric complexation with alkanediammonium guests. By controlling the guest chain length, the torsional strain experienced by Zn complex can be modulated to induce bond cleavage with chemical stimulus, and reactivity trend is predicted by conformational analysis derived by DFT calculation. Such strain&#8208;release reactivity by Zn(salen) complex initiated by guest binding is reminiscent of conformation&#8208;induced reactivity of enzymes to enable chemical events that are otherwise inhibited.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Halogen&#8208;Ion Leaching Regulates Multiple Sites on Tandem Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem catalysts can divide the reaction into distinct steps by local multiple sites thus are attractive to trigger CO  2  RR to C  2+  products  . However, the evolution of catalysts generally exists during CO  2  RR, thus a closer investigation of  the reconstitution  , interplay, and active origin of dual components in tandem catalysts is warranted. Here, taking AgI&#8208;CuO as conceptual  tandem catalysts  , we uncovered the interaction of two phases during electrochemical reconstruction. Multiple operando techniques unraveled that in situ iodine ion leaching from AgI restrain the entire reduction of CuO to acquiring stable active Cu  0  /Cu  +  species during the CO  2  RR. That way, the residual iodine of Ag matrix accelerated CO generation and iodine&#8208;induced Cu  0  /Cu  +  promote C&#8208;C coupling. This self&#8208;adaptive dual&#8208;optimization endowed our catalysts excellent C  2+  Faradaic efficiency of 68.9%. Material operando changes in this work offer a new approach of manipulating active species towards enhancing C  2+  products.</dc:description>

         <title>Environmentally Benign Biosynthesis of Hierarchical MOF/Bacterial Cellulose Composite Sponge for Nerve Agent Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of MOF polymer composite materials enables the practical applications of MOF&#8208;based technology, in particular for protective suits and masks. However, traditional production methods typically require organic solvent for processing which leads to environment pollution, low loading efficiency, poor accessibility, and loss of functionality due to poor solvent resistance property. For the first time, we have developed a microbial synthesis strategy to prepare a MOF/cellulose nanofiber composite sponge. The prepared sponge exhibited a hierarchically porous structure, high MOF loading (up to ~90%), good solvent resistance, and high catalytic activity for the liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;state hydrolysis of nerve agent simulants. Moreover, the bacterial cellulose/MOF composite sponge reported here showed a nearly 8&#8208;fold enhancement in the protection against an ultra&#8208;toxic nerve agent (GD) in permeability studies as compared to a commercialized adsorptive carbon cloth. The results shown here present an essential step toward the practical of application of MOF&#8208;based protective gear against nerve agents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Enzyme catalysis has been increasingly engaged in reversible deactivation radical polymerization (Enz&#8208;RDRP) on account of its mildness, efficiency, and sustainability. In this minireview, we discuss the key roles of enzymes played in RDRP, including ATRPase, initiase, deoxygenation, and photoenzyme activities. We use selected examples to highlight applications of Enz&#8208;RDRP in surface brush fabrication, sensing, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, and high&#8208;throughput synthesis. We finally provide our reflection on the challenges and future directions in this emerging area.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternating Current Electrolysis Enabled Formal C&#8208;O/O&#8208;H Cross&#8208;Metathesis of 4&#8208;Alkoxy Anilines with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While multiple bond metathesis reactions, for example olefin metathesis, have seen considerable recent progress, direct metathesis of traditionally inert C&#8208;O single bonds is extremely rare and particularly challenging. Undoubtedly, metathesis reaction of C&#8208;O bonds is one of the most ideal routes for the value&#8208;added upgrading of molecules involving C&#8208;O bonds. Reported here is a new protocol to achieve the formal C&#8208;O/O&#8208;H cross&#8208;metathesis via alternating current electrolysis. Featuring mild reaction conditions, the protocol allows readily available 4&#8208;alkoxy anilines and alcohols to be converted into a wide range of valuable products in highly regioselective and chemoselective manner. Moreover, the present strategy can be used in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals as well as biologically active compounds, which demonstrated the potential application.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Propyne/propylene (C  3  H  4  /C  3  H  6  ) separation is an important but challenging industrial process to produce polymer grade C  3  H  6  and recover high purity C  3  H  4  . Herein, we report an ultrastable TiF  6  2&#8208;  anion cross&#8208;linked metal organic framework (ZNU&#8208;2) with precisely controlled pore size, shape and functionality for benchmark C  3  H  4  storage (3.9/7.7 mmol/g at 0.01/1.0 bar and 298 K) and record high C  3  H  4  /C  3  H  6  (10/90) separation potential (31.0 mol/kg). The remarkable C  3  H  4  /C  3  H  6  (1/99, 10/90, 50/50) separation performance was fully demonstrated by simulated and experimental breakthroughs under various conditions with excellent recyclability and high productivity (42 mol/kg) of polymer grade C  3  H  6  from 1/99 C  3  H  4  /C  3  H  6  mixture. Modelling study revealed that the symmetrical spatial distribution of six TiF  6  2&#8208;  on the icosahedral cage surface provides two distinct binding sites for C  3  H  4  adsorption: one serves as a tailored single C  3  H  4  molecule trap and the other boosts C  3  H  4  accommodation by cooperative host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Serviced&#8208;Track 3D DNA Walker for Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Exosomes by Glycoprotein Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitive and accurate analysis of low&#8208;concentration of tumor&#8208;derived exosomes (Exos) in biofluids is essential for noninvasive cancer diagnosis but still challenging due to the lack of high&#8208;sensitive methods with low&#8208;cost and easy&#8208;operating. Herein, exploiting target Exos as three&#8208;dimensional (3D) track for the first time, we developed a self&#8208;serviced&#8208;track DNA walker (STDW) for wash&#8208;free detection of tumor Exos using exosomal glycoprotein, which was enabled by split aptamer&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated autonomous running powered by catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). Benefiting from high selectivity and sensitivity of STDW assay, direct detection of tumor Exos in cell culture medium and serum could also be realized. Furthermore, this method exhibited high accuracy in clinical diagnosis, offering the potential for early cancer diagnosis and postoperative response prediction.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Cages with {SiW9Ni4} Polyoxotungstate Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A tritopic, Ni&#8208;substituted Keggin cluster, {SiW  9  Ni  4  }, assembles with rigid dicarboxylate linkers to give rise to a set of discrete, POM  2  n  L  3  n  &#8208;type structures (POM = {SiW  9  Ni  4  }) with defined interior voids. The outcome of coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assemblies of these polyhedral cages&#8212;from fused dimers to trigonal prism&#8212;was found to be sensitive to bend angles of the ditopic ligands, which vary from 122&#176; to 180&#176;. These polyoxotungstate&#8208;based metal&#8211; organic polyhedra, when coupled with [Ru(bpy)  3  ]Cl  2  as a photosensitizer and triethanolamine as the electron donor, serve as highly effective catalysts for CO  2  reduction, with turnover numbers up to 328 and CO selectivity as high as 96.2%. The inner cavities of such cage structures, if functionalized or of sufficient size to encapsulate targeted guest molecules, could present a new strategy towards functional materials for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectively Regulating Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Achieving Turn&#8208;on/off the Catalytic Activity in Different CO2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating Lewis acid&#8208;base sites in catalysts to investigate their influence in the chemical fixation of CO2 is significant but challenging. A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with open metal Co sites, {(NH2Me2)[Co3(&#956;3&#8208;OH)(BTB)2(H2O)]&#183; 9H2O&#183;5DMF}n (1), was obtained and the results of catalytic investigation show that 1 can catalyze cycloaddition of CO2 and aziridines with 99% yield. The efficiency in the cyclization of CO2 with propargyl amines is only 32%. To improve the catalytic ability of 1, ligand XN with Lewis base sites was introduced into 1 and coordinated with the open Co sites, resulting in a decrease of the Lewis acid sites and an increase in the Lewis base sites in a related MOF 2 ({(NH2Me2)[Co3&#8208;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)(NHMe2)(BTB)2(XN)]&#183;8H2O&#183;4DMF}n). Selective regulation of the type of active centers causes the yield of oxazolidinones to be enhanced about 2.4 times, suggesting that this strategy can turn on/off the catalytic activity for different reactions. The catalytic results from 2 treated with acid solution support this conclusion. This work illuminates a MOF&#8208;construction strategy that produces efficient catalysts for CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Pyridoxal Probes Unravel Novel Cofactor&#8208;Dependent Targets and Antibiotic Hits in Critical Bacterial Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprecedented bacterial targets are urgently needed to overcome the resistance crisis. Herein we systematically mine pyridoxal phosphate&#8208;dependent enzymes (PLP&#8208;DEs) in bacteria to focus on a target class which is involved in crucial metabolic processes. For this, we tailored eight pyridoxal (PL) probes bearing modifications at various positions. Overall, the probes exceeded the performance of a previous generation and provided a detailed map of  PLP&#8208;DEs in clinically relevant pathogens including challenging Gram&#8208;negative strains. Putative PLP&#8208;DEs with unknown function were exemplarily characterized via in&#8208;depth enzymatic assays. Finally, we screened a panel of  PLP  binders for antibiotic activity and unravelled the targets of hit molecules. Here, an uncharacterized enzyme, essential for bacterial growth, was assigned as  PLP&#8208;dependent cysteine desulfurase and confirmed to be inhibited by the marketed drug phenelzine. Our approach provides a basis for deciphering novel  PLP&#8208;DEs as essential antibiotic targets along with corresponding ways to decipher small molecule inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tailoring enzymes are important modification biocatalysts in natural product biosynthesis. We report herein six orthologous two&#8208;gene clusters for mycocyclosin and guatyromycine biosynthesis. Expression of the cyclodipeptide synthase genes  gymA  1  &#8722;  gymA  6  in  Escherichia coli  resulted in the formation of  cyclo  &#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr as the major product. Reconstruction of the biosynthetic pathways in  Streptomyces albus  and biochemical investigation proved that the cytochrome P450 enzymes GymB  1  &#8722; GymB  6  act as both intramolecular oxidases and intermolecular nucleobase transferases. They catalyze not only the oxidative C&#8208;C coupling within  cyclo  &#8208;l&#8208;Tyr&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr, leading to mycocyclosin, but also its connection with guanine and hypoxanthine, and are thus responsible for the formation of tyrosine&#8208;containing guatyromycines, instead of the reported tryptophan&#8208;nucleobase adducts. Phylogenetic data suggest the presence of at least 47 GymB orthologues, indicating the occurrence of a widely distributed enzyme class.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Single&#8208;Crystalline Hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 with Open Nanoarchitectures via Anisotropic&#8208;Kinetics Transformation for the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an anisotropic&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy to prepare single&#8208;crystalline aluminosilicate  MFI  zeolites (ZSM&#8208;5) with highly open nanoarchitectures and hierarchical porosities. The methodology relies on the cooperative effect of in situ etching and recrystallization on the evolution of pure&#8208;silica  MFI  zeolite (silicalite&#8208;1) nanotemplates under hydrothermal conditions. The strategy enables a controllable preparation of ZSM&#8208;5 nanostructures with diverse open geometries by tuning the relative rate difference between etching and recrystallization processes. Meanwhile, it can also be extended to synthesize other heteroatom&#8208;substituted  MFI  zeolite nanocages. Compared with conventional ZSM&#8208;5 microcrystals, nanocrystals, and nanoboxes, the ZSM&#8208;5 nanocages with single&#8208;crystalline nature, highly open nanoarchitectures, and hierarchical porosities exhibit remarkably enhanced catalytic lifetime and low coking rate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Catalytic Oxidation of Methane to Methanol in Aqueous Medium over Copper Cations Promoted by Atomically Dispersed Rhodium on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conver&#173;sion of methane into value&#8208;added chemicals, such as methanol in mild conditions, is a promising route for industrial applications. In this work, atomically dispersed Rh on TiO2 suspended in the aqueous solution was used for the oxidation of methane to methanol. Promoted by copper cations (as co&#8208;catalyst) in solution, the catalysts exhibited high activity and selectivity for the production of methanol using molecular oxygen with the presence of carbon monoxide at 150 oC with a reaction pressure of 31 bar. Millimole level yields of methanol were reached with the selectivity higher than 99% using the Rh/TiO2 catalysts with the promotion of copper cation. CO was the reductive agent to generate H2 from H2O, which led to the formation of H2O2 through the reaction of H2 and O2. Atomically dispersed Rh activated the C&#8208;H bond in CH4 and catalyzed the oxidation using H2O2. Copper cations maintained the low&#8208;valence state of Rh. Moreover, copper acted as a scavenger for suppressing the overoxidation, thus leading to the high selectivity of methanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Caging Enables the Control of Endogenous DNA Alkyltransferases Activity with Light inside Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of endogenous proteins activity with light inside live cells is helpful for the high spatiotemporal probing of their dynamic roles. Herein, we report the first small&#8208;molecule&#8208;ligand&#8208;directed caging approach to control the endogenous human O  6  &#8208;alkylguanine&#8208;DNA alkyltransferases (AGT) activity with light, and the caged AGT is constructed from the native intracellular AGT. The photo&#8208;responsive O  6  &#8208;benzylguanine derivative O  6  &#8208;NBG3 is developed to site&#8208;specifically cage the AGT's catalytic cysteine residue, and the light irradiation on&#8208;demand restores AGT's activity in vitro, in bacteria, and in mammalian cells. With O  6  &#8208;NBG3, the alkylated AGT is dealkylated for the first time to recover the DNA repair activity in breast cancer MCF&#8208;7 cells by the dose&#8208;dependent light irradiation. This decaging strategy enables the localized modulation of endogenous AGT activity in high temporal precision without genetic engineering, which holds great potential for therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Norbornenylsilanes: Soluble Polymers with Controllable Molecular Properties via Siloxane Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse vulcanized polymers of norbornenylsilanes with hydrolysable chloro&#8208; and ethoxy substituents were prepared and polycondensated to install defined amounts of M, D, or T siloxane bonds. The MW and TG of the soluble and branched polymers containing 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% S could be varied systematically, whereas the elemental composition remained the same. Polymers with a sulfur content of 30&#8197;wt&#8201;% could be prepared without low molar mass impurities.







Abstract
The inverse vulcanization produces high sulfur content polymers from alkenes and elemental sulfur. Control over properties such as the molar mass or the solubility of polymers is not well established, and existing strategies lack predictability or require large variations of the composition. Systematic design principles are sought to allow for a targeted design of materials. Herein, we report on the inverse vulcanization of norbornenylsilanes (NBS), with a different number of hydrolysable groups at the silicon atom. Inverse vulcanization of mixtures of NBS followed by polycondensation yielded soluble high sulfur content copolymers (50&#8197;wt&#8201;% S) with controllable weight average molar mass (MW), polydispersity (&#272;), glass transition temperature (TG), or zero&#8208;shear viscosity (&#951;0). Polycondensation was conducted in the melt with HCl as a catalyst, abolishing the need for a solvent. Purification by precipitation afforded polymers with a greatly reduced amount of low molar mass species.

         <title>Potassium Aluminyl Promoted Carbonylation of Ethene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;promoted carbonylation of alkenes is established for d&#8208;block metals, whilst prior work with aluminium has been limited by reversible C=C coordination and decomposition of CO insertion products. This work shows how the aluminyl anion allows the non&#8208;reversible carbonylation of ethene using carbon monoxide under mild conditions. A bimetallic pathway involving an intramolecular 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift was identified and supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
The potassium aluminyl [K{Al(NONDipp)}]2 ([NONDipp]2&#8722;=[O{SiMe2NDipp}2]2&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) activates ethene towards carbonylation with CO under mild conditions. An isolated bis&#8208;aluminacyclopropane compound reacted with CO via carbonylation of an Al&#8722;C bond, followed by an intramolecular hydrogen shift to form K2[Al(NONDipp)(&#956;&#8208;CH2CH=CO&#8208;1&#954;2C1,3&#8208;2&#954;O)Al(NONDipp)Et]. Restricting the chemistry to a mono&#8208;aluminium system allowed isolation of [Al(NONDipp)(CH2CH2CO&#8208;&#954;2C1,3)]&#8722;, which undergoes thermal isomerisation to form the [Al(NONDipp)(CH2CH=CHO&#8208;&#954;2C,O)]&#8722; anion. DFT calculations highlight the stabilising influence of incorporated benzene at multiple steps in the reaction pathways.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fast diffusion kinetics of NH4+ ions and the abundance of resources have resulted in aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs) gradually emerging as one of most promising approaches for energy storage systems beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This Minireview highlights the most recent advances in electrode materials and electrolytes for AAIBs. An overview of the existing challenges and possible solutions is also given to enable further development of AAIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIB) are a recently emerging technology that utilize the abundant electrode resources and the fast diffusion kinetics of NH4+ to deliver an excellent rate performance at a low cost. Although significant progress has been made on AAIBs, the technology is still limited by various challenges. In this Minireview, the most recent advances are comprehensively summarized and discussed, including cathode and anode materials as well as the electrolytes. Finally, a perspective on possible solutions for the current limitations of AAIBs is provided.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Insights into the Notorious CO Poisoning of Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occupancy and energy of metal d electrons are the two vital factors in d&#8208;band theory. These factors have an effect on CO poisoning with distinct scaling relationships. An increase of Pt 5d band energy strengthens the competitive adsorption between CO and hydrogen, while a decrease of Pt 5d band occupancy lowers the site coverage of CO to promote its association with oxygen.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is notorious for its strong adsorption to poison platinum group metal catalysts in the chemical industry. Here, we conceptually distinguish and quantify the effects of the occupancy and energy of d electrons, emerging as the two vital factors in d&#8208;band theory, for CO poisoning of Pt nanocatalysts. The stepwise defunctionalization of carbon support is adopted to fine&#8208;tune the 5d electronic structure of supported Pt nanoparticles. Excluding other promotional mechanisms, the increase of Pt 5d band energy strengthens the competitive adsorption of hydrogen against CO for the preferential oxidation of CO, affording the scaling relationship between Pt 5d band energy and CO/H2 adsorption energy difference. The decrease of Pt 5d band occupancy lowers CO site coverage to promote its association with oxygen for the total oxidation of CO, giving the scaling relationship between Pt 5d occupancy and activation energy. The above insights outline a molecular&#8208;level understanding of CO poisoning.

         <title>Topochemical Synthesis of a Heterochiral Peptide Polymer in Different Polymorphic Forms from Crystals and Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordering polymers in different packing modes is an ideal method to get different properties from a polymer, but a challenging task. In this study, two polymorphs of a heterochiral dipeptide yielded pseudopolypeptides in parallel and antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangements upon topochemical polymerization (see picture). Synthesis of the parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet polymer could be scaled up by using an aerogel.







Abstract
We have designed a heterochiral dipeptide monomer (N3&#8208;D&#8208;Ala&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;NHCH2C&#8801;CH) modified with an azide group and an alkyne at its termini for topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. We obtained two different polymorphs: PI (P21) from a DCM&#8211;toluene mixture, and PII (P&#8208;1) from a hexane&#8211;ethyl acetate mixture. PI adopts parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing, and PII adopts antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing. In both the cases, molecules from adjacent &#946;&#8208;stacks are arranged in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner. On heating, the polymorphs underwent TAAC reaction to form linear polymers having parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like ordering (PI) and an antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure (PII). PI reacted spontaneously at room temperature and the crystals showed cracking after the reaction, but PII was intact even after complete reaction. The dipeptide congealed various solvents, and the aerogels were identical to PI. These aerogels also underwent spontaneous TAAC reaction at room temperature to yield a pseudoprotein with alternate D&#8208; and L&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Alternating Conjugated Polymers Enabled by Room&#8208; Temperature Stille Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of conjugated polymers (CPs) often suffers from high temperature and indistinct homocoupling structural defects. In this study, the first room&#8208;temperature Stille cross&#8208;coupling polymerization was explored. Surprisingly, this method produced defect&#8208;free CPs, which enhanced their charge transport properties. Therefore, this work paves the road for the development of plastic electronics and optoelectronics.







Abstract
The Stille cross&#8208;coupling polymerization is one of the most efficient synthetic methods for donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs). Nevertheless, thermal&#8208;activation Stille polymerization readily produced homocoupling defects, resulting in batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations in copolymers quality and deteriorating the device performance of electronics and optoelectronics. Here, a room&#8208;temperature Stille&#8208;type polymerization was developed, the utility and generality of which were demonstrated by synthesis of twelve D&#8211;A CPs with high molecular weights. Importantly, the resultant copolymers possessed no homocoupling (hc) structural defects, while hc reactions were observed in the thermal&#8208;activation Stille reactions. Thus, the organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on the former exhibited twofold higher charge transport mobility (2.10&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), since it possessed stronger crystallinity and lower trap density of states (tDOS).

         <title>Extreme Enhancement of Carbon Hydrogasification via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon hydrogasification is the slowest reaction among all carbon&#8208;involved small molecule transformations. Here, we demonstrate a mechanochemical method that results in both a faster reaction rate and a new synthesis route. The reaction rate was dramatically enhanced by up to 4 orders of magnitude compared to the traditional thermal method. Simultaneously, the reaction exhibited very high selectivity (99.8% CH4, versus 80% under thermal conditions) with a cobalt catalyst. Our study demonstrated that this extreme increase in reaction rate originates from the continuous activation of reactive carbon species via mechanochemistry. The high selectivity is intimately related to the activation at low temperature, at which higher hydrocarbons are difficult to form. This work is expected to advance studies of carbon hydrogasification, and other solid&#8208;gas reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Access to Multisubstituted Acrylamides from Cyclic Ketones via Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to access diverse multisubstituted acrylamides from cyclic ketones is realized  via  palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;carbamoylation and ipso&#8208;functionalization of the corresponding enol triflates. The development of bulky C2 secondary amide&#8208;substituted norbornene cocatalysts is the key to achieve the desired reactivity and selectivity. Readily available carbamoyl chlorides serve as effective electrophiles; various moieties including alkenyl, hydrogen, alkynyl, aryl, and alkyl groups can be installed at the ipso position. In addition, tandem &#945;&#8208;carbamoylation/ipso&#8208;annulations are demonstrated to furnish lactam&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds. The utility of this method is exemplified in the streamlined preparation of a platelet&#8208;activating factor (PAF)&#8208;antagonist.</dc:description>

         <title>Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of N&#8208;Propargylamides and Their Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A substantially improved method for living polymerization of  N  &#8208;propargylamides and their derivatives has been developed. Rhodium(I) complexes bearing an aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain can work as excellent initiators of the polymerization of such non&#8208;conjugated terminal alkynes to give the corresponding  cis  &#8208;stereoregular polymers having a narrow molecular weight distribution. The typical living nature has been confirmed by investigating the effects of initial feed ratios of the monomer to the initiator on the molecular weight of the resulting polymers as well as multistage polymerization. Moreover, we demonstrated that the present method enables functionalization of both polymer chain ends and synthesis of novel block co&#8208;polymers consisting of poly(  N  &#8208;propargylamide) and poly(phenylacetylene) blocks with a narrow molecular weight distribution.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfacial Chemistry Modulation for Ultra&#8208;High Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries capable of operating at rate and temperature extremes are highly desirable, but elusive due to the dynamics and thermodynamics limitations. Herein, a strategy of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial chemistry modulation is proposed. The commercial hard carbon demonstrates superior rate performance with 212 mAh g  &#8208;1  at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 5 A g  &#8208;1  in the electrolyte with weak ion solvation/desolvation, which is much higher than those in common electrolytes (nearly no capacity in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes). Even at &#8208;20 &#176;C, a high capacity of 175 mAh g  &#8208;1  (74% of its room temperature capacity) can be maintained at 2 A g  &#8208;1  . Such electrode retains 90% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. As proved, weak ion solvation/desolvation of tetrahydrofuran greatly facilitates fast ion diffusion at SEI/electrolyte interface and homogeneous SEI with well&#8208;distributed NaF and organic components ensures fast Na  +  diffusion through the SEI layer and stable interface.</dc:description>

         <title>ATP&#8208;Induced Emergent Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomimetic ATP&#8208;driven supramolecular assembly is important to understand various biological processes and dissipative systems. Here, we reported an ATP&#8208;driven chiral assembly exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) via the interaction of achiral terpyridine&#8208;based Zn(II) complex with nucleotides. It was found while the metal complexes could co&#8208;assemble with the nucleotides to form fluorescent assemblies, only a combination of furan&#8208;substituted terpyridine complex and ATP showed an intense CPL with a dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 0.20. This meant that the complex could recognize ATP using CPL as a readout signal, thus providing an example of ATP encryption. Interestingly, when ATP was transferred into ADP or AMP under enzymatic hydrolysis, the CPL will decrease or disappear. Addition of ATP will generate CPL again, thus producing an ATP&#8208;induced CPL system. This work presented the first example of ATP&#8208;induced CPL and encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;doped Highly Graphitic Carbon Urchin&#8208;like Hollow Structures Loaded with Single&#8208;Ni Atoms towards Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational design of single&#8208;atom catalysts featuring excellent conductivity, highly accessible discrete active sites and favorable mass transfer is crucial for electrocatalysis but remains challenging. In this study, a reliable Ni&#8208;catalyzed and &#8208;templated strategy is developed to synthesize a single&#8208;atom catalyst by transforming metallic Ni into single&#8208;Ni atoms anchored on hollow porous urchin&#8208;like (HPU) N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(HPU)), which possesses high crystallinity and sufficient Ni&#8208;N4 moiety (2.4 wt%). The unique hollow thorns on the surface, good conductivity and large external surface area facilitate electron/mass transfer and exposure of singe&#8208;Ni sites. As a result, the Ni&#8208;NC(HPU) catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and high stability for CO2 electroreduction. Moreover, this synthetic strategy can also be facilely extended to prepare distinct hollow porous architectures with similar components, such as the wire&#8208; and sphere&#8208;like ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8208;H Borylation of Aminocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;controllable C&#8208;H functionalization remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric catalysis. We herein disclose the first example of iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp  3  )&#8208;H borylation of aminocyclopropanes using simple imides as weakly coordinating directing groups under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeded via a six&#8208;membered iridacycle, affording a vast range of chiral aminocyclopropyl boronates. The current method features a broad spectrum of functional groups (36&#160;examples) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99%). We also demonstrated the synthetic utility by a preparative scale C&#8208;H borylation, C&#8208;B bond transformations, and conversions of the directing group.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transition-metal-catalyzed regio- and stereo-controllable C-H functionalization remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric catalysis. We herein disclose the first example of iridium-catalyzed C(sp  3  )-H borylation of aminocyclopropanes using simple imides as weakly coordinating directing groups under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeded via a six-membered iridacycle, affording a vast range of chiral aminocyclopropyl boronates. The current method features a broad spectrum of functional groups (36&#160;examples) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99%). We also demonstrated the synthetic utility by a preparative scale C-H borylation, C-B bond transformations, and conversions of the directing group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Desaturative Approach for Aromatic Aldehyde Synthesis via Synergistic Enamine, Photoredox and Cobalt Triple Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic aldehydes are fundamental intermediates that are widely utilised for the synthesis of important materials across a broad spectrum of chemical industries. Accessing highly substituted derivatives can often be difficult as their functionalizations are generally performed via electrophilic aromatic substitution, S  E  Ar. Here we provide an alternative and mechanistically distinct approach whereby aromatic aldehydes are assembled from saturated precursors via a desaturative process. This novel strategy harnesses the high&#8208;fidelity of Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions to quickly construct multi&#8208;substituted cyclohexene&#8208;carbaldehyde cores, which undergo desaturation via synergistic interplay of enamine, photoredox and cobalt triple catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Glycoform&#8208;Resolved Dual&#8208;Modal Ratiometric Immunoassay Improves the Diagnostic Precision for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The glycosylation pattern of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) paves the basis for precise early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, existing analytical methods ignore the contribution of terminal sialic acid, which has been reported to be highly connected with HCC. Besides, the development of diagnostic assays is severely hindered by the preparation of anti&#8208;glycans antibodies. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), as synthetic antibody mimics, provide unique strengths to address these issues. Herein, we report a MIPs&#8208;based dual&#8208;modal ratiometric immunoassay for precise HCC diagnosis. Using a &#8220;pit one against ten&#8221; MIP to recognize a subset of glycans containing sialic acid and/or core fucose, we demonstrated our assay exhibited improved precision as compared with ELISA. This assay provided not only a glycoform&#8208;resolved method for precise HCC diagnosis, but also a new paradigm for developing antibody mimics via molecular imprinting towards challenging biomedical applications.</dc:description>
