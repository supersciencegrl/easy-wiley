         <title>Design of Hollow Nanoreactors for Size&#8208; and Shape&#8208;Selective Catalytic Semihydrogenation Driven by Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimicking the structures and functions of cells to create artificial organelles spurs the development of efficient strategies for producing hollow nanoreactors with biomimetic catalytic functions, but it is still rarely reported because of the highly challenging fabrication. Here, we report the design of hollow nanoreactors with hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles. Starting from molecular&#8208;level design strategy, well&#8208;defined hollow multishelled structure phenolic resins (HoMS&#8208;PR) and carbon (HoMS&#8208;C) submicron particles were accurately architected. HoMS&#8208;C can serve as an excellent, versatile platform, owing to its tunable properties with tailored functional sites, for achieving precise spatial location of metal nanoparticles, internally encapsulated (Pd@HoMS&#8208;C) or externally supported (Pd/HoMS&#8208;C). Impressively, the combination of the delicate nanoarchitecture and spatially loaded metal nanoparticles endow the pair of nanoreactors size&#8208;shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition properties in catalytic semihydrogenation, including high activity and selectivity of Pd@HoMS&#8208;C for small aliphatic substrates and Pd/HoMS&#8208;C for large aromatic substrates. Theoretic calculation provides insights into the pair of nanoreactors with distinct behaviors due to the differences in energy barrier of substrate adsorption. This work shed the light on rational design and accurate construction of hollow nanoreactors with precise location of active sites and fine&#8208;modulated microenvironment by mimicking the functions of cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective and Stereospecific &#946;&#8208;Arabinofuranosylation by&#160;Boron&#8208;Mediated Aglycon Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regio&#8208; and stereoselective formation of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanosidic linkage has been in great demand for efficient synthesis of biologically active natural glycosides. In this study, we accomplished a regioselective and &#946;&#8208;stereospecific d&#8208;/l&#8208;arabinofuranosylation promoted by a boronic acid catalyst under mild conditions. The glycosylations proceeded smoothly for a variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors to give the corresponding &#946;&#8208;arabinofuranosides (&#946;&#8208;Arbf) in high yields with complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivities and high regioselectivities. The regioselectivity was completely reversed depending on the optical isomerism of the donor used and was predictable a priori using predictive models. In addition, mechanistic studies using DFT calculations revealed that the present glycosylation occurs via a highly dissociative concerted SNi mechanism. The usefulness of the glycosylation method was demonstrated by the chemical synthesis of trisaccharide structures of arabinogalactan fragments.</dc:description>

         <title>p&#8208;Block Bismuth Nanoclusters Sites Activated by Atomically Dispersed Bismuth for Tandem Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing electrocatalysts with p&#8208;block elements is generally considered rather challenging owing to their closed&#160;d shells. Here for the first time, we present a p&#8208;block&#8208;element Bi&#8208;based catalyst derived from a bismuth&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework featuring a high O coordination number (Bi&#8208;MOF) for the highly selective O2 reduction reaction (ORR) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;STEM) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed the co&#8208;existence of single&#8208;atomic Bi coordinated with O and S&#160;atoms and Bi nanoclusters (Biclu) (collectively denoted as BiOSSA/Biclu). Compared with control samples comprising Bi single atoms or nanoclusters, the catalyst with such a unique structure gives a high selectivity for 2e&#8211; reduction (maximum up to 95%) in RRDE test, and a large current density (36 mA cm&#8211;2 at 0.15 V vs. RHE), a considerable H2O2 yield with high H2O2 Faraday efficiency (11.5 mg cm&#8211;2 h&#8211;1 with FE ~ 90% at 0.3 V vs. RHE) and a long&#8208;term durability (~22 h) in H&#8208;cell test. Interestingly, the experimental data on site poisoning and theoretical calculations both revealed that, for BiOSSA/Biclu, the catalytic active sites are on the Bi clusters, which are further activated by the atomically dispersed Bi coordinated with O and S atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>General Design Concepts for CAPodes as Ionologic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capacitive analogues of semiconductor diodes (CAPodes) present a new avenue for energy&#8208;efficient and nature&#8208;inspired next&#8208;generation computing devices. Here, we disclose the generalized concept for bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable n&#8208; and p&#8208;CAPodes based on selective ion sieving. Controllable&#8208;unidirectional ion flux is realized by blocking electrolyte ions from entering sub&#8208;nanometer pores. The resulting CAPodes exhibit charge&#8208;storage characteristics with a high rectification ratio (96.29%). The enhancement of capacitance is attributed to the high surface area and porosity of an omnisorbing carbon as counter electrode. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of an integrated device in a logic gate circuit architecture to implement &#8216;OR&#8217; logic operations. This work demonstrates CAPodes as a generalized concept to achieve p&#8208;n and n&#8208;p analogue junctions based on selective ion electrosorption, provides a comprehensive understanding and highlights applications of ion&#8208;based diodes in ionologic architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>An In&#8208;Situ Cyanidation Strategy to Access Tetracyanodiacenaphthoanthracene Diimides with High Electron Mobilities Exceeding 10 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of novel highly &#960;&#8208;extended tetracyano&#8208;substituted acene diimides, named as tetracyanodiacenaphthoanthracene diimides (TCDADIs), are synthesized using a facile four&#8208;fold Knoevenagel condensation strategy. Unlike conventional cyano substitution reactions, our approach enables access to a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone with the in&#8208;situ formation of four cyano substitutes at room temperature while avoiding extra cyano&#8208;functionalization reactions. TCDADIs decorated with different N&#8208;alkyl substituents present good solubility, near&#8208;coplanar backbones, good crystallinity, and low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies of &#8722;4.33 eV, all of which contribute to desirable electron&#8208;transport performance when applied to organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFET). The highest electron mobility of OFET based on 2&#8208;hexyldecyl&#8208;substituted TCDADIs single crystal reaches 12.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is not only among the highest values for the reported n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials (OSMs) but also exceeds that of most n&#8208;type OSMs decorated with imide units.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescence Anisotropy in Eutectic Crystals of Polynuclear Lanthanide Complexes and Silver Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anisotropy is an intrinsic property of crystalline materials. However, the photoluminescence anisotropy in eutectic crystals of organometallic complexes has remained unexplored. Herein, the eutectic of polynuclear lanthanide complexes and Ag clusters was prepared, and the crystal shows significant photoluminescence anisotropy. The polarization anisotropy of emission &#948; and degree of excitation polarization P are 2.62 and 0.53, respectively. The rare excitation polarization properties have been proved to be related to the regular arrangement of electric transition dipole moments of luminescent molecules in the crystal. Our design provides a reference for developing new photoluminescence anisotropy materials and expanding their applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Electrophiles with Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In terms of its abundance and its minimal toxicity, iron has advantages relative to other transition metals. Although alkyl&#8211;alkyl bond construction is central to organic synthesis, examples of iron&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8211;alkyl couplings of alkyl electrophiles are relatively sparse. Herein we report an iron catalyst that achieves cross&#8208;coupling reactions of alkyl electrophiles wherein olefins, in the presence of a hydrosilane, are used in place of alkylmetal reagents. Carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation proceeds at room temperature, and the method employs commercially available components (Fe(OAc)2, Xantphos, and Mg(OEt)2); interestingly, this set of reagents can be applied directly to a distinct hydrofunctionalization of olefins, hydroboration. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the generation of an alkyl radical from the alkyl electrophile, as well as with reversibility for elementary steps that precede carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation (olefin binding to iron and &#946;&#8208;migratory insertion).</dc:description>

         <title>Tryptophan in Multicomponent Petasis Reactions for Peptide Stapling and Late&#8208;Stage Functionalisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide stapling is a robust strategy for generating enzymatically stable, macrocyclic peptides. The incorporation of biologically relevant tags (such as cell&#8208;penetrating motifs or fluorescent dyes) into peptides, while preserving their binding interactions and enhancing their stability, is highly sought after. Consequently, the quest for novel peptide stapling methodologies that would easily incorporate such motifs, remains eminent. Despite the unique opportunities offered by tryptophan's indole scaffold for targeted functionalisation, its utilisation in peptide stapling was limited compared to other amino acids. Herein, we present an unprecedented approach for peptide stapling using the tryptophan&#8208;mediated Petasis reaction (TMPR). This method represents a versatile tool for the synthesis of both stapled and labelled peptides, applicable to both solution and solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Importantly, the utilisation of the Petasis reaction in combination with tryptophan represents a significant advancement in the field of peptide stapling, facilitating the formation of stapled peptides in one straightforward, multicomponent fashion, while circumventing formation of undesired by&#8208;products &#8211; a persistent challenge in current methodologies. Furthermore, this approach allows for efficient and diverse late&#8208;stage peptide modifications, thereby enabling rapid production of numerous conjugates for biological and medicinal applications.</dc:description>

         <title>2D MOF&#8208;assisted Pyrolysis&#8208;displacement&#8208;alloying Synthesis of High&#8208;entropy Alloy Nanoparticles Library for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) have received considerable attention in various applications due to their compositional variability and exceptional properties. However, the complexity of both the general synthesis and structure&#8208;activity relationships remain the long&#8208;standing challenges in this field. Herein, we report a versatile 2D MOF&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;displacement&#8208;alloying route to successfully synthesize a series of binary, ternary and even high&#8208;entropy NPs that are uniformly dispersed on porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (PNC NSs). As a proof of utility, the obtained Co0.2Ru0.7Pt0.1/PNC NSs exhibits apparent hydrogen oxidation activity and durability with a record&#8208;high mass specific kinetic current of 1.84 A mg&#8208;1 at the overpotential of 50 mV, which is approximately 11.5 times higher than that of the Pt benchmark. Both experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the addition of Pt engenders a phase transition in CoRu alloys from hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) to face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structure. The elevated reactivity of the resulted ternary alloy can be attributed to the optimized ad&#8208;sorption of hydrogen intermediate and the decreased reaction barrier for water formation. This study opens a new avenue for the development of highly efficient alloy NPs with various compositions and functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzidine Derivatives: A Class of High Redox Potential Molecules for Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of water&#8208;soluble redox&#8208;active molecules with high potentials is one of the effective ways to enhance the energy density of aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs). Herein, a series of promising N&#8208;substituted benzidine analogues as water&#8208;soluble catholyte candidates with controllable redox potentials (0.78 ~1.01 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) were obtained by the molecular engineering of aqueous irreversible benzidines. Theoretical calculations reveal that the redox potentials of these benzidine derivatives in acidic solution are determined by their electronic structure and alkalinity. Among these benzidine derivatives, N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;Tetraethylbenzidine (TEB) shows both high redox potential (0.82 V vs. SHE) and good solubility (1.1 M). Pairing with H4[Si(W3O10)4] anolyte, the cell displayed discharge capacity retention of 99.4% per cycle and a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of ~100% over 1200 cycles. The stable discharge capacity of 41.8 Ah L&#8208;1 was achieved at the 1.0 M TEB catholyte with a CE of 97.2% and energy efficiency (EE) of 91.2%, demonstrating that N&#8208;substituted benzidines could be promising for AOFBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Benzylamine Oxidation with CO2 Photoconversion to Ethanol over a Black Phosphorus and Bismuth Tungstate S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoconversion of CO2 and H2O into ethanol is an ideal strategy to achieve carbon neutrality. However, the production of ethanol with high activity and selectivity is challenging owing to the less efficient reduction half&#8208;reaction involving multi&#8208;step proton coupled electron transfer (PCET), slow C&#8208;C coupling process, and sluggish water oxidation half&#8208;reaction. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional/two&#8208;dimensional (2D/2D) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction consisting of black phosphorus and Bi2WO6 (BP/BWO) was constructed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupling with benzylamine (BA) oxidation. The as&#8208;prepared BP/BWO catalyst exhibits a superior photocatalytic performance toward CO2 reduction, with a yield of 61.3 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for ethanol (selectivity of 91%).In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that S&#8208;scheme heterojunction can effectively promote photogenerated carrier separation via the Bi&#8208;O&#8208;P bridge to accelerate the PCET process. Meanwhile, electron&#8208;rich BP acts as the active site and plays a vital role in the process of C&#8208;C coupling. In addition, the substitution of BA oxidation for H2O oxidation can further enhance the photocatalytic performance of CO2 reduction to C2H5OH. This work opens a new horizon for exploring novel heterogeneous photocatalysts in CO2 photoconversion to C2H5OH based on cooperative photoredox systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed Migratory Allylation of Remote Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chain walking has been an efficient route to realize the functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds, but this strategy is limited to mono&#8208;olefin migration and functionalization. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of tandem directed simultaneous migrations of remote olefins and stereoselective allylation for the first time. The adoption of palladium hydride catalysis and secondary amine morpholine as solvent is critical for achieving high substrate compatibility and stereochemical control with this method. The protocol is also applicable to the functionalization of three vicinal C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds and thus construct three continuous stereocenters along a propylidene moiety via a short synthetic process. Preliminary mechanistic experiments corroborated the design of simultaneous walking of remote dienes.</dc:description>

         <title>Fused Indacene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic hydrocarbons consisting of two or more directly fused antiaromatic subunits are rare due to their high reactivity. However, it is important to understand how the interactions between the antiaromatic subunits influence the electronic properties of the fused structure. Herein, we present the&#160;synthesis of two fused indacene dimer isomers: s&#8208;indaceno[2,1&#8208;a]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (s&#8208;ID) and as&#8208;indaceno[3,2&#8208;b]&#8208;as&#8208;indacene (as&#8208;ID), containing two fused antiaromatic s&#8208;indacene or as&#8208;indacene units, respectively. Their structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. 1H NMR/ESR measurements and DFT calculations revealed that both  s&#8208;ID and  as&#8208;ID have an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. However, while localized antiaromaticity was observed in  s&#8208;ID,  as&#8208;ID showed weak global aromaticity. Moreover,  as&#8208;ID exhibited a larger diradical character and a smaller singlet&#8208;triplet gap than  s&#8208;ID. All the differences can be attributed to their distinct quinoidal substructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Cooperative CO2 Adsorption via a Cation Crowding Mechanism on a Cesium&#8208;Exchanged Phillipsite Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly cooperative CO2 adsorption on a flexible cesium&#8208;exchanged phillipsite, a channel&#8208;based small&#8208;pore zeolite, is operated by an unprecedented adsorption phenomenon: structural breathing (the narrow&#8208;to&#8208;wide pore) is associated with the crowding and dispersal of large Cs+ ions, depending on the CO2 pressure, termed the &#8216;cation crowding&#8217; mechanism.







Abstract
An understanding of the CO2 adsorption mechanisms on small&#8208;pore zeolites is of practical importance in the development of more efficient adsorbents for the separation of CO2 from N2 or CH4. Here we report that the CO2 isotherms at 25&#8211;75&#8201;&#176;C on cesium&#8208;exchanged phillipsite zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of 2.5 (Cs&#8208;PHI&#8208;2.5) are characterized by a rectilinear step shape: limited uptake at low CO2 pressure (PCO2) is followed by highly cooperative uptake at a critical pressure, above which adsorption rapidly approaches capacity (2.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1). Structural analysis reveals that this isotherm behavior is attributed to the high concentration and large size of Cs+ ions in dehydrated Cs&#8208;PHI&#8208;2.5. This results in Cs+ cation crowding and subsequent dispersal at a critical loading of CO2, which allows the PHI framework to relax to its wide pore form and enables its pores to fill with CO2 over a very narrow range of PCO2. Such a highly cooperative phenomenon has not been observed for other zeolites.

         <title>Consecutive Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Isomerization of Novel Octamolybdate Anions within a Microporous Hybrid Framework with Robust Water Sorption Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three sequential thermally&#8208;triggered single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal isomerizations of novel octamolybdate anions occur within a hybrid coordination network formed by the assembly of polyoxometalate clusters and copper(II)&#8208;complexes of a macrocyclic tetraaza ligand. Up to three different microporous phases with accessible voids can be isolated, which exhibit robust water sorption properties.







Abstract
The 3D hybrid framework [{Cu(cyclam)}3(&#954;&#8208;Mo8O27)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O (1) (cyclam=1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) undergoes sequential single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations upon heating to afford two different anhydrous phases (2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a). These transitions modify the framework dimensionality and enable the isomerization of &#954;&#8208;octamolybdate (&#954;&#8208;Mo8) anions into &#955; (2&#8201;a) and &#956; (3&#8201;a) forms through metal migration. Hydration of 3&#8201;a involves condensation of one water molecule to the cluster to afford the &#947;&#8208;Mo8 isomer in 4, which dehydrates back into 3&#8201;a through the 6&#8201;a intermediate. In contrast, 2&#8201;a reversibly hydrates to form 5, exhibiting the same Mo8 cluster as that of 1. It is remarkable that three of the Mo8 clusters (&#954;, &#955; and &#956;) are new and that up to three different microporous phases can be isolated from 1 (2&#8201;a, 3&#8201;a, and 6&#8201;a). Water vapor sorption analyses show high recyclability and the highest uptake values for POM&#8208;based systems. The isotherms display an abrupt step at low humidity level desirable for humidity control devices or water harvesting in drylands.

         <title>Unraveling the Oxidation Behaviors of MXenes in Aqueous Systems by Active&#8208;Learning&#8208;Potential Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation kinetics of MXenes were studied using active&#8208;learning&#8208;potential molecular dynamics. MXenes spontaneously oxidize to transition&#8208;metal oxides in water, which form oxide protection layers on the surface to further inhibit the oxidation process. The free protons in water also impair the water's motility, inhibiting its attack on the MXene surface.







Abstract
MXenes are 2D materials with great potential in various applications. However, the degradation of MXenes in humid environments has become a main obstacle in their practical use. Here we combine deep neural networks and an active learning scheme to develop a neural network potential (NNP) for aqueous MXene systems with ab initio precision but low cost. The oxidation behaviors of super large aqueous MXene systems are investigated systematically at nanosecond timescales for the first time. The oxidation process of MXenes is clearly displayed at the atomic level. Free protons and oxides greatly inhibit subsequent oxidation reactions, leading to the degree of oxidation of MXenes to exponentially decay with time, which is consistent with the oxidation rate of MXenes measured experimentally. Importantly, this computational study represents the first exploration of the kinetic process of oxidation of super&#8208;sized aqueous MXene systems. It opens a promising avenue for the future development of effective protection strategies aimed at controlling the stability of MXenes.

         <title>Polyketide Synthase&#8208;Mediated O&#8208;Methyloxime Formation in the Biosynthesis of the Oximidine Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anticancer agent oximidine I and three novel variants were discovered as products of a cryptic trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS in Pseudomonas baetica. By manipulating the biosynthetic pathway, a key intermediate was identified that retains potent anticancer properties. A combination of bioinformatics analysis and genetic and biochemical experiments illuminated the oximidine biosynthetic pathway, including a novel mechanism for O&#8208;methyloxime formation.







Abstract
Bacterial trans&#8208;acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans&#8208;AT PKSs) are modular megaenzymes that employ unusual catalytic domains to assemble diverse bioactive natural products. One such PKS is responsible for the biosynthesis of the oximidine anticancer agents, oxime&#8208;substituted benzolactone enamides that inhibit vacuolar H+&#8208;ATPases. Here, we describe the identification of the oximidine gene cluster in Pseudomonas baetica and the characterization of four novel oximidine variants, including a structurally simpler intermediate that retains potent anticancer activity. Using a combination of in vivo, in vitro and computational approaches, we experimentally elucidate the oximidine biosynthetic pathway and reveal an unprecedented mechanism for O&#8208;methyloxime formation. We show that this process involves a specialized monooxygenase and methyltransferase domain and provide insight into their activity, mechanism and specificity. Our findings expand the catalytic capabilities of trans&#8208;AT PKSs and identify potential strategies for the production of novel oximidine analogues.

         <title>Stepwise O2&#8208;Induced Rearrangement and Disassembly of the [NiFe4(OH)(&#956;3&#8208;S)4] Active Site Cluster of CO Dehydrogenase</title>

         <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) are inactivated by dioxygen. High&#8208;resolution crystallography was used to show how O2 induces a stepwise rearrangement of the Ni,Fe&#8208;cluster in the active site, with evidence for a reversible and an irreversible phase of cluster destruction. The open coordination site on Ni renders the cluster vulnerable, and its protection offers strategies to prevent inactivation.







Abstract
Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. CODHs are found in anaerobic microorganisms and can rapidly lose their activity when exposed to air. What causes the loss of activity is unclear. In this study, we analyzed the time&#8208;dependent structural changes induced by the presence of air on the metal centers of CODH&#8208;II. We show that inactivation is a multistep process. In a reversible step, the open coordination site on the Ni ion is blocked by a Ni,Fe&#8208;bridging &#956;&#8208;sulfido or chlorido ligand. Blocking this open coordination site with a cyanide ligand stabilizes the cluster against O2&#8208;induced decomposition, indicating that O2 attacks at the Ni ion. In the subsequent irreversible phase, nickel is lost, the Fe ions rearrange and the sulfido ligands disappear. Our data are consistent with a reversible reductive reactivation mechanism to protect CODHs from transient over&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Thermal Stability and Outgassing Behaviors of High&#8208;nickel Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal stability and outgassing as two critical safety metrics of high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes are summarized from a chemical perspective. Thermal decomposition of high&#8208;Ni cathodes starts with ion migration, phase transition, and oxygen release, and ends up with electrolyte combustion. Gas evolution originates from the chemical decomposition of surface lithium carbonate residues and electrolytes under the attack of oxygen from the cathode.







Abstract
LiNiO2&#8208;based high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes are regarded as promising cathode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density automotive lithium batteries. Most of the attention thus far has been paid towards addressing their surface and structural instability issues brought by the increase of Ni content (&gt;90&#8201;%) with an aim to enhance the cycle stability. However, the poor safety performance remains an intractable problem for their commercialization in the market, yet it has not received appropriate attention. In this review, we focus on the gas generation and thermal degradation behaviors of high&#8208;Ni cathodes, which are critical factors in determining their overall safety performance. A comprehensive overview of the mechanisms of outgassing and thermal runaway reactions is presented and analyzed from a chemistry perspective. Finally, we discuss the challenges and the insights into developing robust, safe high&#8208;Ni cathodes.

         <title>Polymeric STING Pro&#8208;agonists for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric STING pro&#8208;agonists (PSPA), whose sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficacy is activated by sono&#8208;irradiation and elevated glutathione (GSH) within the tumor microenvironment (TME), were developed for precision cancer immunotherapy with minimized side effects.







Abstract
The efficacy of combination immunotherapy has been limited by tumor specificity and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs). Herein, we report the development of polymeric STING pro&#8208;agonists (PSPA), whose sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficacy is activated by sono&#8208;irradiation and elevated glutathione (GSH) within the tumor microenvironment (TME). PSPA is composed of sonosensitizers (semiconducting polymer) and STING agonists (MSA&#8208;2) via the GSH&#8208;activatable linkers. Under sono&#8208;irradiation, PSPA serves as a sonosensitizer to generate 1O2 and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of malignant tumor cells. Furthermore, MSA&#8208;2 is released specifically in tumor microenvironment with highly expressed GSH, minimizing off&#8208;target side effects. The activation of the STING pathway elevates the interferon&#8208;&#946; level and synergizes with SDT to enhance the anti&#8208;tumor response. Therefore, this work proposes a universal approach for spatiotemporal regulation of cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of a Giant [Mn86] Nanocage&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Specific CO2 Binding Pockets for Highly Selective CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a bioinspired design strategy, a CO2&#8208;selective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), NKMOF&#8208;9&#8201;a, is fabricated, which possesses unprecedented [Mn86] nanocage&#8208;based structure and high structure robustness. Attributed to the unique enzyme&#8208;like CO2&#8208;binding pockets, NKMOF&#8208;9&#8201;a can selectively remove CO2 from CO2/C2H2, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 mixtures with high selectivities.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas mixtures has demonstrated great potential for solving energy security and environmental sustainability challenges. However, due to similar physicochemical properties between CO2 and other gases as well as the co&#8208;adsorption behavior, the selectivity of CO2 is severely limited in currently reported CO2&#8208;selective sorbents. To address the challenge, we create a bioinspired design strategy and report a robust, microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with unprecedented [Mn86] nanocages. Attributed to the existence of unique enzyme&#8208;like confined pockets, strong coordination interactions and dipole&#8208;dipole interactions are generated for CO2 molecules, resulting in only CO2 molecules fitting in the pocket while other gas molecules are prohibited. Thus, this MOF can selectively remove CO2 from various gas mixtures and show record&#8208;high selectivities of CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 mixtures. Highly efficient CO2/C2H2, CO2/CH4, and CO2/N2 separations are achieved, as verified by experimental breakthrough tests. This work paves a new avenue for the fabrication of adsorbents with high CO2 selectivity and provides important guidance for designing highly effective adsorbents for gas separation.

         <title>Elusive Double Perovskite Iodides: Structural, Optical, and Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unicorn double perovskite iodides [A2MIMIIII6] are elusive, but with the help of rational design rules, can indeed be synthesized. The Cs2NaLnI6 (Ln=Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy) family demonstrate optical properties that are red shifted compared to related halide materials and their magnetic properties show weak interaction parameters.







Abstract
Halide double perovskites [A2MIMIIIX6] are an important class of materials that have garnered substantial interest as non&#8208;toxic alternatives to conventional lead iodide perovskites for optoelectronic applications. While numerous studies have examined chloride and bromide double perovskites, reports of iodide double perovskites are rare, and their definitive structural characterization has not been reported. Predictive models have aided us here in the synthesis and characterization of five iodide double perovskites of general formula Cs2NaLnI6 (Ln=Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy). The complete crystal structures, structural phase transitions, optical, photoluminescent, and magnetic properties of these compounds are reported.

&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] are an important class of materials that have garnered substantial interest as non-toxic alternatives to conventional lead iodide perovskites for optoelectronic applications. While numerous studies have examined chloride and bromide double perovskites, reports of iodide double perovskites are rare, and their definitive structural characterization has not been reported. Predictive models have aided us here in the synthesis and characterization of five iodide double perovskites of general formula Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Na&lt;i&gt;Ln&lt;/i&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ln&lt;/i&gt;=Ce, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy). The complete crystal structures, structural phase transitions, optical, photoluminescent, and magnetic properties of these compounds are reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Insights into the Interlayer Characteristics and Oxygen Reactivity of Bilayer Borophene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) was used to study the local chemical properties of bilayer synthetic two&#8208;dimensional boron (i.e., borophene) with atomic&#8208;scale spatial resolution. TERS established the chemical fingerprint of bilayer borophene that is correlated with the vibration of interlayer B&#8722;B bonds and revealed its chemical stability with single&#8208;bond (B&#8722;O) sensitivity by exposure to controlled oxidizing conditions in ultrahigh vacuum.







Abstract
Bilayer (BL) two&#8208;dimensional boron (i.e., borophene) has recently been synthesized and computationally predicted to have promising physical properties for a variety of electronic and energy technologies. However, the fundamental chemical properties of BL borophene that form the foundation of practical applications remain unexplored. Here, we present atomic&#8208;level chemical characterization of BL borophene using ultrahigh vacuum tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (UHV&#8208;TERS). UHV&#8208;TERS identifies the vibrational fingerprint of BL borophene with angstrom&#8208;scale spatial resolution. The observed Raman spectra are directly correlated with the vibrations of interlayer boron&#8211;boron bonds, validating the three&#8208;dimensional lattice geometry of BL borophene. By virtue of the single&#8208;bond sensitivity of UHV&#8208;TERS to oxygen adatoms, we demonstrate the enhanced chemical stability of BL borophene compared to its monolayer counterpart by exposure to controlled oxidizing atmospheres in UHV. In addition to providing fundamental chemical insight into BL borophene, this work establishes UHV&#8208;TERS as a powerful tool to probe interlayer bonding and surface reactivity of low&#8208;dimensional materials at the atomic scale.

         <title>Mechanochemistry&#8208;Amended Barbier Reaction as an Expedient Alternative to Grignard Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organomagnesium halides (Grignard reagents) are essential carbanionic building blocks widely used in carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions with various electrophiles. In the Barbier variant of the Grignard synthesis, the generation of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;sensitive Grignard reagents occurs concurrently with their reaction with an electrophile. Although operationally simpler, the classic Barbier approach suffers from low yields due to multiple side reactions, thereby limiting the scope of its application. Here, we report a mechanochemical adaptation of the Mg&#8208;mediated Barbier reaction, which overcomes these limitations and facilitates the coupling of versatile organic halides (e.g., allylic, vinylic, aromatic, aliphatic) with a diverse range of electrophilic substrates (e.g., aromatic aldehydes, ketones, esters, amides, O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamine, chlorosilane, borate ester) to assemble C&#8211;C, C&#8211;N, C&#8211;Si, and C&#8211;B bonds. The mechanochemical approach has the advantage of being essentially solvent&#8208;free, operationally simple, immune to air, and surprisingly tolerant to water and some weak Br&#248;nsted acids. Notably, solid ammonium chloride was found to improve yields in the reactions of ketones. Mechanistic studies have clarified the role of mechanochemistry in the process, indicating the generation of transient organometallics facilitated by improved mass transfer and activation of the surface of magnesium metal.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of an Anionic Diazoolefin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bent (hetero)allenes such as carbodicarbenes and carbodiphosphoranes can act as neutral C&#8208;donor ligands, and diverse applications in coordination chemistry have been reported. N&#8208;Heterocyclic diazoolefins are heterocumulenes, which can function in a similar fashion as L&#8208;type ligands. Herein, we describe the synthesis and the reactivity of an anionic diazoolefin. This compound displays distinct reactivity compared to neutral diazoolefins, as evidenced by the preparation of diazo compounds via protonation, alkylation, or silylation. The anionic diazoolefin can be employed as an ambidentate, X&#8208;type ligand in salt metathesis reactions with metal halide complexes. Extrusion of dinitrogen was observed in a reaction with PCl(NiPr2)2, resulting in a stable phosphinocarbene.</dc:description>

         <title>Compartmentalized Polyampholyte Microgels by Depletion Flocculation and Coacervation of Nanogels in Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In pH&#8208;responsive drug carriers, the distribution of charges has been proven to affect delivery efficiency but is difficult to control and verify. Herein, we fabricate polyampholyte nanogel&#8208;in&#8208;microgel colloids (NiM&#8208;C) and show that the arrangement of the nanogels (NG) can easily be manipulated by adapting synthesis conditions. Positively and negatively charged pH&#8208;responsive NG are synthesized by precipitation polymerization and labelled with different fluorescent dyes. The obtained NG are integrated into microgel (MG) networks by subsequent inverse emulsion polymerization in droplet&#8208;based microfluidics. By confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we verify that depending on NG concentration, pH value and ionic strength, NiM&#8208;C with different NG arrangements are obtained, including Janus&#8208;like phase&#8208;separation of NG, statistical distribution of NG, and core&#8208;shell arrangements. Our approach is a major step towards uptake and release of oppositely charged (drug) molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A simple method for accessing trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaryl&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans is reported. This approach leverages the equilibrium between quinone methide dimers and their persistent radicals. This equilibrium is disrupted by phenols that yield comparatively transient phenoxyl radicals, leading to cross&#8208;coupling between the persistent and transient radicals. The resultant quinone methides with pendant phenols rapidly cyclize to form dihydrobenzofurans (DHBs). This putative biomimetic access to dihydrobenzofurans provides superb functional group tolerance and a unified approach for the synthesis of resveratrol&#8208;based natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time pH&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly of Ionisable Lipids from COVID&#8208;19 Vaccines and In Situ Nucleic Acid Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionisable amino&#8208;lipid is a key component in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which plays a crucial role in the encapsulation of RNA molecules, allowing efficient cellular uptake and then releasing RNA from acidic endosomes. Herein, we present direct evidence for the remarkable structural transitions, with decreasing membrane curvature, including from inverse micellar, to inverse hexagonal, to two distinct inverse bicontinuous cubic, and finally to a lamellar phase for the two mainstream COVID&#8208;19 vaccine ionisable ALC&#8208;0315 and SM&#8208;102 lipids, occurring upon gradual acidification as encountered in endosomes. The millisecond kinetic growth of the inverse cubic and hexagonal structures and the evolution of the ordered structure formation upon ionisable&#8208;lipid&#8208;RNA/DNA complexation are quantitatively revealed by in&#8208;situ synchrotron radiation time&#8208;resolved small angle X&#8208;ray scattering coupled with rapid flow mixing. We found that the final self&#8208;assembled structural identity, and the formation kinetics, were controlled by the ionisable lipid molecular structure, acidic bulk environment, lipid compositions, and nucleic acid molecular structure/size. The implicated link between the inverse membrane curvature of LNP and LNP endosomal escape helps future optimisation of ionisable lipids and LNP engineering for RNA and gene delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of 2&#8208;(Quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzaldehydes: Atroposelective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenative Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An atroposelective Ir&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of 2&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzaldehydes/1&#8208;naphthaldehydes by transfer hydrogenative coupling of allyl acetate is disclosed. The allylation reaction takes place with simultaneous installation of central and axial chirality, reaching high diastereoselectivities and excellent enantiomeric excesses when ortho&#8208;cyclometalated iridium&#8208;DM&#8208;BINAP is used as the catalyst. The racemization of the substrates occurs through a designed transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction between the quinoline nitrogen atom and the aldehyde carbonyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>Li Plating Regulation on Fast&#8208;Charging Graphite Anodes by a Triglyme&#8208;LiNO3 Synergistic Electrolyte Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphite anodes are prone to dangerous Li plating during fast charging, but the difficulty to identify the rate&#8208;limiting step has made a challenging to eliminate Li plating thoroughly. Thus, the inherent thinking on inhibiting Li plating needs to be compromised. Herein, an elastic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with uniform Li&#8208;ion flux is constructed on graphite anode by introducing a triglyme (G3)&#8208;LiNO3 synergistic additive (GLN) to commercial carbonate electrolyte, for realizing a dendrite&#8208;free and highly&#8208;reversible Li plating under high rates. The cross&#8208;linked oligomeric ether and Li3N particles derived from the GLN greatly improve the stability of the SEI before and after Li plating and facilitate the uniform Li deposition. When 51% of lithiation capacity is contributed from Li plating, the graphite anode in the electrolyte with 5 vol.% GLN achieved an average 99.6% Li plating reversibility over 100 cycles. In addition, the 1.2&#8208;Ah LiFePO4 | graphite pouch cell with GLN&#8208;added electrolyte stably operated over 150 cycles at 3 C, firmly demonstrating the promise of GLN in commercial Li&#8208;ion batteries for fast&#8208;charging applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Adamantoid Scaffolds for Multiple Cargo Loading and Cellular Delivery as &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is huge demand for developing guests&#160;that bind&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD&#160;and&#160;can conjugate multiple cargos for cellular delivery. We synthesized trioxaadamantane derivatives, which can conjugate up to three cargos per guest.&#160;1H NMR titration and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed these guests form 1:1 inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;CD with association constants in the order of 103&#160;M&#8208;1. Co&#8208;crystallization of &#946;&#8208;CD with guests yielded crystals of their 1:1 inclusion complexes as determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In all cases,&#160;trioxaadamantane core is buried within the hydrophobic cavity of&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD&#160;and three hydroxyl groups are exposed outside.&#160;We established biocompatibility using representative candidate&#160;G4&#160;and its inclusion complex with&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD (&#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G4), by MTT assay using HeLa cells.&#160;We incubated HeLa cells with rhodamine&#8208;conjugated&#160;G4&#160;and&#160;established cellular cargo delivery using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.&#160;For functional assay, we&#160;incubated HeLa cells with&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;inclusion complexes&#160;of&#160;G4&#8208;derived prodrugs&#160;G6&#160;and&#160;G7, containing one and three units of the antitumor drug (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;camptothecin, respectively. Cells incubated with&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G7&#160;displayed the highest internalization and uniform distribution of camptothecin.&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G7&#160;showed higher cytotoxicity than&#160;G7, camptothecin,&#160;G6&#160;and&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD&#8834;G6, affirming the efficiency of adamantoid derivatives in high&#8208;density loading and cargo delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerizable Solvent&#8208;free Organic Liquids: A New Approach for Large Area Flexible and Foldable Luminescent Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high demand for light&#8208;emitting and display devices made luminescent organic materials as attractive candidates. Solvent&#8208;free organic liquids are one of the promising emitters among them due to the salient features. However, the inherent limitations of forming sticky and noncurable surfaces must be addressed to become an alternate emitter for large&#8208;area device applications. Herein, we functionalized solvent&#8208;free organic liquids having monomeric emission in bulk with polymerizable groups to improve the processability. The polymerizable group on carbazole, naphthalene monoimide, and diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based solvent&#8208;free liquid emitters enabled on&#8208;surface polymerization. These emitters alone and in combinations can be directly coated on a glass substrate without the help of solvents. Subsequent photo or thermal polymerization leads to stable, non&#8208;sticky, flexible, foldable, and free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area films with reasonably high quantum yield. Our demonstration of the tunable and white light&#8208;emitting films using polymerizable solvent&#8208;free liquids might be a potential candidate in flexible/foldable/stretchable electronics. The new concept of polymerizable liquid can be extended to other functional features suitable for futuristic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Birefringence Activated by Tetrahedra Decorated with Single Linear Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Performance enhancement induced by structural modification has long been the target in materials science fields. Direct evidence to witness the effectivity of one strategy is challenging and necessary. In this work, a tetrahedra&#8208;decoration strategy was proposed to improve the birefringent performance sharply, namely decorating the tetrahedra with single linear [S2] unit. The strategy was verified by comprehensive characterization of two thiogermanates K2BaGeS4 and K2BaGeS5, which crystallize in the same space group, have similar unit cells and the same units arrangements. Theoretical characterization verified that the [GeS5] group has much larger polarization anisotropy than [GeS4], further demonstrated that the linear [S2] lead to the sharp birefringence enlargement of K2BaGeS5 (0.19 vs 0.03 of K2BaGeS4). This work provides a new guiding thought to improve the birefringence performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
An ionic liquid (IL) confined MOF/Polymer 3D&#8208;porous membrane was constructed for boosting in situ electrochemical transformations of Janus&#8208;heterarchical LiF/Li3N&#8208;rich SEI films on the nanofibers. Such a 3D&#8208;Janus SEI&#8208;incorporated into the separator offers fast Li+ transport routes. In particular, this membrane with high thermal stability and mechanical strength used in solid&#8208;state Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM&#8208;811 full cells and even in pouch cells showed enhanced rate&#8208;performance and ultra&#8208;long life spans.







Abstract
Pursuing high power density lithium metal battery with high safety is essential for developing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices, but uncontrollable electrolyte degradation and the consequence formed unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) make the task really challenging. Herein, an ionic liquid (IL) confined MOF/Polymer 3D&#8208;porous membrane was constructed for boosting in situ electrochemical transformations of Janus&#8208;heterarchical LiF/Li3N&#8208;rich SEI films on the nanofibers. Such a 3D&#8208;Janus SEI&#8208;incorporated into the separator offers fast Li+ transport routes, showing superior room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 8.17&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and Li+ transfer number of 0.82. The cryo&#8208;TEM was employed to visually monitor the in situ formed LiF and Li3N nanocrystals in SEI and the deposition of Li dendrites, which is greatly benefit to the theoretical simulation and kinetic analysis of the structural evolution during the battery charge and discharge process. In particular, this membrane with high thermal stability and mechanical strength used in solid&#8208;state Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM&#8208;811 full cells and even in pouch cells showed enhanced rate&#8208;performance and ultra&#8208;long life spans.

&lt;p&gt;Pursuing high power density lithium metal battery with high safety is essential for developing next-generation energy-storage devices, but uncontrollable electrolyte degradation and the consequence formed unstable solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) make the task really challenging. Herein, an ionic liquid (IL) confined MOF/Polymer 3D-porous membrane was constructed for boosting in situ electrochemical transformations of Janus-heterarchical LiF/Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N-rich SEI films on the nanofibers. Such a 3D-Janus SEI-incorporated into the separator offers fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport routes, showing superior room-temperature ionic conductivity of 8.17&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer number of 0.82. The cryo-TEM was employed to visually monitor the in situ formed LiF and Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N nanocrystals in SEI and the deposition of Li dendrites, which is greatly benefit to the theoretical simulation and kinetic analysis of the structural evolution during the battery charge and discharge process. In particular, this membrane with high thermal stability and mechanical strength used in solid-state Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Li||NCM-811 full cells and even in pouch cells showed enhanced rate-performance and ultra-long life spans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Intermolecular Dialkylation of Alkenylarenes: Generation of Two Vicinal C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Bonds Across Alkenes
</title>

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed dialkylation reaction of alkenylarenes with &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyls and alkylzinc reagents is reported wherein two alkyl&#8208;alkyl bonds are generated in one step.







Abstract
We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed regioselective dialkylation reaction of alkenylarenes with &#945;&#8208;halocarbonyls and alkylzinc reagents. The reaction produces &#947;&#8208;arylated alkanecarbonyl compounds with the generation of two new C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds at the vicinal carbons of alkenes. This reaction is effective for the use of primary, secondary and tertiary &#945;&#8208;halocarboxylic esters, amides and ketones in conjunction with primary and secondary alkylzinc reagents as the sources of two C(sp3) carbons for the dialkylation of terminal and cyclic internal alkenes.

         <title>Expedient Access to Enantioenriched 1&#8208;Azaspiro Cyclobutanones Enabled by Modified Heyns Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a unified strategy for the asymmetric construction of [3,4]&#8208;azaspirocycles by employing the Heyns reactivity upon its electrophilic modification. The chiral phosphoric acid is an efficient catalyst for this transformation and allows to access a wide range of cyclobutanone containing 1&#8208;azaspirocycles with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
Leveraging the unexplored regions of chemical space, the integration of spirocyclic cyclobutane in a molecular scaffold opens up a new vista in modern drug discovery. Despite recent advancements in achieving the synthesis of such motifs, strategies for their asymmetric construction have not been well&#8208;recognized and remain a formidable challenge. Herein, for the first time, we have demonstrated a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;azaspiro cyclobutanone enabled by an unusual reactivity of enamine that explore the potentiality of Heyns rearrangement upon electrophilic modification. This design strategy offers viable access to a wide range of cyclobutanone containing spiroindoline and spiropyrrolidine derivatives in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). Furthermore, the practicality of this methodology has been shown by a scale&#8208;up synthesis of spirocyclic products and their facile post&#8208;synthetic modifications.

         <title>Synthesis and Optoelectronic Applications of d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; Conjugated Polymers with a Di&#8208;metallaaromatic Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a di&#8208;metallaaromatic acceptor with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, and introduced it to a series of d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugated metallopolymers using a double&#8208;monomer polymerization methodology. These metallopolymers can be applied as electron transport layer materials of an organic solar cell, improving the power conversion efficiency considerably.







Abstract
The development of conjugated polymers especially n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors is powered by the design and synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient building blocks. Herein, a strong acceptor building block with di&#8208;metallaaromatic structure was designed and synthesized by connecting two electron&#8208;deficient metallaaromatic units through a &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridge. Then, a double&#8208;monomer polymerization methodology was developed for inserting it into conjugated polymer scaffolds to yield metallopolymers. The isolated well&#8208;defined model oligomers indicated polymer structures. Kinetic studies based on nuclear magnetic resonance and ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopies shed light on the polymerization process. Interestingly, the resulted metallopolymers with d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugations are very promising electron transport layer materials which can boost photovoltaic performance of an organic solar cell, with power conversion efficiency up to 18.28&#8201;% based on the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;EH&#8208;HD&#8208;4F non&#8208;fullerene system. This work not only provides a facile route to construct metallaaromatic conjugated polymers with various functional groups, but also discovers their potential applications for the first time.

         <title>Photonic Modulation Enabled by Controlling the Edge Structures of Boron&#8208;Doped Molecular Carbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report control over the edge structures of boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs) that were achieved by sequential cyclization. Three as&#8208;synthesized BMCs, featuring the C56B2 or C84B2 polycyclic &#960;&#8208;skeletons with controlled edges, display well&#8208;tunable aromatic structures, decreased band gaps and intriguing photonic properties. Notably, the C56B2 molecule exhibits unprecedented stimulated emission behavior and amplified spontaneous emission property.







Abstract
Control over topological edges of molecular carbons (MCs) is of importance for achieving diverse molecular topologies and desirable physical properties. However, it remains very challenging for heteroatom&#8208;doped MCs due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, we report control over the edge structures of boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs) via the sequential cyclization strategy. Three BMC molecules that feature the C56B2 or C84B2 polycyclic &#960;&#8208;skeletons with selective cove/fjord or cove/bay edges, respectively, were synthesized through the rational combination of Mallory photoreaction and Scholl reaction. We not only obtain the largest boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system reported so far, but also disclose that fine control of their edges and length greatly affects electronic structures and thereby photonic properties of BMCs, such as tunable aromaticity, decreased band gaps, as well as redshifted absorptions and fluorescence. Remarkably, the C56B2 molecule exhibits stimulated emission behavior and amplified spontaneous emission property, both of which have never been reported for pristine boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems, thus demonstrating the potential of BMCs as optical gain materials for laser cavities.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of cis&#8208;Decalins by Merging the Birch Reduction and Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized chiral cis&#8208;decalins was realized by merging Birch reduction and a tandem olefin migration/asymmetric IEDDA reaction. Up to six contiguous and two quaternary stereocenters could be formed in one step by efficient kinetic resolution. The synthetic value of the approach is illustrated by the concise total synthesis of (+)&#8208;occidentalol and the synthesis of a key intermediate for seven triterpenes.







Abstract
Herein, we show that the combination of the Birch reduction of readily available anisole derivatives and the catalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones can serve as a powerful platform for the diverse synthesis of synthetically important cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds. Enabled by a well&#8208;modified chiral bis(oxazoline) ligand/CuII complex, a wide range of polysubstituted cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds with up to six contiguous stereocenters were generated efficiently. The synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by the concise synthesis of the sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;occidentalol and a key intermediate for seven triterpenes. Mechanistic studies suggest the 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes formed in situ are the key intermediates, and efficient kinetic resolution occurs when C2&#8208; and/or C3&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes are utilized as substrates.

     alt="Enantioselective Synthesis of cis-Decalins by Merging the Birch Reduction and Inverse-Electron-Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized chiral &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-decalins was realized by merging Birch reduction and a tandem olefin migration/asymmetric IEDDA reaction. Up to six contiguous and two quaternary stereocenters could be formed in one step by efficient kinetic resolution. The synthetic value of the approach is illustrated by the concise total synthesis of (+)-occidentalol and the synthesis of a key intermediate for seven triterpenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we show that the combination of the Birch reduction of readily available anisole derivatives and the catalytic asymmetric inverse-electron-demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2-pyrones can serve as a powerful platform for the diverse synthesis of synthetically important &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-decalin scaffolds. Enabled by a well-modified chiral bis(oxazoline) ligand/Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex, a wide range of polysubstituted &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-decalin scaffolds with up to six contiguous stereocenters were generated efficiently. The synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by the concise synthesis of the sesquiterpene (+)-occidentalol and a key intermediate for seven triterpenes. Mechanistic studies suggest the 1,3-cyclohexadienes formed in situ are the key intermediates, and efficient kinetic resolution occurs when C2- and/or C3-substituted 1,4-cyclohexadienes are utilized as substrates. DFT calculations elucidated that the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction proceeds in a stepwise fashion and revealed the origins of the stereoselectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylalkenes Enabled by 1,2&#8208;Boron Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation via 1,2&#8208;boron shift to access enantioenriched gem&#8208;diborylalkenes. In this reaction, excellent enantioselectivities were obtained by simply improving the reaction temperature via an impressive DKR process. DFT calculations and extensive mechanistic studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origin of excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Asymmetric cross&#8208;couplings based on 1,2&#8208;carbon migration from B&#8208;ate complexes have been developed efficiently to access valuable organoboronates. However, enantioselective reactions triggered by 1,2&#8208;boron shift have remained to be unaddressed synthetic challenge. Here, Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation enabled by 1,2&#8208;boron shift was developed. In this reaction, we disclosed that excellent enantioselectivities were achieved through an interesting dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process of allylic carbonates at the elevated temperature. Notably, the highly valuable (bis&#8208;boryl)alkenes have enabled an array of diversifications to access versatile molecules. Extensive experimental and computational studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism of DKR process and clarify the origin of excellent enantioselectivities.

         <title>Rational Design and Expedient Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate Mimetics from Natural Aminoglycosides for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 27 oligosaccharides as heparan sulfate mimetics were efficiently synthesized from the natural aminoglycoside tobramycin in 7&#8211;12 steps. Rapid generation of these sulfated aminoglycans will provide a tool to decipher HS&#8208;protein interactions and develop HS therapeutic potential.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) contains variably repeating disaccharide units organized into high&#8208; and low&#8208;sulfated domains. This rich structural diversity enables HS to interact with many proteins and regulate key signaling pathways. Efforts to understand structure&#8208;function relationships and harness the therapeutic potential of HS are hindered by the inability to synthesize an extensive library of well&#8208;defined HS structures. We herein report a rational and expedient approach to access a library of 27 oligosaccharides from natural aminoglycosides as HS mimetics in 7&#8211;12 steps. This strategy significantly reduces the number of steps as compared to the traditional synthesis of HS oligosaccharides from monosaccharide building blocks. Combined with computational insight, we identify a new class of four trisaccharide compounds derived from the aminoglycoside tobramycin that mimic natural HS and have a strong binding to heparanase but a low affinity for off&#8208;target platelet factor&#8208;4 protein.

         <title>Blending Low&#8208;Frequency Vibrations and Push&#8211;Pull Effects Affords Superior Photoacoustic Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we present a facile but effective approach for engineering photoacoustic imaging (PAI) agents by amplifying intramolecular low&#8208;frequency vibrations and enhancing the push&#8208;pull effect. As a demonstration of this blended approach, we constructed a PAI agent (BDP1&#8208;NEt2) based on the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) scaffold, which met key requirements of high&#8208;quality PAI.







Abstract
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noninvasive in vivo imaging technique, has been widely used in clinical disease diagnosis. However, the design of high&#8208;performance PAI agents with three key characteristics, i.e., near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption (&#955;abs&gt;800&#8197;nm), intense PA signals, and excellent photostability, remains a challenging goal. Herein, we present a facile but effective approach for engineering PAI agents by amplifying intramolecular low&#8208;frequency vibrations and enhancing the push&#8208;pull effect. As a demonstration of this blended approach, we constructed a PAI agent (BDP1&#8208;NEt2) based on the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) scaffold. Compared with indocyanine green (ICG, an FDA&#8208;approved organic dye widely utilized in PAI studies; &#955;abs=788&#8197;nm), BDP1&#8208;NEt2 exhibited a UV/Vis&#8208;NIR spectrum peaked at 825&#8197;nm, superior in vivo PA signal intensity and outstanding stability to offer improved tumor diagnostics. We believe this work provides a promising strategy to develop the next generation of PAI agents.

         <title>Triptycene&#8208;Fused Sterically Shielded Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Deep Blue OLEDs with Reduced Dexter Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically shielded yet extremely rigid multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitter (Tp&#8208;DABNA), based on a triptycene&#8208;fused B,N core, has been developed. The bulky fins of the triptycene moieties enable Tp&#8208;DABNA to achieve narrowed emission and reduced Dexter energy transfer while maintaining efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. The corresponding deep blue OLEDs demonstrate a high EQE of 28.7&#8201;% and mitigated efficiency roll&#8208;offs.







Abstract
Designing multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters that can simultaneously achieve narrowband emission and suppressed intermolecular interactions is challenging for realizing high color purity and stable blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, a sterically shielded yet extremely rigid emitter based on a triptycene&#8208;fused B,N core (Tp&#8208;DABNA) is proposed to address the issue. Tp&#8208;DABNA exhibits intense deep blue emissions with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a high horizontal transition dipole ratio, superior to the well&#8208;known bulky emitter, t&#8208;DABNA. The rigid MR skeleton of Tp&#8208;DABNA suppresses structural relaxation in the excited state, with reduced contributions from the medium&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency vibrational modes to spectral broadening. The hyperfluorescence (HF) film composed of a sensitizer and Tp&#8208;DABNA shows reduced Dexter energy transfer compared to those of t&#8208;DABNA and DABNA&#8208;1. Notably, deep blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs with the Tp&#8208;DABNA emitter display higher external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax=24.8&#8201;%) and narrower FWHMs (&#8804;26&#8197;nm) than t&#8208;DABNA&#8208;based OLEDs (EQEmax=19.8&#8201;%). The HF&#8208;OLEDs based on the Tp&#8208;DABNA emitter further demonstrate improved performance with an EQEmax of 28.7&#8201;% and mitigated efficiency roll&#8208;offs.

A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [1,2]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of ammonium ylides, generated in situ from 3&#8208;methyleneazetidines and &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoamides was described. A series of chiral quaternary prolineamide derivatives were obtained in excellent yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) under mild reaction condition.







Abstract
We realized a highly efficient formal [1,2]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of ammonium ylides generated from 3&#8208;methylene&#8208;azetidines and &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoamides. The employ of readily available chiral cobalt(II) complex of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide enabled the ring&#8208;expansion of azetidines, affording a variety of quaternary prolineamide derivatives with excellent yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) under mild reaction condition. For the rearrangement of ammonium ylides, the installation of a pyrazoamide group as a masked brick to build chiral scaffolds proved successful. The enantioselective ring expansion process was elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>A General Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalytic Platform for the Activation of Inert Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a readily available indole thiolate organocatalyst that, upon excitation with light, can activate via single electron reduction a wide variety of typically inert electron&#8208;rich substrates, including strong C&#8722;F, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;O bonds in both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. The protocol is also useful for the borylation and phosphorylation of inert substrates, exhibiting high functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Due to their strong covalent bonds and low reduction potentials, activating inert substrates is challenging. Recent advances in photoredox catalysis offered a number of solutions, each of which useful for activating specific inert bonds. Developing a general catalytic platform that can consistently target a broad range of inert substrates would be synthetically useful. Herein, we report a readily available indole thiolate organocatalyst that, upon excitation with 405&#8197;nm light, acquires a strongly reducing power. This excited&#8208;state reactivity served to activate, by single&#8208;electron reduction, strong C&#8722;F, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;O bonds in both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic platform was versatile enough to promote the reduction of generally recalcitrant electron&#8208;rich substrates (Ered&lt;&#8722;3.0&#8197;V vs SCE), including arenes that afforded 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes. The protocol was also useful for the borylation and phosphorylation of inert substrates with a high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies identified an excited&#8208;state thiolate anion as responsible of the highly reducing reactivity.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Transfer from Xanthates to Acyl Azoliums: Divergent Ketone Synthesis via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile NHC&#8208;catalyzed method has been developed for synthesizing ketones from alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives through SET (single electron transfer) between photoexcited xanthates and acyl azoliums. This approach further facilitates the generation of structurally diverse cross&#8208;coupled ketones by incorporating alkenes and enynes.







Abstract
Considering the prevalence of alcohols and carboxylic acids, their fragment cross&#8208;coupling reactions could hold significant implications in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a versatile method for synthesizing a diverse range of ketones from alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that photoexcited xanthates and acyl azoliums undergo single electron transfer (SET) under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions, generating NHC&#8208;derived ketyl radicals and alkyl radicals. These open&#8208;shell intermediates subsequently undergo the radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction, yielding valuable ketones. Furthermore, this approach can be employed in three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and enynes, resulting in structurally diverse cross&#8208;coupled ketones. The unified strategy offers a unique opportunity for the fragment coupling of a diverse range of alcohols and carboxylic acid derivatives, accommodating diverse functional groups even in complex settings.

         <title>A Divergent Polyene Cyclization for the Total Synthesis of Greenwayodendrines, Greenwaylactams, Polysin and Polyveoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of nine alkaloid sesquiterpenoids has been accomplished in only 5&#8211;8&#8197;steps in excellent overall yield (3&#8211;21&#8201;%). The dual nucleophilicity of the indole enabled two divergent termination pathways to be unlocked: an unprecedented N&#8208;termination and a previously challenging C&#8208;termination step. Furthermore, a bioinspired late&#8208;stage Witkop oxidation enabled the first total synthesis of greenwaylactams A&#8722;C.







Abstract
We present a concise asymmetric total synthesis (5&#8211;8&#8197;steps) of nine sesquiterpenoid alkaloids featuring four different tetra&#8208;/pentacyclic scaffolds. To this end, a novel, bioinspired indole N&#8208;terminated cationic tricyclization has been developed, enabling the divergent synthesis of greenwayodendrines and polysin. Subtle variation of the C2&#8208;substituted indole cyclization precursor allowed switching between indole N&#8208; and C&#8208;termination. For the latter, a subsequent Witkop oxidation enabled conversion of the cyclopentene&#8208;fused indole into the eight&#8208;membered benzolactam to directly furnish the family of greenwaylactams. In addition, a diastereomeric C&#8208;termination product has been elaborated to provide access to polyveoline.

         <title>Directly Imaging and Regulating the Nanoscale Inhomogeneity of S&#8208;Vacancies in Molybdenum Disulfide Monolayer during Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change of activity of molybdenum disulfide monolayer with potential during hydrogen evolution is observed by opto&#8208;electrochemical imaging. The inhomogeneous spatial distribution of local active sites and uncharged impurities is identified with high sensitivity. The WE, RE and CE represent the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.







Abstract
The study of electron transfer event on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered transition metal dichalcogenides has attracted tremendous attentions attributing to their promising applications in electrochemical devices. Herein, we demonstrate an opto&#8208;electrochemical strategy to directly map and regulate electron transfer event on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayer by combining bright field (BF) imaging technique with electrochemical modulation. The heterogeneity of electrochemical activity on MoS2 monolayer down to nanoscale is resolved spatiotemporally. The thermodynamics of MoS2 monolayer is measured during electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and the Arrhenius correlations are obtained. We validate that the defect generation engineered by oxygen plasma bombardment dramatically enhances the local electrochemical activity of MoS2 monolayer, which can be attributed to point defects of S&#8208;vacancies as evidenced. Furthermore, by comparing the difference of electron transfer event on MoS2 with various layers, the interlayer coupling effect is uncovered. This study represents a facile method to image the heterogeneity of electrochemical properties for nanomaterials with atomic thickness and regulate the local activity within the plane by extrinsic factors. It also has potential applications in the design and evaluation of high&#8208;performance layered electrochemical systems down to nanoscale.

         <title>Combining Carbazole Building Blocks and &#957;&#8208;DABNA Heteroatom Alignment for a Double Boron&#8208;Embedded MR&#8208;TADF Emitter with Improved Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collocating carbazole building blocks with &#957;&#8208;DABNA heteroatom alignment, a novel double boron&#8208;embedded multiple resonance emitter &#928;&#8208;CzBN is obtained and exhibits superior photophysical properties. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on &#928;&#8208;CzBN achieve an exceptional efficiency of 39.3&#8201;% with a mild roll&#8208;off and a narrow full width at half maximum of 21&#8197;nm/106&#8197;meV in the bluish&#8208;green region.







Abstract
Building blocks and heteroatom alignments are two determining factors in designing multiple resonance (MR)&#8208;type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. Carbazole&#8208;fused MR emitters, represented by CzBN derivatives, and the heteroatom alignments of &#957;&#8208;DABNA are two star series of MR&#8208;TADF emitters that show impressive performances from the aspects of building blocks and heteroatom alignments, respectively. Herein, a novel CzBN analog, &#928;&#8208;CzBN, featuring &#957;&#8208;DABNA heteroatom alignment is developed via facile one&#8208;shot lithium&#8208;free borylation. &#928;&#8208;CzBN exhibits superior photophysical properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield close to 100&#8201;% and narrowband sky blue emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16&#8197;nm/85&#8197;meV. It also gives efficient TADF properties with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy offset of 40&#8197;meV and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 2.9&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1. The optimized OLED using &#928;&#8208;CzBN as the emitter achieves an exceptional external quantum efficiency of 39.3&#8201;% with a low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 20&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and a narrowband emission at 495&#8197;nm with FWHM of 21&#8197;nm/106&#8197;meV, making it one of the best reported devices based on MR emitters with comprehensive performance.

&lt;p&gt;Collocating carbazole building blocks with &#957;-DABNA heteroatom alignment, a novel double boron-embedded multiple resonance emitter &#928;-CzBN is obtained and exhibits superior photophysical properties. The corresponding organic light-emitting diodes based on &#928;-CzBN achieve an exceptional efficiency of 39.3&#8201;% with a mild roll-off and a narrow full width at half maximum of 21&#8197;nm/106&#8197;meV in the bluish-green region.

&lt;p&gt;Building blocks and heteroatom alignments are two determining factors in designing multiple resonance (MR)-type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. Carbazole-fused MR emitters, represented by CzBN derivatives, and the heteroatom alignments of &lt;i&gt;&#957;&lt;/i&gt;-DABNA are two star series of MR-TADF emitters that show impressive performances from the aspects of building blocks and heteroatom alignments, respectively. Herein, a novel CzBN analog, &#928;-CzBN, featuring &lt;i&gt;&#957;&lt;/i&gt;-DABNA heteroatom alignment is developed via facile one-shot lithium-free borylation. &#928;-CzBN exhibits superior photophysical properties with a photoluminescence quantum yield close to 100&#8201;% and narrowband sky blue emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16&#8197;nm/85&#8197;meV. It also gives efficient TADF properties with a small singlet-triplet energy offset of 40&#8197;meV and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 2.9&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The optimized OLED using &#928;-CzBN as the emitter achieves an exceptional external quantum efficiency of 39.3&#8201;% with a low efficiency roll-off of 20&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a narrowband emission at 495&#8197;nm with FWHM of 21&#8197;nm/106&#8197;meV, making it one of the best reported devices based on MR emitters with comprehensive performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low Catalyst Loading Enhances Charge Accumulation for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar water oxidation is a critical step in artificial photosynthesis.&#160;&#160;Successful completion of the process requires four holes and releases four protons.&#160;&#160;It depends on the consecutive accumulation of charges at the active site.&#160;&#160;While recent research has shown an obvious dependence of the reaction kinetics on the hole concentrations on the surface of heterogeneous (photo)electrodes, little is known about how the catalyst density impacts the reaction rate.&#160;&#160;Using atomically dispersed Ir catalysts on hematite, we report a study on how the interplay between the catalyst density and the surface hole concentration influences the reaction kinetics.&#160;&#160;At low photon flux, where surface hole concentrations are low, faster charge transfer was observed on photoelectrodes with low catalyst density comparing to high catalyst&#160;&#160;density; at high photon flux and high applied potentials, where surface hole concentrations are moderate or high, slower surface charge recombination was afforded by low density catalysts.&#160;&#160;The results support that charge transfer between the light absorber and the catalyst is reversible; they reveal the unexpected benefits of low&#8208;density catalyst loading in facilitating forward charge transfer for desired chemical reactions.&#160;&#160;It is implied that for practical solar water splitting devices, a suitable catalyst loading is important for optimized performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Prolinyl Nucleotides Drive Enzyme&#8208;Free Genetic Copying of RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proline is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. It is found in all kingdoms of life. It also has remarkable activity as organocatalyst, and it is of structural importance for many folded polypeptides. Here we show that prolinyl nucleotides with a phosphoramidate linkage are active building blocks in enzyme&#8208; and ribozyme&#8208;free copying of RNA in the presence of monosubstituted imidazoles as organocatalysts. Both dinucleotides and mononucleotides are incorporated at the terminus of RNA primers in aqueous buffer, as instructed by the template sequence, in up to eight consecutive extension steps. Our results show that condensation products of amino acids and ribonucleotides can act like nucleoside triphosphates in media devoid of enzymes or ribozymes. They are metastable building blocks, readily activated by catalysts, helping to explain why the combination of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and nucleic acids was selected in molecular evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Activity of Molybdenum Complexes Bearing PNP&#8208;Type Pincer Ligand toward Ammonia Formation</title>

         <dc:description>We newly designed and prepared a novel molybdenum complex bearing a 4&#8208;[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pyridine&#8208;based PNP&#8208;type pincer ligand, based on the bond dissociation free energies (BDFEs) of the N&#8211;H bonds in molybdenum&#8211;imide complexes bearing various substituted pyridine&#8208;based PNP&#8208;type pincer ligands.&#160;&#160;The complex worked as an excellent catalyst toward ammonia formation from the reaction of an atmospheric pressure of dinitrogen with samarium diiodide as a reductant and water as a proton source under ambient reaction conditions, where up to 3580 equivalents of ammonia were formed based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst.&#160;&#160;The catalytic activity was significantly improved by one order of magnitude larger than those observed when using the complex before modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Data&#8208;Dependent Acquisition with Precursor Coisolation Improves Proteome Coverage and Measurement Throughput for Label&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Cell Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We combined efficient sample preparation and ultra&#8208;low&#8208;flow liquid chromatography with a newly developed data acquisition and analysis scheme termed wide window acquisition (WWA) to quantify &gt;3,000 proteins from single cells in rapid label&#8208;free analyses. WWA employs large isolation windows to intentionally co&#8208;isolate and co&#8208;fragment adjacent precursors along with the selected precursor. Optimized WWA increases proteome coverage by ~40% relative to standard approaches. For a 40&#8208;min LC gradient operated at ~15 nL/min, we identified an average of 3,524 proteins per single&#8208;cell&#8208;sized aliquot of protein digest. Reducing the active gradient to 20 min resulted in a modest 10% decrease in proteome coverage. Using this platform, we compared protein expression between single HeLa cells having an essential autophagy gene,&#160;atg9a,&#160;knocked out, with their isogenic WT parental line. Similar proteome coverage was observed, and 268 proteins were significantly up&#8208; or downregulated. &#160;Protein upregulation primarily related to innate immunity, vesicle trafficking and protein degradation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in the immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment, yet in situ engineering of TAMs for enhanced tumor immunotherapy remains a significant challenge in translational immune&#8208;oncology. Here, we report an innovative nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug (STNSP@ELE) strategy that leverages two&#8208;dimensional (2D) stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (STNSP) and &#946;&#8208;Elemene (ELE), a small&#8208;molecule anticancer drug, to overcome TAM&#8208;mediated immunosuppression and improve chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. Our results demonstrate that both STNSP and &#946;&#8208;Elemene are capable of polarizing the tumor&#8208;supportive M2&#8208;like TAMs into tumor&#8208;suppressive M1&#8208;like phenotype, which acts with the ELE chemotherapeutic to booster anti&#8208;tumor responses. In vivo mouse studies demonstrate that STNSP@ELE treatment can reprogram the immunosuppressive TME by significantly increasing the intra&#8208;tumoral ratio of M1/M2&#8208;like TAMs, enhancing the population of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells, and elevating the expression of immunostimulatory cytokines in B16F10 melanomas, thereby promoting a robust anti&#8208;tumor response. Our study not only demonstrates that the STNSP@ELE chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic nanoplatform has immune&#8208;modulatory capabilities that can overcome TAM&#8208;mediated immunosuppression in solid tumors, but also highlights the promise of this nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug strategy in developing other nano&#8208;immunotherapeutics and treating various types of immunosuppressive tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Self&#8208;Dissociation is Insensitive to Nanoscale Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoconfinement effects on water dissociation and reactivity remain controversial, despite their importance to understand the aqueous chemistry at interfaces, pores, or aerosols. The pKw in confined environments has been assessed from experiments and simulations in a few specific cases, leading to dissimilar conclusions. Here, with the use of carefully designed ab&#8208;initio simulations, we demonstrate that the energetics of bulk water dissociation is conserved intact to unexpectedly small length&#8208;scales, down to aggregates of only a dozen molecules or pores of widths below 2 nm. The reason is that most of the free&#8208;energy involved in water autoionization comes from breaking the O&#8208;H covalent bond, which has a comparable barrier in the bulk liquid, in a small droplet of nanometer size, or in a nanopore in the absence of strong interfacial interactions. Thus, dissociation free&#8208;energy profiles in nanoscopic aggregates or in 2D slabs of 1 nm width reproduce the behavior corresponding to the bulk liquid, regardless of whether the corresponding nanophase is delimited by a solid or a gas interface. The present work provides a definite and fundamental description of the mechanism and thermodynamics of water dissociation at different scales with broader implications on reactivity and self&#8208;ionization at the air&#8208;liquid interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of Nonpolar C&#8211;C Bonds via &#960;&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Enabled Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activation of C&#8211;C bonds allows editing of molecular skeletons, but methods for selective activation of nonpolar C&#8211;C bonds in the absence of a chelation effect or a driving force derived from opening of a strained ring are scarce. Herein, we report a method for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed activation of nonpolar C&#8211;C bonds of pro&#8208;aromatic compounds by means of &#960;&#8208;coordination&#8208;enabled aromatization. This method was effective for cleavage of C&#8211;C(alkyl) and C&#8211;C(aryl) bonds and for ring&#8208;opening of spirocyclic compounds, providing an array of benzene&#8208;ring&#8208;containing products. The isolation of a methyl ruthenium complex intermediate supports a mechanism involving ruthenium&#8208;mediated C&#8211;C bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>A Smart Deoxyribozyme&#8208;Programmable Catalytic DNA Circuit for High&#8208;Contrast MicroRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic catalytic DNA circuits have been well recognized as the signal amplification toolbox for sensitive intracellular imaging, yet their selectivity and efficiency are always constrained by uncontrolled off&#8208;site signal leakage and inefficient on&#8208;site circuitry activation. Thus, the endogenously controllable on&#8208;site exposure/activation of DNA circuits is highly desirable for achieving the selective imaging of live cells. Herein, an endogenously activated DNAzyme strategy was facilely integrated with a catalytic DNA circuit for guiding the selective and efficient microRNA imaging in vivo. To prevent the off&#8208;site activation, the circuitry constitute was initially caged without sensing functions, yet could be selectively liberated by DNAzyme amplifier for guaranteeing the high&#8208;contrast microRNA imaging in target cells. This intelligent on&#8208;site modulation strategy can tremendously expand these molecularly engineered circuits in biological system.</dc:description>

         <title>An Experimental and Computational Investigation Rules Out Direct Nucleophilic Addition on the N2 Ligand in Manganese Dinitrogen Complex [Cp(CO)2Mn(N2)]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have re&#8208;examined the reactivity of the manganese dinitrogen complex [Cp(CO)2Mn(N2)] (1, Cp = &#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, C5H5) with phenylithium (PhLi). By combining experiment and density functional theory (DFT), we have found that, unlike previously reported, the direct nucleophilic attack of the carbanion onto coordinated dinitrogen does not occur. Instead, PhLi reacts with one of the CO ligand to provide an anionic acylcarbonyl dinitrogen metallate [Cp(CO)(N2)MnCOPh]Li (3) that is stable only below &#8211;40 &#176;C. Full characterization of 3 (including single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) was performed. This complex decomposes quickly above &#8211;20 &#176;C with N2 loss to give a phenylate complex [Cp(CO)2MnPh]Li (2). The latter compound was erroneously formulated as an anionic diazenido compound [Cp(CO)2MnN(Ph)=N]Li in earlier reports, ruling out the claimed and so&#8208;far unique behavior of the N2 ligand in 1. DFT calculations were run to explore both the hypothesized and the experimentally verified reactivity of 1 with PhLi and are fully consistent with our results. Direct attack of a nucleophile on metal&#8208;coordinated N2 remains to be demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalysts with metal&#8208;Nx sites have long been considered as effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet the accurate structure&#8208;property correlations of these active sites remain debatable. Report here is a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept method to construct 1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraaza[14]annulene (TAA)&#8208;based polymer nanocomposites with well&#8208;managed electronic microenvironment via electron&#8208;donors/acceptors interaction of altering electron&#8208;withdrawing &#946;&#8208;site substituents. DFT calculation proves the optimal &#8208;Cl substituted catalyst (CoTAA&#8208;Cl@GR) tailored the key OH* intermediate interaction with Co&#8208;N4 sites under the d&#8208;orbital regulation, hence reaching the top of ORR performance with excellent turnover frequency (0.49 e s&#8722;1 site&#8722;1). The combination of in&#8208;situ scanning electrochemical microscopy and variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry techniques contribute the great ORR kinetics of CoTAA&#8208;Cl@GR to the relatively high accessible site density (7.71&#215;1019 site g&#8208;1) and fast electron outbound propagation mechanism. This work provides theoretical guidance for rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for ORR and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Degradable, Ultraviolet&#8208;Crosslinked Pressure&#8208;Sensitive Adhesives Made from Thioester&#8208;Functional Acrylate Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are made from soft, irreversibly lightly crosslinked polymers. Even after removal from surfaces, they retain insoluble networks which pose problems during the recycling of glass and cardboard. Herein, degradable PSAs are presented that provide the required performance in use but have networks that can be degraded after use. A series of copolymers was prepared through radical copolymerization of n&#8208;butyl acrylate, 4&#8208;acryloyloxy benzophenone (ABP) photo&#8208;crosslinker, and dibenzo[c,e]oxepin&#8208;5(7H)&#8208;thione (DOT) to provide degradable backbone thioesters. The optimum tack and peel strengths were found for molar contents of 0.05 mol% ABP and 0.25 mol% DOT. Degradation of the backbone thioesters through aminolysis or thiolysis led to the full dissolution of the networks, loss of adhesive properties of films (decreases in the measured tack and peel strengths), and the quick detachment of model labels from a substrate. Inclusion of DOT into PSAs offers a viable route toward degradable and recyclable packaging labels.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for High&#8208;Selectivity Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The site isolation strategy has been employed in thermal catalytic acetylene semihydrogenation to inhibit overhydrogenation and C&#8208;C coupling. However, there is a dearth of analogous investigations in electrocatalytic systems. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) simulations demonstrate that isolated Cu metal sites have higher energy barriers on overhydrogenation and C&#8208;C coupling. Following this result, we develop Cu single&#8208;atom catalysts highly dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix, which exhibit high ethylene selectivity (&gt;80% Faradaic efficiency for ethylene, &lt;1% Faradaic efficiency for C4, and no ethane) at high concentrations of acetylene. The superior performance observed in the electrocatalytic selective hydrogenation of acetylene can be attributed to the weak adsorption of ethylene intermediates and highly energy barriers on C&#8208;C coupling at isolated sites, as confirmed by both DFT calculations and experimental results. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the isolated sites inhibiting the side reactions of electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation.</dc:description>

Following this result, we develop Cu single-atom catalysts highly dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon matrix, which exhibit high ethylene selectivity (&amp;gt;80% Faradaic efficiency for ethylene, &amp;lt;1% Faradaic efficiency for C4, and no ethane) at high concentrations of acetylene. The superior performance observed in the electrocatalytic selective hydrogenation of acetylene can be attributed to the weak adsorption of ethylene intermediates and highly energy barriers on C-C coupling at isolated sites, as confirmed by both DFT calculations and experimental results. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the isolated sites inhibiting the side reactions of electrocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolyte Design for Improving Mechanical Stability of Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emerging electrolyte design, which can construct high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes, is proposed for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. High&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability SEI effectively restricts its fracture and ongoing reactions of electrolytes on lithium metal anodes, which notably improves the stability of practical lithium&#8211;sulfur coin and pouch cells.







Abstract
Practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are severely plagued by the instability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed in routine ether electrolytes. Herein, an electrolyte with 1,3,5&#8208;trioxane (TO) and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) as co&#8208;solvents is proposed to construct a high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability SEI by enriching organic components in Li&#8722;S batteries. The high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;stability SEI works compatibly in Li&#8722;S batteries. TO with high polymerization capability can preferentially decompose and form organic&#8208;rich SEI, strengthening mechanical stability of SEI, which mitigates crack and regeneration of SEI and reduces the consumption rate of active Li, Li polysulfides, and electrolytes. Meanwhile, DME ensures high specific capacity of S cathodes. Accordingly, the lifespan of Li&#8722;S batteries increases from 75&#8197;cycles in routine ether electrolyte to 216&#8197;cycles in TO&#8208;based electrolyte. Furthermore, a 417&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 Li&#8722;S pouch cell undergoes 20&#8197;cycles. This work provides an emerging electrolyte design for practical Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Identifying the Role of Lewis&#8208;base Sites for the Chemistry in Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis&#8208;base site of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 is capable of capturing Li+ during the discharge process, which can optimize the adsorption strength of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 towards LiO2 intermediates, thereby leading to the solution&#8208;mediated growth of Li2O2 and ultimately improving the discharge capacity of the lithium&#8208;oxygen battery. In addition, Lewis&#8208;base site can promote the activation of O2 and Li2O2 to reduce the overpotential of the lithium&#8208;oxygen battery.







Abstract
Lewis&#8208;base sites have been widely applied to regulate the properties of Lewis&#8208;acid sites in electrocatalysts for achieving a drastic technological leap of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Whereas, the direct role and underlying mechanism of Lewis&#8208;base in the chemistry for LOBs are still rarely elucidated. Herein, we comprehensively shed light on the pivotal mechanism of Lewis&#8208;base sites in promoting the electrocatalytic reaction processes of LOBs by constructing the metal&#8211;organic framework containing Lewis&#8208;base sites (named as UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the Lewis&#8208;base sites can act as electron donors that boost the activation of O2/Li2O2 during the discharged&#8208;charged process, resulting in the accelerated reaction kinetics of LOBs. More importantly, the in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra and DFT calculations firstly demonstrate the Lewis&#8208;base sites can convert Li2O2 growth mechanism from surface&#8208;adsorption growth to solvation&#8208;mediated growth due to the capture of Li+ by Lewis&#8208;base sites upon discharged process, which weakens the adsorption energy of UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 towards LiO2. As a proof of concept, LOB based on UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can achieve a high discharge specific capacity (12&#8201;661&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), low discharged&#8208;charged overpotential (0.87&#8197;V) and long cycling life (169&#8197;cycles). This work reveals the direct role of Lewis&#8208;base sites, which can guide the design of electrocatalysts featuring Lewis&#8208;acid/base dual centers for LOBs.

         <title>Direct Observation of the Ethyl Radical in the Pyrolysis of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We directly detect the ethyl radical intermediate in ethane pyrolysis for the first time, and reveal new insights into the reaction mechanism based upon our observations. This advance was enabled by a combination of isotopic microreactor studies, master equation based kinetics calculations, and threshold photoelectron&#8208;photoion coincidence spectroscopy.







Abstract
We report the first direct detection of ethyl radical in the pyrolysis of ethane. Observation of this vital intermediate was made possible in this extremely reactive environment by the use of a microreactor coupled with synchrotron radiation and photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy, despite its short lifetime and low concentration. Together with ab&#8208;initio master equation&#8208;calculated rates and fully coupled computational fluid dynamics simulations, our measurements show that even under the low pressures and short residence times in our experiment, ethyl formation can only be explained by bimolecular reactions; the most important is the catalytic attack of ethane by H atoms, which are then regenerated by decomposition of the nascent ethyl radicals. Our results complete the observation of all hypothesized intermediates in this industrially important process and highlight the need for further studies under additional conditions using similar methods to improve existing models and optimize process chemistries.

         <title>A Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Pathologically Activated Assay for Efficient Bioorthogonal Catalytic Selective Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A representative acid/H2S&#8208;responsive molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based POM doped with Cu (Cu&#8208;POM NCs) has been constructed for selective antibiofilm therapy. The Cu&#8208;POM NCs not only self&#8208;assemble into larger aggregates for biofilm&#8208;responsive and efficient alkyne&#8208;azide click (CuAAC) reactions to generate antibacterial molecules, but also produce a NIR&#8208;II photothermal effect, switchable by H2S in pathogens for selective therapy.







Abstract
Since polyoxometalates (POMs) can undergo reversible multi&#8208;electron redox transformations, they have been used to modulate the electronic environment of metal nanoparticles for catalysis. Besides, POMs possess unique electronic structures and acid&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly ability. These properties inspired us to tackle the drawbacks of the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction in biomedical applications, such as low catalytic efficiency and unsatisfactory disease selectivity. Herein, we construct molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based POM nanoclusters doped with Cu (Cu&#8208;POM NCs) as a highly efficient bioorthogonal catalyst, which is responsive to pathologicallyacid and H2S for selective antibiofilm therapy. Leveraging the merits of POMs, the Cu&#8208;POM NCs exhibit biofilm&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly behavior, efficient CuAAC&#8208;mediated in situ synthesis of antibacterial molecules, and a NIR&#8208;II photothermal effect selectively triggered by H2S in pathogens. The consumption of bacterial H2S at the pathological site by Cu&#8208;POM NCs extremely decreases the number of persisterbacteria, which is conducive to the inhibition of bacterial tolerance and elimination of biofilms. Unlocked at pathological sites and endowed with NIR&#8208;II photothermal property, the constructed POM&#8208;based bioorthogonal catalytic platform provides new insights into the design of efficient and selective bioorthogonal catalysts for disease therapy.

We report a protocol for the reduction of amides to amines using a cationic BiIII catalyst with a tridentate ligand framework in combination with a simple and cheap silane as the reducing agent. Various amides can be reduced and a variety of functional groups can be tolerated. Kinetic analyses and modelling were used to elucidate the orders of each component and to generate a kinetic model that is in agreement with the observed experimental data.







Abstract
In this article we report that a cationic version of Akiba's BiIII complex catalyzes the reduction of amides to amines using silane as hydride donor. The catalytic system features low catalyst loadings and mild conditions, en route to secondary and tertiary aryl&#8208; and alkylamines. The system tolerates functional groups such as alkene, ester, nitrile, furan and thiophene. Kinetic studies on the reaction mechanism result in the identification of a reaction network with an important product inhibition that is in agreement with the experimental reaction profiles.

         <title>Desolvation&#8208;Induced Highly Symmetrical Terbium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Exhibiting Luminescent Self&#8208;Monitoring of Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical thermometer was obtained by the dehydration of a cyanido&#8208;bridged TbIII&#8722;CoIII framework. By this transformation, the TbIII centers change geometry to high&#8208;symmetry trigonal prismatic. This also induces a strong magnetic anisotropy providing single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) behavior with an energy barrier of 594(18)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and a wide temperature overlap with optical thermometry.







Abstract
A conjunction of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) behavior and luminescence thermometry is an emerging research line aiming at contactless read&#8208;out of temperature in future SMM&#8208;based devices. The shared working range between slow magnetic relaxation and the thermometric response is typically narrow or absent. We report TbIII&#8208;based emissive SMMs formed in a cyanido&#8208;bridged framework whose properties are governed by the reversible structural transformation from [TbIII(H2O)2][CoIII(CN)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.7H2O (1) to its dehydrated phase, TbIII[CoIII(CN)6] (2). The 8&#8208;coordinated complexes in 1 show the moderate SMM effect but it is enhanced for trigonal&#8208;prismatic TbIII complexes in 2, showing the SMM features up to 42&#8197;K. They are governed by the combination of QTM, Raman, and Orbach relaxation with the energy barrier of 594(18)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (854(26) K), one of the highest among the TbIII&#8208;based molecular nanomagnets. Both systems exhibit emission related to the f&#8211;f electronic transitions, with the temperature variations resulting in the optical thermometry below 100&#8197;K. The dehydration leads to a wide temperature overlap between the SMM behavior and thermometry, from 6&#8197;K to 42&#8197;K. These functionalities are further enriched after the magnetic dilution. The role of post&#8208;synthetic formation of high&#8208;symmetry TbIII complexes in achieving the SMM effect and hot&#8208;bands&#8208;based optical thermometry is discussed.

         <title>Extremely Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Lewis&#8208;Paired CN Groups for Organic p&#8208;Dopants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of various CN&#8208;functionalized conjugated molecules and Lewis acids has led to the synthesis of&#160;unprecedentedly strong organic p&#8208;dopants (LUMO level down to &#8722;5.93&#8197;eV) exhibiting excellent doping stability (over 40&#8197;h at 120&#8201;&#176;C). Lewis pairing leads to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the CN groups increasing almost twofold and the dopant size enlarging significantly.







Abstract
P&#8208;type chemical doping (p&#8208;doping) is a key technique to modulate the optical, electrical, and electronic properties of organic semiconductors. However, typical functional groups in organic p&#8208;dopants have insufficient electron&#8208;withdrawing strength, and the inevitable diffusion of dopants in host matrices degrades doping stabilities. Herein, we utilize extremely electron&#8208;withdrawing Lewis&#8208;paired CN groups as a new class of building blocks for designing unprecedentedly strong organic p&#8208;dopants with excellent doping stability. Various Lewis acids are paired with CN&#8208;functionalized conjugated molecules in the solution state, which strengthens the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of CN groups almost twofold. The large dopants afford outstanding doping stability against continuous heating and long&#8208;term atmospheric exposure, which is promising for practical applications in devices. Given the broad applicability of this simple combinatorial approach, it may impact many fields of (opto)electronics.

         <title>Facile Tuned TSCT&#8208;TADF in Donor&#8208;Acceptor MOF for Highly Adjustable Photonic Modules based on Heterostructures Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8208;A MOF) featuring highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) were realized. Furthermore, heterostructures crystals featuring highly adjustable emissions in wide wavelength range was fabricated, illustrating its potential as photonic modules for photonic integrated circuit applications.







Abstract
Highly adjustable photonic modules were constructed based on the heterostructures crystals of a new series of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8208;A MOF) featuring highly tunable thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). By introducing N&#8208;phenylcarbazole and derivatives as donor guests into the acceptor host NKU&#8208;111, highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer based TADF could be achieved through the engineering of heavy atom effect, which result in modulatable emission wavelength (540 to 600&#8197;nm) and enhanced quantum yield (up to 30.86&#8201;%). Furthermore, by rationally integrating the D&#8208;A MOFs with distinctive emissions, rod&#8208;like heterostructures crystals featuring excitation position dependent tip emissions in wide wavelength range (495 to 598&#8197;nm) could be fabricated, which could serve as highly potential photonic modules for photonic circuit applications.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Ultrasmall Recyclable Iridium(0) Nanoparticles for Regioselective Aromatic Hydrogenation of Phosphine Oxide Scaffolds: An Easy Access to New Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first highly regioselective hydrogenation of PV&#8208;substituted naphthalenes through ligand&#8208;free iridium(0) nanoparticle catalysis is described. This novel pathway allows the formation of both new and well&#8208;established H8&#8208;BINAP ligand&#8208;types.







Abstract
Herein, we developed the recyclable ligand&#8208;free iridium (Ir)&#8208;hydride based Ir0 nanoparticles (NPs) for the first regioselective partial hydrogenation of PV&#8208;substituted naphthalenes. Both the isolated and in situ generated NPs are catalytically active. A control nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study revealed the presence of metal&#8208;surface&#8208;bound hydrides, most likely formed from Ir0 species. A control NMR study confirmed that hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent was accountable for substrate activation via hydrogen bonding. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy of the catalyst supports the formation of ultrasmall NPs, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the dominance of Ir0 in the NPs. The catalytic activity of NPs is broad as showcased by highly regioselective aromatic ring reduction in various phosphine oxides or phosphonates. The study also showcased a novel pathway toward preparing bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;,8,8&#8242;&#8208;octahydro&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl (H8&#8208;BINAP) and its derivatives without losing enantioselectivity during catalytic events.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass Catalysts from Melting Glass&#8208;Forming Cobalt&#8208;Based Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework for Boosting Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advancement of novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts bears practical significance for improving photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. A MOF glass catalyst was synthesized via a melting glass&#8208;forming cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62). Introducing the MOF glass catalyst on various metal oxide semiconductor substrates coupled with NiO hole transport layer constructs the integrated Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes. From experimental analyses and density functional theory calculations, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62 can effectively promote charge transfer and separation, improve carrier mobility, accelerate the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction, and thus improve PEC performance.







Abstract
Sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics and serious charge recombination restrict the development of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The advancement of novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) catalysts bears practical significance for improving PEC water splitting performance. Herein, a MOF glass catalyst through melting glass&#8208;forming cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62) was introduced on various metal oxide (MO: Fe2O3, WO3 and BiVO4) semiconductor substrates coupled with NiO hole transport layer, constructing the integrated Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes. Owing to the excellent conductivity, stability and open active sites of MOF glass, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62/NiO/MO photoanodes exhibit a significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical water oxidation activity and stability in comparison to pristine MO photoanodes. From experimental analyses and density functional theory calculations, Co&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62 can effectively promote charge transfer and separation, improve carrier mobility, accelerate the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and thus improve PEC performance. This MOF glass not only serves as an excellent OER cocatalyst on tunable photoelectrodes, but also enables promising opportunities for PEC devices for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Preparation and Reactivity Study of a Versatile Trifluoromethylthiolating Agent: S&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Trifluoromethanesulfonothioate (TTST)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel CF3S reagent named TTST has been prepared in one step using commercially inexpensive materials. TTST is easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, highly reactive, and can be used to prepare many CF3S reagents. TTST can generate one CF3S+, two CF3S&#8722;, or both CF3S&#8901;/CF3&#8901; species. TTST exhibits high atom economy&#8211;all atoms except the oxygens can be used. TTST enabled to reach a new type of molecule, ArOSCF3, and revealed a novel catalytic CF3SII&#8208;rearrangement.







Abstract
A novel, air and thermally stable, yet highly reactive trifluoromethylthiolating reagent, CF3SO2SCF3 (1), was prepared easily in one step from commercially inexpensive CF3SO2Na and Tf2O. 1 is a highly versatile and atom&#8208;efficient reagent that can generate one equivalent of CF3S+, two equivalents of CF3S&#8722;, or a combination of CF3S&#8901;/CF3&#8901; species. Many high&#8208;yielding CF3S reactions of C, O, S, and N&#8208;nucleophiles were achieved, including the simple&#8208;step preparations of many reported CF3S reagents. 1 delivered a hitherto hard&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize ArOSCF3 that was followed by a novel CF3SII&#8208;rearrangement. Through Cu or TDAE/Ph3P combinations, 1 generated two equivalents of CF3S anion species, and the photo&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenes with 1 provided CF3/CF3S&#8208;containing products in high atom&#8208;efficiency.

         <title>T&#8208;shaped Ni0 Systems Featuring Cationic Tetrylenes: Direct Observation of L/Z&#8208;type Ligand Duality, and Alkene Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic low&#8208;coordinate tetrylenes are shown to behave as Z&#8208;type ligands towards Ni0, forming rare T&#8208;shaped Ni0 complexes. These selectively bind classical N&#8208;bases at EII (E=Ge, Sn), which switches the nature of this ligand centre from Z&#8208; to L&#8208;type, concomitant with a geometry switch at Ni to trigonal planar. T&#8208;shaped systems are active catalysts for alkene hydrogenation, establishing a new class of catalyst for this challenging transformation.







Abstract
We report a facile synthetic method for accessing rare T&#8208;shaped Ni0 species, stabilised by low&#8208;coordinate cationic germylene and stannylene ligands which behave as Z&#8208;type ligands toward Ni0. An in&#8208;depth computational analysis indicates significant Nid&#8594;Ep donation (E=Ge, Sn), with essentially no E&#8594;Ni donation. The tetrylene ligand's Lewis acidity can be modulated in situ through the addition of a donor ligand, which selectively binds at the Lewis acidic tetrylene site. This switches this binding centre from a Z&#8208;type to a classical L&#8208;type ligand, with a concomitant geometry switch at Ni0 from T&#8208;shaped to trigonal planar. Exploring the effects of this geometry switch in catalysis, isolated T&#8208;shaped complexes 3&#8201;a&#8211;c and 4&#8201;a&#8211;c are capable of the hydrogenation of alkenes under mild conditions, whilst the closely related trigonal planar and tetrahedral Ni0 complexes 5, D, and E, which feature L&#8208;type chloro&#8208; or cationic&#8208;tetrylene ligands, are inactive under these conditions. Further, addition of small amounts of N&#8208;bases to the catalytic systems involving T&#8208;shaped complexes significantly reduces turnover rates, giving evidence for the in situ modulation of ligand electronics for catalytic switching.

         <title>New Anderson&#8208;Based Polyoxometalate Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrodes for Energy Storage Boosted Through Keto&#8208;Enol Tautomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The engineering of novel nanostructured electrode materials represents a viable strategy to obtain devices with high energy and power density. We present the synthesis of two novel polyoxometalate&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (POCOF) with superior electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance (125&#8197;F/g), energy and power density (56.2&#8197;Wh/kg and 3.7&#8197;kW/kg, respectively) and high cyclability (5000 cycles).







Abstract
The unique electrochemical properties of polyoxometalates (POMs) render them ideal components for the fabrication of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance energy storage systems. However, their practical applications have been hindered by their high solubility in common electrolytes. This problem can be overcome by the effective hybridization of POMs with other materials. Here we present the design and synthesis of two novel polyoxometalate&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (POCOF) via one&#8208;pot solvothermal strategy between an amino&#8208;functionalized Anderson&#8208;type POM and a trialdehyde&#8208;based building unit. We show that structural and functional complexity can be enriched by adding hydroxyl groups in the 2,4,6 position to the benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde allowing to exploit for the first time in POCOFs the keto&#8208;enol tautomerization as additional feature to impart greater chemical stability to the COFs and enhanced properties leading to large specific surface area (347&#8197;m2/g) and superior electrochemical performance of the POCOF&#8208;1 electrodes, when compared with POCOF&#8208;2 electrodes that possess only imine&#8208;type linkage and with pristine POM electrodes. Specifically, POCOF&#8208;1 electrodes display remarkable specific, areal, and volumetric capacitance (125&#8197;F/g, 248&#8197;mF/cm2 and 41.9&#8197;mF/cm3, respectively) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A/g, a maximum energy density (56.2&#8197;Wh/kg), a maximum power density (3.7&#8197;kW/kg) and an outstanding cyclability (90&#8201;% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles).

         <title>Chiral Carbon Nanodots Can Act as Molecular Catalysts in Chemical and Photochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of chiral carbon nanodots (CNDs) is synthesized through a hydrothermal treatment of molecular precursors. The surface amino functionalities along with the photophysical and redox properties of the material allowed its exploitation as a multifunctional catalytic platform. The CNDs promote enantioselective organocatalytic reactions, photochemical processes and organophotoredox transformations.







Abstract
In this work, a microwave synthesis followed by a simple purification process produces a new type of chiral Carbon Nanodots (CNDs). These CNDs are soluble in organic solvents, exhibit amino groups on their surface and display interesting absorption and emission properties along with mirror image profiles in the electronic circular dichroism spectrum. All these features set the stage for CNDs to act as multifunctional catalytic platforms, able to promote diverse chemical transformations. In particular, the outer shell composition of CNDs was instrumental to carry out organocatalytic reactions in an enantioselective fashion. In addition, the redox and light&#8208;absorbing properties of the material are suitable to drive photochemical processes. Finally, the photoredox and organocatalytic activations of CNDs were exploited at the same time to promote a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. This work demonstrates that CNDs can be used as catalysts to promote multiple reactivities, previously considered exclusive domain of molecular catalysts.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Stable Hydrogen Production from Water and Lactic Acid via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis in a Porous Microreactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term stable H2 production from H2O via visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis using lactic acid as a sacrificial reagent and Pt/CdS as a photocatalyst is achieved in a porous microreactor (PP12), with a H2 production rate as high as 602.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. PP12 can be scaled up to a flat&#8208;plate reactor with an area as large as 1&#8197;m2, without a decrease in H2 production efficiency, offering great potential for commercialization.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is significant to overcome challenges like fossil fuel depletion and carbon dioxide emission, but its efficiency is still far below that which is needed for commercialization. Herein, we achieve long&#8208;term stable H2 bubbling production from water (H2O) and lactic acid via visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis in a porous microreactor (PP12); the catalytic system benefits from photocatalyst dispersion, charge separation, mass transfer, and dissociation of O&#8722;H bonds associated with H2O. With the widely used platinum/cadmium&#8208;sulfide (Pt/CdS) photocatalyst, PP12 leads to a H2 bubbling production rate of 602.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, which is 1000&#8197;times higher than that in a traditional reactor. Even when amplifying PP12 into a flat&#8208;plate reactor with an area as large as 1&#8197;m2 and extending the reaction time to 100&#8197;h, the H2 bubbling production rate still remains at around 600.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, offering great potential for commercialization.

         <title>Highly Efficient FeIII&#8208;initiated Self&#8208;cycled Fenton System in Piezo&#8208;catalytic Process for Organic Pollutants Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient FeIII&#8208;initiated piezo&#8208;catalytic self&#8208;cycled Fenton (PSF) system has been constructed. The rapid FeIII/FeII cycle couple with the greatly improved two&#8208;electron water oxidative H2O2 production kinetics, providing an exceptional Fenton degradation efficiency far exceeding that of the classical FeII PSF system.







Abstract
Piezo&#8208;catalytic self&#8208;Fenton (PSF) system has been emerging as a promising technique for wastewater treatment, while the competing O2 reductive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and FeIII reduction seriously limited the reaction kinetics. Here, we develop a two&#8208;electron water oxidative H2O2 production (WOR&#8722;H2O2) coupled with FeIII reduction over a FeIII/BiOIO3 piezo&#8208;catalyst for highly efficient PSF. It is found that the presence of FeIII can simultaneously initiate the WOR&#8722;H2O2 and reduction of FeIII to FeII, thereby enabling a rapid reaction kinetics towards subsequent Fenton reaction of H2O2/FeII. The FeIII initiating PSF system offers exceptional self&#8208;recyclable degradation of pollutants with a degradation rate constant for sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) over 3.5 times as that of the classic FeII&#8208;PSF system. This study offers a new perspective for constructing efficient PSF systems and shatters the preconceived notion of FeIII in the Fenton reaction.

         <title>Low&#8208;silica Cu&#8208;CHA Zeolite Enriched with Al Pairs Transcribed from Silicoaluminophosphate Seed: Synthesis and Ammonia Selective Catalytic Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strict &#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722; sequence in the fragments from the dissolution of SAPO seed promoted the Al pairs with the &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; sequence via a transcription process and thus results in a low&#8208;silica CHA zeolite with enriched Al pairs.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;exchanged low&#8208;silica CHA zeolites (Si/Al&#8804;4) synthesized without organic templates are promising candidate catalysts for ammonia selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NH3&#8208;SCR), but their practical application is restricted due to the low hydrothermal stability. Here, inspired by the transcription from duplex DNA to RNA, we synthesized Al pairs enriched low&#8208;silica CHA zeolite (CHA&#8208;SPAEI, Si/Al=3.7) by using silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) featured by strict alternation of &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; tetrahedra as seed. The proportion of Al pairs in CHA&#8722;SPAEI is 78&#8201;%, which is much higher than that in the conventional low&#8208;silica CHA (CHA&#8208;LS, 52&#8201;%). After hydrothermal ageing at 800&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h, Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;SPAEI shows NO conversion above 90&#8201;% within 225&#8211;500&#8201;&#176;C under a gas hourly space velocity of 200,000&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is much better than that of Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;LS. The spatial close proximity of Al pairs in CHA&#8208;SPAEI is confirmed by the 27Al double&#8208;quantum single&#8208;quantum two&#8208;dimensional NMR analyses. The strict &#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8208; sequence in the fragments from the dissolution of SAPO seed promotes the Al pairs with the &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; sequence via a transcription process. The utilization of aluminophosphate&#8208;based zeolites as seeds opens up a new avenue for the regulation of the Al distribution in zeolites.

The strict &#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;P(Si)&#8722;O- sequence in the fragments from the dissolution of SAPO seed promotes the Al pairs with the &#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722;Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;O&#8722; sequence via a transcription process. The utilization of aluminophosphate-based zeolites as seeds opens up a new avenue for the regulation of the Al distribution in zeolites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruptenes: A Family of Terpene Analogs Give Insight into Cyclisation Mechanisms by Cascade Disruption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two terpenoid substrate analogs with a saturated C6&#8722;C7 bond were converted with terpene synthases. Their blocked reactivity caused interruption of the cyclisation cascade leading to ruptenes that represent cationic intermediates of the natural cyclisation reaction. Such intermediates are difficult to observe directly and thus the ruptenes deepen our understanding of terpene synthase catalysis.







Abstract
The terpenoid substrate analogs (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrogeranylgeranyl diphosphate (6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GGPP) and (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydrogeranylfarnesyl diphosphate (6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP) were synthesised from (S)&#8208;citronellol and enzymatically converted with nine diterpene and two sesterterpene synthases, respectively. In two cases the substrate analogs were converted into diterpenes in cyclisation reactions corresponding to those observed for the native substrate GGPP, while the cyclisation cascade was disrupted or redirected in the other nine cases, leading to products that were named ruptenes. Several of the isolated ruptenes represent deprotonation products of cationic intermediates that are analogs of the intermediates proposed along the cyclisation cascades for the native substrates GGPP or GFPP, thus giving insights into the complex reaction mechanisms of terpene synthase mediated biosynthesis.

         <title>Bilayer&#8208;Coating Strategy for Hydrophobic Nanoparticles Providing Colloidal Stability, Functionality, and Surface Protection in Biological Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying the surface of oleate&#8208;coated hydrophobic particles to render them stable in aqueous biological environments is often challenging. We present a one&#8208;step reaction, to form a bilayer consisting of oleate and dodecylamine moieties, which provides excellent stability and versatility as it allows further functionalization via carbodiimide chemistry.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of nanoparticles is a key step on the pathway from particle design towards applications in biologically relevant environments. Here, a bilayer&#8208;based strategy for the surface modification of hydrophobic nanoparticles is introduced that leads to excellent colloidal stability in aqueous environments and good protection against disintegration, while permitting surface functionalization via simple carbodiimide chemistry. We have demonstrated the excellent potential of this strategy using upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), initially coated with oleate and therefore dispersible only in organic solvents. The hydrophobic oleate capping is maintained and a bilayer is formed upon addition of excess oleate. The bilayer approach renders protection towards luminescence loss by water quenching, while the incorporation of additional molecules containing amino functions yields colloidal stability and facilitates the introduction of functionality. The biological relevance of the approach was confirmed with the use of two model dyes, a photosensitizer and a nitric oxide (NO) probe that, when attached to the surface of the UCNPs, retained their functionality to produce singlet oxygen and detect intracellular NO, respectively. We present a simple and fast strategy to protect and functionalize inorganic nanoparticles in biological media, which is important for controlled surface engineering of nanosized materials for theranostic applications.

         <title>Engaging Early&#8208;Career Scientists in Global Policy&#8208;Making</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Societal, political, and institutional barriers impede early&#8208;career scientists&#8217; engagement in evidence&#8208;informed policy&#8208;making to address societal challenges. Better training, recognition, and stakeholder reforms could raise awareness and involvement of scientists across disciplines in the policy&#8208;making process.







Abstract
Pressing global challenges, such as climate change, the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, or antibiotic resistance, require coordinated international responses guided by evidence&#8208;informed decisions. For this purpose, it is critical that scientists engage in providing insights during the decision&#8208;making process. However, the mechanisms for the engagement of scientists in policy&#8208;making are complex and vary internationally, which often poses significant challenges to their involvement. Herein, we address some of the mechanisms and barriers for scientists to engage in policy&#8208;making with a global perspective by early&#8208;career scientists. We highlight the importance of scientific academies, societies, universities, and early&#8208;career networks as stakeholders and how they can adapt their structures to actively contribute to shaping global policies, with representative examples from chemistry&#8208;related disciplines. We showcase the importance of raising awareness, providing resources and training, and leading discussions about connecting emerging scientists with global decision&#8208;makers to address societal challenges through policies.

         <title>Mechanochemical reactions from individual impacts to global transformation kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Typically induced by the mechanical processing of powders in ball mills, mechanochemical transformations are considered to occur as a result of the application of mechanical force to solid reagents. Nevertheless, such claim has remained vague so far and the undeniable deep connection between the dynamic compaction of powders during impacts and the overall transformation degree has yet to be fully disclosed. In the present work, we show that the square planar bis(dibenzoylmethanato)Ni(II) coordination compound undergoes trimerization when its powder experiences even a single ball impact. Based on systematic experiments with individual ball impacts and analysis by Raman spectroscopy, we provide here quantitative mapping of the transformation in the powder compact and deduce bulk reaction kinetics from multiple individual impacts.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Conformation of Dimeric Acceptors and Their Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The determination of molecular conformation of oligomeric acceptors (OAs)&#160;and their impact on molecular packing are crucial for understanding the photovoltaic performance of resulting polymer solar cells (PSCs) but have not been well studied yet. Herein, we synthesized two dimeric acceptor materials, DIBP3F&#8208;Se and DIBP3F&#8208;S, which bridged two segments of Y6&#8208;derivatives by selenophene and thiophene, respectively.&#160;Theoretical simulation and experimental&#160;1D and 2D NMR&#160;spectroscopic studies prove that both dimers exhibit&#160;O&#8208;shape conformation other than&#160;S&#8208; or&#160;U&#8208;shape counter&#8208;ones. Notably, this&#160;O&#8208;shaped conformation is likely governed by a distinctive "conformational lock" mechanism, arising from the intensified intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the two terminal groups of the dimers.&#160;PSCs based on DIBP3F&#8208;Se deliver a maximum efficiency of 18.09%, outperforming DIBP3F&#8208;S&#8208;based cells (16.11%) and ranking among the highest efficiencies for OA&#8208;based PSCs. This work demonstrates a facile method to obtain OA conformations and highlights the potential of dimeric acceptors for high&#8208;performance PSCs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A phosphor emitting both white light and broad near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation can simultaneously provide visual inspection and early signs of rotting of food products.&#160;The broad NIR emission is absorbed by the vibrational overtones of water molecules present in food items, providing the non&#8208;invasive image contrast to assess the food freshness.&#160;Here we design a phosphor, namely, Cr3+&#8208;Bi3+&#8208;codoped Cs2Ag0.6Na0.4InCl6, that simultaneously emit warm white light and broad NIR (1000 nm) radiation with quantum yield 27%.&#160;This dual emitter is designed by combining the features of s2&#8208;electron (Bi3+) and d3&#8208;electron (Cr3+) doping in a weak crystal field of the halide perovskite host. 6s2 to 6s16p1&#160;excitation of Bi3+, using a commercial 370 nm ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (UV&#8208;LED), yields both the emissions.&#160;A fraction of the excited Bi3+ dopants emit the warm white light, and the other fraction transfers its energy non&#8208;radiatively to Cr3+.&#160;Then the Cr3+ de&#8208;excites emitting broad NIR emission.&#160;Temperature dependent (6.4 &#8211; 300 K) photoluminescence in combination with Tanabe&#8208;Sugano diagram show that the Cr3+ experiences a weak crystal field (Dq/B = 2.2),&#160;yielding the&#160;4T2 to 4A2&#160;NIR emission.&#160;As a proof of concept, we fabricated a panel containing&#160;122 phosphor&#8208;converted LEDs, demonstrating its capability to inspect food products.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Linear and Cyclic Poly(diphenylacetylene)s by Molybdenum and Tungsten Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improved methods for the synthesis of linear and cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s by polymerization of the corresponding diphenylacetylenes using MoCl5&#8208; and WCl4&#8208;based catalytic systems have been developed. MoCl5 induces migratory insertion polymerization of diphenylacetylenes in the presence of arylation reagents such as Ph4Sn and ArSnnBu3 to produce cis&#8208;stereoregular linear poly(diphenylacetyelene)s with high molecular weights (Mn = 30,000&#8210;3,200,000) in good yields (up to 98%). On the other hand, WCl4 induces ring expansion polymerization of diphenylacetylenes in the presence of Ph4Sn or reducing reagents to produce cis&#8208;stereoregular cyclic poly(diphenylacetylene)s with high molecular weights (number&#8208;average molar mass (Mn) = 20,000&#8210;250,000) in moderate to good yields (up to 90%). Both catalytic systems are applicable to the polymerization of various diphenylacetylenes having polar functional groups such as esters that are not efficiently polymerized by conventional methods using WCl6&#8208;Ph4Sn and TaCl5&#8208;nBu4Sn systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing&#160;Oxygen Vacancies via&#160;Engineering Heterostructured Fe3C/Fe3O4&#160;Catalysts for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions provides an intriguing pathway to convert N2 into NH3. However, the NRR&#8217;s kinetic barriers at low temperatures in desirable aqueous electrolytes remains a grand challenge due to the inert N&#8801;N bond of the N2 molecule. Herein, we propose a unique strategy for in situ oxygen vacancy construction to address the significant trade&#8208;off between N2 adsorption and NH3 desorption by building a hollow shell structured Fe3C/Fe3O4 heterojunction coated with carbon frameworks (Fe3C/Fe3O4@C). In the heterostructure, the Fe3C serves as a trigger to induce oxygen vacancies of the Fe3O4 component, which are likely active sites for the NRR. The unique design could optimize the adsorption strength of the N2 and NxHy intermediates, thus boosting the catalytic activity for the NRR. This work highlights the significance of the interaction between defect&#8208;engineering and interface&#8208;engineering strategies for regulating the electrocatalytic properties for the challenging NRR. It could motivate an in&#8208;depth exploration to advance N2 reduction to ammonia.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are promising for cryogenic energy storage. However, current researches on low&#8208;temperature PIBs are limited to half cells utilizing potassium metal as an anode, and realizing rechargeable full cells is challenged by lacking viable anode materials and compatible electrolytes. Herein, a hard carbon (HC)&#8208;based low&#8208;temperature potassium&#8208;ion full cell is successfully fabricated for the first time. Experimental evidence and theoretical analysis revealed that potassium storage behaviors of HC anodes in the matched low&#8208;temperature electrolyte involve defect adsorption, interlayer co&#8208;intercalation, and micropore filling. Notably, these unique potassiation processes exhibited low interfacial resistances and small reaction activation energies, enabling an excellent cycling performance of HC with a capacity of 172 mAh g&#8208;1 at &#8722;40 &#176;C (68% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity). Consequently, the HC&#8208;based full cells demonstrated impressive rechargeability and high energy density above 100 Wh kg&#8208;1cathode at &#8722;40 &#176;C, representing a significant advancement in the development of PIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fully Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework with Oxidative and Reductive Sites for Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction with Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing powerful photocatalytic system that can achieve the carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction half&#8208;reaction and the water (H2O) oxidation half&#8208;reaction simultaneously is a very challenging but meaningful task. Herein, a porous material with crystalline topological network, named viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re, was rationally synthesized by incorporating rhenium complexes as reductive sites and triazine ring structures as oxidative sites via robust &#8211;C=C&#8211; bond linkages. The charge separation ability is promoted by low polarized &#960;&#8211;bridges between rhenium complexes and triazine ring units, and the efficient charge separation enables the photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs separated by intramolecular charge transfer process to form photogenerated electrons involved in CO2 reduction and photogenerated holes participated in H2O oxidation simultaneously. The powerful viCOF&#8208;bpy&#8208;Re shows the highest catalytic photocatalytic carbon monoxide (CO) production rate of 190.6 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 with about 100% selectivity and oxygen (O2) evolution of 90.2 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 among all the porous materials in CO2 reduction with H2O as sacrificial agents. Therefore, a powerful photocatalytic system is successfully achieved, and this catalytic system exhibits excellent stability in the catalysis process for 50 hours. Meanwhile, the structure&#8211;function relationship was confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Achieving substantial anisotropic thermal expansion (TE) in solid&#8208;state materials is challenging as most materials undergo volumetric expansion upon heating. Here, we describe colossal, anisotropic TE in crystals of an organic compound functionalized with two azo groups. Interestingly, the material exhibits distinct and switchable TE behaviors within different temperature regions. At high temperature, two&#8208;dimensional, area zero TE and colossal, positive linear TE (&#945; = 211 MK&#8208;1) are attained due to dynamic motion, while at low temperature, moderate positive TE occurs in all directions. Investigation of the solid&#8208;state motion showed the change in enthalpy and entropy are quite different in the two temperature regions and solid&#8208;state NMR experiments support motion in the solid. Cycling experiments demonstrate that the solid&#8208;state motions and TE behaviors are completely reversible. These results reveal strategies for designing significant anisotropic and switchable behaviors in solid&#8208;state materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Myocardial&#8208;Targeting Tannic Cerium Nanocatalyst Attenuates Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Medications or surgery have been considered as effective protocols to treat IHD for decades. Yet the reperfusion of the blood flow frequently leads to the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing prominent and irreversible damage to the cardiomyocytes. In the present work, tannic acid&#8208;assembled tetravalent cerium (TA&#8208;Ce) nanocatalysts with appealing cardiomyocyte&#8208;targeting and antioxidation capability have been synthesized and applied for the effective and biocompatible ischemia/reperfusion injury therapeutics. TA&#8208;Ce nanocatalysts could effectively rescue the cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress induced by H2O2 challenge as well as oxygen&#8208;glucose deprivation in vitro. In the murine ischemia/reperfusion model, cardiac accumulation and intracellular ROS scavenging could be achieved against the pathology, substantially reducing the myocardial infarct area and recovering heart functionality. This work illuminates the design of nanocatalytic metal complexes and their therapeutic prospects in ischemic heart diseases with high effectiveness and biocompatibility, paving the way for the clinical translation from bench to bedside.</dc:description>

         <title>A Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free Molecular Motif Based on Centrosymmetric Bird&#8208;like Structured Tetraphenylenes with Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP) Afterglow over 8s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with highly efficient and long&#8208;persistent afterglow has drawn substantial awareness. Commonly, spin&#8208;orbit coupling can be improved by introducing heavy atoms into pure&#8208;organic molecules. However, this strategy will simultaneously increase the radiative and non&#8208;radiative transition rate, further resulting in dramatic decreases in the excited state lifetime and afterglow duration. Here in this work, a highly centrosymmetric bird&#8208;like structure tetraphenylene (TeP), and its three symmetrical halogenated derivatives (TeP&#8208;F, TeP&#8208;Cl and TeP&#8208;Br) are synthesized, while their RTP properties and mechanisms are systematically investigated by both theoretical and experimental approaches. As the results, the rigid, highly twisted conformation of TeP restricts the non&#8208;radiative processes of RTP and gives rise to the enhancement of electron&#8208;exchange, which can contribute to the RTP radiation process. Despite the faint RTP of the bromine and chlorine&#8208;substituted ones (TeP&#8208;Br, TeP&#8208;Cl), the fluoro&#8208;substituted TeP&#8208;F exhibited a long phosphorescent lifetime of up to 890 ms, corresponding to an extremely long RTP afterglow over 8 s, which could be incorporated into the best series of non&#8208;heavy&#8208;atom RTP materials reported in previous literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of the Dynamics of the Human Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor Reveals Insights into the Energy Landscape of the Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total amplitude of reorientational motion extracted from MD is plotted on the GHSR molecule for apo (inactive, left) and ghrelin&#8208;bound (active, right) GHSR. Decrease in dynamics at histidine residues H2586.30 and H2806.52 upon ghrelin&#8208;binding shifts the NMR resonances to higher ppm values, whereas H186ECL2 sees smaller changes in the total motion and correspondingly has a smaller change in chemical shift.







Abstract
G protein&#8208;coupled receptors initiate signal transduction in response to ligand binding. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), the focus of this study, binds the 28 residue peptide ghrelin. While structures of GHSR in different states of activation are available, dynamics within each state have not been investigated in depth. We analyze long molecular dynamics simulation trajectories using &#8220;detectors&#8221; to compare dynamics of the apo and ghrelin&#8208;bound states yielding timescale&#8208;specific amplitudes of motion. We identify differences in dynamics between apo and ghrelin&#8208;bound GHSR in the extracellular loop 2 and transmembrane helices 5&#8211;7. NMR of the GHSR histidine residues reveals chemical shift differences in these regions. We evaluate timescale specific correlation of motions between residues of ghrelin and GHSR, where binding yields a high degree of correlation for the first 8 ghrelin residues, but less correlation for the helical end. Finally, we investigate the traverse of GHSR over a rugged energy landscape via principal component analysis.

         <title>Electrode/Electrolyte Synergy for Concerted Promotion of Electron and Proton Transfers toward Efficient Neutral Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy is devised to enhance the neutral water oxidation. The concerted promotion of electron transfer via the IrOx/NiOOH interface and proton transfer via the near&#8208;surface ion environment synergistically accelerated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer events. The expedited kinetics enabled the direct detection of oxygen intermediates at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Neutral water oxidation is a crucial half&#8208;reaction for various electrochemical applications requiring pH&#8208;benign conditions. However, its sluggish kinetics with limited proton and electron transfer rates greatly impacts the overall energy efficiency. In this work, we created an electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy for simultaneously enhancing the proton and electron transfers at the interface toward highly efficient neutral water oxidation. The charge transfer was accelerated between the iridium oxide and in situ formed nickel oxyhydroxide on the electrode end. The proton transfer was expedited by the compact borate environment that originated from hierarchical fluoride/borate anions on the electrolyte end. These concerted promotions facilitated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) events. Due to the electrode/electrolyte synergy, Ir&#8722;O and Ir&#8722;OO&#8722; intermediates could be directly detected by in situ Raman spectroscopy, and the rate&#8208;limiting step of Ir&#8722;O oxidation was determined. This synergy strategy can extend the scope of optimizing electrocatalytic activities toward more electrode/electrolyte combinations.

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked F&#8208;rich Polymer to Inhibit Lead Leakage for Sustainable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic small&#8208;molecule octafluoro&#8208;1,6&#8208;hexanediol diacrylate (OF&#8208;HDDA) is introduced to in situ crosslink forming a polymer (POF&#8208;HDDA), which anchors uncoordinated lead ions and prevents lead leakage from water and oxygen invasion, and concurrently improves the long&#8208;term stability of the corresponding devices.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells have demonstrated commercial viability, but still face the risk of contamination from lead leakage and long&#8208;term stability problems caused by defects. Here, an organic small molecule (octafluoro&#8208;1,6&#8208;hexanediol diacrylate) is introduced into the perovskite film to form a polymer through in situ thermal crosslinking, of which the carbonyl group anchors the uncoordinated Pb2+ of perovskite and reduces the leakage of lead, along with the &#8722;CF2&#8722; hydrophobic group protecting the Pb2+ from water invasion. Additionally, the polymer passivates varieties of Pb&#8208;related and I&#8208;related defects through coordination and hydrogen bonding interactions, regulating the crystallization of perovskite film with reduced trap density, releasing lattice strain, and promoting carrier transport and extraction. The optimal efficiencies of polymer&#8208;incorporated devices are 24.76&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 20.66&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm2). More importantly, the storage stability, thermal stability, and operational stability have been significantly improved.

         <title>Highly Twisted Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Molecules and Their Applications in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes (OLEDs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly twisted thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge&#8208;transfer characters and form rigid molecular structures. This Review discusses and summarizes recent research progress in this domain, mainly covering the molecular design strategies and photophysical properties of twisted molecules, as well as the performance parameters of related OLED devices.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have attracted great potential in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Among thousands of TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters have become a hotspot in recent years. Compared with traditional TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge&#8208;transfer characters and form rigid molecular structures. This is advantageous for TADF materials, as non&#8208;radiative decay processes can be suppressed to facilitate efficient exciton utilization. Accordingly, OLEDs with excellent device performances have also been reported. In this Review, we have summarized recent progress in highly twisted TADF materials and related devices, and give an overview of the molecular design strategies, photophysical studies, and the performances of OLED devices. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of highly twisted TADF molecules and the related OLEDs are also discussed.

         <title>Programmed Pore&#8208;Shape Fixing in a Soft Porous Molecular Crystal&#8212;Navigating the Phase Interconversion Landscape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;known organic soft porous crystal is shown to undergo pore&#8208;shape fixing in response to high&#8208;pressure uptake of CO2 gas. Despite two decades of studies of this material, this work formulates, for the first time, an unambiguous phase interconversion Scheme to facilitate navigation of the metastable phase landscape, which now includes a 4th guest&#8208;free polymorph with enhanced porosity.







Abstract
Pore&#8208;shape fixing effects (PSFEs) in soft porous crystals are a relatively unexplored area of materials chemistry. We report the PSFE in the prototypical dynamic van der Waals solid p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene (TBC4). Starting with the high&#8208;density guest&#8208;free phase, two porous shape&#8208;fixed phases were programmed using the stimuli of CO2 pressure and temperature. A suite of complementary in situ techniques, including variable&#8208;pressure (VP) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, VP powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, VP differential scanning calorimetry, volumetric sorption analysis, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy was used to track dynamic guest&#8208;induced transformations, providing molecular&#8208;level insight into the PSFE. The interconversion between the two metastable phases is particle size dependent, making this the second example of the PSFE by crystal downsizing, and the first example involving a porous molecular crystal: larger particles undergo reversible transitions while smaller particles remain fixed in the metastable phase. A complete phase interconversion scheme was constructed for the material, thus allowing navigation of the phase interconversion landscape of TBC4 using the easily applied stimuli of CO2 pressure and thermal treatment.

         <title>A Pro&#8208;Fluorescent Ubiquitin&#8208;Based Probe to Monitor Cysteine&#8208;Based E3 Ligase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is an increased interest in E3 ligases as drug targets. Here we present UbSRhodol, an autoimmolative Ub&#8208;based probe which upon E3 processing liberates the pro&#8208;fluorescent dye Rhodol triggering a strong fluorescence signal. Our platform allows detection of changes in E3 transthiolation activity in real time for recombinant and in cell&#8208;extract ligases, as well as the discovery of new ligands for E3 ligases.







Abstract
Protein post&#8208;translational modification with ubiquitin (Ub) is a versatile signal regulating almost all aspects of cell biology, and an increasing range of diseases is associated with impaired Ub modification. In this light, the Ub system offers an attractive, yet underexplored route to the development of novel targeted treatments. A promising strategy for small molecule intervention is posed by the final components of the enzymatic ubiquitination cascade, E3 ligases, as they determine the specificity of the protein ubiquitination pathway. Here, we present UbSRhodol, an autoimmolative Ub&#8208;based probe, which upon E3 processing liberates the pro&#8208;fluorescent dye, amenable to profile the E3 transthiolation activity for recombinant and in cell&#8208;extract E3 ligases. UbSRhodol enabled detection of changes in transthiolation efficacy evoked by enzyme key point mutations or conformational changes, and offers an excellent assay reagent amenable to a high&#8208;throughput screening setup allowing the identification of small molecules modulating E3 activity.

         <title>Noncovalent Modulation of Chemoselectivity in the Gas Phase Leads to a Switchover in Reaction Type from Heterolytic to Homolytic to Electrocyclic Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversity in chemical reactivity unfolds even in the gas phase when noncovalent tools such as macrocyclic encapsulation are being used. Two distinct reaction pathways of a&#160;multifunctional bicyclic&#160;azoalkane (bottom) can be chemoselectively activated inside the cavity of a macrocycle (in gold), leading either to ejection of molecular dinitrogen (top) or ethylene (right),&#160;depending on its protonation state. In sharp contrast, the free substrate prefers to eject ammonia upon thermal activation (left), as reported by Werner&#8197;M. Nau, Elina Kalenius, Tung&#8208;Chun Lee et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202303491).

         <title>Variations in Intracellular Organometallic Reaction Frequency Captured by Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify ruthenium&#8208;promoted allylcarbamate cleavage reactions in live A549 human lung cells. Individual turn&#8208;on events were detected as single fluorescence spots and found to occur more frequently in the mitochondria than the rest of the cell. These results suggest that the subcellular distribution is an important consideration in designing intracellular catalysts.







Abstract
Studies of organometallic reactions in living cells commonly rely on ensemble&#8208;averaged measurements, which can obscure the detection of reaction dynamics or location&#8208;specific behavior. This information is necessary to guide the design of bioorthogonal catalysts with improved biocompatibility, activity, and selectivity. By leveraging the high spatial and temporal resolution of single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy, we have successfully captured single&#8208;molecule events promoted by Ru complexes inside live A549 human lung cells. By observing individual allylcarbamate cleavage reactions in real&#8208;time, our results revealed that they occur with greater frequency inside the mitochondria than in the non&#8208;mitochondria regions. The estimated turnover frequency of the Ru complexes was at least 3&#8208;fold higher in the former than the latter. These results suggest that organelle specificity is a critical factor to consider in intracellular catalyst design, such as in developing metallodrugs for therapeutic applications.

         <title>Elongated Bacterial Pili as a Versatile Alignment Medium for NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for the measurement of residual dipolar couplings by NMR spectroscopy is presented. The medium is based on filamentous type 1 pili from E. coli and shown to withstand a wide range of challenging experimental conditions. Being compatible with biological macromolecules and small molecules alike, its high versatility suggests broad applicability in molecular structure determination by NMR.







Abstract
In NMR spectroscopy, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) have emerged as one of the most exquisite probes of biological structure and dynamics. The measurement of RDCs relies on the partial alignment of the molecule of interest, for example by using a liquid crystal as a solvent. Here, we establish bacterial type 1 pili as an alternative liquid&#8208;crystalline alignment medium for the measurement of RDCs. To achieve alignment at pilus concentrations that allow for efficient NMR sample preparation, we elongated wild&#8208;type pili by recombinant overproduction of the main structural pilus subunit. Building on the extraordinary stability of type 1 pili against spontaneous dissociation and unfolding, we show that the medium is compatible with challenging experimental conditions such as high temperature, the presence of detergents, organic solvents or very acidic pH, setting it apart from most established alignment media. Using human ubiquitin, HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA and camphor as spectroscopic probes, we demonstrate the applicability of the medium for the determination of RDCs of proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. Our results show that type 1 pili represent a very useful alternative to existing alignment media and may readily assist the characterization of molecular structure and dynamics by NMR.

&lt;p&gt;A new, liquid-crystalline alignment medium for the measurement of residual dipolar couplings by NMR spectroscopy is presented. The medium is based on filamentous type 1 pili from &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and shown to withstand a wide range of challenging experimental conditions. Being compatible with biological macromolecules and small molecules alike, its high versatility suggests broad applicability in molecular structure determination by NMR.

         <title>Harmonious Heterointerfaces Formed on 2D&#8208;Pt Nanodendrites by Facet&#8208;Respective Stepwise Metal Deposition for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;Metal Nanohybrids with harmonious heterointerfaces have been synthesized by facet&#8208;respective stepwise metal deposition. These hybrid nanomaterial can approach superior electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance induced by unique multi heterointerfaces in specific facet for effective activation of platinum.







Abstract
The performance of nanocrystal (NC) catalysts could be maximized by introducing rationally designed heterointerfaces formed by the facet&#8208; and spatio&#8208;specific modification with other materials of desired size and thickness. However, such heterointerfaces are limited in scope and synthetically challenging. Herein, we applied a wet chemistry method to tunably deposit Pd and Ni on the available surfaces of porous 2D&#8722;Pt nanodendrites (NDs). Using 2D silica nanoreactors to house the 2D&#8208;PtND, an 0.5&#8208;nm&#8208;thick epitaxial Pd or Ni layer (e&#8208;Pd or e&#8208;Ni) was exclusively formed on the flat {110} surface of 2D&#8722;Pt, while a non&#8208;epitaxial Pd or Ni layer (n&#8208;Pd or n&#8208;Ni) was typically deposited at the {111/100} edge in absence of nanoreactor. Notably, these differently located Pd/Pt and Ni/Pt heterointerfaces experienced distinct electronic effect to influence unequally in electrocatalytic synergy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For instance, an enhanced H2 generation on the Pt{110} facet with 2D&#8208;2D interfaced e&#8208;Pd deposition and faster water dissociation on the edge&#8208;located n&#8208;Ni overpowered their facet&#8208;located counterparts in respective HER catalysis. Therefore, a feasible assembling of the valuable heterointerfaces in the optimal 2D n&#8208;Ni/e&#8208;Pd/Pt catalyst overcame the sluggish alkaline HER kinetics, with a catalytic activity 7.9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C.

         <title>Bright Free&#8208;Radical Emission in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole ionic liquids have been used to protect photoinduced radical emissions from carbonyl through electrostatic interactions and spin delocalization effects, with a highest emission efficiency of 53.3&#8201;% achieved. The radical system could be used to build multi&#8208;color and heat&#8208;responsive luminescence materials. They could also be used to detect different amine compounds based on the change in the emission and photoactivation times.







Abstract
It is challenging to achieve stable and efficient radical emissions under ambient conditions. Herein, we present a rational design strategy to protect photoinduced carbonyl free radical emission through electrostatic interaction and spin delocalization effects. The host&#8208;guest system is constructed from tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzene molecules and a series of imidazolium ionic liquids as the guest and host, respectively, whereby the carbonyl anion radical emission can be in situ generated under the light irradiation and further stabilized by electrostatic interaction. More importantly, the anion species and the alkyl chain length of imidazolium ionic liquids show a noticeable effect on luminescence efficiency, with the highest radical emission efficiency is as high as 53.3&#8201;% after optimizing the imidazole ionic liquid's structure, which is about four times higher than the polymer&#8208;protected radical system. Theoretical calculations confirm the synergistic effect of strong electrostatic interactions and that the spin delocalization effect significantly stabilizes the radical emission. Moreover, such a radical emission system also could be integrated with a fluorescent dye to induce multi&#8208;color or even white light emission with reversible temperature&#8208;responsive characteristics. The radical emission system can also be used to detect different amine compounds on the basis of the emission changes and photoactivation time.

         <title>Trinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inert alkyl bromides are rarely used in photoinduced 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes due to their strong reduction potential and bond dissociation energy. In their Research Article (e202305121), Jin Xie and co&#8208;workers overcome the inherent redox potential limit of alkyl bromides and achieve 1,2&#8208;aminoalkylation and 1,2&#8208;alkylarylation of different alkenes by using the inner single electron transfer mechanism of an excited trinuclear gold catalyst.

         <title>Surface Adsorbed Hydroxyl: A Double&#8208;Edged Sword in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction over Oxide&#8208;Derived Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) featured with surface located sub&#8208;20&#8197;nm nanoparticles developed for electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR), surface adsorbed hydroxyls (OHad) are demonstrated to act as a double&#8208;edged sword for selective C2 production. OHad with adsorption well optimized and steered would contribute to the stable C2 production with high selectivity over OD&#8722;Cu for long&#8208;term ECO2RR.







Abstract
Oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) featured with surface located sub&#8208;20&#8197;nm nanoparticles (NPs) created via surface structure reconstruction was developed for electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR). With surface adsorbed hydroxyls (OHad) identified during ECO2RR, it is realized that OHad, sterically confined and adsorbed at OD&#8722;Cu by surface located sub&#8208;20&#8197;nm NPs, should be determinative to the multi&#8208;carbon (C2) product selectivity. In situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that OHad favors the adsorption of low&#8208;frequency *CO with weak C&#8801;O bonds and strengthens the *CO binding at OD&#8722;Cu surface, promoting *CO dimerization and then selective C2 production. However, excessive OHad would inhibit selective C2 production by occupying active sites and facilitating competitive H2 evolution. In a flow cell, stable C2 production with high selectivity of &#8764;60&#8201;% at &#8722;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 could be achieved over OD&#8722;Cu, with adsorption of OHad well steered in the fast flowing electrolyte.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Gated and Self&#8208;Protected Bioorthogonal Catalyst for Nanozyme&#8208;Assisted Safe Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

We described a self&#8208;protected and responsive bioorthogonal catalyst to achieve efficient and precise intracellular drug synthesis for safe cancer combination therapy. This appealing strategy will promote the development of bioorthogonal catalyst&#8208;mediated novel antineoplastic platforms.







Abstract
Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal uncaging catalysis has sparked increasing interest in prodrug activation. However, due to their &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; catalytic activity as well as the complex and catalytic&#8208;detrimental intracellular environment, the biosafety and therapeutic efficiency of TMCs are unsatisfactory. Herein, a DNA&#8208;gated and self&#8208;protected bioorthogonal catalyst has been designed by modifying nanozyme&#8208;Pd0 with highly programmable nucleic acid (DNA) molecules to achieve efficient intracellular drug synthesis for cancer therapy. Monolayer DNA molecules could endow the catalyst with targeting and perform as a gatekeeper to achieve selective prodrug activation within cancer cells. Meanwhile, the prepared graphitic nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanozyme with glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activities could improve the catalytic&#8208;detrimental intracellular environment to prevent the catalyst from being inactivated and sensitize the subsequent chemotherapy. Overall, we believe that our work will promote the development of secure and efficient bioorthogonal catalytic systems and provide new insights into novel antineoplastic platforms.

         <title>High Performance Dynamic X&#8208;ray Flexible Imaging Realized Using a Copper Iodide Cluster&#8208;Based MOF Microcrystal Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray imaging technology has achieved important applications in many fields and has attracted extensive attentions. Dynamic X&#8208;ray flexible imaging for the real&#8208;time observation of the internal structure of complex materials is the most challenging type of X&#8208;ray imaging technology, which requires high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators with high X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) efficiency as well as excellent processibility and stability. Here, a macrocyclic bridging ligand with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature was introduced for constructing a copper iodide cluster&#8208;based MOF scintillator. This strategy endows the scintillator with high XEL efficiency and excellent chemical stability. Moreover, a regular rod&#8208;like microcrystal was prepared through the addition of polyvinyl pyrrolidone during the in&#8208;situ synthesis process, which further enhanced the XEL and processibility of the scintillator. The microcrystal was used for the preparation of a scintillator screen with excellent flexibility and stability, which can be used for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray imaging in extremely humid environments. Furthermore, dynamic X&#8208;ray flexible imaging was realized for the first time. The internal structure of flexible objects was observed in real time with an ultrahigh resolution of 20 LP mm&#8722;1</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Thermal and Chemical Stability of Oxynitride Phosphor from Facile Chemical Synthesis for Cornering Lights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Orange Eu2+&#8208;doped phosphors are essential for light&#8208;emitting diodes for cornering lights to prevent fatal road accidents at night, but such phosphors require features of high thermal, chemical stability and facile synthesis. This study reports a series of yellow&#8208;orange&#8208;red emitting SrAl2Si3ON6:Eu2+ oxynitride phosphors, derived from the SrAlSi4N7 nitride iso&#8208;structure by replacing Si4+&#8208;N3&#8208; with Al3+&#8208;O2&#8208;. The introduction of a certain amount of oxygen enabled the facile synthesis under atmospheric pressure using the air&#8208;stable raw materials SrCO3, Eu2O3, AlN and Si3N4. SrAl2Si3ON6 has a smaller band gap and lower structure rigidity than SrAlSi4N7 (5.19 eV vs 5.50 eV, Debye temperature 719 K vs 760 K), but exhibits higher thermal stability with 100% of room temperature intensity remaining at 150 &#176;C compared to 85% for SrAlSi4N7. Electron paramagnetic resonance, thermoluminescence and density functional theory revealed that the oxygen vacancy electron traps compensated the thermal loss. Additionally, no decrease in emission intensity was found after either being heated at 500 &#176;C for 2 hours or being immersed in water for 20 days, implying both of the thermal and chemical stability of SrAl2Si3ON6:Eu2+ phosphors. The strategy of oxynitride&#8208;introduction from nitride promotes the development of low&#8208;cost thermally and chemically stable luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent Effect to Fine&#8208;Tune Energy Levels of Atom&#8208;Precise [MoOS3]2&#8208; Modified Cu(I) Thiolate Clusters Boosting Recyclable Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The propulsion of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production is limited by the rational design and regulation of catalysts with precise structures and excellent activities. In this work, the [MoOS3]2&#8208; unit is introduced into the Cu(I) clusters to form a series of atomically&#8208;precise Mo(VI)&#8208;Cu(I) bimetallic clusters of [Cu6(MoOS3)2(C6H5(CH2)S)2(P(C6H4&#8208;R)3)4]&#183;xCH3CN (R = H, CH3, or F), which show high photocatalytic H2 evolution activities and excellent stability. By electron push&#8208;pull effects of the surface ligand, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of these Mo(VI)&#8208;Cu(I) clusters can be finely tuned, promoting the resultant visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution performance. Furthermore, Mo(VI)&#8208;Cu(I) clusters loaded onto the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 carriers significantly reduced the loss of catalysts in the collection process, efficiently addressing the recycling issues of such small cluster&#8208;based catalyst. This work not only highlights a competitively universal approach on the design of high&#8208;efficiency cluster photocatalysts for energy conversion, but also makes it feasible to manipulate the catalytic performance of clusters through a rational substituent strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Driven Assembly of a Penta&#8208;Shell Keplerate Cuprofullerene for Metallofullerene Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two metallofullerene frameworks (MFFs) constructed from a penta&#8208;shell Keplerate cuprofullerene chloride, C60@Cu24@Cl44@Cu12@Cl12, have been successfully prepared via a C60&#8208;templated symmetry&#8208;driven strategy. The icosahedral cuprofullerene chloride is assembled on a C60 molecule through [&#951;2&#8208;(C=C)]&#8208;Cu(I) and Cu(I)&#8208;Cl coordination bonds, resulting in the penta&#8208;shell Keplerate with the C60 core canopied by 24 Cu, 44 Cl, 12 Cu and 12 Cl atoms that fulfill the tic@rco@oae@ico@ico penta&#8208;shell polyhedral configuration. By sharing the outmost&#8208;shell Cl atoms, the cuprofullerene chlorides are connected into 2D or 3D (snf net) frameworks. TD&#8208;DFT calculations reveal that the charge transfer from the outmost Cu(I) and Cl to C60 core is responsible for their light absorption expansion to near&#8208;infrared region, implying anionic halogenation may be an effective strategy to tune the light absorption properties of metallofullerene materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical LTL Zeolite as an Efficient and Sustainable Solid Acid Catalyst for Replacing HCl in the Production of Polyurethane Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In many industrially important reactions, caustic mineral acid catalysts have been successfully replaced with green solid acids such as zeolites. In this context, extensive efforts have been devoted to replacing HCl to produce methylenedianiline (MDA), a key intermediate in polyurethane production. Unfortunately, limited success has been achieved thus far due to low activity, selectivity towards the desired 4,4'&#8208;MDA, and rapid catalyst deactivation. Here we report that meso&#8208;/microporous hierarchical LTL zeolite exhibits unprecedentedly high activity, selectivity, and stability. The one&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;like micropores of LTL promote the bimolecular reaction between two para&#8208;aminobenzylaniline intermediates to selectively produce 4,4'&#8208;MDA and inhibit the formation of undesired isomers and heavy oligomers. Meanwhile, the secondary mesopores alleviate mass transfer limitations, resulting in a 7.8&#8208;fold higher MDA formation rate compared to solely microporous LTL zeolite. Due to suppressed oligomer formation and fast mass transfer, the catalyst exhibits inappreciable deactivation in an industrially relevant continuous flow reactor.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Random Island Nucleation in the Electrochemical Roughening on Pt(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical roughening of platinum upon oxidation&#8208;reduction cycles, leads to nano&#8208;island growth that surprisingly show an almost perfect hexagonal arrangement. The non&#8208;random nucleation of these islands is due to special, preferential nuclei sites that a priori do not exist. Precursors of the oxidation, given by the so&#8208;called place&#8208;exchange atoms, form a network of triangles or disordered spoke wheels, in which the nucleation takes place.







Abstract
Many chemical surface systems develop ordered nano&#8208;islands during repeated reaction and restoration. Platinum is used in electrochemical energy applications, like fuel cells and electrolysers, although it is scarce, expensive, and degrades. During oxidation&#8208;reduction cycles, simulating device operation, nucleation and growth of nano&#8208;islands occurs that eventually enhances the dissolution. Preventing nucleation would be the most effective solution. However, little is known about the atomic details of the nucleation; a process almost impossible to observe. Here, we analyze the nuclei&#8208;distance distribution mapping out the underlying atomic mechanism: a rarely observed, non&#8208;random nucleation takes place. Special, preferential nucleation sites that a priori do not exist, develop initially via a precursor and eventually form a semi&#8208;ordered Pt&#8208;oxide structure. This precursor mechanism seems to be general, possibly explaining also the nano&#8208;island formation on other surfaces/reactions.

         <title>Understanding Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction on PdNiRuIrRh High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy by Machine Learning Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating machine learning&#8208;based Monte Carlo simulation with ab initio calculation, the complex atomic structure of a high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA&#8208;PdNiRuIrRh) was comprehensively uncovered. The origin of the superior electrocatalytic performance for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction was fundamentally understood.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts have been widely studied in electrocatalysis. However, identifying atomic structure of HEA with complex atomic arrangement is challenging, which seriously hinders the fundamental understanding of catalytic mechanism. Here, we report a HEA&#8208;PdNiRuIrRh catalyst with remarkable mass activity of 3.25&#8197;mA&#8201;&#956;g&#8722;1 for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), which is 8&#8208;fold enhancement compared to that of commercial Pt/C. Through machine learning potential&#8208;based Monte Carlo simulation, we reveal that the dominant Pd&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ni/Pd&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pd bonding environments and Ni/Ru oxophilic sites on HEA surface are beneficial to the optimized adsorption/desorption of *H and enhanced *OH adsorption, contributing to the excellent HOR activity and stability. This work provides significant insights into atomic structure and catalytic mechanism for HEA and offers novel prospects for developing advanced HOR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Aerobic&#8208;Hydrophobic Janus Interface on Partially Carbonized Iron Heterostructure Promotes Bifunctional Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerobic&#8208;hydrophobic Janus interface is constructed by introducing fluorinated modification on porous carbon nanofibers embedded with partially carbonized iron heterojunctions (Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F). The Janus structure can keep the internal Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F away from water infiltration and endows a N2 molecule&#8208;concentrating effect, resulting in the formation of a robust &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;gas&#8221; state micro&#8208;domain at the catalyst surface. Such microdomains can suppress competing water splitting reactions and enhance nitrogen fixation.







Abstract
Competition from hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions and low solubility of N2 in aqueous systems limited the selectivity and activity on nitrogen fixation reaction. Herein, we design an aerobic&#8208;hydrophobic Janus structure by introducing fluorinated modification on porous carbon nanofibers embedded with partially carbonized iron heterojunctions (Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F). The simulations prove that the Janus structure can keep the internal Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F away from water infiltration and endow a N2 molecular&#8208;concentrating effect, suppressing the competing reactions and overcoming the mass&#8208;transfer limitations to build a robust &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;gas&#8221; state micro&#8208;domain around the catalyst surface. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system, the Fe3C/Fe@PCNF&#8208;F exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for nitrogen fixation (NH3 yield rate up to 29.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and Faraday efficiency (FE) up to 27.8&#8201;% in nitrogen reduction reaction; NO3&#8722; yield rate up to 15.7&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and FE up to 3.4&#8201;% in nitrogen oxidation reaction).

         <title>Enhanced Carrier Diffusion Enables Efficient Back&#8208;Contact Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced charge carrier diffusion in perovskite thin films is demonstrated to significantly improve the efficiency of back&#8208;contact perovskite photovoltaics. The addition of guanidine thiocyanate induces a preferred out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation of the perovskite films which exhibit increased carrier diffusion lengths exceeding 7.5&#8197;&#956;m. Back&#8208;contact devices using such films display improved efficiencies reaching 11.2&#8201;%, a 3&#8208;fold increase in performance.







Abstract
Back&#8208;contact architectures offer a promising route to improve the record efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by eliminating parasitic light absorption. However, the performance of back&#8208;contact PSCs is limited by inadequate carrier diffusion in perovskite. Here, we report that perovskite films with a preferred out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation show improved carrier dynamic properties. With the addition of guanidine thiocyanate, the films exhibit carrier lifetimes and mobilities increased by 3&#8211;5&#8197;times, leading to diffusion lengths exceeding 7&#8197;&#956;m. The enhanced carrier diffusion results from substantial suppression of nonradiative recombination and improves charge collection. Devices using such films achieve reproducible efficiencies reaching 11.2&#8201;%, among the best performances for back&#8208;contact PSCs. Our findings demonstrate the impact of carrier dynamics on back&#8208;contact PSCs and provide the basis for a new route to high&#8208;performance back&#8208;contact perovskite optoelectronic devices at low cost.

         <title>Peptide Cyclization by the Use of Acylammonium Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional approach to peptide cyclization involving the use of acyl ammonium species was developed. Rapid and epimerization/dimerization&#8208;free cyclization of synthetically challenging peptides was possible, including a difficult cyclization reaction involving N&#8208;methyl amide bond formation. The approach is characterized by ease of purification of the products, high productivity, and high reaction mass efficiencies.







Abstract
Although cyclic peptides have become increasingly important as drugs, the most conventional peptide cyclization method using moderately active coupling agents suffers from a lot of waste and high cost as well as long reaction times and burdensome purification. Herein, we report an unconventional approach to peptide cyclization that uses acylammonium species generated from inexpensive and less wasteful Me2NBn and ClCO2i&#8208;Pr. Using this approach, we observed the desired rapid activation of the C&#8208;terminus of cyclization precursors by an acylammonium ion for rapid and epimerization/dimerization&#8208;free cyclization of synthetically challenging peptides, including a difficult cyclization involving N&#8208;methyl amide bond formation. The ease of purification, productivities, and reaction mass efficiencies of our approach were significantly superior to those in previous reports. We synthesized a previously reported versicotide D analogue, and our data indicated that its assigned stereostructure should be revised.

     alt="Peptide Cyclization by the Use of Acylammonium Species"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unconventional approach to peptide cyclization involving the use of acyl ammonium species was developed. Rapid and epimerization/dimerization-free cyclization of synthetically challenging peptides was possible, including a difficult cyclization reaction involving &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl amide bond formation. The approach is characterized by ease of purification of the products, high productivity, and high reaction mass efficiencies.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis&#8212;Controlling the Competition between Monomeric versus Dimeric Reaction Pathways Enhances Stereoselectivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even sterically demanding chiral phosphoric acids can form highly active catalyst dimers with stereoselectivities inverse to monomers. The two pathways are separable by adjusting temperature and catalyst loading. Significantly enhanced ee values up to 99&#8201;% result from the monomeric and complete inversion up to &#8722;98&#8201;% from the dimeric pathway.







Abstract
Chiral phosphoric acids (CPA) have become a privileged catalyst type in organocatalysis, but the selection of the optimum catalyst is still challenging. So far hidden competing reaction pathways may limit the maximum stereoselectivities and the potential of prediction models. In CPA&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of imines, we identified for many systems two reaction pathways with inverse stereoselectivity, featuring as active catalyst either one CPA or a hydrogen bond bridged dimer. NMR measurements and DFT calculations revealed the dimeric intermediate and a stronger substrate activation via cooperativity. Both pathways are separable: Low temperatures and high catalysts loadings favor the dimeric pathway (ee up to &#8722;98&#8201;%), while low temperatures with reduced catalyst loading favor the monomeric pathway and give significantly enhanced ee (92&#8211;99&#8201;% ee; prior 68&#8211;86&#8201;% at higher temperatures). Thus, a broad impact is expected on CPA catalysis regarding reaction optimization and prediction.

         <title>A Sustainable Wood&#8208;Based Iron Photocatalyst for Multiple Uses with Sunlight: Water Treatment and Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst was made from demethylated lignin as sustainable source and Fe3O4. It can be used in environmental sciences to clean wastewater and in material sciences as a radical photoinitiator, resulting in crosslinking of vinyl monomers by radical photopolymerization. Films obtained showed good water repelling and no tackiness even in an aerobic surrounding.







Abstract
A sustainable photocatalyst for use with multiple purpose comprising demethylated lignin (Fe3O4@D&#8208;wood) was made by treatment of wood and iron oxide. Characterization followed by XRD, UV/Vis, photo&#8208;current studies, and electrochemical measurements. This material became subject of photocatalytic explorations for water treatment and material synthesis by radical photopolymerization. Exposure of Fe3O4@D&#8208;wood with artificial sunlight showed an improved activity considering photochemical oxidation of organic pollutants in the presence of H2O2. The efficient generation of reactive radicals brought this system also to photopolymerization. Here, radicals based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the catalytic cycle can be seen as the dominating species to initiate radical polymerization. A mixture of UDMA and TPGDA showed good reactivity with cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Photocatalyst used for water treatment facilitates reuse for photopolymerization.

         <title>Controlling the Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Overlayer Structure in Pt/TiO2 Catalysts Prevents Particle Evaporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study expands the concept of the condition&#8208;dependence of overlayers induced by strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) in Pt/TiO2 catalysts. TiOX overlayers are studied with in situ TEM, and it is found that the overlayers are stable at high temperatures in oxygen and therefore can protect the platinum nanoparticles from evaporation.







Abstract
Platinum nanoparticles (NPs) supported by titania exhibit a strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI)[1] that can induce overlayer formation and encapsulation of the NP's with a thin layer of support material. This encapsulation modifies the catalyst's properties, such as increasing its chemoselectivity[2] and stabilizing it against sintering.[3] Encapsulation is typically induced during high&#8208;temperature reductive activation and can be reversed through oxidative treatments.[1] However, recent findings indicate that the overlayer can be stable in oxygen.[4,&#8201;5] Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we investigated how the overlayer changes with varying conditions. We found that exposure to oxygen below 400&#8201;&#176;C caused disorder and removal of the overlayer upon subsequent hydrogen treatment. In contrast, elevating the temperature to 900&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining the oxygen atmosphere preserved the overlayer, preventing platinum evaporation when exposed to oxygen. Our findings demonstrate how different treatments can influence the stability of nanoparticles with or without titania overlayers. expanding the concept of SMSI and enabling noble metal catalysts to operate in harsh environments without evaporation associated losses during burn&#8208;off cycling.

         <title>The Sonogashira Coupling on Palladium Milling Balls&#8212;A new Reaction Pathway in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Sonogashira coupling was conducted in a ball mill using a catalytically active milling ball and three additives in low quantities to achieve quantitative yields within 90&#8197;minutes. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic, diffractive, as well as in situ methods led to the discovery of a formed complex of the co&#8208;catalyst copper, which differs from liquid phase Sonogashira coupling.







Abstract
Utilizing direct mechanocatalytical conditions, the Sonogashira coupling was successfully performed on the surface of milling tools by using pure Pd and Pd coated steel balls. The optimization of co&#8208;catalyst forming additives led to a protocol, which generates quantitative yields under aerobic conditions for various substrates within as little as 90&#8197;minutes. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic, diffractive, as well as in situ methods lead to the identification of a previously unknown and highly reactive complex of the co&#8208;catalyst copper. This new complex differs substantially from the known complexes in liquid phase Sonogashira couplings, proving that reaction pathways in mechanochemistry may differ from those in established synthetic procedures.

         <title>Aqueous Processable Two&#8208;Dimensional Triazine Polymers with Superior Photocatalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and general noncovalent functionalization strategy is developed to prepare aqueous processable high&#8208;quality semiconducting 2D triazine polymers on a large scale. The crystalline ultrathin 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can be easily processed into ultralight and mechanically strong aerogels and also exhibit superior photocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).







Abstract
Efficient and scalable production of high&#8208;quality and processable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers are highly desired but have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrate a convenient noncovalent functionalization strategy for producing highly uniform, aqueous processable and semiconducting 2D triazine polymers. Experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that the aromatic amphiphilic 1&#8208;pyrenebutyrate can adsorb and intercalate into the interlayer of bulk crystalline covalent triazine framework (CTF) through noncovalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between the pyrene moiety and the porous basal plane of 2D triazine polymer layer, which greatly facilitate the exfoliation of CTF in water in large scale. The as&#8208;prepared highly water&#8208;dispersible single&#8208;layer/few&#8208;layer 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can be easily processed into ultralight aerogels with a density of 5&#8211;15&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3, which can be further shaped into mechanically strong films upon simple compression. This noncovalent functionalization not only improve the dispersibility and processability of 2D triazine polymer, but also optimize its band structure and promote the photogenerated carrier separation via an interesting surface molecule doping effect, thus resulting in a remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 1249&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 (24980&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and apparent quantum efficiency up to 27.2&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm for the 2D triazine polymer, outperforming most metal&#8208;free photocatalysts ever reported.

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Assembly of Metallacages and Their Supramolecular Catalysis Behaviors in Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of well&#8208;defined metallacages in microdroplets was achieved through a continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic approach. The high efficiency and diversity of this strategy were illustrated by the generation of five representative metallacages with nearly quantitative yields in a few minutes. This approach is promising for the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular systems in a confined space.







Abstract
Developing a new strategy to improve the self&#8208;assembly efficiency of functional assemblies in a confined space and construct hybrid functional materials is a significant and fascinating endeavor. Herein, we present a highly efficient strategy for achieving the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of well&#8208;defined metallacages in microdroplets through continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic devices. The high efficiency and versatility of this approach are demonstrated by the generation of five representative metallacages in different solvents containing water, DMF, acetonitrile, and methanol in a few minutes with nearly quantitative yields, in contrast to the yields obtained with the hour&#8208;scale reaction time in a batch reactor. A ring&#8208;opening catalytic reaction of the metallacages was selected as a model reaction for exploring supramolecular catalysis in microdroplets, whereby the catalytic yield was enhanced by 2.22&#8208;fold compared to that of the same reaction in the batch reactor. This work illustrates a new promising approach for the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular systems.

         <title>A Widespread Glycosidase Confers Lobophorin Resistance and Host&#8208;Dependent Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural diversification of lobophorins (LOBs) in S.&#8197;coelicolor M1154/pCSG5560 through glycosylation, deglycosylation and reglycosylation was unexpectedly found to be correlated with cross&#8208;talk between the endogenous glycosidase KijX and the products encoded by the exogenous lob BGC. KijX homologues are widespread among bacteria, archaea and fungi, and encode the same glycohydrolytic activity on LOBs as a resistance mechanism to detoxify LOBs.







Abstract
Identifying new environmental resistance determinants is significant to combat rising antibiotic resistance. Herein we report the unexpected correlation of a lobophorin (LOB) resistance&#8208;related glycosidase KijX with the host&#8208;dependent chemical diversity of LOBs, by a process of glycosylation, deglycosylation and reglycosylation. KijX homologues are widespread among bacteria, archaea and fungi, and encode the same glycohydrolytic activity on LOBs. The crystal structure of AcvX (a KijX homologue) shows a similar fold to that of the glycoside hydrolase family 113 and a special negatively charged groove to accommodate and deglycosylate LOBs. Antagonistic assays indicate kijX as a defense weapon of actinomycetes to combat LOB producers in environment, reflecting an elegant coevolution relationship. Our study provides insight into the KijX&#8208;related glycosidases as preexisting resistance determinants and represents an example of resistance genes accidentally integrated into natural product assembly.

         <title>Insight into Iron Leaching from an Ascorbate&#8208;Oxidase&#8208;like Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Nanozyme and Oxygen Reduction Selectivity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe leaching from an Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom nanozyme mimicking ascorbate (H2A) oxidase was observed in mild biological media. Besides Fe&#8208;Nx sites for well&#8208;known 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction (ORR) via bound iron&#8208;oxo species, 40&#8201;% of &#8220;silent&#8221; N&#8722;C sites on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C were activated for 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR via free O2.&#8722; by H2A oxidation, providing a new ORR pathway to regulate the distinct anti&#8208; and pro&#8208;oxidant functions of ascorbate oxidation for various biomedical applications.







Abstract
Ascorbate (H2A) is a well&#8208;known antioxidant to protect cellular components from free radical damage and has also emerged as a pro&#8208;oxidant in cancer therapies. However, such &#8220;contradictory&#8221; mechanisms underlying H2A oxidation are not well understood. Herein, we report Fe leaching during catalytic H2A oxidation using an Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C nanozyme as a ferritin mimic and its influence on the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the heterogeneity, the Fe&#8208;Nx sites in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C primarily catalyzed H2A oxidation and 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR via an iron&#8208;oxo intermediate. Nonetheless, trace O2&#8901;&#8722; produced by marginal N&#8722;C sites through 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR accumulated and attacked Fe&#8208;Nx sites, leading to the linear leakage of unstable Fe ions up to 420&#8197;ppb when the H2A concentration increased to 2&#8197;mM. As a result, a substantial fraction (ca. 40&#8201;%) of the N&#8722;C sites on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C were activated, and a new 2+2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR path was finally enabled, along with Fenton&#8208;type H2A oxidation. Consequently, after Fe ions diffused into the bulk solution, the ORR at the N&#8722;C sites stopped at H2O2 production, which was the origin of the pro&#8208;oxidant effect of H2A.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled L&#8211;DNA Linkers for Rapid Construction of Multi&#8208;Specific Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates Library</title>

A modular platform is reported for rapid construction of multi&#8208;specific Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates (ADCs). The MADC platform offers the combinatorial flexibility to screen for optimal target and payload combinations, while having the potential of becoming viable therapeutic agents themselves.







Abstract
One of the key challenges of improving clinical outcomes of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) is overcoming cancer resistance to the antibody and/or drug components of ADCs, and hence the need for ADC platforms with high combinatory flexibility. Here, we introduce the use of self&#8208;assembled left&#8208;handed DNA (L&#8211;DNA) oligonucleotides to link combinatory single&#8208;domain antibodies and toxin payloads for tunable and adaptive delivery of ADCs. We demonstrate that the method allows convenient construction of a library of ADCs with multi&#8208;specific targeting, multi&#8208;specific payloads, and exact drug&#8208;antibody ratio. The newly constructed ADCs with L&#8211;DNA scaffold showed favorable properties of in vitro cell cytotoxicity and in vivo suppression and eradication of solid tumors. Collectively, our data suggest that the L&#8211;DNA based modular ADC (MADC) platform is a viable option for generating therapeutic ADCs and for potentially expanding ADC therapeutic window via multi&#8208;specificity.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl halides with sulfoximines (as ammonia surrogates) was realized by employing a chiral anionic N,N,N&#8208;ligand with a long spreading side arm under mild conditions. An array of valuable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids could be furnished with good efficiency (up to 95&#8201;% yield) and enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed enantioconvergent cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl halides with ammonia offers a rapid avenue to chiral unnatural &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acids. However, the construction of chiral C&#8722;N bonds between tertiary&#8208;carbon electrophiles and nitrogen nucleophiles presented a great challenge owing to steric congestion. We report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl halides with sulfoximines (as ammonia surrogates) under mild conditions by employing a chiral anionic N,N,N&#8208;ligand with a long spreading side arm. An array of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid derivatives were obtained with good efficiency and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility of the strategy has been showcased by the elaboration of the coupling products into different chiral &#945;&#8208;fully substituted amine building blocks.

         <title>Maldistribution of Chemical Bond Strength Inducing Exceptional Anisotropy of Thermal Conductivity in Non&#8208;Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose that maldistribution of chemical bond strength can lead to large anisotropy of &#954; in non&#8208;layered materials. Taking PbSnS3, a typical non&#8208;layered orthorhombic compound, as an example, our result reveals that the maldistribution of Pb&#8722;S bonds leads to an anisotropy ratio up to 7.1 at 200&#8197;K and 5.5 at 300&#8197;K, respectively, which are among the highest values ever reported in non&#8208;layered materials and even surpass many classical layered materials.







Abstract
Currently, the efforts to find materials with high &#954; anisotropy ratios mainly focus on layered materials, however, the limited quantity and lower workability comparing to non&#8208;layered ones boost the exploration of non&#8208;layered materials with high &#954; anisotropy ratios. Here, taking PbSnS3, a typical non&#8208;layered orthorhombic compound, as an example, we propose that maldistribution of chemical bond strength can lead to large anisotropy of &#954; in non&#8208;layered materials. Our result reveals that the maldistribution of Pb&#8722;S bonds lead to obvious collective vibrations of dioctahedron chain units, resulting in an anisotropy ratio up to 7.1 at 200&#8197;K and 5.5 at 300&#8197;K, respectively, which is one of the highest ever reported in non&#8208;layered materials and even surpasses many classical layered materials such as Bi2Te3 and SnSe. Our findings can not only broaden the horizon for exploring high anisotropic &#954; materials but also provide new opportunities for the application of thermal management.

         <title>CoN1O2 Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation and Selective Cobalt(IV)=O Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Co sites with a N1O2 coordination pocket were constructed on the surface of Mn3O4 to overcome the difficulties in CoIV=O generation during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Nitrogen in the asymmetric configuration induces significant electronic delocalization at the Co sites, thus facilitating PMS adsorption, dissociation, and subsequent CoIV=O formation. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX).







Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo (HVMO) species are powerful non&#8208;radical reactive species that enhance advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) due to their long half&#8208;lives and high selectivity towards recalcitrant water pollutants with electron&#8208;donating groups. However, high&#8208;valent cobalt&#8208;oxo (CoIV=O) generation is challenging in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs because the high 3d&#8208;orbital occupancy of cobalt would disfavor its binding with a terminal oxygen ligand. Herein, we propose a strategy to construct isolated Co sites with unique N1O2 coordination on the Mn3O4 surface. The asymmetric N1O2 configuration is able to accept electrons from the Co 3d&#8208;orbital, resulting in significant electronic delocalization at Co sites for promoted PMS adsorption, dissociation and subsequent generation of CoIV=O species. CoN1O2/Mn3O4 exhibits high intrinsic activity in PMS activation and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation, highly outperforming its counterpart with a CoO3 configuration, carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts with CoN4 configuration, and commercial cobalt oxides. CoIV=O species effectively oxidize the target contaminants via oxygen atom transfer to produce low&#8208;toxicity intermediates. These findings could advance the mechanistic understanding of PMS activation at the molecular level and guide the rational design of efficient environmental catalysts.

         <title>Observation of Asymmetric Oxidation Catalysis with B20 Chiral Crystals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The identification of the driving force for enantiomeric reactions is essential for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. With a pure B20 chiral crystal without any modification, enantiomeric oxidation was achieved at the surface. It is proposed that orbital angular momentum polarization will influence the adsorption of enantiomers and thus change their oxidation kinetics.







Abstract
The study of heterogeneous reactions for enantiomeric processes based on inorganic crystals has been resurgent in recent years. However, the question remains how homochirality develops in nature and chemical reactions. Here, the successful growth of B20 group PdGa single crystals with different chiral lattices enabled us to achieve enantioselective recognition of 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) based on a new mechanism, namely orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization. The orbital textures of PdGa crystals indicate large OAM polarization near the Fermi level and carrying opposite signs. A positive or negative magnetization in the [111] direction is expected depending on the chiral lattice of PdGa crystals. Due to this, the adsorption energies of PdGa crystals and DOPA molecules differ depending on how well the O&#8208;2p orbital of DOPA pairs with the Pd&#8208;4d orbital of PdGa.

     alt="Observation of Asymmetric Oxidation Catalysis with B20 Chiral Crystals**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of the driving force for enantiomeric reactions is essential for the design of high-performance catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. With a pure B20 chiral crystal without any modification, enantiomeric oxidation was achieved at the surface. It is proposed that orbital angular momentum polarization will influence the adsorption of enantiomers and thus change their oxidation kinetics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of heterogeneous reactions for enantiomeric processes based on inorganic crystals has been resurgent in recent years. However, the question remains how homochirality develops in nature and chemical reactions. Here, the successful growth of B20 group PdGa single crystals with different chiral lattices enabled us to achieve enantioselective recognition of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) based on a new mechanism, namely orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization. The orbital textures of PdGa crystals indicate large OAM polarization near the Fermi level and carrying opposite signs. A positive or negative magnetization in the [111] direction is expected depending on the chiral lattice of PdGa crystals. Due to this, the adsorption energies of PdGa crystals and DOPA molecules differ depending on how well the O-2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital of DOPA pairs with the Pd-4&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbital of PdGa. The results provide one possible explanation for how chirality arises in nature by providing an enantioselective route with pure inorganic crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling Atom Migration Abilities Affected Anode Performance of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of &#8220;atomic migration&#8221; is proposed to explain phase separation and poor reaction reversibility in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Instead of standing still, the atoms can migrate dynamically in carbon layers during discharge, which is tracked by in situ transmission electron microscopy. The atomic migration&#8208;induced irreversible reaction that leads to a low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and rapid degradation of electrode performance is unraveled.







Abstract
In sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) is commonly induced by irreversible phase conversion and difficult desodiation, especially on transition metal compounds (TMCs). Yet the underlying physicochemical mechanism of poor reaction reversibility is still a controversial issue. Herein, by using in situ transmission electron microscopy and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, we demonstrate the irreversible conversion of NiCoP@C is caused by the rapid migration of P in carbon layer and preferential formation of isolated Na3P during discharge. By modifying the carbon coating layer, the migration of Ni/Co/P atoms is inhibited, thus the improvement of ICE and cycle stability is realized. The inhibiting of fast atom migration which induces component separation and rapid performance degradation might be applied to a wide range of electrode materials, and guides the development of advanced SIBs.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Azahelicenes through Organocatalyzed Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyzed multicomponent asymmetric synthesis of azahelicenes by using a central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion strategy is reported. The one&#8208;pot sequential Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;catalyzed Povarov reaction/oxidative aromatization gave access to various substituted pyrido[4] and [5]&#8208;helicenes with high enantioselectivity, and these could be easily derivatized while also displaying promising photophysical and chiroptical properties.







Abstract
We have developed an efficient modular asymmetric synthesis of azahelicenes through an organocatalyzed asymmetric multicomponent reaction from readily available polycyclic aromatic amines, aldehydes, and (di)enamides, by employing a central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion strategy. A series of aza[5]&#8208; and aza[4]helicenes bearing various substituents were readily afforded through this one&#8208;pot sequential enantioselective Povarov reaction/oxidative aromatization process, with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The fruitful and diverse derivatizations of the chiral azahelicene products demonstrated the potential of this method, and a preliminary application of the azahelicene derivative as a chiral organocatalyst was showcased. The photophysical and chiroptical properties of these azahelicenes, particularly the acid/base&#8208;triggered switching of these properties, were also well studied, which may find potential applications in the development of novel organic optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Frenkel Defect&#8208;modulated Anti&#8208;thermal Quenching Luminescence in Lanthanide&#8208;doped Sc2(WO4)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon heating, the change from intrinsic to extrinsic position of partial WO42&#8722; in Sc2(WO4)3:Ln forms Frenkel defect, which serves as energy reservoir and back&#8208;transfers the stored excitation energy to Ln3+ so that thermally enhanced downshifting and upconversion luminescence at record&#8208;high working temperatures of 500 and 1073&#8197;K are obtained, respectively.







Abstract
Although large amount of effort has been invested in combating thermal quenching that severely degrades the performance of luminescent materials particularly at high temperatures, not much affirmative progress has been realized. Herein, we demonstrate that the Frenkel defect formed via controlled annealing of Sc2(WO4)3:Ln (Ln=Yb, Er, Eu, Tb, Sm), can work as energy reservoir and back&#8208;transfer the stored excitation energy to Ln3+ upon heating. Therefore, except routine anti&#8208;thermal quenching, thermally enhanced 415&#8208;fold downshifting and 405&#8208;fold upconversion luminescence are even obtained in Sc2(WO4)3:Yb/Er, which has set a record of both the Yb3+&#8208;Er3+ energy transfer efficiency (&gt;85&#8201;%) and the working temperature at 500 and 1073&#8197;K, respectively. Moreover, this design strategy is extendable to other hosts possessing Frenkel defect, and modulation of which directly determines whether enhanced or decreased luminescence can be obtained. This discovery has paved new avenues to reliable generation of high&#8208;temperature luminescence.

         <title>Mercaptoamine&#8208;assisted Post&#8208;encapsulation of Metal Nanoparticles within Preformed Zeolites and their Analogues for Hydroisomerization and Methane Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general synthetic strategy for the post&#8208;encapsulating of metal nanoparticles within preformed zeolites by using 2&#8208;aminoethanethiol as the bi&#8208;grafting agent. Thiol groups are coordinated to metal centers, whereas amine moieties are dynamically attached to micropore walls via acid&#8208;base interactions. The zeolite&#8208;encapsulated catalysts demonstrated high resistance to sintering and fouling in hydroisomerization and methane decomposition.







Abstract
We report a general synthetic strategy for post&#8208;encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within preformed zeolites using post&#8208;synthetic modification. Both anionic and cationic precursors to metal nanoparticle are supported on 8&#8208; and 10&#8208;membered ring zeolites and analogues during wet impregnation using 2&#8208;aminoethanethiol (AET) as a bi&#8208;grafting agent. Thiol groups are coordinated to metal centers, whereas amine moieties are dynamically attached to micropore walls via acid&#8208;base interactions. The dynamic acid&#8208;base interactions cause the even distribution of the metal&#8208;AET complex throughout the zeolite matrix. These processes encapsulate Au, Rh, and Ni precursors within the CHA, *MRE, MFI zeolite, and SAPO&#8208;34 zeolite analogues, for which small channel apertures preclude the post&#8208;synthesis impregnation of metal precursors. Sequential activation forms small and uniform nanoparticles (1&#8211;2.5&#8197;nm in diameter), as confirmed through electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Containment within the small micropores protected the nanoparticles against harsh thermal sintering conditions and prevented the fouling of the metal surface by coke, thus resulting in a high catalytic performance in n&#8208;dodecane hydroisomerization and methane decomposition. The remarkable specificity of the thiol to metal precursors and the dynamic acid&#8208;base interaction make these protocols extendable to various metal&#8208;zeolite systems, suitable for shape&#8208;selective catalysts in challenging chemical environments.

         <title>Regulated High&#8208;Spin State and Constrained Charge Behavior of Active Cobalt Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Promoting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are developed by assembling definite cobalt&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon configurations onto carbon nanotubes using linkers with different electronic effects. The resulting COFs have high&#8208;spin state active cobalt sites, which constrain charge behaviors and serve as an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).







Abstract
A novel type of covalent organic frameworks has been developed by assembling definite cobalt&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon configurations onto carbon nanotubes using linkers that have varying electronic effects. This innovative approach has resulted in an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction, which is understood by a combination of in situ spectroelectrochemistry and the bond order theorem. The strong interaction between the electron&#8208;donating carbon nanotubes and the electron&#8208;accepting linker mitigates the trend of charge loss at cobalt sites, while inducing the generation of high spin state. This enhances the adsorption strength and electron transfer between the cobalt center and reactants/intermediates, leading to an improved oxygen reduction capability. This work not only presents an effective strategy for developing efficient non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts through reticular chemistry, but also provides valuable insights into regulating the electronic configuration and charge behavior of active sites in designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>Prussian Blue Analogues with Optimized Crystal Plane Orientation and Low Crystal Defects toward 450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost Fe&#8208;based Prussian blue analogue with increased redox potential and high energy density is reported for safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries by introducing potassium into the framework and regulating the crystal phase orientation. The unconventional and highly&#8208;reversible phase evolution is also identified, and preferred guest&#8208;ion storage sites and migration mechanism are analyzed through theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been regarded as promising cathode materials for alkali&#8208;ion batteries owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the high water and vacancy content of PBAs lower their energy density and bring safety issues, impeding their large&#8208;scale application. Herein, a facile &#8220;potassium&#8208;ions assisted&#8221; strategy is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs. By manipulating the dominant crystal plane and suppressing vacancies, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs exhibit increased redox potential resulting in high energy density up to &#8776;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is at the same level of the well&#8208;known LiFePO4 cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Remarkably, unconventional highly&#8208;reversible phase evolution and redox&#8208;active pairs were identified by multiple in situ techniques for the first time. The preferred guest&#8208;ion storage sites and migration mechanism were systematically analysed through theoretical calculations. We believe these results could inspire the design of safe with high energy density.

         <title>Observing Confined Local Oxygen&#8208;induced Reversible Thiol/Disulfide Cycle with a Protein Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible thiol/disulfide cycle under protein confinement was monitored in real&#8208;time using a mutant aerolysin nanopore. Experiments combined with kinetic calculations revealed that confined local O2 can lead to proton&#8208;involved, oxygen&#8208;induced disulfide bond cleavage. The negatively charged neighboring microenvironment facilitates disulfide bond cleavage, which plays a vital role in redox signaling and reactions.







Abstract
Disulfide bonds play an important role in thiol&#8208;based redox regulation. However, owing to the lack of analytical tools, little is known about how local O2 mediates the reversible thiol/disulfide cycle under protein confinement. In this study, a protein&#8208;nanopore inside a glove box is used to control local O2 for single&#8208;molecule reaction, as well as a single&#8208;molecule sensor for real&#8208;time monitoring of the reversible thiol/disulfide cycle. The results demonstrate that the local O2 molecules in protein nanopores could facilitate the redox cycle of disulfide formation and cleavage by promoting a higher fraction of effective reactant collisions owing to nanoconfinement. Further kinetic calculations indicate that the negatively charged residues near reactive sites facilitate proton&#8208;involved oxygen&#8208;induced disulfide cleavage under protein confinement. The unexpectedly strong oxidation ability of confined local O2 may play an essential role in cellular redox signaling and enzyme reactions.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonance Building&#8208;Block&#8208;Based Electroluminescent Material: Lengthening Emission Maximum and Shortening Delayed Fluorescence Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unique strategy was proposed to develop multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter (m&#8208;DBCz) by arranging two MR&#8208;building blocks in the slipping&#8208;repeat mode in multiple resonance skeleton. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode employing m&#8208;DBCz as emitter exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with high color purity, external quantum efficiency of 36.3&#8201;% and negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off at ultra&#8208;high brightness.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are considered a class of organic materials with exceptional electronic and optical properties, which make them promising for the applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we improved, synthesized, and characterized a multiple&#8208;resonance type emitter based on the assembly of MR&#8208;building blocks (MR&#8208;BBs). By optimizing the geometric arrangement of MR&#8208;BBs, we were able to generate narrowband emission in the longer wavelength region and shorten the delayed excited&#8208;state lifetime, resulting in improved emission efficiency compared to the parent molecule. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule, m&#8208;DBCz, exhibited narrowband yellowish&#8208;green TADF emission with a full width at half&#8208;maximum of 32&#8197;nm and a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 0.04&#8197;eV. The OLED developed using m&#8208;DBCz as the emitter demonstrated electroluminescence at 548&#8197;nm and achieved a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.9&#8201;%. Further optimization of the device resulted in a high external quantum efficiency of 36.3&#8201;% and extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQE values of 30.1&#8201;% and 27.7&#8201;% obtained even at high luminance levels of 50&#8201;000 and 100&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. These results demonstrate the full potential of MR&#8208;TADF materials for applications on ultrahigh&#8208;luminance OLEDs.

         <title>Geometric Isomerisation of Bifunctional Alkenyl Fluoride Linchpins: Stereodivergence in Amide and Polyene Bioisostere Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkenyl fluorides are valuable amide bioisosteres, but emulating endergonic isomerisation by &#936;[CF=CH] mimicry remains challenging. Herein we report an energy transfer catalysis platform to enable the isomerisation of fluorinated &#946;&#8208;borylacrylate linchpins with an inexpensive sensitiser (up to E/Z 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 in 1&#8197;h). The ambiphilic nature of the products enables facile functionalisation at both termini, and this is demonstrated in a target synthesis.







Abstract
Amide groups are pervasive across the chemical space continuum, where their structural and pharmacological importance, juxtaposed with the hydrolytic vulnerabilities, continues to fuel bioisostere development. Alkenyl fluorides have a venerable history as effective mimics (&#936;[CF=CH]) owing to the planarity of the motif and intrinsic polarity of the C(sp2)&#8722;F bond.

     alt="Geometric Isomerisation of Bifunctional Alkenyl Fluoride Linchpins: Stereodivergence in Amide and Polyene Bioisostere Synthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkenyl fluorides are valuable amide bioisosteres, but emulating endergonic isomerisation by &#936;[CF=CH] mimicry remains challenging. Herein we report an energy transfer catalysis platform to enable the isomerisation of fluorinated &#946;-borylacrylate linchpins with an inexpensive sensitiser (up to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 in 1&#8197;h). The ambiphilic nature of the products enables facile functionalisation at both termini, and this is demonstrated in a target synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amide groups are pervasive across the chemical space continuum, where their structural and pharmacological importance, juxtaposed with the hydrolytic vulnerabilities, continues to fuel bioisostere development. Alkenyl fluorides have a venerable history as effective mimics (&#936;[CF=CH]) owing to the planarity of the motif and intrinsic polarity of the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;F bond. However, emulating the &lt;i&gt;s-cis&lt;/i&gt; to the &lt;i&gt;s-trans&lt;/i&gt; isomerisation of a peptide bond with fluoro-alkene surrogates remains challenging, and current synthetic solutions only enable access to a single configuration. Through the design of an ambiphilic linchpin based on a fluorinated &#946;-borylacrylate, it has been possible to leverage energy transfer catalysis to affect this unprecedented isomerisation process: this provides geometrically-programmable building blocks that can be functionalised at either terminus. Irradiation at &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;=402&#8197;nm with inexpensive thioxanthone as a photocatalyst enables rapid, effective isomerisation of tri- and tetra-substituted species (up to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 in 1&#8197;h), providing a stereodivergent platform for small molecule amide and polyene isostere discovery.

         <title>Interfacial Ti&#8722;S Bond Modulated S&#8208;Scheme MOF/Covalent Triazine Framework Nanosheet Heterojunctions for Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>

An S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction built up from titanium&#8208;organic framework (MOF&#8208;902) @thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine framework (CTF&#8208;Th) nanosheets was prepared. It has controllable interfacial oxygen vacancies (OVs). This heterojunction demonstrates high efficiency in photocatalytic C3&#8208;acylation of indoles with a yield 8.2&#8197;times larger than pristine CTF&#8208;Th or MOF&#8208;902. The reaction could be applied to a range of substrates.







Abstract
Constructing photocatalyst systems to functionalize the inert C&#8722;H bonds has attracted extensive research interest. However, purposeful modulation of interfacial charge transfer in heterostructures remains a challenge, as it usually suffers from sluggish kinetics. Reported herein is an easy strategy to construct the heteroatom&#8208;induced interface for developing the titanium&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;902) @ thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine frameworks (CTF&#8208;Th) nanosheets S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions with controllable oxygen vacancies (OVs). Specifically, Ti atoms were first anchored onto the heteroatom site of CTF&#8208;Th nanosheets, and then grown into MOF&#8208;902 via an interfacial Ti&#8722;S linkage, generating OVs. Using in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the enhanced interfacial charge separation and transfer induced by moderate OVs in the pre&#8208;designed S&#8208;scheme nanosheets was validated. The heterostructures exhibited an improved efficiency in photocatalytic C3&#8208;acylation of indoles under mild conditions with a yield 8.2&#8197;times larger than pristine CTF&#8208;Th or MOF&#8208;902 and enabled an extended scope of substrates (15&#8197;examples). This performance is superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalyst and can be retained, without significant loss, after 12&#8197;consecutive cycles.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Modulated Metal Tetrathiafulvalene Octacarboxylate Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three similar MOFs were constructed with Zn2+/Mn2+/Cd2+ and a new tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;octacarboxylate&#8208;based ligand (o&#8208;H8TTFOB), possessing excellent electrochemical performance as anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The slight difference in the structures introduced by adjusting the radius of the metal ions leads to a change in the coordination environment, which results in the highest reversible specific capacity of 1288&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 in Zn&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB.







Abstract
Modulation of the ligands and coordination environment of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has been an effective and relatively unexplored avenue for improving the anode performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). In this study, three MOFs are synthesized, namely, M4(o&#8208;TTFOB)(bpm)2(H2O)2 (where M is Mn, Zn, and Cd; o&#8208;H8TTFOB is ortho&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene octabenzoate; and bpm is 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyrimidine), based on a new ligand o&#8208;H8TTFOB with two adjacent carboxylates on one phenyl, which allows us to establish the impact of metal coordination on the performance of these MOFs as anode materials in LIBs. Mn&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB and Zn&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB, with two more uncoordinated oxygen atoms from o&#8208;TTFOB8&#8722;, show higher reversible specific capacities of 1249&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1288&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after full activation. In contrast, Cd&#8208;o&#8208;TTFOB shows a reversible capacity of 448&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the same condition due to the lack of uncoordinated oxygen atoms. Crystal structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry measurements of the half&#8208;cell configurations, and density functional theory calculations have been performed to explain the lithium storage mechanism, diffusion kinetics, and structure&#8208;function relationship. This study demonstrates the advantages of MOFs with high designability in the fabrication of LIBs.

         <title>Significant Acceleration of Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction at the Gas&#8208;Liquid Interface of Microdroplets
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency in microdroplets is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding bulk phase reaction. The acceleration is essentially related to an intrinsic strong electric field at the abundant air&#8208;water interface that can promote the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is largely constrained by the sluggish mass transfer and fast combination of photogenerated charge carriers. Herein, we find that the photocatalytic CO2RR efficiency at the abundant gas&#8208;liquid interface provided by microdroplets is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding bulk phase reaction. Even in the absence of sacrificial agents, the production rates of HCOOH over WO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.33H2O mediated by microdroplets reaches 2536&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 (vs. 13&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 in bulk phase), which is significantly superior to the previously reported photocatalytic CO2RR in bulk phase reaction condition. Beyond the efficient delivery of CO2 to photocatalyst surfaces within microdroplets, we reveal that the strong electric field at the gas&#8208;liquid interface of microdroplets essentially promotes the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. This study provides a deep understanding of ultrafast reaction kinetics promoted by the gas&#8208;liquid interface of microdroplets and a novel way of addressing the low efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to fuel.

         <title>Fused Triangulene Dimers: Facile Synthesis by Intramolecular Radical&#8208;Radical Coupling and Application for Near&#8208;Infrared Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fused triangulene dimers were synthesized by an intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling approach. The obtained material, dispersed in polystyrene films, showed amplified spontaneous emission in the near&#8208;infrared region. Solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers were also successfully fabricated.







Abstract
Large graphene&#8208;like molecules with four zigzag edges are ideal gain medium materials for organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) lasers. However, synthesizing them becomes increasingly challenging as the molecular size increases. In this study, we introduce a new intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling approach and successfully synthesize two fused triangulene dimers (1&#8201;a/1&#8201;b) efficiently. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of 1&#8201;a indicates that there is no intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the solid state. When the more soluble derivative 1&#8201;b is dispersed in polystyrene thin films, amplified spontaneous emission in the NIR region is observed. Using 1&#8201;b as the active gain material, we fabricate solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers that exhibit a narrow emission linewidth at around 790&#8197;nm. The laser devices also exhibit low thresholds with high photostability. Our study provides a new synthetic strategy for extended nanographenes, which have diverse applications in electronics and photonics.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Mediated Tumor Energy Remodeling for Sensitizing Mild Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoplatform based on copper sulfide (ADT@CuSNDs) that is able to remodel the tumor energy via hydrogen sulfide (H2S) mediation was developed to sensitize the tumor to mild photothermal therapy (mPTT). ADT@CuSNDs could sustainably deliver H2S to tumor sites, disrupt the mitochondrial respiratory chain, inhibit ATP generation, and reduce heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) overexpression, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic outcome.







Abstract
The metabolic reprogramming of tumors requires high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to maintain therapeutic resistance, posing a major challenge for photothermal therapy (PTT). Although raising the temperature helps in tumor ablation, it frequently leads to severe side effects. Therefore, improving the therapeutic response and promoting healing are critical considerations in the development of PTT. Here, we proposed a gas&#8208;mediated energy remodeling strategy to improve mild PTT efficacy while minimizing side effects. In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8208;approved drug&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor was developed to provide a sustained supply of H2S to tumor sites, serving as an adjuvant to PTT. This approach proved to be highly effective in disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain, inhibiting ATP generation, and reducing the overexpression of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which ultimately amplified the therapeutic outcome. With the ability to reverse tumor thermotolerance, this strategy delivered a greatly potent antitumor response, achieving complete tumor ablation in a single treatment while minimizing harm to healthy tissues. Thus, it holds great promise to be a universal solution for overcoming the limitations of PTT and may serve as a valuable paradigm for the future clinical translation of photothermal nanoagents.

         <title>Enhanced CO Adsorption by Modulating the Electron Density Distribution of Graphite&#8208;Copper Porphyrin Sorbents with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from the current methodology depending on the mechanical deformation of photochromic units, the nondeforming photo&#8208;responsiveness of the sorbent is exploited in this study, via the change of electron density distribution at stable excited states. The CO adsorption capability can be dramatically photo&#8208;gained over the sorbent with an ultra&#8208;low specific surface area.







Abstract
The photo&#8208;responsive adsorption has emerged as a vibrant area, but its current methodology is limited by the well&#8208;defined photochromic units and their molecular deformation driven by photo&#8208;stimuli. Herein, a methodology of nondeforming photo&#8208;responsiveness is successfully exploited. With the exploiting agent of Cu&#8208;TCPP framework assembled on the graphite and strongly interacted with it, the sorbent generates two kinds of adsorption sites, over which the electron density distribution of the graphite layer can be modulated at the c&#8208;axis direction, which can further evolve due to photo&#8208;stimulated excited states. The excited states are stable enough to meet the timescale of microscopic adsorption equilibrium. Independent of the ultra&#8208;low specific surface area of the sorbent (20&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), the CO adsorption capability can be improved from 0.50&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the ground state to 1.24&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar) with the visible light radiation, rather than the photothermal desorption.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts Derived from a Preorganized Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe dual&#8208;atom catalysts with Fe2N6C8O2 configuration were fabricated through the one&#8208;step carbonization of a preorganized covalent organic framework, which exhibited high oxygen reduction activity due to the enhanced adsorption of *OOH, and adjustable d&#8208;band center.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DAC) are deemed as promising electrocatalysts due to the abundant active sites and adjustable electronic structure, but the fabrication of well&#8208;defined DAC is still full of challenges. Herein, bonded Fe dual&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe2DAC) with Fe2N6C8O2 configuration were developed through one&#8208;step carbonization of a preorganized covalent organic framework with bimetallic Fe chelation sites (Fe2COF). The transition from Fe2COF to Fe2DAC involved the dissociation of the nanoparticles and the capture of atoms by carbon defects. Benefitting from the optimized d&#8208;band center and enhanced adsorption of OOH* intermediates, Fe2DAC exhibited outstanding oxygen reduction activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.898&#8197;V vs. RHE. This work will guide more fabrication of dual&#8208;atom and even cluster catalysts from preorganized COF in the future.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis via Modulating the Interfacial Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) into the KOH electrolyte improves the selectivity and activity of H2O2 electrosynthesis. The hydrogen bonds formed between DMSO and water molecules can reduce the activity of water dissociation to active H* species. The suitable H* supply environment improves the selectivity of H2O2 via suppressing 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction.







Abstract
Designing highly efficient and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis remains challenging. Inhibiting the competitive side reaction, 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction to H2O, is essential for highly selective H2O2 electrosynthesis. Instead of hindering excessive hydrogenation of H2O2 via catalyst modification, we discover that adding a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), to the KOH electrolyte enables simultaneous improvement of the selectivity and activity of H2O2 electrosynthesis.

&lt;p&gt;The addition of a hydrogen-bond acceptor DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) into the KOH electrolyte improves the selectivity and activity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis. The hydrogen bonds formed between DMSO and water molecules can reduce the activity of water dissociation to active H* species. The suitable H* supply environment improves the selectivity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via suppressing 4&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing highly efficient and stable electrode-electrolyte interface for hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electrosynthesis remains challenging. Inhibiting the competitive side reaction, 4&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is essential for highly selective H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis. Instead of hindering excessive hydrogenation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via catalyst modification, we discover that adding a hydrogen-bond acceptor, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), to the KOH electrolyte enables simultaneous improvement of the selectivity and activity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis. Spectral characterization and molecular simulation confirm that the formation of hydrogen bonds between DMSO and water molecules at the electrode-electrolyte interface can reduce the activity of water dissociation into active H* species. The suitable H* supply environment hinders excessive hydrogenation of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thus improving the selectivity of 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR and achieving over 90&#8201;% selectivity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Initiator&#8208;Activation Strategy&#8208;Enabled Organocatalyzed Reversible&#8208;Deactivation Radical Polymerization Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyzed controlled radical polymerization has been established using a bis(phenothiazine)arene catalyst, enabling efficient initiation from sulfonyl chlorides with pyridine activators via photo&#8208;induced electron transfer. This work furnishes a versatile method to tailor poly(meth)acrylates without transition&#8208;metal concerns. It facilitates grafting polymerization toward brush topologies, &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; temporal control, and chain extensions.







Abstract
Organocatalyzed reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerizations (RDRPs) are attractive for many applications. Here, we developed photoredox&#8208;mediated RDRP by activating (hetero)aryl sulfonyl chloride (ArSO2Cl) initiators with pyridines and designing a novel bis(phenothiazine)arene catalyst. The in situ formed sulfonyl pyridinium intermediates effectively promote controlled chain&#8208;growth from ArSO2Cl, enabling access to various well&#8208;defined polymers with high initiation efficiencies and controlled dispersities under mild conditions. This versatile method allows &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; temporal control, chain&#8208;extension, facile synthesis of different polymer brushes via organocatalyzed grafting reactions from linear chains. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence decay studies and calculations support the reaction mechanism. This work provides a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free RDRP to tailor polymers with readily available aromatic initiators, and will promote the design of polymerization leveraged from photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Solar Hydrocarbons: Single&#8208;Step, Atmospheric&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of C2&#8722;C4 Alkanes and Alkenes from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
At atmospheric pressure, solar&#8208;energy&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step CO2 hydrogenation to C2&#8722;C4 hydrocarbons is realized with considerable activity. The photothermal effect of light plays an essential role in the distinct selectivity to hydrocarbons. Promising results obtained from a laboratory demonstration bode well for the development of a solar hydrocarbon pilot refinery.







Abstract
Cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) spinel has been found to produce C2&#8722;C4 hydrocarbons in a single&#8208;step, ambient&#8208;pressure, photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 with a rate of 1.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, selectivity of 29.8&#8201;% and conversion yield of 12.9&#8201;%. On stream the CoFe2O4 reconstructs to a CoFe&#8722;CoFe2O4 alloy&#8208;spinel nanocomposite which facilitates the light&#8208;assisted transformation of CO2 to CO and hydrogenation of the CO to C2&#8722;C4 hydrocarbons. Promising results obtained from a laboratory demonstrator bode well for the development of a solar hydrocarbon pilot refinery.

         <title>Enhancing Carrier Transport via &#963;&#8208;Linkage Length Modulation in D&#8208;&#963;&#8208;A Semiconductors for Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of D&#8208;&#963;&#8208;A organic photocatalysts (imidazole&#8208;alkyl&#8208;perylene diimide, denoted as IMZ&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PDI) are presented with different &#963;&#8208;linkage lengths and high crystallinity. Through tuning &#963;&#8208;linkage length, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance is finely controlled, and the carrier transport rate and photocatalytic performance of materials is improved. The use of an ethyl&#8208;linkage can shorten the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance most significantly to yield the best photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Carrier transport is an equally decisive factor as carrier separation for elevating photocatalytic efficiency. However, limited by indefinite structures and low crystallinities, studies on enhancing carrier transport of organic photocatalysts are still in their infancy. Here, we develop an &#963;&#8208;linkage length modulation strategy to enhance carrier transport in imidazole&#8208;alkyl&#8208;perylene diimide (IMZ&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PDI, corresponding to D&#8208;&#963;&#8208;A) photocatalysts by controlling &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance. Ethyl&#8208;linkage can shorten &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance (3.19&#8197;&#197;) the most among IMZ&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PDIs (where alkyl=none, ethyl, and n&#8208;propyl) via minimizing steric hindrance between D and A moieties, which leads to the fastest carrier transport rates. Thereby, IMZ&#8208;ethyl&#8208;PDI exhibits remarkable enhancement in phenol degradation with 32&#8208;fold higher rates than IMZ&#8208;PDI, as well as the oxygen evolution rate (271&#8208;fold increased). In microchannel reactors, IMZ&#8208;ethyl&#8208;PDI also presents 81.5&#8201;% phenol removal with high&#8208;flux surface hydraulic loading (44.73&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1). Our findings provide a promising molecular design guideline for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts and elucidate crucial internal carrier transport mechanisms.

         <title>Photosynthetic Fixation of CO2 in Alkenes by Heterogeneous Photoredox Catalysis with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photoredox system is reported for hydrocarboxylation of alkenes. Boron carbonitride with abundant terminal B/N defects was employed as a photo transducer, permitting construction of sterically encumbered Lewis acid&#8208;base sites that are able to synergistically activate CO2 molecules under visible light. Anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity was achieved with good functional group tolerance using CO2 as the carboxyl source.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven fixation of CO2 in organics has emerged as an appealing alternative for the synthesis of value&#8208;added fine chemicals. Challenges remain in the transformation of CO2 as well as product selectivity due to its thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Here we develop a boron carbonitride (BCN) with the abundant terminal B/N defects around the mesoporous walls, which essentially enhances surface active sites as well as charge transfer kinetics, boosting the overall rate of CO2 adsorption and activation. In this protocol, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrocarboxylation of alkenes with CO2 to an extended carbon chain is achieved with good functional group tolerance and specific regioselectivity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The mechanistic studies demonstrate the formation of CO2 radical anion intermediate on defective boron carbonitride, leading to the anti&#8208;Markovnikov carboxylation. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural products and synthesis of anti&#8208;diabetic GPR40 agonists reveal the utility of this method. This study sheds new insight on the design and application of metal&#8208;free semiconductors for the conversion of CO2 in an atom&#8208;economic and sustainable manner.

Boron carbonitride with abundant terminal B/N defects was employed as a photo transducer, permitting construction of sterically encumbered Lewis acid-base sites that are able to synergistically activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules under visible light. Anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity was achieved with good functional group tolerance using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the carboxyl source.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-driven fixation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in organics has emerged as an appealing alternative for the synthesis of value-added fine chemicals. Challenges remain in the transformation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as product selectivity due to its thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Here we develop a boron carbonitride (BCN) with the abundant terminal B/N defects around the mesoporous walls, which essentially enhances surface active sites as well as charge transfer kinetics, boosting the overall rate of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and activation. In this protocol, anti-Markovnikov hydrocarboxylation of alkenes with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to an extended carbon chain is achieved with good functional group tolerance and specific regioselectivity under visible-light irradiation. The mechanistic studies demonstrate the formation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; radical anion intermediate on defective boron carbonitride, leading to the anti-Markovnikov carboxylation. Gram-scale reaction, late-stage carboxylation of natural products and synthesis of anti-diabetic GPR40 agonists reveal the utility of this method. This study sheds new insight on the design and application of metal-free semiconductors for the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an atom-economic and sustainable manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequence Control in Asymmetric Terpolymerizations of meso&#8208;Epoxides, CO2, and Phthalic Anhydride: Unprecedented Statistical Ester&#8211;Carbonate Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric terpolymerizations of meso&#8208;epoxides, CO2, and phthalic anhydride mediated by dinuclear aluminum catalysts with multiple stereogenic centers delivered unprecedented statistical ester&#8211;carbonate distributions and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The statistical terpolymerization of epoxides, CO2 and cyclic anhydrides remains challenging, mainly because epoxide/CO2 and epoxide/anhydride copolymerizations typically proceed at considerably different rates. Herein, we report the syntheses of novel chiral terpolymers with unprecedented statistical distributions of carbonate and ester units (up to 50&#8201;% junction units) via the one&#8208;pot reaction of cyclohexene oxide, phthalic anhydride, and CO2 under mild conditions using enantiopure bimetallic aluminum&#8208;complex&#8208;based catalyst systems. Notably, all resulting terpolymers exhibited excellent enantioselectivities (&#8805;96&#8201;% ee) that were independent of the carbonate&#8211;ester distribution. The statistical compositions of the carbonate and ester units in the resulting terpolymers were determined via 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies. Furthermore, thermal properties were tuned by altering the ester content of the chiral terpolymer without influencing the enantioselective ring&#8208;opening step involving the meso&#8208;epoxide. This asymmetric terpolymerization methodology is also compatible with a variety of meso&#8208;epoxides to afford the corresponding terpolymers with 17&#8201;%&#8211;25&#8201;% junction units and excellent enantioselectivities (94&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). The present study is expected to provide new guidelines for preparing a broad range of biodegradable polymers with excellent enantioselectivities and adjustable properties.

         <title>Alkali Metal Dihydropyridines in Transfer Hydrogenation Catalysis of Imines: Amide Basicity versus Hydride Surrogacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
When it comes to catalytic transfer hydrogenation of imines to amines using 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene as the hydrogen source, the 2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridyl complexes of the heavyweight alkali metals potassium, rubidium and caesium pack the greater power over their lightweight lithium and sodium rivals with, in best cases, near quantitative yields in minutes and reactions run at room temperature.







Abstract
Catalytic reduction of a representative set of imines, both aldimines and ketimines, to amines has been studied using transfer hydrogenation from 1,4&#8208;dicyclohexadiene. Unusually, this has been achieved using s&#8208;block pre&#8208;catalysts, namely 1&#8208;metallo&#8208;2&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 2&#8208;tBuC5H5NM, M(tBuDHP), where M=Li&#8211;Cs. Reactions have been monitored in C6D6 and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;d8 (THF&#8208;d8). A definite trend is observed in catalyst efficiency with the heavier alkali metal tBuDHPs outperforming the lighter congeners. In general, Cs(tBuDHP) is the optimal pre&#8208;catalyst with, in the best cases, reactions producing quantitative yields of amines in minutes at room temperature using 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst. Supporting the experimental study, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have also been carried out which reveal that Cs has a pathway with a significantly lower rate determining step than the Li congener. In the postulated initiation pathways DHP can act as either a base or as a surrogate hydride.

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries Based on an Ultrathin and Respirable Interphase Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries with high areal capacities, high energy and power densities, as well as long cycle number have been achieved using an ultrathin and respirable interphase layer. It enables highly reversible Li plating/stripping process and unlocks new approaches for designing and screening novel interphase layers towards practical anode&#8208;free batteries.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries are desirable candidates in pursuit of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, their poor cycling performances originated from the unsatisfactory reversibility of Li plating/stripping remains a grand challenge. Here we show a facile and scalable approach to produce high&#8208;performing anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries using a bioinspired and ultrathin (250&#8197;nm) interphase layer comprised of triethylamine germanate. The derived tertiary amine and LixGe alloy showed enhanced adsorption energy that significantly promoted Li&#8208;ion adsorption, nucleation and deposition, contributing to a reversible expansion/shrinkage process upon Li plating/stripping. Impressive Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) of &#8776;99.3&#8201;% were achieved for 250&#8197;cycles in Li/Cu cells. In addition, the anode&#8208;free LiFePO4 full batteries demonstrated maximal energy and power densities of 527&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 1554&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, respectively, and remarkable cycling stability (over 250&#8197;cycles with an average CE of 99.4&#8201;%) at a practical areal capacity of &#8776;3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the highest among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art anode&#8208;free LiFePO4 batteries. Our ultrathin and respirable interphase layer presents a promising way to fully unlock large&#8208;scale production of anode&#8208;free batteries.

A class of stereoisomeric &#945;&#8208;cyano triaryl[3]radialenes was reported, showing state&#8208;dependent light absorption &amp; photoluminescence properties and electron transfer&#8208;driven photoelectromagnetic responsiveness for multimodal information technologies. Specifically, we discussed the special modulation effects of cyano groups on these stereoisomeric radialenes, which may lead to novel design strategy for solid&#8208;state molecular materials.







Abstract
[3]Radialene has a peculiar topology and cross&#8208;conjugation system, representing a unique molecular scaffold in organic materials. Herein, we report a special class of stereoisomeric &#945;&#8208;cyano triaryl[3]radialenes (CTRs) that show concentration&#8208;caused quenching in solution but emit red&#8208;shifted and enhanced luminescence in the crystalline state. Clustering of multiple cyano groups and their through&#8208;space interactions with the [3]radialene ring significantly extend &#960;&#8208;electron communication meanwhile rigidifying the propeller conformation multivalently, thus playing a key role behind the state&#8208;dependent luminescence. These radialenes with a substantial electron affinity undergo a reversible electron transfer transition to anionic radicals with good stability, showing switching of photoabsorption, photoluminescence and electron spin resonance (ESR) signal. We also established proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications of CTRs for multimodal information encryption and chemical sensing.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3]Radialene has a peculiar topology and cross-conjugation system, representing a unique molecular scaffold in organic materials. Herein, we report a special class of stereoisomeric &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-cyano triaryl[3]radialenes (&lt;b&gt;CTRs&lt;/b&gt;) that show concentration-caused quenching in solution but emit red-shifted and enhanced luminescence in the crystalline state. Clustering of multiple cyano groups and their through-space interactions with the [3]radialene ring significantly extend &#960;-electron communication meanwhile rigidifying the propeller conformation multivalently, thus playing a key role behind the state-dependent luminescence. These radialenes with a substantial electron affinity undergo a reversible electron transfer transition to anionic radicals with good stability, showing switching of photoabsorption, photoluminescence and electron spin resonance (ESR) signal. We also established proof-of-concept applications of &lt;b&gt;CTRs&lt;/b&gt; for multimodal information encryption and chemical sensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cluster Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Containing Copper Iodine Cube with 100&#8201;% Exciton Utilization Using Host&#8208;Cluster Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cluster light&#8208;emitting diode (CLED) with a record external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;% was demonstrated. Its emissive layer consisted of redox&#8208;active Cu4I4 cluster and thermally activated delayed fluorescence host, which complementarily provided internal and external reverse intersystem crossing channels for 100&#8201;% triplet conversion, 100&#8208;fold increased singlet radiation rate constant and tenfold decreased triplet non&#8208;radiation rate constant.







Abstract
Clusters combine the advantages of organic molecules and inorganic nanomaterials, which are promising alternatives for optoelectronic applications. Nonetheless, recently emerged cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes require further excited state optimization of cluster emitters, especially to reduce population of the cluster&#8208;centered triplet quenching state (3CC). Here we report that redox&#8208;active ligands enhance reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) of Cu4I4 cluster for triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet conversion, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) host can provide an external RISC channel. It indicates that the complementarity between TADF host and cluster in RISC transitions gives rise to 100&#8201;% triplet conversion efficiency and complete singlet exciton convergence, rendering 100&#8208;fold increased singlet radiation rate constant and tenfold decreased triplet non&#8208;radiation rate constant. We achieve a photoluminescence quantum yield of 99&#8201;% and a record external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;%.

         <title>Green, General and Low&#8208;cost Synthesis of Porous Organic Polymers in Sub&#8208;kilogram Scale for Catalysis and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic polymers (POPs) with high surface areas were synthesized using inexpensive diamine and dialdehyde monomers under green synthesis conditions. Sub&#8208;kilogram yields of POP were obtained from a scaled&#8208;up synthesis in ethanol at room temperature. The cost of POPs can be reduced to &#8776;10&#8197;USD/kg, making it significantly more cost&#8208;effective compared to other porous materials.







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) with high porosity and tunable functionalities have been widely studied for use in gas separation, catalysis, energy conversion and energy storage. However, the high cost of organic monomers, and the use of toxic solvents and high temperatures during synthesis pose obstacles for large&#8208;scale production. Herein, we report the synthesis of imine and aminal&#8208;linked POPs using inexpensive diamine and dialdehyde monomers in green solvents. Theoretical calculations and control experiments show that using meta&#8208;diamines is crucial for forming aminal linkages and branching porous networks from [2+2] polycondensation reactions. The method demonstrates good generality in that 6 POPs were successfully synthesized from different monomers. Additionally, we scaled up the synthesis in ethanol at room temperature, resulting in the production of POPs in sub&#8208;kilogram quantities at a relatively low cost. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies demonstrate that the POPs can be used as high&#8208;performance sorbents for CO2 separation and as porous substrates for efficient heterogeneous catalysis. This method provides an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective approach for large&#8208;scale synthesis of various POPs.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia in Strong Acid Conditions with Fe2M&#8208;Trinuclear&#8208;Cluster Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient, direct, electrocatalytic ammonia production from nitrate in a strong acid environment is possible by using the efficient electron proton conduction capability of the dinitrogen ligand and the metal active site in an Fe&#8208;based trinuclear cluster metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF).







Abstract
Nitrate&#8208;containing industrial wastewater poses a serious threat to the global food security and public health safety. As compared to the traditional microbial denitrification, electrocatalytic nitrate reduction shows better sustainability with ultrahigh energy efficiency and the production of high&#8208;value ammonia (NH3). However, nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater from most industrial processes, such as mining, metallurgy, and petrochemical engineering, is generally acidic, which contradicts the typical neutral/alkaline working conditions for both denitrifying bacteria and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art inorganic electrocatalysts, leading to the demand for pre&#8208;neutralization and the problematic hydrogen evaluation reaction (HER) competition and catalyst dissolution. Here, we report a series of Fe2M (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Zn) trinuclear cluster metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) that enable the highly efficient electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonium under strong acidic conditions with excellent stability. In pH=1 electrolyte, the Fe2Co&#8208;MOF demonstrates the NH3 yield rate of 20653.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1site with 90.55&#8201;% NH3&#8208;Faradaic efficiency (FE), 98.5&#8201;% NH3&#8208;selectivity and up to 75&#8197;hr of electrocatalytic stability. Additionally, successful nitrate reduction in high&#8208;acidic conditions directly produce the ammonium sulfate as nitrogen fertilizer, avoiding the subsequent aqueous ammonia extraction and preventing the ammonia spillage loss. This series of cluster&#8208;based MOF structures provide new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance nitrate reduction catalysts under environmentally&#8208;relevant wastewater conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly Mechanism and Chiral Transfer in CuO Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For inorganic material self&#8208;assembly, chiral communication generally aims at transferring and amplifying chirality from the molecules to the superstructure. The demanding fabrication and complex structure seriously hinder understanding the mechanism of chiral transfer and superstructure formation. In this work, we use a simple and mild synthesis method to demonstrate the evolution of the morphology and chirality of hierarchical superstructures.







Abstract
Chiral inorganic superstructures have received considerable interest due to the chiral communication between inorganic compounds and chiral organic additives. However, the demanding fabrication and complex multilevel structure seriously hinder the understanding of chiral transfer and self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. Herein, we use chiral CuO superstructures as a model system to study the formation process of hierarchical chiral structures. Based on a simple and mild synthesis route, the time&#8208;resolved morphology and the in situ chirality evolution could be easily followed. The morphology evolution of the chiral superstructure involves hierarchical assembly, including primary nanoparticles, intermediate bundles, and superstructure at different growth stages. Successive redshifts and enhancements of the CD signal support chiral transfer from the surface penicillamine to the inorganic superstructure. Full&#8208;field electro&#8208;dynamical simulations reproduced the structural chirality and allowed us to predict its modulation. This work opens the door to a large family of chiral inorganic materials where chiral molecule&#8208;guided self&#8208;assembly can be specifically designed to follow a bottom&#8208;up chiral transfer pathway.

Atom&#8208;precise nickel&#8208;thiolate clusters activate dinitrogen electrochemically and selectively transform it to ammonia with 25&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency. A combined approach based on experimental results and theoretical calculations sheds light on the mechanism of this electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction.







Abstract
The fixing of N2 to NH3 is challenging due to the inertness of the N&#8801;N bond. Commercially, ammonia production depends on the energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch (H&#8722;B) process, which emits CO2 while using fossil fuels as the sources of hydrogen and energy. An alternative method for NH3 production is the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) process as it is powered by renewable energy sources. Here, we report a tiara&#8208;like nickel&#8208;thiolate cluster, [Ni6(PET)12] (where, PET=2&#8208;phenylethanethiol)] as an efficient electro&#8208;catalyst for the electrochemical NRR at ambient conditions. Ammonia (NH3: 16.2&#177;0.8&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) was the only nitrogenous product over the potential of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V vs. Fc+/Fc with a Faradaic efficiency of 25%&#177;1.7. Based on theoretical calculations, NRR by [Ni6(PET)12] proceeds through both the distal and alternating pathways with an onset potential of &#8722;1.84&#8197;V vs. RHE (i.e., &#8722;2.46&#8197;V vs. Fc+/Fc) which corroborates with the experimental findings.

         <title>Nano&#8208;enabled Quenching of Bacterial Communications for the Prevention of Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new antimicrobial strategy is reported to catalytically cut off cell&#8722;cell communications in biofilm construction. Through tuning the coordination environment around zinc atoms, an efficient lactonase&#8208;like Zn&#8722;Nx&#8722;C nanomaterial was synthesized to mimic the active domain of lactonase, which significantly prevented biofilm formation in antibiotic&#8208;resistant strains.







Abstract
Biofilm formation is a major threat to industry, the environment and human health. While killing of embedded microbes in biofilms may inevitably lead to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), catalytic quenching of bacterial communications by lactonase is a promising antifouling approach. Given the shortcomings of protein enzymes, it is attractive to engineer synthetic materials to mimic the activity of lactonase. Herein, an efficient lactonase&#8208;like Zn&#8722;Nx&#8722;C nanomaterial was synthesized by tuning the coordination environment around zinc atoms to mimic the active domain of lactonase for catalytical interception of bacterial communications in biofilm formation. The Zn&#8722;Nx&#8722;C material could selectively catalyze 77.5&#8201;% hydrolysis of N&#8208;acylated&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine lactone (AHL), a critical bacterial quorum sensing (QS) signal in biofilm construction. Consequently, AHL degradation downregulated the expression of QS&#8208;related genes in antibiotic resistant bacteria and significantly prevented biofilm formation. As a proof of concept, Zn&#8722;Nx&#8722;C&#8208;coated iron plates prevented 80.3&#8201;% biofouling after a month exposure in river. Overall, our study provides a nano&#8208;enabled contactless antifouling insight to avoid AMR evolution by engineering nanomaterials for mimicking the key bacterial enzymes (e.g., lactonase) functioning in biofilm construction.

         <title>A Recyclable and Scalable High&#8208;Capacity Organic Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practically applicable organic electrode material is proposed for scalable aqueous batteries, which empower Ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale capacity in stacked large pouch cells. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of the charge storage were carried out. The recycling of the organic electrode can be achieved at any state of charge with high yields through an economical process.







Abstract
Redox organic electrode materials (OEMs) have attracted extensive attention for batteries due to the possibility to be designed with high performance. However, the practical application of OEMs requires rigor criteria such as low cost, recyclability, scalability and high performance etc. and hence seems still far away. Here, we demonstrate an OEM for high performance aqueous organic batteries. Quantification of the charge storage confirmed the storage of protons with fast reaction kinetics, thereby enabling the high performance at high mass loading. As a result, the laminated pouch cells delivered Ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale capacity with excellent cycling performance. Benefited from the small molecular nature and the stable both charged and discharged states, the electrodes can be recycled at any states of charge with high yields (more than 90&#8201;%). This work provides a substantial step in the practical applications of OEMs for the future sustainable batteries.

         <title>Polycation&#8208;Regulated Electrolyte and Interfacial Electric Fields for Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycation additive is introduced to simultaneously regulate the electric fields of electrolyte and Zn/electrolyte interface, which improves Zn2+ migration behaviors and guides dominant Zn (002) deposition, thereby facilitating homogeneous Zn nucleation and growth concomitantly, and blocking the parasitic side reactions derived from water.







Abstract
Zn metal as one of promising anode materials for aqueous batteries but suffers from disreputable dendrite growth, grievous hydrogen evolution and corrosion. Here, a polycation additive, polydiallyl dimethylammonium chloride (PDD), is introduced to achieve long&#8208;term and highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Specifically, the PDD can simultaneously regulate the electric fields of electrolyte and Zn/electrolyte interface to improve Zn2+ migration behaviors and guide dominant Zn (002) deposition, which is veritably detected by Zeta potential, Kelvin probe force microscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy. Moreover, PDD also creates a positive charge&#8208;rich protective outer layer and a N&#8208;rich hybrid inner layer, which accelerates the Zn2+ desolvation during plating process and blocks the direct contact between water molecules and Zn anode. Thereby, the reversibility and long&#8208;term stability of Zn anodes are substantially improved, as certified by a higher average coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% for Zn||Cu cells and 22 times longer life for Zn||Zn cells compared with that of PDD&#8208;free electrolyte.

         <title>Unlocking the Interfacial Adsorption&#8208;Intercalation Pseudocapacitive Storage Limit to Enabling All&#8208;Climate, High Energy/Power Density and Durable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) for zinc&#8208;ion batteries is mainly limited by the sluggish storage kinetics. This report presents an integrated modulation to unlock the omnidirectional storage kinetics&#8208;enhanced porous VSe2&#8722;x&#8901;n&#8201;H2O host for all&#8208;climate, high energy/power density and durable zinc&#8208;ion batteries. An interfacial adsorption and intercalation pseudocapacitive storage mechanism was also uncovered.







Abstract
Sluggish storage kinetics and insufficient performance are the major challenges that restrict the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) applied for zinc ion storage, especially at the extreme temperature conditions. Herein, a multiscale interface structure&#8208;integrated modulation concept was presented, to unlock the omnidirectional storage kinetics&#8208;enhanced porous VSe2&#8722;x&#8901;n&#8201;H2O host. Theory research indicated that the co&#8208;modulation of H2O intercalation and selenium vacancy enables enhancing the interfacial zinc ion capture ability and decreasing the zinc ion diffusion barrier.

&lt;p&gt;The application of transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) for zinc-ion batteries is mainly limited by the sluggish storage kinetics. This report presents an integrated modulation to unlock the omnidirectional storage kinetics-enhanced porous VSe&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O host for all-climate, high energy/power density and durable zinc-ion batteries. An interfacial adsorption and intercalation pseudocapacitive storage mechanism was also uncovered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sluggish storage kinetics and insufficient performance are the major challenges that restrict the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) applied for zinc ion storage, especially at the extreme temperature conditions. Herein, a multiscale interface structure-integrated modulation concept was presented, to unlock the omnidirectional storage kinetics-enhanced porous VSe&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O host. Theory research indicated that the co-modulation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O intercalation and selenium vacancy enables enhancing the interfacial zinc ion capture ability and decreasing the zinc ion diffusion barrier. Moreover, an interfacial adsorption-intercalation pseudocapacitive storage mechanism was uncovered. Such cathode displayed remarkable storage performance at the wide temperature range (&#8722;40&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C) in aqueous and solid electrolytes. In particular, it can retain a high specific capacity of 173&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 5000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as a high energy density of 290&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a power density of 15.8&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature. Unexpectedly, a remarkably energy density of 465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and power density of 21.26&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 60&#8201;&#176;C also can be achieved, as well as 258&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 10.8&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Integration of a Hydrophobic and Fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;Conductive Inorganic Interphase to Stabilize Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ integration of a hydrophobic and fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conductive inorganic interphase layer composed of zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) on Zn by a room&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry method effectively addresses the irreversible issues facing Zn anodes involving dendrite growth and water erosion, while the hydrophilic and loose ZnHCF particles&#8208;based interphase counterpart cannot efficiently prevent water erosion on Zn during long&#8208;term cycling.







Abstract
The irreversible issues of Zn anode stemming from dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced erosion have severely hindered the commercialization of rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries. Herein, a hydrophobic and fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conductive zinc hexacyanoferrate (HB&#8208;ZnHCF) interphase layer is in situ integrated on Zn by a rapid room&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry method to address these dilemmas. Different from currently proposed hydrophilic inorganic cases, the hydrophobic and compact HB&#8208;ZnHCF interphase effectively prevents the access of water molecules to Zn surface, thus avoiding H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. Moreover, the HB&#8208;ZnHCF with large internal ion channels, strong zincophilicity, and high Zn2+ transference number (0.86) permits fast Zn2+ transport and enables smooth Zn deposition. Remarkably, the resultant HB&#8208;ZnHCF@Zn electrode delivers unprecedented reversibility with 99.88&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency over 3000&#8197;cycles, realizes long&#8208;term cycling over 5800&#8197;h (&gt;8&#8197;months, 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and 1000&#8197;h (10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and assures the stable operation of full Zn battery with both coin&#8208; and pouch&#8208;type configurations.

         <title>Uncovering Dynamic Edge&#8208;Sites in Atomic Co&#8722;N&#8722;C Electrocatalyst for Selective Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A correlated in situ X&#8208;ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy study provides insight into the dynamics of the edge&#8208;sites in atomic Co&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction. Observation of adapted dynamic oxo adsorption and valence state shuttling between Co(2&#8722;&#948;)+ and Co2+ manifests the structural flexibility of unique edge&#8208;hosted atomic Co sites, in contrast to the rigid in&#8208;plane embedded Co1&#8722;Nx counterpart.







Abstract
Understanding the nature of single&#8208;atom catalytic sites and identifying their spectroscopic fingerprints are essential prerequisites for the rational design of target catalysts. Here, we apply correlated in situ X&#8208;ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy to probe the edge&#8208;site&#8208;specific chemistry of Co&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) operation. The unique edge&#8208;hosted architecture affords single&#8208;atom Co site remarkable structural flexibility with adapted dynamic oxo adsorption and valence state shuttling between Co(2&#8722;&#948;)+ and Co2+, in contrast to the rigid in&#8208;plane embedded Co1&#8722;Nx counterpart. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergistic interplay of in situ reconstructed Co1&#8722;N2&#8208;oxo with peripheral oxygen groups gives a rise to the near&#8208;optimal adsorption of *OOH intermediate and substantially increases the activation barrier for its dissociation, accounting for a robust acidic ORR activity and 2e&#8722; selectivity for H2O2 production.

         <title>Inside Cover: A Sustainable Wood&#8208;Based Iron Photocatalyst for Multiple Uses with Sunlight: Water Treatment and Radical Photopolymerization (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 27/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable photocatalyst comprising iron oxide and modified lignin provides a greener approach for material synthesis and finishes the job with wastewater cleaning using sunlight as a natural photon source. Monomers participating in radical photopolymerization enjoy these wonderful reaction conditions. The robust photocatalyst can be reused in several reaction cycles for wastewater cleaning, as reported by Bernd Strehmel, Zhijun Chen, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202301242).

A versatile noncovalent functionalization strategy has been developed for the large&#8208;scale preparation of aqueous processable high&#8208;quality semiconducting 2D triazine polymers. In their Research Article (e202301865), Yuxi Xu et&#8197;al. demonstrate that the obtained crystalline ultrathin 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can not only be assembled into ultralight and mechanically strong macroscopic porous aerogels, but also show a new surface molecule doping effect to significantly improve the photocatalytic water splitting activity.

Post&#8208;encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within small&#8208;pore zeolites has posed a significant challenge. In their Research Article (e202303503), Hae&#8197;Sung Cho, Jeong&#8208;Chul Kim, Changbum Jo, and co&#8208;workers showcase the effective utilization of 2&#8208;aminoethanethiol as a bi&#8208;grafting agent, resulting in the even distribution of uniform nanoparticles throughout a microporous zeolite matrix. Containment within the small micropores protected the nanoparticles against harsh thermal sintering and inhibited the fouling of the metal surface by coke.

         <title>Driving Polymer Brushes from Synthesis to Functioning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of facile and robust surface&#8208;initiated controlled radical polymerization strategies has encouraged researchers to fabricate well&#8208;defined polymer brushes under mild conditions. This review provides an overview of very recent advances in the architectural design of polymer brushes, which show new and very promising bioapplications such as biolubrication, antifouling and antibacterial coating, biosensing, and drug delivery.







Abstract
The great success of controlled radical polymerizations has encouraged researchers to develop more facile and robust approaches for surface&#8208;initiated polymerizations (SIPs) to fabricate polymer brushes, even for non&#8208;experts. In recent years, external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;mediated radical polymerization methods have come to the fore as SIPs because of their less rigorous synthetic procedures and high controllability, which expand the opportunities for synthesizing macromolecules with desired chemical compositions and structures, as well as tailor&#8208;made polymers and bioconjugates that show broad applicability and physiological compatibility. This review discusses the latest developments in surface&#8208;initiated polymerization methods, in particular, external&#8208;stimuli mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), photo&#8208;induced polymerizations, and reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, as well as other methods and their combination for the application in surface grafting. The implementation of these methods is of great interest due to their unique possibilities to temporally control a polymerization process, fast and straightforward polymerization, and environmentally benign features, which lead to established and emerging applications in biolubrication, antifouling, and biosensing.

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation and Recycling of Synthetic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve a circular polymer economy, it is desirable to convert polymers into monomers or useful building blocks. This Minireview summarizes recent developments on polymer degradation and recycling enabled by mechanochemistry.







Abstract
The accumulation of plastic waste, due to lack of recycling, has led to serious environmental pollution. Although mechanical recycling can alleviate this issue, it inevitably reduces the molecular weight and weakens the mechanical properties of materials and is not suitable for mixed materials. Chemical recycling, on the other hand, breaks the polymer into monomers or small&#8208;molecule constituents, allowing for the preparation of materials of quality comparable to that of the virgin polymers and can be applied to mixed materials. Mechanochemical degradation and recycling leverages the advantages of mechanical techniques, such as scalability and efficient energy use, to achieve chemical recycling. We summarize recent progress in mechanochemical degradation and recycling of synthetic polymers, including both commercial polymers and those designed for more efficient mechanochemical degradation. We also point out the limitations of mechanochemical degradation and present our perspectives on how the challenges can be mitigated for a circular polymer economy.

         <title>In Situ X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy of Metal/Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbons in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and then comprehensively review the setup and application of in situ XAS, introducing electrochemical XAS cells, experimental methods, as well as primary functions on catalytic applications. The active sites and the structural evolution of M&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction are discussed in detail.







Abstract
Metal/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons (M&#8722;N&#8722;C) are promising candidates as oxygen electrocatalysts due to their low cost, tunable catalytic activity and selectivity, and well&#8208;dispersed morphologies. To improve the electrocatalytic performance of such systems, it is critical to gain a detailed understanding of their structure and properties through advanced characterization. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) serves as a powerful tool to probe both the active sites and structural evolution of catalytic materials under reaction conditions. In this review, we firstly provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of XAS and then comprehensively review the setup and application of in situ XAS, introducing electrochemical XAS cells, experimental methods, as well as primary functions on catalytic applications. The active sites and the structural evolution of M&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction are subsequently discussed in detail. Finally, major challenges and future opportunities in this exciting field are highlighted.

         <title>Chiral Control of Gas&#8208;Phase Molecules using Microwave Pulses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in the area of chiral control using rotational spectroscopy are highlighted. Microwave three&#8208;wave mixing is a phase&#8208;sensitive technique for enantiodifferentiation; it is discussed here together with its extension to create coherent enantiomer&#8208;selective population enrichment. This scheme results in enantioselective enrichment in a chosen rotational state that holds interesting promises for advanced chirality experiments.







Abstract
Microwave three&#8208;wave mixing has emerged as a novel approach for studying chiral molecules in the gas phase. This technique employs resonant microwave pulses and is a non&#8208;linear and coherent approach. It serves as a robust method to differentiate between the enantiomers of chiral molecules and to determine the enantiomeric excess, even in complex chiral mixtures. Besides such analytical applications, the use of tailored microwave pulses allows us to control and manipulate chirality at the molecular level. Here, an overview of some recent developments in the area of microwave three&#8208;wave mixing and its extension to enantiomer&#8208;selective population transfer is provided. The latter is an important step towards enantiomer separation&#8212;in energy and finally in space. In the last section, we present new experimental results on how to improve enantiomer&#8208;selective population transfer to achieve an enantiomeric excess of about 40&#8201;% in the rotational level of interest using microwave pulses alone.

         <title>Outstanding Quadratic to Septic Optical Nonlinearity at Dipolar Alkynylmetal&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Alkynylruthenium&#8208;15&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;functionalized nickel porphyrins exhibit record quadratic optical nonlinearities and outstanding two&#8208;, three&#8208;, and four&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;sections. The key optical transitions have been analyzed and their impact on the quadratic to septic nonlinearities has been suggested.







Abstract
Porphyrins are important macrocycles with applications in several areas including therapy, catalysis, and sensing. Strong nonlinear optical (NLO) responses are the key to fully exploiting the potential of these biocompatible molecules. We herein report that certain metal&#8208;alkynyl donor/nitro acceptor&#8208;functionalized porphyrins are attractive candidates for NLO applications. We show that specific examples exhibit record quadratic optical nonlinearity, exceptional two&#8208;photon absorption, and outstanding three&#8208;photon absorption, and we report the first porphyrins that exhibit four&#8208;photon absorption. The two&#8208;, three&#8208;, and four&#8208;photon absorption maxima are found at the corresponding multiples of linear absorption bands that time&#8208;dependent density functional theory assigns as admixtures of porphyrin&#8208;localized &#960;*&#8592;&#960; and donor&#8208;porphyrin to porphyrin&#8208;acceptor charge&#8208;transfer transitions.

         <title>BN&#8208;Butafulvenes and Their Application in the Synthesis of Highly Substituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
BN&#8208;butafulvenes have been synthesized from the reaction of bis(alkynyl)boranes with an uranacyclopropene complex. On the other hand, DMAP&#8208;coordinated BN&#8208;butafulvenes underwent structural rearrangement under thermal conditions, affording 1,2,4,6&#8208;multisubstituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalene products.







Abstract
BN&#8208;butafulvenes, mono&#8208;BN isosteres of butafulvene and highly strained isomers of azaborines and B&#8208;amino boroles, have been synthesized via hydrolysis of the urana&#8208;borabicyclic complexes obtained from the reactions of bis(alkynyl)boranes with an uranacyclopropene complex. Their 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) adducts can further isomerize to 1,2,4,6&#8208;multisubstituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalenes. Both NMR reaction monitoring and theoretical calculations point to a reaction mechanism involving dearomative insertion of DMAP followed by two consecutive 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shifts. The photophysical studies of the highly substituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalenes reveal a notable redshift in both the UV/Vis absorption and emission spectra. The (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations corroborate the experimental data, suggesting that the strong &#960;&#8208;donating amino substitution at the 1&#8208; and/or 6&#8208;positions destabilizes the HOMO, and thus leading to a notable decrease of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Labeling of Hydroxyindoles with Chemoselectivity (PhotoCLIC) for Site&#8208;Specific Protein Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;catalyzed bioconjugation reaction, PhotoCLIC, has been developed for chemoselective attachment of aromatic amines onto a 5&#8208;hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) residue site&#8208;specifically preinstalled in a full&#8208;length protein using genetic code expansion technology. PhotoCLIC has a wide substrate scope and is compatible with the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition to enable site&#8208;specific dual&#8208;labeling of target proteins.







Abstract
We have developed a novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;catalyzed bioconjugation reaction, PhotoCLIC, that enables chemoselective attachment of diverse aromatic amine reagents onto a site&#8208;specifically installed 5&#8208;hydroxytryptophan residue (5HTP) on full&#8208;length proteins of varied complexity. The reaction uses catalytic amounts of methylene blue and blue/red light&#8208;emitting diodes (455/650&#8197;nm) for rapid site&#8208;specific protein bioconjugation. Characterization of the PhotoCLIC product reveals a unique structure formed likely through a singlet oxygen&#8208;dependent modification of 5HTP. PhotoCLIC has a wide substrate scope and its compatibility with strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click reaction, enables site&#8208;specific dual&#8208;labeling of a target protein.

         <title>Hyperpolarized 13C&#8197;NMR Spectroscopy of Urine Samples at Natural Abundance by Quantitative Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarized 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization provides a rich and resolved 13C metabolic profile on urine samples at natural abundance while retaining precious quantitative information using a standard addition workflow.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) offers an ensemble of methods that remarkably address the sensitivity issues of conventional NMR. Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (d&#8208;DNP) provides a unique and general way to detect 13C&#8197;NMR signals with a sensitivity enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The expanding application scope of d&#8208;DNP now encompasses the analysis of complex mixtures at natural 13C abundance. However, the application of d&#8208;DNP in this area has been limited to metabolite extracts. Here, we report the first d&#8208;DNP&#8208;enhanced 13C&#8197;NMR analysis of a biofluid &#8208;urine&#8208; at natural abundance, offering unprecedented resolution and sensitivity for this challenging type of sample. We also show that accurate quantitative information on multiple targeted metabolites can be retrieved through a standard addition procedure.

         <title>High&#8208;Current Capable and Non&#8208;Flammable Protic Organic Electrolyte for Rechargeable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The protic amide solvent N&#8208;methyl formamide (NMF) is adopted to prepare a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte for Zn anodes, resulting in an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 2000&#8197;h at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/2.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high coulombic efficiency of 99.57&#8201;%, wide electrochemical window (&#8776;3.43&#8197;V), and outstanding durability up to 10.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which might accelerate the development of safe and long cycle&#8208;life rechargeable zinc batteries (RZBs).







Abstract
Rechargeable Zinc batteries (RZBs) are considered a potent competitor for next&#8208;generation electrochemical devices, due to their multiple advantages. Nevertheless, traditional aqueous electrolytes may cause serious hazards to long&#8208;term battery cycling through fast capacity fading and poor Coulombic efficiency (CE), which happens due to complex reaction kinetics in aqueous systems. Herein, we proposed the novel adoption of the protic amide solvent, N&#8208;methyl formamide (NMF) as a Zinc battery electrolyte, which possesses a high dielectric constant and high flash point to promote fast kinetics and battery safety simultaneously. Dendrite&#8208;free and granular Zn deposition in Zn&#8208;NMF electrolyte assures ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 2000&#8197;h at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/2.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high CE of 99.57&#8201;%, wide electrochemical window (&#8776;3.43&#8197;V vs. Zn2+/Zn), and outstanding durability up to 10.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work sheds light on the efficient performance of the protic non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte, which will open new opportunities to promote safe and energy&#8208;dense RZBs.

         <title>Diastereomer Resolution of M4L6 Coordination Cages by Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Resolution Ion&#8208;Mobility Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomeric coordination cages are separated and individually investigated using ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry. Alongside iron(II), supramolecular species containing cobalt(II) and nickel(II) were also investigated, successfully demonstrating a new approach for the investigation of paramagnetic complexes.







Abstract
Coordination cages can be used for enantio&#8208; and regioselective catalysis and for the selective sensing and separation of isomeric guest molecules. Here, stereoisomers of a family of coordination cages are resolved using ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution cyclic ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry (cIM&#8208;MS). The observed ratio of diastereomers is dependent on both the metal ion and counter ion. Moreover, the point groups can be assigned through complementary NMR experiments. This method enables the identification and interrogation of the individual isomers in complex mixtures of cages which cannot be performed in solution. Furthermore, these techniques allow the stability of individual isomers within the mixture to be probed, with the T&#8208;symmetric isomers in this case shown to be more robust than the C3 and S4 analogues.

         <title>Spiroligomer&#8208;Based Macrocycles for Atomically Precise Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangular peptidomimetic macrocycles were synthesized by cyclizing highly structured spiroligomers. They were assembled into nanofilms with atomically precise pores defined by their programmable three&#8208;dimensional structures. This study demonstrates the size and shape&#8208;dependent molecular sieving with macrocycle membranes. The structural stability and diversity of spiroligomer&#8208;based macrocycles make them promising candidates for various applications.







Abstract
Here, we report a new class of peptidomimetic macrocycles with well&#8208;defined three&#8208;dimensional structures and low conformational flexibility. They are assembled from fused&#8208;ring spiro&#8208;ladder oligomers (spiroligomers) by modular solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Two&#8208;dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance confirms their shape persistency. Triangular macrocycles of tunable sizes assemble into membranes with atomically precise pores, which exhibit size and shape&#8208;dependent molecular sieving towards a series of structurally similar compounds. The exceptional structural diversity and stability of spiroligomer&#8208;based macrocycles will be explored for more applications.

         <title>Regiodivergent C&#8722;H Acylation of Arenes by Switching from Ionic&#8208; to Radical&#8208;Type Chemistry Using NHC Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent benzoylation of 2&#8208;methoxynaphthalene with benzoyl fluoride is presented using either Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type chemistry to give selectively the 1&#8208;isomer or cooperative NHC/photoredox catalysis to afford the 4&#8208;isomer exclusively. Along with arenes, regiodivergent aroylation also works for heteroarenes.







Abstract
The Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation reaction, which belongs to the class of electrophilic aromatic substitutions is a highly valuable and versatile reaction in synthesis. Regioselectivity is predictable and determined by electronic as well as steric factors of the (hetero)arene substrate. Herein, a radical approach for the acylation of arenes and heteroarenes is presented. C&#8722;H acylation is achieved through mild cooperative photoredox/NHC radical catalysis with the cross&#8208;coupling of an arene radical cation with an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical as a key step. As compared to the classical Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation, a regiodivergent outcome is observed upon switching from the ionic to the radical mode. In these divergent reactions, aroyl fluorides act as the acylation reagents in both the ionic as well as the radical process.

         <title>Carboxylation of Acetylene without Salt Waste: Green Synthesis of C4 Chemicals Enabled by a CO2&#8208;Pressure Induced Acidity Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof of concept for a salt waste free carboxylation of acetylene was achieved with the help of a CO2&#8208;pressure dependent pH&#8208;switch. The base can be regenerated for another reaction cycle without loss of activity. This concept enables the synthesis of C4&#8208;platform chemicals such as dimethyl succinate from biogas (CH4+CO2) and hydrogen. Thermodynamic predictions with ePC&#8208;SAFT allowed to model the acidity switch and reaction conditions.







Abstract
The inherent formation of salt waste in C&#8722;H carboxylations is a key obstacle precluding the utilization of CO2 as C1 building block in the industrial synthesis of base chemicals. This challenge is addressed in a circular process for the production of the C4 base chemical dimethyl succinate from CO2 and acetylene. At moderate CO2 pressures, acetylene is doubly carboxylated in the presence of cesium carbonate. Hydrogenation of the C&#8722;C triple bond stabilizes the product against decarboxylation. By increasing the CO2 pressure to 70&#8197;bar, the medium is reversibly acidified, allowing an esterification of the succinate salt with methanol. The cesium base and the hydrogenation catalyst are regenerated and can be reused. This provides the proof of concept for a salt&#8208;free route to C4 chemicals from biogas (CH4/CO2). The origin of this reversible acidity switch and the critical roles of the cesium base and the NMP/MeOH solvents were elucidated by thermodynamic modeling.

         <title>Appealing sheath&#8208;core spun high&#8208;performance composite carbon molecular sieve membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost composite hollow fiber membranes (Matrimid&#174; as core layer and 6FDA&#8208;DAM as sheath layer) were spun with intrinsic O2/N2 selectivity greater than 2.1. High performance carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes were obtained by tuning the pyrolysis temperature. It indicates some defects from the precursor can be eliminated by higher pyrolysis temperature. More porous support layer was desired to achieve high permeability CMS.







Abstract
Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes are attractive candidates to meet requirements for challenging gas separations. The added ability to maintain such intrinsic properties in an asymmetric morphology with a structure that we term a &#8220;Pseudo Wheel+Hub &amp; Spoke&#8221; asymmetric form offers new opportunities. For CMS membrane, specifically, the structure provides both selective layer support and low flow resistance even for high feed pressures and fluxes in CO2 removal from natural gas. This capability is unavailable to even rigid glassy polymers due to the much higher modulus of CMS materials. Combining precursor asymmetric hollow fiber formation and optimized pyrolysis creates a defect free CMS proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept membrane for this application. Facile formation of the sheath&#8208;core spun precursor with a 6FDA&#8208;DAM sheath and Matrimid&#174; core also avoids the need to seal defects before or after the carbonization of the precursors. The composite CMS membrane shows CO2/CH4 (50&#8201;:&#8201;50) mixed gas feed with an attractive CO2/CH4 selectivity of 64.3 and CO2 permeance of 232&#8197;GPU at 35&#8201;&#176;C. A key additional benefit of the approach is reduction in use of the more costly high performance 6FDA&#8208;DAM in a composite sheath&#8208;core CMS membrane with the &#8220;Pseudo Wheel+Hub &amp; Spoke&#8221; structure.

         <title>Piezochromism in Dynamic Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching chromophores are prepared. For first time they are used to study piezochromism under mechanical stimuli by the diamond anvil cell technique.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials with pressure&#8208;dependent photoluminescence tuning properties are important in many fields, such as mechanical sensors, security papers, and storage devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as an emerging class of crystalline porous materials (CPMs) with structural dynamics and tunable photophysical properties, are suitable for designing piezochromic materials, but there are few related studies. Herein, we report two dynamic three&#8208;dimensional COFs based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) chromophores, termed JUC&#8208;635 and JUC&#8208;636 (JUC=Jilin University China), and for the first time, study their piezochromic behavior by diamond anvil cell technique. Due to the various luminescent groups, JUC&#8208;635 has completely different solvatochromism and molecular aggregation behavior in the solvents. More importantly, JUC&#8208;635 with AIE effect exhibits a sustained fluorescence upon pressure increase (&#8776;3&#8197;GPa), and reversible sensitivity with high&#8208;contrast emission differences (&#916;&#955;em=187&#8197;nm) up to 12&#8197;GPa, superior to other CPMs reported so far. Therefore, this study will open a new gate to expand the potential applications of COFs as exceptional piezochromic materials in pressure sensing, barcoding, and signal switching.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Self&#8208;sorting in Molecular and Polymeric Architectures Enabled by Spiroborate Bond Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiroborate metathesis has been demonstrated using a small molecule model reaction involving spiroborate&#8208;linked well&#8208;defined polymeric and molecular architectures. The spiroborate bond exchange driven by dynamic covalent self&#8208;sorting led to scrambling between a macrocycle and a 1D helical covalent polymer through formation of a molecular cage, with all structures unambiguously elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Self&#8208;sorting is commonly observed in complex reaction systems, which has been utilized to guide the formation of single major by&#8208;design molecules. However, most studies have been focused on non&#8208;covalent systems, and using self&#8208;sorting to achieve covalently bonded architectures is still relatively less explored. Herein, we first demonstrated the dynamic nature of spiroborate linkage and systematically studied the self&#8208;sorting behavior observed in the transformation between spiroborate&#8208;linked well&#8208;defined polymeric and molecular architectures, which is enabled by spiroborate bond exchange. The scrambling between a macrocycle and a 1D helical covalent polymer led to the formation of a molecular cage, whose structures are all unambiguously elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The results indicate that the molecular cage is the thermodynamically favored product in this multi&#8208;component reaction system. This work represents the first example of a 1D polymeric architecture transforming into a shape&#8208;persistent molecular cage, driven by dynamic covalent self&#8208;sorting. This study will further guide the design of spiroborate&#8208;based materials and open the possibilities for the development of novel complex yet responsive dynamic covalent molecular or polymeric systems.

&lt;p&gt;Spiroborate metathesis has been demonstrated using a small molecule model reaction involving spiroborate-linked well-defined polymeric and molecular architectures. The spiroborate bond exchange driven by dynamic covalent self-sorting led to scrambling between a macrocycle and a 1D helical covalent polymer through formation of a molecular cage, with all structures unambiguously elucidated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

         <title>Atroposelective Silylation of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diols by a Chiral Counteranion Directed Desymmetrization Enhanced by a Subsequent Kinetic Resolution</title>

         <dc:description>
An enantioselective silylation of biaryl diols is achieved with a silylium&#8208;ion&#8208;like silicon electrophile paired with a List&#8208;type imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi). The initial enantioinduction of the desymmetrization is further enhanced by a downstream kinetic resolution that kinetically selects the monosilylated minor enantiomer to form the corresponding bissilylated diol (see Scheme; TBS=tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl).







Abstract
A desymmetrizing silylation of aromatic diols is reported. The previously unknown asymmetric silyl ether formation of phenol derivatives is achieved by applying List's counteranion directed silylation technique. A silylium&#8208;ion&#8208;like silicon electrophile generated from an allylic silane paired with an imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi) enables enantioselective discrimination of achiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diols. The enantioselectivity of that desymmetrization is further improved by a downstream kinetic resolution, converting the monosilylated minor enantiomer into the corresponding, again achiral bissilylated diol.

         <title>Diastereoselective Biomimetic Synthesis of Dimeric Tetrahydrocarbazoles via a Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization&#8208;[3+2] Cyclodimerization Cascade</title>

Discovery and development of a CuII&#8208;catalyzed, diastereoselective, biomimetic cycloisomerization&#8208;[3+2] cyclodimerization of 1&#8208;(indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ols to access structurally unprecedented dimeric&#8208;tetrahydrocarbazoles is reported. Control experiments, isolation of monomer intermediates and their conversion into cyclodimerized products delineated the dimerization as being either homochiral or heterochiral [3+2] annulation of in situ generated monomers.







Abstract
The cyclodimerization (homochiral&#8208; and heterochiral&#8722;) of monomeric units for the construction of stereodefined polycyclic systems is a powerful strategy in both biosynthesis and biomimetic synthesis. Herein we have discovered and developed a CuII&#8208; catalyzed, biomimetic, diastereoselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;[3+2] cyclodimerization of 1&#8208;(indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ol. This novel strategy operates under very mild conditions, providing access to structurally unprecedented dimeric tetrahydrocarbazoles fused to a tetrahydrofuran unit in excellent yields of the products. Several fruitful control experiments, isolation of the monomeric&#8208;cycloisomerized products and their subsequent conversion into the corresponding cyclodimeric products supported their intermediacy and the possible mechanism as a cycloisomerization&#8208;diastereoselective [3+2] cyclodimerization cascade. The cyclodimerization involves a substituent controlled, highly diastereoselective homochiral [3+2] annulation or heterochiral [3+2] annulation of in situ generated 3&#8208;hydroxytetrahydrocarbazoles. The key and important features of this strategy are: a) construction of three new C&#8722;C bonds &amp; one new C&#8722;O bond; b) creation of two new stereocenters, and c) construction of three new rings, in a single operation; d) low catalyst loading (1&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;%); e) 100&#8201;% atom economy; and f) rapid construction of structurally unprecedented natural product like polycyclic frameworks. A chiral pool version using an enantio&#8208; and diastereopure substrate was also demonstrated.

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nitride Additive: A Drop&#8208;in Solution for Lithium/Garnet Wetting in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>

Powder&#8208;form Mg3N2 offers a drop&#8208;in solution to improve lithium metal anode/garnet oxide electrolyte wetting and to suppress dynamic de&#8208;wetting in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. The concept of reactive dispersion&#8208;plus&#8208;wetting can be applied to the design and processing of other solid&#8208;state materials and devices.







Abstract
Garnet oxides such as Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) are promising solid electrolyte materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries because of high ionic conductivity, low electronic leakage, and wide electrochemical stability window. While LLZTO has been frequently discussed to be stable against lithium metal anode, it is challenging to achieve and maintain good solid&#8208;on&#8208;solid wetting at the metal/ceramic interface in both processing and extended electrochemical cycling. Here we address the challenge by a powder&#8208;form magnesium nitride additive, which reacts with the lithium metal anode to produce well&#8208;dispersed lithium nitride. The in situ formed lithium nitride promotes reactive wetting at the Li/LLZTO interface, which lowers interfacial resistance, increases critical current density (CCD), and improves cycling stability of the electrochemical cells. The additive recipe has been diversified to titanium nitride, zirconium nitride, tantalum nitride, and niobium nitride, thus supporting the general concept of reactive dispersion&#8208;plus&#8208;wetting. Such a design can be extended to other solid&#8208;state devices for better functioning and extended cycle life.

         <title>Methane Carboxylation Using Electrochemically Activated Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct synthesis of CH3COOH from CH4 and CO2 is made possible. The process first activates CO2 by electrochemistry, producing CO and O2. It is followed by oxidative CH4 carbonylation catalyzed by Rh single atom catalysts. The net result is CH4 carboxylation with 100&#8201;% atom economy.







Abstract
Direct synthesis of CH3COOH from CH4 and CO2 is an appealing approach for the utilization of two potent greenhouse gases that are notoriously difficult to activate. In this Communication, we report an integrated route to enable this reaction. Recognizing the thermodynamic stability of CO2, our strategy sought to first activate CO2 to produce CO (through electrochemical CO2 reduction) and O2 (through water oxidation), followed by oxidative CH4 carbonylation catalyzed by Rh single atom catalysts supported on zeolite. The net result was CH4 carboxylation with 100&#8201;% atom economy. CH3COOH was obtained at a high selectivity (&gt;80&#8201;%) and good yield (ca. 3.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1cat in 3&#8197;h). Isotope labelling experiments confirmed that CH3COOH is produced through the coupling of CH4 and CO2. This work represents the first successful integration of CO/O2 production with oxidative carbonylation reaction. The result is expected to inspire more carboxylation reactions utilizing preactivated CO2 that take advantage of both products from the reduction and oxidation processes, thus achieving high atom efficiency in the synthesis.

Recognizing the thermodynamic stability of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, our strategy sought to first activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce CO (through electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction) and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (through water oxidation), followed by oxidative CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; carbonylation catalyzed by Rh single atom catalysts supported on zeolite. The net result was CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; carboxylation with 100&#8201;% atom economy. CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH was obtained at a high selectivity (&amp;gt;80&#8201;%) and good yield (&lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 3.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; in 3&#8197;h). Isotope labelling experiments confirmed that CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH is produced through the coupling of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This work represents the first successful integration of CO/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production with oxidative carbonylation reaction. The result is expected to inspire more carboxylation reactions utilizing preactivated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that take advantage of both products from the reduction and oxidation processes, thus achieving high atom efficiency in the synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Linear Adsorption Enables NO Selective Electroreduction to Hydroxylamine on Single Co Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 27, July 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and Co nanoparticles (Co NPs) were reported for the selective electroreduction of NO to NH2OH and NH3 by regulating the adsorption configuration of NO. The linear adsorption of NO on Co SACs could maintain the N&#8722;O bond in the hydrogenation process to generate NH2OH, while the bridge adsorption of NO on Co NPs would weaken the N&#8722;O bond, leading to the breaking of the N&#8722;O bond to produce ammonia.







Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH), a vital industrial feedstock, is presently synthesized under harsh conditions with serious environmental and energy concerns. Electrocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) reduction is attractive for the production of hydroxylamine under ambient conditions. However, hydroxylamine selectivity is limited by the competitive reaction of ammonia production. Herein, we regulate the adsorption configuration of NO by adjusting the atomic structure of catalysts to control the product selectivity. Co single&#8208;atom catalysts show state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH2OH selectivity from NO electroreduction under neutral conditions (FE
: 81.3&#8201;%), while Co nanoparticles are inclined to generate ammonia (FE
: 92.3&#8201;%). A series of in situ characterizations and theoretical simulations unveil that linear adsorption of NO on isolated Co sites enables hydroxylamine formation and bridge adsorption of NO on adjacent Co sites induces the production of ammonia.

         <title>Titanium Salalen Catalyzed Enantioselective Benzylic Hydroxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The titanium complex of the cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH) derived Berkessel&#8208;salalen ligand is a highly efficient and enantioselective catalyst for the asymmetric epoxidation of terminal olefins with hydrogen peroxide ("Berkessel&#8208;Katsuki catalyst"). We herein report that this epoxidation catalyst also effects the highly enantioselective hydroxylation of benzylic C&#8208;H bonds with hydrogen peroxide. Mechanism&#8208;based ligand optimization identified a novel nitro&#8208;salalen Ti&#8208;catalyst of the highest efficiency ever reported for asymmetric catalytic benzylic hydroxylation, with enantioselectivities of up to 98% ee, while overoxidation to ketone is marginal. The novel nitro&#8208;salalen Ti&#8208;catalyst also shows enhanced epoxidation ef&#173;ficiency, as evidenced by e.g. the conversion of 1&#8208;decene to its ep&#173;oxide in 90% yield with 94% ee, at a catalyst loading of 0.1 mol&#8208;% only.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond Reduction Cocatalysts: Critical Role of Metal Cocatalysts in Photocatalytic Oxidation of Methane with Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Environmentally sustainable and selective conversion of methane to valuable chemicals under ambient conditions is pivotal for the development of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic technology. However, due to the lack of microscopic knowledge about non&#8208;thermal methane conversion, controlling and modulating photocatalytic oxidation processes driven by photogenerated holes remain a challenge. Here, we report novel function of metal cocatalysts to accept photogenerated holes and dominate selectivity of methane oxidation, which is clearly beyond the conventional concept in photocatalysis that the metal cocatalysts loaded on the surfaces of semiconductor photocatalysts mostly capture photogenerated electrons and dominate reduction reactions exclusively. The novel photocatalytic role of metal cocatalysts was verified by operando molecular spectroscopy combined with real&#8208;time mass spectrometry for metal&#8208;loaded Ga2O3 model photocatalysts under methane and water vapor at ambient temperature and pressure.&#160;Our concept of metal cocatalysts that work as active sites for both photocatalytic oxidation and reduction provides a new understanding of photocatalysis and a solid basis for controlling non&#8208;thermal redox reactions by metal&#8208;cocatalyst engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>ATP Drives the Formation of a Catalytic Hydrazone through an Energy Ratchet Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An energy ratchet mechanism is exploited for the synthesis of a molecule. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), hydrazone&#8208;bond formation between an aldehyde and hydrazide is accelerated and the composition at thermodynamic equilibrium is shifted towards the hydrazone. Enzymatic hydrolysis of ATP installs a kinetically stable state at which hydrazone is present at a higher concentration compared to the composition at thermodynamic equilibrium in the presence of the degradation products of ATP. It is shown that the kinetic state has an enhanced catalytic activity in the hydrolysis of an RNA&#8208;model compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Ferrocene 1,3&#8722;Derivatives by Distal C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The third position of cyclopentadienyl ring of a monosubstituted ferrocene has remained as an inaccessible chemical space for direct functionalization. Until recently, functionalizing the C(3)&#8208;position while bypassing the predominantly active C(2)&#8208;position is the most challenging task. Herein, we report a distal C&#8722;H functionalization of monosubstituted ferrocenes using an easily removable directing group with precise site&#8208;selectivity, under a Pd(II)/ mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected amino&#8208;acid ligand catalytic system. The robust synthetic protocol leads to the synthesis of ferrocene 1,3&#8208;derivatives with broad scope in olefins while functionalizing ferrocenyl methylamine in moderate to good yields via a highly strained ferrocene appended 12&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivated DNA Assembly and Disassembly for On&#8208;Demand Activation and Termination of cGAS&#8208;STING Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite significant progress in DNA self&#8208;assembly for interfacing with biology, spatiotemporally controlled regulation of biological process via in situ dynamic DNA assembly remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we report an optically triggered DNA assembly and disassembly strategy that enables on&#8208;demand activation and termination of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway. In the design, an activatable DNA hairpin is engineered with a photocleavable group at defined site to modulate its self&#8208;assembly activity. Light activation induces the configurational switching and consequent self&#8208;assembly of the DNA hairpins to form long linear double&#8208;stranded structures, allowing to stimulate cGAS protein to synthesize 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) for STING stimulation. Furthermore, by endowing the pre&#8208;assembled DNA scaffold with a built&#8208;in photolysis feature, we demonstrate that the cGAS&#8208;STING stimulation can be efficiently terminated through remote photo&#8208;triggering, providing for the first time a route to control the temporal &#8216;&#8216;dose&#8217;&#8217; on&#8208;demand for such a stimulation. We envision that this regulation&#160;strategy will benefit and inspire both fundamental research and therapeutic applications regarding the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Monodisperse Adducts&#8208;Induced Homogeneous Nucleation Towards High&#8208;Quality Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The classic solvent system can't sufficiently separate one&#8208;dimensional edge&#8208;sharing SnI2 crystals in solution, which severely restricts the fabrication of high&#8208;quality tin&#8208;based perovskite film. Herein, a strong Lewis base (hexamethylphosphoramide, HMPA) has been introduced to coordinate Sn2+ to modulate solvation behaviors on perovskite precursor and regulate crystallization kinetics. The large molecular volume of HMPA and stronger bind energy of SnI2&#183;2HMPA (&#8722;0.595 eV vs &#8722;0.118 eV for SnI2&#183;2DMSO) change the solvation structure of SnI2 from edge&#8208;sharing cluster to monodisperse adduct, which contributes to uniform nucleation sites and prolongs crystal growth process. Delightfully, a fully&#8208;covered perovskite film is formed on the large&#8208;area substrate and tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells processed with HMPA exhibit an excellent efficiency of 13.46%. This research provides novel insights and directions for the solution preparation of smooth and uniform large&#8208;area tin&#8208;based perovskite film.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Activation Coupling with Schottky Junction Boosts Electrochemiluminescence of Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Robust electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of carbon nitride (CN) requires efficient electron&#8208;hole recombination and suppression of electrode passivation. In this work, Au nanoparticles and single atoms (AuSA+NP) loaded on CN serve as dual active sites that significantly accelerate charge transfer and activate peroxydisulfate. Meanwhile, the well&#8208;established Schottky junctions between Au NPs and CN act as electron sinks, effectively trapping over&#8208;injected electrons to prevent electrode passivation. As a result, the porous CN modified with AuSA+NP exhibits enhanced and stable ECL emission, with a minimal relative standard deviation of 0.24%. Furthermore, the designed ECL biosensor based on AuSA+NP&#8208;CN shows remarkable performance in detecting organophosphorus pesticides. This innovative strategy has the potential to offer new insights into strong and stable ECL emission for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Catalytic Difluorocarbene Transfer via Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive difluorocarbene transfer reaction that tames difluorocarbene to couple with two electrophiles has been developed, representing a new mode of difluorocarbene transfer reaction. The approach uses low&#8208;cost and bulk industrial chemical chlorodifluoromethane (ClCF2H) as the difluorocarbene precursor. It produces a variety of difluoromethylated (hetero)arenes from widely available aryl halides/triflates and proton sources, featuring high functional group tolerance and synthetic convenience without preparing organometallic reagents. Experimental mechanistic studies reveal that an unexpected Pd(0/II) catalytic cycle is involved in this reductive reaction, wherein the oxidative addition of palladium(0) difluorocarbene ([Pd0(Ln)]=CF2) with aryl electrophile to generate the key intermediate aryldifluoromethylpalladium [ArCF2Pd(Ln)X], followed by reaction with hydroquinone, is responsible for the reductive difluorocarbene transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Bridge on Buried Interface for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is significantly important for charge transfer and device stability, while the buried interface with the impact on perovskite film growth has been paid less attention. Herein, we use a molecular modifier,   glycocyamine (GDA) to build a molecular bridge on the buried interface of SnO2/perovskite, resulting in superior interfacial contact. This is achieved through the strongly interaction between GDA and SnO2, which also appreciably modulates the energy level. Moreover, GDA can regulate the perovskite crystal growth, yielding perovskite film with enlarged grain size and absence of pinholes, exhibiting substantially reduced defect density. Consequently, PSCs with GDA modification demonstrate significant improvement of open circuit voltage (close to 1.2 V) and fill factor, leading to an improved power conversion efficiency from 22.60% to 24.70%. Additionally, stabilities of GDA devices under maximum power point and 85 &#176;C heat are both perform better than the control devices.</dc:description>
