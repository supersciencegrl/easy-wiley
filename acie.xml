         <title>A GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist for Guiding MOF Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a new framework integrating the AI model GPT&#8208;4 into the iterative process of reticular chemistry experimentation, leveraging a cooperative workflow of interaction between AI and a human researcher. This GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist is an integrated system composed of three phases. Each of these utilizes GPT&#8208;4 in various capacities, wherein GPT&#8208;4 provides detailed instructions for chemical experimentation and the human provides feedback on the experimental outcomes, including both success and failures, for the in&#8208;context learning of AI in the next iteration. This iterative human&#8208;AI interaction enabled GPT&#8208;4 to learn from the outcomes, much like an experienced chemist, by a prompt&#8208;learning strategy. Importantly, the system is based on natural language for both development and operation, eliminating the need for coding skills, and thus, make it accessible to all chemists. Our collaboration with GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist guided the discovery of an isoreticular series of MOFs, with each synthesis fine&#8208;tuned through iterative feedback and expert suggestions. This workflow presents a potential for broader applications in scientific research by harnessing the capability of large language models like GPT&#8208;4 to enhance the feasibility and efficiency of research activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Activation Triggered by Cu&#8722;Co Double&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Silane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance catalysts sufficient to significantly reduce the energy barrier of water activation are crucial in facilitating reactions that are restricted by water dissociation. Herein we present a Cu&#8722;Co double&#8208;atom (CuCo&#8208;DAC) catalyst, which possesses a uniform and well&#8208;defined CuCoN6(OH) structure, and works together to promote water activation in silane oxidation. The catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance far exceeding that of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SAC). Various functional silanes are converted into silanols with up to 98% yield and 99% selectivity. Kinetic studies show that the activation energy of silane oxidation by CuCo&#8208;DAC is significantly lower than that of Cu&#8208;SAC and Co&#8208;SAC. Theoretical calculations demonstrate two different reaction pathways where water splitting is the rate&#8208;determining step and it is accelerated by CuCo&#8208;DAC, whereas H2 formation is key for its single&#8208;atom counterpart.</dc:description>

         <title>Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Multifunctional Solid Electrolyte Interphase Layers for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing a stable and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for achieving dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, maintaining the integrity of SEI during prolonged cycle life under high current densities poses a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an integrated multifunctional SEI layer with inorganic/organic hybrid construction (IOHL&#8208;Na) to enhance the durability of sodium metal anodes during reduplicative plating/stripping processes. The inorganic components with high mechanical strength and strong sodiophilicity demonstrate optimized ionic conduction efficiency and dendrite inhibition ability. Simultaneously, the organic component contributes to the formation of a dense and elastic membrane structure, preventing fracture and delamination issues during volume fluctuations. The symmetrical batteries of IOHL&#8208;Na achieve stable cycling over 2000 hours with an extremely low voltage hysteresis of around 15.8 mV at a high current density of 4 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the Na&#8208;O2 batteries sustain exceptional long&#8208;term stability and impressive capacity retention, exploiting a promising approach for constructing durable SEI and dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Superstructure&#8208;Induced Hierarchical Assemblies for Nanoconfined Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most attempts to synthesize supramolecular nanosystems are limited to a single mechanism, often resulting in the formation of nanomaterials that lack diversity in properties. Herein, hierarchical assemblies with appropriate variety are fabricated in bulk via a superstructure&#8208;induced organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid strategy. The dynamic balance between substructures and superstructures is managed using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as dual building blocks to regulate the performances of hierarchical assemblies. Significantly, the superstructures resulting from the controlled cascade between COFs and MOFs create highly active photocatalytic systems through multiple topologies. Our designed tandem photocatalysis can precisely and efficiently regulate the conversion rates of bioactive molecules (benzo[d]imidazoles) via competing redox pathways. Furthermore, benzo[d]imidazoles catalyzed by such supramolecular nanosystems are afforded in isolated yields ranging from 70% to 93% within tens of minutes. The multilayered structural states within the supramolecular systems demonstrate the importance of hierarchical assemblies in facilitating photocatalytic propagation and expanding the structural repertoire of supramolecular hybrids.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Enzymes for Environmental Sustainability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how engineered enzymes have been developed and implemented to help address environmental challenges. Topics include the use of engineered enzymes for improving carbon capture and utilisation, bioremediation, plastic deconstruction, and renewable feedstock generation. Successes, challenges, and opportunities for future enzyme engineering campaigns to improve environmental sustainability are discussed.







Abstract
The development and implementation of sustainable catalytic technologies is key to delivering our net&#8208;zero targets. Here we review how engineered enzymes, with a focus on those developed using directed evolution, can be deployed to improve the sustainability of numerous processes and help to conserve our environment. Efficient and robust biocatalysts have been engineered to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) and have been embedded into new efficient metabolic CO2 fixation pathways. Enzymes have been refined for bioremediation, enhancing their ability to degrade toxic and harmful pollutants. Biocatalytic recycling is gaining momentum, with engineered cutinases and PETases developed for the depolymerization of the abundant plastic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Finally, biocatalytic approaches for accessing petroleum&#8208;based feedstocks and chemicals are expanding, using optimized enzymes to convert plant biomass into biofuels or other high value products. Through these examples, we hope to illustrate how enzyme engineering and biocatalysis can contribute to the development of cleaner and more efficient chemical industry.

         <title>Bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylenes: Facile Synthesis via Radical&#8208;Mediated Coupling Reactions and their Distinctive Electronic Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four ribbon&#8208;like bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylene molecules were synthesized by intermolecular or intramolecular radical&#8208;mediated coupling reactions. They show electronic structures resembling the typical pyrenacenes rather than quinoidal rylenes, with localized aromatic benzenoid rings along the central long axis.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a one&#8208;dimensional (1D), ribbon&#8208;like structure have the potential to serve as both model compounds for corresponding graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and as materials for optoelectronics applications. However, synthesizing molecules of this type with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation presents a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthetic method for a series of bis&#8208;peri&#8208;dinaphtho&#8208;rylene molecules, wherein the peri&#8208;positions of perylene, quaterrylene, and hexarylene are fused with naphtho&#8208;units. These molecules were efficiently synthesized primarily through intramolecular or intermolecular radical coupling of in situ generated organic radical species. Their structures were confirmed using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which also revealed a slightly bent geometry due to the incorporation of a cyclopentadiene ring at the bay regions of the rylene backbones. Bond lengh analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that their electronic structures resemble pyrenacenes more than quinoidal rylenes. That is, the aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the long axis of the skeletones. As the chain length increases, these molecules exhibit enhanced electronic absorption with a bathochromic shift, and multiple amphoteric redox waves. This study introduces a novel synthetic approach for generating 1D extended PAHs and GNRs, along with their structure&#8208;dependent electronic properties.

&lt;p&gt;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a one-dimensional (1D), ribbon-like structure have the potential to serve as both model compounds for corresponding graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and as materials for optoelectronics applications.

Bond lengh analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that their electronic structures resemble pyrenacenes more than quinoidal rylenes. That is, the aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the long axis of the skeletones. As the chain length increases, these molecules exhibit enhanced electronic absorption with a bathochromic shift, and multiple amphoteric redox waves. This study introduces a novel synthetic approach for generating 1D extended PAHs and GNRs, along with their structure-dependent electronic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Polymer Dots Photocatalyze CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Solution</title>

Organic poly[(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorenyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl)&#8208;co&#8208;(1,4&#8208;benzo&#8208;thiadiazole)] (PFBT) polymer dots were applied as the CO2 photoreduction catalyst in aqueous solution to yield a CO production rate of 57&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of up to 100&#8201;% and promising stability. Mechanistic studies indicated that the photoexcited PFBT was reduced by triethanolamine (TEOA) first, then bound with CO2 before CO production.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost and efficient photocatalysts to convert CO2 into valuable fuels is desirable to realize a carbon&#8208;neutral society. In this work, we report that polymer dots (Pdots) of poly[(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorenyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl)&#8208;co&#8208;(1,4&#8208;benzo&#8208;thiadiazole)] (PFBT), without adding any extra co&#8208;catalyst, can photocatalyze reduction of CO2 into CO in aqueous solution, rendering a CO production rate of 57&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a detectable selectivity of up to 100&#8201;%. After 5 cycles of CO2 re&#8208;purging experiments, no distinct decline in CO amount and reaction rate was observed, indicating the promising photocatalytic stability of PFBT Pdots in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. A mechanistic study reveals that photoexcited PFBT Pdots are reduced by sacrificial donor first, then the reduced PFBT Pdots can bind CO2 and reduce it into CO via their intrinsic active sites. This work highlights the application of organic Pdots for CO2 reduction in aqueous solution, which therefore provides a strategy to develop highly efficient and environmentally friendly nanoparticulate photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>On the Electride Nature of Na&#8208;hP4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Early quantum mechanical models suggested that pressure drives solids towards free&#8208;electron metal behavior where the ions are locked into simple close&#8208;packed structures. The prediction and subsequent discovery of high&#8208;pressure electrides (HPEs), compounds assuming open structures where the valence electrons are localized in interstitial voids, required a paradigm shift. Our quantum chemical calculations on the iconic insulating Na&#8208;hP4 HPE show that increasing density causes a 3s &#8594; 3pd electronic transition due to Coulomb repulsion between the 1s2s and 3s states, and orthogonality of the 3pd states to the core. The large lobes of the resulting Na&#8208;pd hybrid orbitals point towards the center of an 11&#8208;membered penta&#8208;capped trigonal prism and overlap constructively, forming multi&#8208;centered bonds, which are responsible for the emergence of the interstitial charge localization in Na&#8208;hP4. These multi&#8208;centered bonds facilitate the increased density of this phase, which is key for its stabilization under pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Catalytic Production of Hydrogen Peroxide Using Tin&#8208;containing Zeolite Fixed Palladium Nanoparticles with Oxidation Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal surfaces tend to be oxidized in air through dissociation the O&#8208;O bond of oxygen to reduce the performances in various fields. Although several ligand modification routes have alleviated the oxidation of bulky metal surfaces, it is still a challenge for the oxidation resistance of small&#8208;size metal nanoparticles. Herein, we fixed the small&#8208;size Pd nanoparticles in tin&#8208;contained MFI zeolite crystals, where the tin acts as an electron donor to efficiently hinder the oxidation of Pd by weakening the adsorption of molecular oxygen and suppressing the O&#8208;O cleavage. This oxidation&#8208;resistant Pd catalyst exhibited superior performance in directly synthesizing hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen, with the productivity of hydrogen peroxide at ~10,170 mmol gPd&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, steadily outperforming the catalysts tested previously. This work leads to the hypothesis that tin is an electron donor to realize oxidation&#8208;resistant Pd within zeolite crystals for efficient catalysis to overcome the limitation of generally supported Pd catalysts, and further motivates the use of oxidation&#8208;resistant metal nanoparticles in various fields.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Efficient Mg2+/Li+ separation is crucial to combating the lithium shortage worldwide, yet current nanofiltration membranes suffer from low efficacy and/or poor scalability, because desirable properties of membranes are entangled and trade&#8208;off. This work reported a &#8220;tagged&#8208;modification&#8221; chemistry to tackle the challenge. A mixture of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;trimethylpropan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium bromide (E1) and 3&#8208;aminopropyl&#8208;trimethylazanium (E2) was designed to modify polyethylenimine &#8211; trimesoyl chloride (PEI&#8208;TMC) membranes. E1 and E2 reacted with the PEI and TMC, respectively, and thus, membrane properties (hydrophilicity, pore sizes, charge) were untangled and intensified simultaneously. Permeance (34.3 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1) and Mg2+/Li+ selectivity (23.2) of modified membranes are ~4 times and ~2 times higher than the pristine membrane, and remain stable in a 30&#8208;days test. The permeance is the highest among all analogous nanofiltration membranes. The tagged&#8208;modification method enables the preparation of large&#8208;area membranes and modules that produce high&#8208;purity Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) from simulated brine.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Removal of Antibiotic Resistance Genes through 4f&#8208;2p&#8208;3d Gradient Orbital Coupling Mediated Fenton&#8208;Like Redox Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) mediated radical and nonradical active substances can synergistically achieve the efficient elimination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, enhancing interface electron cycling and optimizing the coupling of the oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates to improve PMS activation kinetics remains a major challenge. Here, Co doped CeVO4 catalyst (Co&#8208;CVO) with asymmetric sites was constructed based on Ce 4f&#8208;O 2p&#8208;Co 3d gradient orbital coupling. The catalyst achieved approximately 2.51&#215;105 copies/mL of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) removal within 15 minutes, exhibited ultrahigh degradation rate (k = 1.24 min&#8208;1). The effective gradient 4f&#8208;2p&#8208;3d orbital coupling precisely regulates the electron distribution of Ce&#8208;O&#8208;Co active center microenvironment, while optimizing the electronic structure of Co 3d states (especially the occupancy of eg), promoting the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The generated radical and nonradical generated by interfacial electron cycling enhanced by the reduction reaction of PMS at the Ce site and the oxidation reaction at the Co site achieved a significant mineralization rate of ARGs (83.4%). The efficient removal of ARGs by a continuous flow reactor for 10 hours significantly reduces the ecological risk of ARGs in actual wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) by Interrupted Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitous presence of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in aqueous environments has aroused societal concern. Nonetheless, effective sensing technologies for continuous monitoring of PFAS within water distribution infrastructures currently do not exist. Herein, we describe a ratiometric sensing approach to selectively detect aqueous perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at concentrations of &#181;g&#183;L&#8208;1. Our method relies on the excitonic transport in a highly fluorinated poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) to amplify a ratiometric emission signal modulated by an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye. The electronic coupling between the polymer and dye occurs through overlap of &#960;&#8208;orbitals and is designed to such that energy transfer is dominated by an electron exchange (Dexter) mechanism. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS perturbs the orbital interactions between the squaraine dye and the polymer backbone, thereby diminishing the efficiency of the energy transfer and producing a &#8220;polymer&#8208;ON/dye&#8208;OFF&#8221; response. These polymer/dye combinations were evaluated in spin&#8208;coated films and polymer nanoparticles and were able to selectively detect PFAS at concentrations of &#8764;150 ppb and &#8764;50 ppb, respectively. Both polymer films and nanoparticles are not affected by the type of water, and similar responses to PFAS were found in milliQ and well water.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ubiquitous presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in aqueous environments has aroused societal concern. Nonetheless, effective sensing technologies for continuous monitoring of PFAS within water distribution infrastructures currently do not exist. Herein, we describe a ratiometric sensing approach to selectively detect aqueous perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at concentrations of &#181;g&#183;L-1. Our method relies on the excitonic transport in a highly fluorinated poly(p-phenylene ethynylene) to amplify a ratiometric emission signal modulated by an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye. The electronic coupling between the polymer and dye occurs through overlap of &#960;-orbitals and is designed to such that energy transfer is dominated by an electron exchange (Dexter) mechanism. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS perturbs the orbital interactions between the squaraine dye and the polymer backbone, thereby diminishing the efficiency of the energy transfer and producing a &#8220;polymer-ON/dye-OFF&#8221; response. These polymer/dye combinations were evaluated in spin-coated films and polymer nanoparticles and were able to selectively detect PFAS at concentrations of &#8764;150 ppb and &#8764;50 ppb, respectively. Both polymer films and nanoparticles are not affected by the type of water, and similar responses to PFAS were found in milliQ and well water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving Low&#8208;temperature Performance and Stability of Na2Ti6O13 Anodes by the Ti&#8211;O Spring Effect through Nb&#8208;doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na2Ti6O13 (NTO) with high safety has been regarded as a promising anode candidate for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In the present study, integrated modification of migration channels broadening, charge density re&#8208;distribution, and oxygen vacancies regulation are realized in case of Nb&#8208;doping and have obtained significantly enhanced cycling performance with 92% reversible capacity retained after 3000 cycles at 3000 mA g&#8208;1. Moreover, unexpected low&#8208;temperature performance with a high discharge capacity of 143 mAh g&#8208;1 at 100 mA g&#8208;1 under &#8208;15&#176;C is also achieved in the full cell. Theoretical investigation suggests that Nb preferentially replaces Ti3 sites, which effectively improves structural stability and lowers the diffusion energy barrier. What&#8217;s more important, both the in&#8208;situ XRD and in&#8208;situ Raman furtherly confirm the robust spring effect of the Ti&#8208;O bond, making special charge compensation mechanism and respective regulation strategy to conquer the sluggish transport kinetics and low conductivity, which plays a key role in promoting electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>From Biomimicking to Bioinspired Design of Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction to C1 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) is a promising approach to maintain a carbon cycle balance and produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, CO2RR technology is far from mature, since the conventional CO2RR electrocatalysts suffer from low activity (leading to currents &lt; 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in an H&#8208;cell), stability (&lt; 120 h), and selectivity. Hence, they cannot meet the requirements for commercial applications (&gt; 200 mA cm&#8208;2, &gt; 8000 h, &gt; 90 % selectivity). Significant improvements are possible by taking inspiration from nature, considering biological organisms that efficiently catalyze the CO2 to various products. In this minireview, we present recent examples of enzyme&#8208;inspired and enzyme&#8208;mimicking CO2RR electrocatalysts enabling the production of C1 products with high faradaic efficiency (FE). At present, these designs do not typically follow a methodical approach, but rather focus on isolated features of biological systems. To achieve disruptive change, we advocate a systematic design methodology that leverages fundamental mechanisms associated with desired properties in nature and adapts them to the context of engineering applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging of Single Molecular Behaviors Under Bifurcated Three&#8208;Centered Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism for interaction and bonding of single guest molecules with active sites fundamentally determines the sorption and subsequent catalytic processes occurring in host zeolitic frameworks. However, no real&#8208;space studies on these significant issues have been reported thus far, since atomically visualizing guest molecules and recognizing single Al T&#8208;sites in zeolites remain challenging. Here, we atomically resolved single thiophene probes interacting with acid T&#8208;sites in the ZSM&#8208;5 framework to study the bonding behaviors between them. The synergy of bifurcated three&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions can &#8220;freeze&#8221; the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and make it stable enough to be imaged. By combining the imaging results with simulations, direct atomic observations enabled us to precisely locate the single Al T&#8208;sites in individual straight channels. Then, we statistically found that the thiophene bonding probability of the T11 site is 15 times higher than that of the T6 site. For different acid T&#8208;sites, the variation in the interaction synergy changes the inner angle of the host&#8208;guest O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;S hydrogen bond, thereby affecting the stability of the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and leading to considerable bonding inhomogeneities.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectric Polarization Modulated Facet&#8208;selective Charge Separation in Bi4NbO8Cl Single Crystal for Boosting Visible&#8208;light Driven Bifunctional Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing bifunctional water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts is meaningful, but challenged by the harsh requirements of specific&#8208;facet single crystals with spatially separated reactive sites and anisotropic charge transfer paths contributed by well&#8208;built charge driving force. Herein, tunable ferroelectric polarization is introduced in Bi4NbO8Cl single crystal nanosheets to strengthen the orthogonal charge transfer channels. By manipulating the in&#8208;plane polarization from octahedral off&#8208;centering of Nb5+ and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization from lone pair electron effect of anisotropic Bi3+, both the fast charge recombination in bulk catalyst and the process of charge trapping into surface states can be effectively modulated. Collaborating with modest polarization electric field and facet junction induced built&#8208;in electric field, cooperative charge tractive force is constructed, which reinforces the spatial separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes to {110} reductive site facet and {001} oxidation site facet, respectively. While excessive polarization charges impair the facet&#8208;selective charge separation characteristics and conversely promote charge recombination on the surface. As a result, polarity&#8208;optimized Bi4NbO8Cl shows an excellent H2 and O2 evolution rate of 54.21 and 36.08 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1 in the presence of sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation. This work unveils the function of ferroelectric polarization in tuning the intrinsic facet&#8208;selective charge transfer process of photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Protocol for Activated Bioorthogonal Fluorescence Labeling and Imaging of 4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase in Plants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) plays a crucial role in the synthesis of nutrients needed to maintain optimal plant growth. Its level is closely linked to the extent of abiotic stress experienced by plants. Moreover, it is also the target of commercial herbicides. Therefore, labeling of HPPD in plants not only enables visualization of its tissue distribution and cellular uptake, it also facilitates assessment of abiotic stress of plants and provides information needed for the development of effective environmentally friendly herbicides. In this study, we created a method for fluorescence labeling of HPPD that avoids interference with the normal growth of plants. In this strategy, a perylene&#8208;linked dibenzyl&#8208;cyclooctyne undergoes strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition with an azide&#8208;containing HPPD ligand. The activation&#8208;based labeling process results in a significant emission enhancement caused by the change in the fluorescent forms from an excimer to a monomer. Notably, this activated bioorthogonal strategy is applicable to visualizing HPPD in Arabidopsis thaliana, and assessing its response to multiple abiotic stresses. Also, it can be employed to monitor in vivo levels and locations of HPPD in crops. Consequently, the labeling strategy will be a significant tool in investigations of HPPD&#8208;related abiotic stress mechanisms, discovering novel herbicides, and uncovering unknown biological functions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) salts, as crystalline carbon nitrides, exhibit high photocatalytic activity and are being extensively researched, but its photochemical instability has not drawn researchers&#8217; attention yet. Herein, sodium PHI (PHI&#8208;Na) ultrathin nanosheets with increased crystallinity, synthesized by enhancing contact of melamine with NaCl functioning as a structure&#8208;induction agent and hard template, exhibits improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, but low photochemical stability, owing to Na+ loss in the photocatalytic process, which, interestingly, can be enhanced by the common ion effect, e.g., addition of NaCl that is also able to remarkably increase the photoactivity with the apparent quantum yield at 420 nm reaching 41.5%. This work aims at attracting research peers&#8217; attention to photochemical instability of PHI salts and provides a way to enhance their crystallinity.</dc:description>

This work aims at attracting research peers&#8217; attention to photochemical instability of PHI salts and provides a way to enhance their crystallinity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sterically Allowed H&#8208;type Supramolecular Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of&#160;pi&#8208;conjugated scaffolds with sterically demanding substituents is a widely used tactic to suppress cofacial (H&#8208;type) stacking interactions, which may even inhibit self&#8208;assembly. Contrary to expectations, we demonstrate herein that increasing steric effects can result in an enhanced thermodynamic stability of H&#8208;type supramolecular polymers. In our approach, we have investigated two boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes with bulky phenyl (2) and mesityl (3) meso&#8208;substituents and compared their self&#8208;assembly in nonpolar media with that of a parent meso&#8208;methyl BODIPY 1 lacking bulky groups. While the enhanced steric demand induces pathway complexity, the superior thermodynamic stability of the H&#8208;type pathways can be rationalized in terms of additional enthalpic gain arising from intermolecular C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F&#8208;B interactions of the orthogonally arranged aromatic substituents, which overrule their inherent steric demand. Our findings underline the importance of balancing competing non&#8208;covalent interactions in self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Stable Nickelocenium Dication Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of the nickelocenium cations [NiCp2]&#8226;+ and [NiCp2]2+ as their [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF = C(CF3)3) salts. Diamagnetic [NiCp2]2+ represents the first example for the isolation of an unsubstituted parent metallocene dication. Both salts were generated by reacting neutral NiCp2 with [NO]+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (4FB). The salts were cha&#173;racterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), indicating shorter metal&#8208;ligand bond lengths for the higher charged salt. Powder XRD shows the salts to be phase pure, cyclic voltammetry in 4FB gave qua&#173;si reversible redox waves at &#8722;0.44 (0&#8702;1) and +1.17 V (1&#8702;2) vs Fc/Fc+. The 1H&#8208;NMR of [NiCp2]2+ is a singlet at 8.6 ppm, whereas paramagnetic [NiCp2]&#8226;+ is significantly shifted upfield to &#8722;103.1 ppm.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating Lone&#8208;Pair&#8208;Driven Luminescence in 0D Tin Halides by Pressure&#8208;Tuned Stereochemical Activity from Static to Dynamic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excellent luminescence properties and structural dynamics driven by the stereoactivity of the lone pair in a variety of low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides have attracted growing investigations for optoelectronic applications. However, the structural and photophysical aspects of the excited state associated with the lone pair expression are currently open questions. Herein, zero&#8208;dimensional Sn&#8208;based halides with static stereoactive 5s2 lone pairs are selected as a model system to understand the correlations between the distinctive lone pair expression and the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation and charge carrier dynamics by continuous lattice manipulation. Lattice compression drives 5s2 lone pair active switching and self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) redistribution by suppressing excited&#8208;state structural deformation of the isolated SnBr42&#8208; units. Our results demonstrate that the static expression of the 5s2 lone pair results in a red broadband triplet STE emission with a large Stokes shift, while its dynamic expression creates a sky&#8208;blue narrowband emission dominated by the radiative recombination of singlet STEs. Our findings and the&#160;photophysical mechanism proposed highlight the stereochemical effects of lone pair expression in controlling light emission properties and offer constructive guidelines for tuning the optoelectronic properties in diverse ns2 metal halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Infinite Twisted Polycatenanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly[n]catenanes have exceptional mechanical bonding properties that give them tremendous potential for use in the development of molecular machines and soft materials. Synthesizing these compounds has, however, been proved to be a formidable challenge. In this paper, we describe a concise method for the construction of twisted polycatenanes. Our approach involves using preorganized double helicates as templates, and linked crosswise in a linear fashion by either silver ions or triple bonds. Using this approach, we successfully synthesized twisted polycatenanes with both covalent bonding employing Ag(I) ions and ethynylene units, respectively, as the linkages and leveraging the same Ag(I)&#8208;templated double helicate in both cases. Synthesis with Ag(I) ions formed a single&#8208;crystalline one&#8208;dimensional (1D) coordination poly[n]catenane, and synthesis using ethynylene units generated 1D fibers which self&#8208;assembled with solvents to form a gel. Our results confirm the potential of multi&#8208;stranded metallohelicates for creating sophisticated mechanically interlocked molecules and polymers, which could pave the way for exploration in the realms of molecular nanotopology and materials design.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the metal&#8208;oxo cluster structural feature and charge separation behaviour of oxygen evolving center (OEC) in photosystem II (PS&#8208;II) under photoirradiation, a new crystalline photochromic polyoxomolybdate, MV2[&#946;&#8208;Mo8O26] (1, MV = methyl viologen cation), is designed as a biomimetic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst in neutral electrolytes. After photoinduced electron transfer (PIET), it remains an ultra&#8208;stable charge&#8208;separated state over a year under ambient conditions with color change from colorless to gray. The observed overpotential at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope decrease 49 mV and 62.8 mV&#183;dec&#8722;1 after coloration, respectively. The outstanding OER performance of colored state in neutral electrolytes even outperforms the commercial RuO2 benchmark. Experimental and theoretical calculations elucidate that the presence of oxygen holes within polyanions after irradiation serves as sites for enhancing direct O&#8208;O coupling, thus effectively promoting OER. This is the first successful application of electron&#8208;transfer photochromism to realize OER activity gain.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is a powerful technique for preparing block copolymer nanostructures. Recently, efforts have been focused on applying photochemistry to promote PISA due to the mild reaction conditions, low cost, and spatiotemporal control that light confers. Despite these advantages, chain&#8208;end degradation and long reaction times can mar the efficacy of this process. Herein, we demonstrate the use of ultrafast photoiniferter PISA to produce polymeric nanostructures. By exploiting the rapid photolysis of xanthates, near&#8208;quantitative monomer conversion can be achieved within five minutes to prepare micelles, worms, and vesicles at various core&#8208;chain lengths, concentrations, or molar compositions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Catalytic Activity of a Pincer Complex of Rhodium (I) by Supramolecular and Redox Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a rhodium (I) complex [Rh(CNC&#8208;NDI)(CO)]+, in which CNC&#8208;NDI refers to a pincer&#8208;CNC ligand decorated with a naphthalenediimide moiety. Due to the presence of the planar CNC ligand, and the naphthalenediimide moiety, the electronic nature of the complex can be modulated by means of supramolecular and redox stimuli, respectively. The metal complex shows a strong &#960;&#8722;&#960;&#8208;stacking interaction with coronene. This interaction has an impact on the electronrichness of the metal, as demonstrated by the shifting of the &#957;(CO) stretching band to a lower frequency. The addition of tetrabutylammonium fluoride facilitates the sequential one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction of the NDI moiety of the ligand, thus rendering a situation in which the ligand can increase its electrondonor strength in two levels. The nature of the interaction with the fluoride anion was studied computationally. The catalytic activity of the [Rh(CNC&#8208;NDI)(CO)]+ complex was tested in the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids, where it is observed that the activity of the catalyst can be modulated between four levels of activity, which correspond to i) the use of the unmodified catalyst, ii) catalyst + coronene, iii) catalyst + 2 equivalents of fluoride, and iv) catalyst + 5 equivalents of fluoride.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation of Broad Absorption Band with Small Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap in Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are one of the most effective ways to harvest renewable solar energy, with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices soaring above 19% when processed with halogenated solvents. The superior photocurrent of OPV over other emerging photovoltaics offers more opportunities to further improve the efficiency. Tailoring the absorption band of photoactive materials is an effective way to further enhance OPV photocurrent. However, the field has mostly been focusing on improving the near&#8208;infrared region photo&#8208;response, with the absorption shoulders in short&#8208;wavelength region (SWR) usually being neglected. Herein, by developing a series of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with varied side&#8208;group conjugations, we observe an enhanced SWR absorption band with increased side&#8208;group conjugation length. The underpinning factors of how molecular structures and geometries improve SWR absorption are clearly elucidated through theoretical modelling and crystallography. Moreover, a clear relationship between SWR absorption intensity and singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap is established. These collectively establish a comprehensive correlation from NFA structure to non&#8208;radiative recombination loss in OPV, affording a high PCE of 18.5% when processed with a non&#8208;halogenated green solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable and Reversible Fluorescent Eutectogels for Conformal Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Smart fluorescent materials that can respond to environmental stimuli are of great importance in the fields of information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, traditional fluorescent materials usually face problems such as lack of tunable fluorescence and insufficient surface&#8208;adaptive adhesion, hindering their practical applications. Herein, inspired by the glowing sucker octopus, we present a novel strategy&#160;to fabricate a reversible fluorescent eutectogel with high transparency, adhesive and self&#8208;healing performance for conformal information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Using anthracene as luminescent unit, the eutectogel exhibits photoswitchable fluorescence and can therefore be reversibly written/erased with patterns by non&#8208;contact stimulation. Additionally, different from mechanically irreversible adhesion via glue, the eutectogel can adhere to various irregular substrates over a wide temperature range (&#8208;20 to 65 &#176;C) and conformally deform more than 1000 times without peeling off. Furthermore, by exploiting surface&#8208;adaptive adhesion, high transparency and good stretchability of the eutectogel, dual encryption can be achieved under UV and stretching conditions to further improve the security level. This study should provide a promising strategy for the future development of advanced intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Encapsulation of Palladium Carbide Subnanometric Species in Zeolite Boosts Highly Selective Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a crucial step in the synthesis of fine chemicals. However, the widely utilized Palladium (Pd)&#8208;based catalysts often suffer from poor selectivity. In this work, we demonstrate a carbonization&#8208;reduction method to create palladium carbide subnanometric species within pure silicate MFI zeolite. The carbon species can modify the electronic and steric characteristics of Pd species by forming the predominant Pd&#8208;C4 structure and, meanwhile, facilitate the desorption of alkenes by forming the Si&#8208;O&#8208;C structure with zeolite framework, as validated by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterizations and theoretical calculations. The developed catalyst shows superior performance in the selective hydrogenation of alkynes over mild conditions (298 K, 2 bar H2), with 99% selectivity to styrene at a complete conversion of phenylacetylene. In contrast, the zeolite&#8208;encapsulated carbon&#8208;free Pd catalyst and the commercial Lindlar catalyst show only 15% and 14% selectivity to styrene, respectively, under identical reaction conditions. The zeolite&#8208;confined Pd&#8208;carbide subnanoclusters promise their superior properties in semihydrogenation of alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bismuth&#8208;Based Zeolitic Organic Framework with Coordination&#8208;Linked Metal Cages for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to HCOOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;directing strategy is developed to build a bismuth&#8208;based zeolitic organic framework (Bi&#8208;ZMOFs) with coordination&#8208;linked metal cages for efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOOH with 91&#8201;% efficiency. The coordination of Bi with pyrazole&#8208;N atom triggers an effective interatomic electron transfer and contributes to the activation of CO2 and stabilization of the active intermediates.







Abstract
Zeolitic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (ZMOFs) have emerged as one of the most promsing catalysts for energy conversion, but they suffer from either weak bonding between metal&#8208;organic cubes (MOCs) that decrease their stability during catalysis processes or low activity due to inadequate active sites. In this work, through ligand&#8208;directing strategy, we successfully obtain an unprecedented bismuth&#8208;based ZMOF (Bi&#8208;ZMOF) featuring a ACO topological crystal structure with strong coordination bonding between the Bi&#8208;based cages. As a result, it enables efficient reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) with Faradaic efficiency as high as 91&#8201;%. A combination of in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation reveals that the Bi&#8722;N coordination contributes to facilitating charge transfer from N to Bi atoms, which stabilize the intermediate to boost the reduction efficiency of CO2 to HCOOH. This finding highlights the importance of the coordination environment of metal active sites on electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. We believe that this work will offer a new clue to rationally design zeolitic MOFs for catalytic reaction

         <title>Zincophilic Interfacial Manipulation against Dendrite Growth and Side Reactions for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phytic acid (PA)&#8208;ZnAl coordination compound is demonstrated as a multifunctional interphase layer to achieve highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anodes. The zincophilic PA&#8208;ZnAl layer enables the homogenized Zn2+ flux, rapid desolvation kinetics, enhanced Zn2+ transference number, and suppressed side reactions, thus contributing to the high Coulombic efficiency and enhanced cycling performance with dendrite&#8208;free morphology.







Abstract
Constructing multifunctional interphases to suppress the rampant Zn dendrite growth and detrimental side reactions is crucial for Zn anodes. Herein, a phytic acid (PA)&#8208;ZnAl coordination compound is demonstrated as a versatile interphase layer to stabilize Zn anodes. The zincophilic PA&#8208;ZnAl layer can manipulate Zn2+ flux and promote rapid desolvation kinetics, ensuring the uniform Zn deposition with dendrite&#8208;free morphology. Moreover, the robust PA&#8208;ZnAl protective layer can effectively inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction and formation of byproducts, further contributing to the reversible Zn plating/stripping with high Coulombic efficiency. As a result, the Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl electrode shows a lower Zn nucleation overpotential and higher Zn2+ transference number compared with bare Zn. The Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl symmetric cell exhibits a prolonged lifespan of 650&#8197;h tested at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the assembled Zn battery full cell based on this Zn@PA&#8208;ZnAl anode also delivers decent cycling stability even under harsh conditions.

         <title>Highly Efficient Depolymerization of Waste Polyesters Enabled by Transesterification/Hydrogenation Relay Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient hydrogenative PET degradation protocol was developed under mild conditions enabled by a novel transesterification/hydrogenation relay strategy and rationally designed catalysts. A broad range of post&#8208;consumer PET sources and other types of polyesters were easily degraded in excellent yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclosed the evolution of catalyst and the important role of methanol for promoting the reaction efficiency.







Abstract
The efficient depolymerization of polyesters under mild conditions remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a highly efficient strategy for the degradation of a diverse array of waste polyesters as low to 80&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;bar H2. The key to the success of this transformation relied on the initial transesterification of macromolecular polyester into more degradable oligomeric fragments in the presence of CH3OH and the subsequent hydrogenation by the use of the rationally designed quinaldine&#8208;based Ru complex. Controlled experiments and preliminary mechanistic studies disclosed the quinaldine&#8208;based catalysts could be hydrogenated to the eventually active species, which has been confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and directly used as a catalyst in the hydrogenolysis of polyester. The strong viability and high activity of this new species in protic solvent were explained in detail. Besides, the crucial role of CH3OH in promoting reaction efficiency during the whole process was also elucidated. The synthetic utility of this method was further illustrated by preparing 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

         <title>Creating a Defined Chirality in Amino Acids and Cyclic Dipeptides by Photochemical Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,5&#8208;Diketopiperazines are cyclic dipeptides displaying a wide range of applications. Their enantioselective preparation has now been found possible from the respective racemates by a photochemical deracemization (53 examples, 74% to quantitative yield, 71&#8208;99% ee). A chiral benzophenone catalyst in concert with irradiation at &#955;= 366 nm enables to establish the configuration at the stereogenic carbon atom C6 at will. If other stereogenic centers are present in the diketopiperazines they remain unaffected and a stereochemical editing is possible at a single position. Consecutive reactions, including the conversion into N&#8208;aryl or N&#8208;alkyl amino acids or the reduction to piperazines, occur without compromising the newly created stereogenic center. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the benzophenone catalyst processes one enantiomer of the 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines preferentially and enables a reversible hydrogen atom transfer that is responsible for the deracemization process. The remarkably long lifetime of the protonated ketyl radical implies a yet unprecedented mode of action.</dc:description>

         <title>Metamorphosis of a Commodity Plastic like PVC to Efficient Catalytic Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We perform the conversion of a commodity plastic of common use in pipes, window frames, medical devices, flexible hoses, etc. like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs). SCNPs are versatile, protein&#8208;mimetic soft nano&#8208;objects of growing interest for catalysis, sensing, and nanomedicine, among other uses. We demonstrate that the metamorphosis process &#8208;as induced through metal&#8208;free click chemistry&#8208; leads to well&#8208;defined, uniform SCNPs that are stable during storage in the solid state for months. All the conversion process (from PVC isolation to PVC&#8208;SCNPs synthesis) can be run in a green, dipolar aprotic solvent and involving, when required, a simple mixture of ethanol and water (1/1 vol.) as non&#8208;solvent. The resulting PVC&#8208;SCNPs are investigated as recyclable, metalloenzyme&#8208;mimetic catalysts for several representative Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed organic reactions. The method could be valid for the metamorphosis and valorization of other commodity plastics in which it is feasible to install azide functional groups in their linear polymer chains.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Ring&#8208;Fused Azafulleroids and Carbazole&#8208;Derived Metallofullerenes: Reactivity Dictated by Encapsulation in a Fullerene Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report divergent additions of 2,2'&#8208;diazidobiphenyls toward C60 and Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80. In stark contrast to that of the previously reported bis&#8208;azide additions, the unexpected reactivity leads to the cascade dearomative formation of unprecedented azafulleroids 2 fused with a 7&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;membered ring system in the case of C60. In contrast, the corresponding reaction with Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 switches to the cascade C&#8211;H insertion pathway, resulting in multiple isomers, including a carbazole&#8208;derived [6,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroid 3 and a [5,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroid 4 and an unusual 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole&#8208;derived metallofullerene 5, whose molecular structures have been unambiguously determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Among them, the addition type of 5 is observed for the first time in all reported additions of azides to fullerenes. Furthermore, unexpected isomerizations from 3 to 5 and from 4 to 5 have been discovered, representing the first example of isomerization from an azafulleroid to a carbazole&#8208;derived fullerene rather than an aziridinofullerene. In particular, the isomerism from [5,6]&#8208;isomer 4 to [5,6]&#8208;isomer 5 is unprecedented in fullerene chemistry, contradicting the present understanding that isomerization generally occurs between [5,6]&#8208; and [6,6]&#8208;isomers. Control experiments have been carried out to rationalize the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, representative azafulleroids have been applied in organic solar cells, resulting in improved power conversion efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Living Alternating Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Copolymerization of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran to Provide Completely Degradable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran (DHF) has recently been gaining significant attention as a comonomer in metathesis polymerization, thanks to its ability to provide the resultant polymer backbones with stimuli&#8208;responsive degradability. In this report, we present living alternating copolymerization of DHF with less reactive endo&#8208;tricyclo[4.2.2.02,5]deca&#8208;3,9&#8208;dienes (TDs) and endo&#8208;oxonorbornenes (oxoNBs). By carefully controlling the reactivity of both the Ru initiators and the monomers, we have achieved outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98%) under near stoichiometric DHF loading conditions. Notably, we have also found that the use of a more sterically hindered Ru initiator helps to attain polymer backbones with higher DHF incorporation and superior A, B&#8208;alternation. While preserving the living characteristics of DHF copolymerization, as evidenced by controlled molecular weights (up to 73.9 kDa), narrow dispersities (down to 1.05), and block copolymer formation, our DHF copolymers could be broken down to a single repeat unit level under acidic conditions. 1H NMR analysis of the model copolymer revealed that after 24 hours of degradation, up to 80% of the initial polymer was transformed into a single small molecule product, and after purification, up to 66% of the degradation product was retrieved. This study provides a versatile approach to improve the alternation and degradability of DHF copolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Zinc Sites with Synergetic Multiple Coordination Shells for Electrochemical H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise manipulation of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is crucial to maximize their catalytic performance. Herein, we present a general two&#8208;step  strategy to fabricate a series of hollow carbon&#8208;based SACs featuring asymmetric Zn&#8208;N2O2 moieties simultaneously modulated with S atoms in higher coordination shells of Zn centers (n &#8805; 2; designated as Zn&#8208;N2O2&#8208;S). Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that the synergetic effects between the N2O2 species in the first coordination shell and the S atoms in higher coordination shells lead to robust discrete Zn sites with the optimal electronic structure for selective O2 reduction to H2O2. Remarkably, the Zn&#8208;N2O2 moiety with S atoms in the second coordination shell possesses a nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate, which favors the formation and desorption of OOH* on Zn sites for H2O2 generation. Consequently, the Zn&#8208;N2O2&#8208;S SAC exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance with high selectivity of 96%. Even at a high current density of 80  mA cm&#8208;2  in the flow cell , the  Zn&#8208;N2O2&#8208;S SAC  shows a high H2O2 production rate of 6.924 mol gcat  &#8208;   1   h  &#8208;   1   with an average Faradaic efficiency of up to 93.1%, and   excellent durability  over 65 h .</dc:description>

         <title>Escape from Hydrofunctionalization: Palladium Hydride&#8208;Enabled Difunctionalization of Conjugated Dienes and Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium hydrides are traditionally employed in hydrofunctionalization (i.e. monofunctionalization) of conjugated dienes and enynes, owning to its facile protic hydropalladation of electron&#8208;rich (or neutral) unsaturated bonds. Herein, we report a mild PdH&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of conjugated dienes and enynes. This protocol is enabled by the chemoselectivity switch of the initial hydropalladation step achieved by visible light enhancement of hydricity of PdH species. This method allows for annulation of dienes and enynes with various easily available and abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8208;Hillman adducts, toward a wide range of alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans. This protocol also provides an easy access to complex spiro&#8208;fused tricyclic frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Five&#8208;Component Radical Relay Aminocarbonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical relay five&#8208;component double aminocarbonylation reaction of alkenes is described for direct access to valuable &#947;&#8208;trifluoromethyl &#945;&#8208;ketoamides with good yields and selectivities. Crucial was the identification of distinct dual roles of the amine coupling partners, which sequentially act as electron donors for the formation of photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with radical precursors and then as a CO acceptor to form carbamoyl radicals.







Abstract
Radical single carbonylation reactions with CO constitute a direct and robust strategy toward various carbonyl compounds from readily available chemicals, and have been extensively studied over the past decades. However, realizing highly selective catalytic systems for controlled radical double carbonylation reactions has remained a substantial challenge, particularly for the more advanced multicomponent variants, despite their great potential value. Herein, we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical relay five&#8208;component radical double aminocarbonylation reaction of unactivated alkenes using CO under metal&#8208;free conditions. This protocol provides direct access to valuable &#947;&#8208;trifluoromethyl &#945;&#8208;ketoamides with good yields and high chemoselectivity. Crucial was the identification of distinct dual roles of amine coupling partners, sequentially acting as electron donors for the formation of photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with radical precursors and then as a CO acceptor via nitrogen radical cations to form carbamoyl radicals. Cross&#8208;coupling of carbamoyl radicals with the acyl radicals that are formed in an alkene&#8208;based relay process affords double aminocarbonylation products.

         <title>Enhanced Active Sites and Stability in Nano&#8208;MOFs for Electrochemical Energy Storage through Dual Regulation by Tannic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilized the rich chemical properties of TA to achieve functionalization of nano&#8208;MOFs through acid&#8208;etching and further chelation strategies. The results indicated that the functionalization effect of TA on MOFs is both universal and targeted.







Abstract
The limited active sites and poor acid&#8208;alkaline solution stability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), significantly limit their wider application. In this study, the acid property of tannic acid (TA) was used as an etchant to etch the surface&#8208;active sites. Subsequently, the further chelation of the protonated TA with the exposed metal active site can effectively protect the metal ions. Meanwhile, the TA provided a large amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups, which can greatly improve the stability of imidazolate&#8208;coordinated MOFs. The electrochemical test results indicated that the MOFs composite materials synthesized using this scheme had high specific capacitance and stability. And the mechanism of its electrochemical reaction process was explored through in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and theoretical calculations. In addition, the same treatment was carried out through a series of carboxyl&#8208;coordinated MOFs, which further confirmed the principle of this scheme to obtain a higher active site and stability. This paper explains the mechanism of functionalization of nano&#8208;MOFs by polyphenolic compounds, providing new ideas for the research of nano&#8208;MOFs.

         <title>Photoactivatable Carbo&#8208; and Silicon&#8208;Rhodamines and Their Application in MINFLUX Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical nanoscopy of cells expressing Vimentin&#8208;HaloTag fusion proteins and labeled with photoactivatable fluorescent dyes is demonstrated in 2D and 3D modes on a commercial MINFLUX (minimal fluxes) setup. The dye synthesis and properties, photoactivation rates, labeling procedures, detection efficiencies, and other parameters related to the practical use of the probes are reported and discussed.







Abstract
New photoactivatable fluorescent dyes (rhodamine, carbo&#8208; and silicon&#8208;rhodamines [SiR]) with emission ranging from green to far red have been prepared, and their photophysical properties studied. The photocleavable 2&#8208;nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl unit with an alpha&#8208;carboxyl group as a branching point and additional functionality was attached to a polycyclic and lipophilic fluorescent dye. The photoactivatable probes having the HaloTagTM amine (O2) ligand bound with a dye core were obtained and applied for live&#8208;cell staining in stable cell lines incorporating Vimentin (VIM) or Nuclear Pore Complex Protein NUP96 fused with the HaloTag. The probes were applied in 2D (VIM, NUP96) and 3D (VIM) MINFLUX nanoscopy, as well as in superresolution fluorescence microscopy with single fluorophore activation (VIM, live&#8208;cell labeling). Images of VIM and NUPs labeled with different dyes were acquired and their apparent dimensions and shapes assessed on a lower single&#8208;digit nanometer scale. Applicability and performance of the photoactivatable dye derivatives were evaluated in terms of photoactivation rate, labeling and detection efficiency, number of detected photons per molecule and other parameters related to MINFLUX nanoscopy.

         <title>Switchable Fluorescent Light&#8208;Up Aptamers Based on Riboswitch Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of switchable fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamers is created by adopting a conformational switching principle derived from natural riboswitches. The aptamers can be activated or deactivated with RNA triggers or small molecules like guanine and adenine, providing highly sensitive switches with minimal signal leakage.







Abstract
Fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA aptamers (FLAPs) such as Spinach or Mango can bind small fluorogens and activate their fluorescence. Here, we adopt a switching mechanism otherwise found in riboswitches and use it to engineer switchable FLAPs that can be activated or repressed by trigger oligonucleotides or small metabolites. The fluorophore binding pocket of the FLAPs comprises guanine (G) quadruplexes, whose critical nucleotides can be sequestered by corresponding anti&#8208;FLAP sequences, leading to an inactive conformation and thus preventing association with the fluorophore. We modified the FLAPs with designed toehold hairpins that carry either an anti&#8208;FLAP or an anti&#8208;anti&#8208;FLAP sequence within the loop region. The addition of an input RNA molecule triggers a toehold&#8208;mediated strand invasion process that refolds the FLAP into an active or inactive configuration. Several of our designs display close&#8208;to&#8208;zero leak signals and correspondingly high ON/OFF fluorescence ratios. We also modified purine aptamers to sequester a partial anti&#8208;FLAP or an anti&#8208;anti&#8208;FLAP sequence to control the formation of the fluorogen&#8208;binding conformation, resulting in FLAPs whose fluorescence is activated or deactivated in the presence of guanine or adenine. We demonstrate that switching modules can be easily combined to generate FLAPs whose fluorescence depends on several inputs with different types of input logic.

         <title>Postsynthetic Photochemical Modification and 2D Structuring of Zr&#8208;MOF Thin Films Containing Benzophenone Linker Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin, porous and highly oriented films of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with benzophenone linker molecules were prepared as a new platform for photochemical postsynthetic modification. Potential reactivities range from targeted functionalization of the inner and outer surface, through grafting&#8208;from polymerization to true 2D patterning of defined structures.







Abstract
For the fabrication of next&#8208;generation MOF&#8208;based devices the availability of highly adaptable materials in suitable shapes is crucial. Here, we present thin films of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) containing photoreactive benzophenone units. Crystalline, oriented and porous films of the zirconium&#8208;based bzpdc&#8208;MOF (bzpdc=benzophenone&#8208;4&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) are prepared by direct growth on silicon or glass substrates. Via a subsequent photochemical modification of the Zr&#8208;bzpdc&#8208;MOF films, various properties can be tuned postsynthetically by covalent attachment of modifying agents. Apart from the modification with small molecules, also grafting&#8208;from polymerization reactions are possible. In a further extension, 2D structuring and photo&#8208;writing of defined structures is also possible, for example by using a photolithographic approach, paving the way towards micro&#8208;patterned MOF surfaces.

         <title>Charting the Chemical Reaction Space around a Multicomponent Combination: Controlled Access to a Diverse Set of Biologically Relevant Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charting the reaction space around a known Multicomponent Reaction (MCR) allows the development of new processes. In this way, a detailed study of the parameters involved in the Orru transformation leads to the generation of alternative connectivities featuring diversely substituted imidazolones, including GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) chromophores, coelenterazine derivatives, natural products, kinase inhibitors, and bioprobes.







Abstract
Charting the chemical reaction space around the combination of carbonyls, amines, and isocyanoacetates allows the description of new multicomponent processes leading to a variety of unsaturated imidazolone scaffolds. The resulting compounds display the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein and the core of the natural product coelenterazine. Despite the competitive nature of the pathways involved, general protocols provide selective access to the desired chemotypes. Moreover, we describe unprecedented reactivity at the C&#8208;2 position of the imidazolone core to directly afford C, S, and N&#8208;derivatives featuring natural products (e.g. leucettamines), potent kinase inhibitors, and fluorescent probes with suitable optical and biological profiles.

         <title>Leveraging Torsional and Steric Strains: A Pre&#8208;macrocyclization Strategy Enables Conformation&#8208;Specific Fullerene Binding in m&#8208;Cyclophanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine&#8208;tuning the torsion and steric effects of the lower&#8208;rim C&#8208;alkyls shows that resorcinarenes devoid of hydrogen bonding could be conformationally locked into a crown in a predetermined way. The fluorescent rigid deep&#8208;crown synthesized by a pre&#8208;macrocyclization route, free&#8208;of covalent tethering, captures C60 in solution and solid&#8208;states as opposed to the flexible counterparts.







Abstract
Though the chemistry of resorcinarenes is half a century old, the conformationally&#8208;locked resorcinarene crowns are generally constructed using hydrogen bonds or covalent tethers. Often, covalent tethering involves extra post&#8208;macrocyclization steps involving upper&#8208;rim functionalities. We have leveraged the torsional and steric strains through &#945;&#8208;substituents of the lower&#8208;rim C&#8208;alkyl chains and accomplished conformationally&#8208;rigid fluorescent m&#8208;cyclophane deep&#8208;crowns in a predetermined way. The strategy offers a pre&#8208;macrocyclization route conserving upper&#8208;rim functionalities, an aspect overlooked in resorcinarene chemistry. X&#8208;ray structural and computational analyses unveil the cause for conformational rigidity in m&#8208;cyclophanes due to &#945;&#8208;branching in C&#8208;alkyls (linear vs. &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;branched). The conformationally&#8208;locked fluorescent deep&#8208;crown with a preorganized cavity captures hydrophobic spherical guest C60 in both solution and solid states specifically, when compared to conformationally&#8208;dynamic boats, enabling conformation&#8208;specific binding.

         <title>Probing the Origin of Viscosity of Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A screened overlapping method (SOM) was developed to effectively compute the viscosity of liquid electrolytes. Based on this method, it is revealed that strong intermolecular interactions give rise to the high viscosity of liquid electrolytes and impede the motion of species in electrolytes.







Abstract
Viscosity is an extremely important property for ion transport and wettability of electrolytes. Easy access to viscosity values and a deep understanding of this property remain challenging yet critical to evaluating the electrolyte performance and tailoring electrolyte recipes with targeted properties. We proposed a screened overlapping method to efficiently compute the viscosity of lithium battery electrolytes by molecular dynamics simulations. The origin of electrolyte viscosity was further comprehensively probed. The viscosity of solvents exhibits a positive correlation with the binding energy between molecules, indicating viscosity is directly correlated to intermolecular interactions. Salts in electrolytes enlarge the viscosity significantly with increasing concentrations while diluents serve as the viscosity reducer, which is attributed to the varied binding strength from cation&#8211;anion and cation&#8211;solvent associations. This work develops an accurate and efficient method for computing the electrolyte viscosity and affords deep insight into viscosity at the molecular level, which exhibits the huge potential to accelerate advanced electrolyte design for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Phase Transition&#8208;Promoted Rapid Photomechanical Motions of Single Crystals of a Triene Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural symmetry&#8208;enhanced phase transition has been induced by [2+2] photocycloaddition in a triene coordination polymer. Under irradiation with UV light, its single crystals show abundant photomechanical motions, such as, jumping, bending, bursting, rolling, splitting, and cracking.







Abstract
Molecular crystals with the ability to transform light energy into macroscopic mechanical motions are a promising class of materials with potential applications in actuating and photonic devices. In regard to such materials, coordination polymers that exhibit dynamic photomechanical motion, associated with a phase transition, are unknown. Herein, we report an intriguing photoactive, one&#8208;dimensional ZnII coordination polymer, 1, derived from 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethenylbenzene and 3,5&#8208;difluorobenzoate. Single crystals of 1 under UV light irradiation exhibit rapid shrinking and bending, violent bursting&#8208;jumping, splitting, and cracking behavior. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy reveal an unusual photoinduced phase transition involving a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] cycloaddition reaction that results in photomechanical responses. Interestingly, crystals of 1, which are triclinic with space group 
, are transformed into a higher symmetry, monoclinic cell with space group C2/c. This process represents a rare example of symmetry enhancement upon photoirradiation. The photomechanical activity is likely due to the sudden release of stress associated with strained molecular geometries and significant solid&#8208;state molecular movement arising from cleavage and formation of chemical bonds. A composite membrane fabricated from 1 and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) also displays interesting photomechanical behavior under UV light illumination, indicating the material's potential as a photoactuator.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Impact Electrochemistry Reveals Kinetics Information of Metal&#8208;Ion Battery Materials with Multiple Redox Centers</title>

The electrochemical processes of individual Prussian blue particles with two distinct redox centres were investigated using nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry, which successfully revealed the precise kinetic mechanism of each oxidation/reduction reaction aided by theoretical simulation. A partially contradictory conclusion between single&#8208;particle analysis and the ensemble&#8208;averaged measurement was also discussed.







Abstract
Prussian blue (PB) has emerged as a promising cathode material in aqueous batteries. It possesses two distinct redox centers, and the potassium ions (K+) are unevenly distributed throughout the compound, adding complexity to the interpretation of the K+ insertion/de&#8208;insertion kinetic mechanism. Traditional ensemble&#8208;averaged measurements are limited in uncovering the precise kinetic information of the PB particles, as the results are influenced by the construction of the porous composite electrode and the redox behavior from different particles. In this study, the electrochemical processes of individual PB particles were investigated using nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry. By varying the potentials, different types of transient current signals were obtained that revealed the kinetic mechanism of each oxidation/reduction reaction in combination with theoretical simulation. Additionally, a partially contradictory conclusion between single&#8208;particle analysis and the ensemble&#8208;averaged measurement was discussed. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the electrochemical processes of cathode materials with multiple redox centers, which facilitates the development of effective strategies to optimize these materials.

         <title>An Efficient Direct Arylation Polycondensation via C&#8722;S Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Pd and Cu co&#8208;catalyzed DArP was developed via inert C&#8722;S bond cleavage of aryl thioethers. Moreover, the mechanism studies highlighted the important role of palladium (Pd) and copper (Cu) co&#8208;catalysis. Of note, CPs synthesized in this method possessed low trap densities, high Mns and charge transport mobility, signifying an excellent choice for synthesizing high performance CPs.







Abstract
The direct arylation polycondensation (DArP) has become one of the most important methods to construct conjugated polymers (CPs). However, the homocoupling side&#8208;reactions of aryl halides and the low regioseletive reactivities of unfunctionalized aryls hinder the development of DArP. Here, an efficient Pd and Cu co&#8208;catalyzed DArP was developed via inert C&#8722;S bond cleavage of aryl thioethers, of which robustness was exemplified by over twenty conjugated polymers (CPs), including copolymers, homopolymers, and random polymers. The capture of oxidative addition intermediate together with experimental and theoretic results suggested the important role of palladium (Pd) and copper (Cu) co&#8208;catalysis with a bicyclic mechanism. The studies of NMR, molecular weights, trap densities, two&#8208;dimensional grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (2D&#8208;GIWAXS), and the charge transport mobilities revealed that the homocoupling reactions were significantly suppressed with high regioselectivity of unfunctionalized aryls, suggesting this method is an excellent choice for synthesizing high performance CPs.

         <title>Biopolymer&#8208;Polysiloxane Double Network Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of transparent aerogels composed of biopolymer&#8208;polysiloxane double networks. Alginate&#8208;polymethylsilsesquioxane aerogel shows high optical transparency due to nanoscale structural homogeneity, water repellency, improved bending flexibility, and comparable superinsulation properties. In contrast, carboxymethyl cellulose&#8208;composited aerogel shows an aggregated microstructure. What is so special about alginate?







Abstract
A new series of transparent aerogels of biopolymer&#8208;polysiloxane double networks is reported. Biopolymer aerogels have attracted much attention from green and sustainable aspects but suffered from strong hydrophilicity and difficulty to make homogeneous structures in nanoscale; these drawbacks are overcome by compositing with a polysiloxane network. Alginate&#8208;polymethylsilsesquioxane aerogel has high optical transparency, water repellency, comparable superinsulation property and improved bending flexibility compared to pure polymethylsilsesquioxane aerogel. The nanoscale homogeneity is realized by separating the crosslinking steps for two networks in a sequential protocol: condensation of siloxane bonds and metal&#8208;crosslinking of biopolymer. The crosslinking order, biopolymer&#8208;first or siloxane&#8208;first, and universality/limitation of biopolymer&#8208;crosslinker pairs are discussed to construct fundamental chemistry of double network systems for their further application potentials.

         <title>Quantum Nuclear Delocalization and its Rovibrational Fingerprints</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protons microsolvated by helium atoms, HHe+n, offer fascinating insights into rovibrational excitations of polyatomic van der Waals complexes subject to pronounced quantum nuclear delocalization effects. Using quasi&#8208;exact calculations, we unveil for HHe3+ how different vibrational excitations modify in characteristic ways the torus&#8208;like quantum delocalization of one He around the quasi&#8208;linear HHe2+ core known from the quantum ground state.







Abstract
Quantum mechanics dictates that nuclei must undergo some delocalization. In this work, emergence of quantum nuclear delocalization and its rovibrational fingerprints are discussed for the case of the van der Waals complex 
. The equilibrium structure of 
 is planar and T&#8208;shaped, one He atom solvating the quasi&#8208;linear He&#8722;H+&#8722;He core. The dynamical structure of 
, in all of its bound states, is fundamentally different. As revealed by spatial distribution functions and nuclear densities, during the vibrations of the molecule the solvating He is not restricted to be in the plane defined by the instantaneously bent 
 chomophore, but freely orbits the central proton, forming a three&#8208;dimensional torus around the 
 chromophore. This quantum delocalization is observed for all vibrational states, the type of vibrational excitation being reflected in the topology of the nodal surfaces in the nuclear densities, showing, for example, that intramolecular bending involves excitation along the circumference of the torus.

, in all of its bound states, is fundamentally different. As revealed by spatial distribution functions and nuclear densities, during the vibrations of the molecule the solvating He is not restricted to be in the plane defined by the instantaneously bent 
 chomophore, but freely orbits the central proton, forming a three-dimensional torus around the 
 chromophore. This quantum delocalization is observed for all vibrational states, the type of vibrational excitation being reflected in the topology of the nodal surfaces in the nuclear densities, showing, for example, that intramolecular bending involves excitation along the circumference of the torus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Selective Ionic Crosslinking Provides Stretchable Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) have been developed through the implementation of size&#8208;selective ionic crosslinking. The resulting OMIECs exhibit remarkable mechanical properties and high conductivity. These materials were utilized to fabricate stretchable thermoelectric generators, demonstrating excellent heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity efficiency and high stability in humid environments.







Abstract
Mechanically compliant conductors are of utmost importance for the emerging fields of soft electronics and robotics. However, the development of intrinsically deformable organic conductors remains a challenge due to the trade&#8208;off between mechanical performance and charge mobility. In this study, we report a solution to this issue based on size&#8208;selective ionic crosslinking. This rationally designed crosslinking mediated by length&#8208;regulated oligo(ethylene glycol) pendant groups and metal ions simultaneously improved the softness and toughness and ensured excellent mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductivity in poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate composite materials. Moreover, the added ions remarkably promoted accumulation of charge carriers in response to temperature gradient, thus offering a viable approach to stretchable thermoelectric generators with enhanced stability against humidity.

         <title>A DNA Logic Circuit Equipped with a Biological Amplifier Loaded into Biomimetic ZIF&#8208;8 Nanoparticles Enables Accurate Identification of Specific Cancers In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amplifier module (AMP) was introduced to boost the signal of the DNA&#8208;based three&#8208;input &#8220;AND&#8221; logic circuit. Three microRNAs abnormally expressed in cancer cells were used as inputs, and all DNA logic circuit and amplifier elements were encapsulated in a ZIF&#8208;8 nano&#8208;carrier, which was then camouflaged with cancer cell membranes for the accurate identification of specific tumor subtypes in vivo.







Abstract
DNA logic circuits (DLC) enable the accurate identification of specific cell types, such as cancer cells, but they face the challenges of weak output signals and a lack of competent platforms that can efficiently deliver DLC components to the target site in the living body. To address these issues, we rationally introduced a cascaded biological amplifier module based on the Primer Exchange Reaction inspired by electronic circuit amplifier devices. As a paradigm, three abnormally expressed Hela cell microRNAs (&#8208;30a, &#8208;17, and &#8208;21) were chosen as &#8220;AND&#8221; gate inputs. DLC response to these inputs was boosted by the amplifier markedly enhancing the output signal. More importantly, the encapsulation of DLC and amplifier components into ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles resulted in their efficient delivery to the target site, successfully distinguishing the Hela tumor subtype from other tumors in vivo. Thus, we envision that this strategy has great potential for clinical cancer diagnosis.

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding Enables a Zwitterionic Mechanism for Macrocyclic Peptide Formation: Computational Mechanistic Studies of CyClick Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a detailed computational investigation on reaction mechanisms of the macrocyclization of linear peptide aldehydes to selectively form imidazolidinone cyclic peptides. Our work demonstrates that intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IMHBs) act as transient internal factors to control stereoselectivity by promoting a kinetically facile zwitterionic mechanism.







Abstract
Macrocyclic peptides have become increasingly important in the pharmaceutical industry. We present a detailed computational investigation of the reaction mechanism of the recently developed &#8220;CyClick&#8221; chemistry to selectively form imidazolidinone cyclic peptides from linear peptide aldehydes, without using catalysts or directing groups (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019, 58, 19073&#8211;19080). We conducted computational mechanistic to investigate the effects of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IMHBs) in promoting a kinetically facile zwitterionic mechanism in &#8220;CyClick&#8221; of pentapeptide aldehyde AFGPA. Our DFT calculations highlighted the importance of IMHB in pre&#8208;organization of the resting state, stabilization of the zwitterion intermediate, and the control of the product stereoselectivity. Furthermore, we have also identified that the low ring strain energy promotes the &#8220;CyClick&#8221; of hexapeptide aldehyde AAGPFA to form a thermodynamically more stable 15+5 imidazolidinone cyclic peptide product. In contrast, large ring strain energy suppresses &#8220;CyClick&#8221; reactivity of tetra peptide aldehyde AFPA from forming the 9+5 imidazolidinone cyclic peptide product.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed FeN2P2 Motif with High Activity and Stability for Oxygen Reduction Reaction Over the Entire pH Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>

A Fe single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst with Fe&#8722;N2P2 coordination motif shows outstanding oxygen reduction activity and stability over the whole pH range. The study provides atomic&#8208;level insight into improving the activity and stability of non&#8208;noble metal ORR catalysts.	







Abstract
The past decade has witnessed the great potential of Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysis in catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, it remains a grand challenge to substantially improve their intrinsic activity and long&#8208;term stability in acidic electrolytes. Herein, we report a facile chemical vapor deposition strategy, by which high&#8208;density Fe atoms (3.97&#8197;wt%) are coordinated with square&#8208;planar para&#8208;positioned nitrogen and phosphorus atoms in a hierarchical carbon framework. The as&#8208;crafted atomically dispersed Fe catalyst (denoted Fe&#8208;SA/PNC) manifests an outstanding activity towards ORR over the entire pH range. Specifically, the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;V, 0.83&#8197;V, and 0.86&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) are attained in alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes, respectively, representing the high performance among reported catalysts to date. Furthermore, after 30,000 durability cycles, the Fe&#8208;SA/PNC remains to be stable with no visible performance decay when tested in 0.1&#8197;M KOH and 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4, and only a minor negative shift of 40&#8197;mV detected in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C counterpart. The coordination motif of Fe&#8208;SA/PNC is validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides atomic&#8208;level insight into improving the activity and stability of non&#8208;noble metal ORR catalysts, opening up an avenue to craft the desired single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts.

         <title>Prolinyl Nucleotides Drive Enzyme&#8208;Free Genetic Copying of RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prolinyl nucleotides are metastable condensation products of an amino acid and ribonucleotides. Their reactivity is reminiscent of nucleoside triphosphates, in that they are incorporated at the terminus of a growing primer in reactions that faithfully copy RNA sequences. These reactions occur in the absence of enzymes or ribozymes.







Abstract
Proline is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. It is found in all kingdoms of life. It also has remarkable activity as an organocatalyst and is of structural importance in many folded polypeptides. Here, we show that prolinyl nucleotides with a phosphoramidate linkage are active building blocks in enzyme&#8208; and ribozyme&#8208;free copying of RNA in the presence of monosubstituted imidazoles as organocatalysts. Both dinucleotides and mononucleotides are incorporated at the terminus of RNA primers in aqueous buffer, as instructed by the template sequence, in up to eight consecutive extension steps. Our results show that condensation products of amino acids and ribonucleotides can act like nucleoside triphosphates in media devoid of enzymes or ribozymes. Prolinyl nucleotides are metastable building blocks, readily activated by catalysts, helping to explain why the combination of &#945;&#8208;amino acids and nucleic acids was selected in molecular evolution.

&lt;p&gt;Prolinyl nucleotides are metastable condensation products of an amino acid and ribonucleotides. Their reactivity is reminiscent of nucleoside triphosphates, in that they are incorporated at the terminus of a growing primer in reactions that faithfully copy RNA sequences. These reactions occur in the absence of enzymes or ribozymes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Biocatalysis by Unspecific Peroxygenases with Genetically Encoded Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have recently gained attraction as versatile oxyfunctionalization catalysts. One shortcoming, however, is their susceptibility towards the co&#8208;substrate hydrogen peroxide. As a solution, the concept of light&#8208;dependent UPO biocatalysis with genetically encoded flavin&#8208;containing photosensitizer proteins for in situ hydrogen peroxide production is introduced.







Abstract
Fungal unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) have gained substantial attention for their versatile oxyfunctionalization chemistry paired with impressive catalytic capabilities. A major drawback, however, remains their sensitivity towards their co&#8208;substrate hydrogen peroxide, necessitating the use of smart in situ hydrogen peroxide generation methods to enable efficient catalysis setups. Herein, we introduce flavin&#8208;containing protein photosensitizers as a new general tool for light&#8208;controlled in situ hydrogen peroxide production. By genetically fusing flavin binding fluorescent proteins and UPOs, we have created two virtually self&#8208;sufficient photo&#8208;enzymes (PhotUPO). Subsequent testing of a versatile substrate panel with the two divergent PhotUPOs revealed two stereoselective conversions. The catalytic performance of the fusion protein was optimized through enzyme and substrate loading variation, enabling up to 24300 turnover numbers (TONs) for the sulfoxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide. The PhotUPO concept was upscaled to a 100&#8197;mg substrate preparative scale, enabling the extraction of enantiomerically pure alcohol products.

         <title>Nanostructure Explains the Behavior of Slippery Covalently Attached Liquid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slippery covalently&#8208;attached liquid surfaces (SCALS) are highly slippery towards liquid droplets, but an understanding of the underpinning mechanism is lacking. This study establishes that a combination of layer uniformity and layer mobility determines optimal SCALS performance. These findings provide insights into SCALS synthesis and nanostructure, enabling rational design of these highly anti&#8208;adhesive surfaces.







Abstract
Slippery covalently&#8208;attached liquid surfaces (SCALS) with low contact angle hysteresis (CAH, &lt;5&#176;) and nanoscale thickness display impressive anti&#8208;adhesive properties, similar to lubricant&#8208;infused surfaces. Their efficacy is generally attributed to the liquid&#8208;like mobility of the constituent tethered chains. However, the precise physico&#8208;chemical properties that facilitate this mobility are unknown, hindering rational design.
This work quantifies the chain length, grafting density, and microviscosity of a range of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) SCALS, elucidating the nanostructure responsible for their properties. Three prominent methods are used to produce SCALS, with characterization carried out via single&#8208;molecule force measurements, neutron reflectometry, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. CO2 snow&#8208;jet cleaning was also shown to reduce the CAH of SCALS via a modification of their grafting density. SCALS behavior can be predicted by reduced grafting density, &#931;, with the lowest water CAH achieved at &#931;&#8776;2. This study provides the first direct examination of SCALS grafting density, chain length, and microviscosity and supports the hypothesis that SCALS properties stem from a balance of layer uniformity and mobility.

         <title>Synchronous Switching of Dielectric Constant and Photoluminescence in Cyanidonitridorhenate&#8208;Based Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular hybrid materials based on tetracyanidonitridorhenate(V) ions bearing diamine ligands exhibit a thermal phase transition related to a change from an ordered to a disordered state of the organic counter&#8208;ions. This leads to a thermal switching of the dielectric constant and the emission features connected with the photoluminescence of the Re(V) complexes.







Abstract
Switching of multiple physical properties by external stimuli in dynamic materials enables applications in, e.g., smart sensors, biomedical tools, as well as data&#8208;storage devices. Among stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, inorganic&#8208;organic molecular hybrids exhibiting thermal order&#8208;disorder phase transitions were tested as promising molecular switches of electrical characteristics, including dielectric constant. We aimed at broadening the multifunctional potential of such hybrid materials towards the switching of not only electrical but also other physical properties, e.g., light emission. We report two ionic salts based on luminescent tetracyanidonitridorhenate(V) anions bearing two different diamine ligands, 1,2&#8208;diaminoethane (1) and 1,3&#8208;diaminopropane (2), both crystallizing with polar N&#8208;methyl&#8208;dabconium cations. They exhibit an order&#8208;disorder phase transition related to the heating&#8208;induced turning&#8208;on of the rotation of polar cations. This leads to a unique synchronous switching of the dielectric constant as well as metal&#8208;complex&#8208;centered photoluminescence, as demonstrated by changes in, e.g., emission lifetime. The roles of organic cations, non&#8208;trivial Re(V) complexes, and their interaction in achieving the coupled thermal switching of electrical and optical properties are discussed utilizing experimental and theoretical approaches.

         <title>Bifunctional Near&#8208;Neutral Electrolyte Enhances Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed KBi/KF (KBi=potassium borate) electrolyte enhances the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at near&#8208;neutral pH via: 1) stabilizing the interfacial pH by forming the BF2(OH)2&#8722; anion; and, 2) activating the interfacial water by F&#8208;containing species.







Abstract
Performance of electrocatalytic reactions depends on not only the composition and structure of the active sites, but also their local environment, including the surrounding electrolyte. In this work, we demonstrate that BF2(OH)2&#8722; anion is the key fluoroborate species formed in the mixed KBi/KF (KBi=potassium borate) electrolyte to enhance the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at near&#8208;neutral pH. Through a combination of electrokinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies, we show that the mixed KBi/KF electrolyte promotes the OER via two pathways: 1) stabilizing the interfacial pH during the proton&#8208;producing reaction with its high buffering capacity; and 2) activating the interfacial water via strong hydrogen bonds with F&#8208;containing species. With the KBi/KF electrolyte, electrodeposited Co(OH)2 is able to achieve 100&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.74&#8197;V, which is among the highest reported activities with earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts at near neutral conditions. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging electrolyte&#8208;engineering for improving the electrochemical performance of the OER.

The STNSP@ELE strategy, employing 2D stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (STNSP) and &#946;&#8208;Elemene (ELE), can repolarize tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in situ, overcome immunosuppression and enhance chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. This study not only demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy of the STNSP&#8208;based nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug strategy for immunosuppressive tumors but also establishes general platforms for 2D nanomaterial&#8208;mediated cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in the immunosuppressive solid tumor microenvironment (TME), yet in situ engineering of TAMs for enhanced tumor immunotherapy remains a significant challenge in translational immuno&#8208;oncology. Here, we report an innovative nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug (STNSP@ELE) strategy that leverages two&#8208;dimensional (2D) stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (STNSP) and &#946;&#8208;Elemene (ELE), a small&#8208;molecule anticancer drug, to overcome TAM&#8208;mediated immunosuppression and improve chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. Our results demonstrate that both STNSP and ELE are capable of polarizing the tumor&#8208;supportive M2&#8208;like TAMs into a tumor&#8208;suppressive M1&#8208;like phenotype, which acts with the ELE chemotherapeutic to boost antitumor responses. In vivo mouse studies demonstrate that STNSP@ELE treatment can reprogram the immunosuppressive TME by significantly increasing the intratumoral ratio of M1/M2&#8208;like TAMs, enhancing the population of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells, and elevating the expression of immunostimulatory cytokines in B16F10 melanomas, thereby promoting a robust antitumor response. Our study not only demonstrates that the STNSP@ELE chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic nanoplatform has immune&#8208;modulatory capabilities that can overcome TAM&#8208;mediated immunosuppression in solid tumors, but also highlights the promise of this nanodrug&#8208;delivering&#8208;drug strategy in developing other nano&#8208;immunotherapeutics and treating various types of immunosuppressive tumors.

         <title>A Supramolecular Naphthalene Diimide Radical Anion with Efficient NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion for E. coli&#8208;Responsive Photothermal Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A supramolecular naphthalene diimide radical anion with efficient NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion is generated through E.&#8197;coli&#8208;induced in situ reduction. It exhibits unexpectedly strong absorption at 1104&#8197;nm and remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency. Therefore, excellent NIR&#8208;II photothermal antimicrobial activity is demonstrated. This work opens a new avenue for constructing NIR&#8208;II dyes on the basis of limited &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures.







Abstract
We report a supramolecular naphthalene diimide (NDI) radical anion with efficient NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion for E.&#8197;coli&#8208;responsive photothermal therapy. The supramolecular radical anion (NDI&#8208;2CB[7])&#8901;&#8722;, which is obtained from the E.&#8197;coli&#8208;induced in situ reduction of NDI&#8208;2CB[7] neutral complex, formed by the host&#8211;guest interaction between an NDI derivative and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), exhibits unexpectedly strong NIR&#8208;II absorption and remarkable photothermal conversion capacity in aqueous solution. The NIR&#8208;II absorption is caused by the self&#8208;assembly of NDI radical anions to form supramolecular dimer radicals in aqueous solution, which is supported by theoretically predicted spectra. The (NDI&#8208;2CB[7])&#8901;&#8722; demonstrates excellent NIR&#8208;II photothermal antimicrobial activity (&gt;99&#8201;%). This work provides a new approach for constructing NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents and non&#8208;contact treatments for bacterial infections.

         <title>Partial Deoxygenative CO Homocoupling by a Diiron Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diiron of a bis(beta&#8208;diketiminate) cyclophane effects the partially deoxygenative homologation of two CO molecules by two sequential one&#8208;electron reduction and silylation reactions to generate a ketenylidene ligand. The ketenylidene can be readily released from the complex along with retention of the dinuclear metal construct.







Abstract
One route to address climate change is converting carbon dioxide to synthetic carbon&#8208;neutral fuels. Whereas carbon dioxide to CO conversion has precedent in homo&#8208; and heterogeneous catalysis, deoxygenative coupling of CO to products with C&#8722;C bonds&#8212;as in liquid fuels&#8212;remains challenging. Here, we report coupling of two CO molecules by a diiron complex. Reduction of Fe2(CO)2L (2), where L2&#8722; is a bis(&#946;&#8208;diketiminate) cyclophane, gives [K(THF)5][Fe2(CO)2L] (3), which undergoes silylation to Fe2(CO)(COSiMe3)L (4). Subsequent C&#8208;OSiMe3 bond cleavage and C=C bond formation occurs upon reduction of 4, yielding Fe2(&#956;&#8208;CCO)L. CO derived ligands in this series mediate weak exchange interactions with the ketenylidene affording the smallest J value, with changes to local metal ion spin states and coupling schemes (ferro&#8208; vs. antiferromagnetism) based on DFT calculations, M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopy. Finally, reaction of 5 with KEt3BH or methanol releases the C2O2&#8722; ligand with retention of the diiron core

         <title>An Asymmetric Hydrogenation/N&#8208;Alkylation Sequence for a Step&#8208;Economical Route to Indolizidines and Quinolizidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric hydrogenation of pyridines and subsequent N&#8208;alkylation lead to indolizidines and quinolizidines. The presence of Cl&#8722; results in retention of the absolute configuration of the initially formed alcohol. Noncovalent interactions, H&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and electrostatic interactions also play important roles in regulating the stereoselectivity of the reaction process.







Abstract
The direct catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of pyridines for the synthesis of piperidines remains a challenge. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot asymmetric hydrogenation of pyridines with subsequent N&#8208;alkylation using a traceless Br&#248;nsted acid activation strategy. Catalyzed by an iridium&#8208;BINAP complex, the substrates undergo ketone reduction, cyclization and pyridine hydrogenation in sequence to form indolizidines and quinolizidines. The absolute configuration of the stereocenter of the alcohol is retained and influences the formation of the second stereocenter. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies reveal that the chloride anion and certain noncovalent interactions govern the stereoselectivity of the cascade reaction throughout the catalytic process.

The assembly line for the fungal hybrid terpenoid saccharide cosmosporaside C (1) has been elucidated. By conducting genome mining from Fusarium orthoceras, a cos cluster was identified. A UbiA family intramembrane prenyltransferase (UbiA&#8208;type PT), a cytochrome P450, an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;hydrolase, an acetyltransferase, a dimethylallyl transferase (DMAT&#8208;type PT), and a glycosyltransferase work in synergy to synthesize 1 using primary central metabolites.







Abstract
Fungal hybrid terpenoid saccharides constitute a new and growing family of natural products with significant biomedical and agricultural activities. One representative family is the cosmosporasides, which feature oxidized terpenoid units and saccharide moieties; however, the assembly line of these building blocks has been elusive. Herein, a cos cluster from Fusarium orthoceras was discovered for the synthesis of cosmosporaside C (1) by genome mining. A UbiA family intramembrane prenyltransferase (UbiA&#8208;type PT), a multifunctional cytochrome P450, an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;hydrolase, an acetyltransferase, a dimethylallyl transferase (DMAT&#8208;type PT) and a glycosyltransferase function cooperatively in the assembly of the scaffold of 1 using primary central metabolites. The absolute configuration at C4, C6 and C7 of 1 was also established. Our work clarifies the unexpected functions of UbiA&#8208;type and DMAT&#8208;type PTs and provides an example for understanding the synthetic logic of hybrid terpenoid saccharides in fungi.

         <title>Zwitterionic Polymeric Sulfur Ylides with Minimal Charge Separation Open a New Generation of Antifouling and Bactericidal Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stronger together: Unlike most zwitterionic materials, including polybetaines, sulfur ylides exhibit minimal charge separation. We show that poly(sulfur ylides) effectively inhibit the adhesion of biomolecules and pathogenic bacteria. Notably, we show that polymeric sulfur ylides create a toxic environment for bacterial cells that surpass the initial hydration barrier while remaining non&#8208;toxic to mammalian cells.







Abstract
Zwitterionic polymers are widely employed hydrophilic building blocks for antifouling coatings with numerous applications across a wide range of fields, including but not limited to biomedical science, drug delivery and nanotechnology. Zwitterionic polymers are considered as an attractive alternative to polyethylene glycol because of their biocompatibility and effectiveness to prevent&#160;formation of biofilms. To this end, zwitterionic polymers are classified in two categories, namely polybetaines and polyampholytes. Yet, despite a fundamental interest to drive the development of new antifouling materials, the chemical composition of zwitterionic polymer remains severely limited. Here, we show that poly(sulfur ylides) that&#160;belong&#160;to the largely overlooked class of poly(ylides),&#160;effectively prevent the&#160;formation of biofilms from pathogenic bacteria. While surface energy analysis reveals strong hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor capabilities of poly(sulfur ylide), membrane damage of pathogenic bacteria induced by poly(sulfur ylides) indicates toxicity towards bacteria while not affecting eucaryotic cells. Such synergistic effect of poly(sulfur ylides) offers distinct advantages over polyethylene glycol when designing new antifouling materials. We expect that our findings will pave the way for the development of a range of ylide&#8208;based materials with antifouling properties that have yet to be explored, opening up new directions at the interface of chemistry, biology, and material science.

         <title>The Role of Chemically Innocent Polyanions in Active, Chemically Fueled Complex Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In chemically fueled complex coacervates, the binding affinity of a peptide building block towards a polyanion can be tuned by a chemical reaction cycle. Beyond the kinetics of the reaction cycle, the interaction of the precursor peptide with the polyanion can influence the droplet lifetime significantly. Strong interactions between the peptide and the polyelectrolytes lead to delayed dissolution of the active droplets but can be controlled further.







Abstract
Complex coacervation describes the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of oppositely charged polymers. Active coacervates are droplets in which one of the electrolyte's affinity is regulated by chemical reactions. These droplets are particularly interesting because they are tightly regulated by reaction kinetics. For example, they serve as a model for membraneless organelles that are also often regulated by biochemical transformations such as post&#8208;translational modifications. They are also a great protocell model or could be used to synthesize life&#8211;they spontaneously emerge in response to reagents, compete, and decay when all nutrients have been consumed. However, the role of the unreactive building blocks, e.g., the polymeric compounds, is poorly understood. Here, we show the important role of the chemically innocent, unreactive polyanion of our chemically fueled coacervation droplets. We show that the polyanion drastically influences the resulting droplets&#8242; life cycle without influencing the chemical reaction cycle&#8211;either they are very dynamic or have a delayed dissolution. Additionally, we derive a mechanistic understanding of our observations and show how additives and rational polymer design help to create the desired coacervate emulsion life cycles.

         <title>A Screening Protocol for Exploring Loop Length Requirements for the Formation of a Three Cytosine&#8208;Cytosine+ Base&#8208;Paired i&#8208;Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interactive protocol for the identification of minimal sequence requirements for i&#8208;Motif (iM) folding was developed. It allowed the resolution by NMR of the simplest intra&#8208;molecular iM with an odd number of cytosine&#8208;cytosine+ (CC+) base pairs. The experimental design revealed the minimal number of nucleotides in the loops&#8211;2 and 3 in the minor and major groove, respectively&#8211;with a preference for the 5&#8242; localization of the outmost CC+ base pair.







Abstract
DNA sequences containing at least four runs of repetitive cytosines can fold into tetra&#8208;helical structures called i&#8208;Motifs (iMs). The interest in these DNA secondary structures is increasing due to their therapeutical and technological applications. Still, limited knowledge of their folding requirements is currently available. We developed a novel step&#8208;by&#8208;step pipeline for the systematic screening of putative iM&#8208;forming model sequences. Focusing on structures comprising only three cytosine&#8208;cytosine+ base pairs, we investigated what the minimal lengths of the loops required for formation of an intra&#8208;molecular iM are. Our data indicate that two and three nucleotides are required to connect the strands through the minor and majorgrooves of the iM, respectively. Additionally, they highlight an asymmetric behavior according to the distribution of the cytosines. Specifically, no sequence containing a single cytosine in the first and third run was able to fold into intra&#8208;molecular iMs with the same stability of those formed when the first and the third run comprise two cytosines. This knowledge represents a step forward toward the development of prediction tools for the proper identification of biologically functional iMs, as well as for the rational design of these secondary structures as technological devices.

         <title>Reversely Trapping Isolated Atoms in High Oxidation State for Accelerating the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable atom&#8208;trapping strategy is developed to extract isolated Mo atom from the a&#8208;MoOx@CoSe2 pre&#8208;catalyst into CoOOH through an ultra&#8208;fast self&#8208;reconstruction process during the OER process. The single Mo&#8208;atom decoration shifts the oxidation cycle of Co sites towards a more energetically favored rate&#8208;limiting process, resulting in outstanding OER activity.







Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount to the energy conversion and storage devices. However, the structural complexity of heterogeneous electrocatalysts makes it a great challenge to elucidate the dynamic structural evolution and OER mechanisms. Here, we develop a controllable atom&#8208;trapping strategy to extract isolated Mo atom from the amorphous MoOx&#8208;decorated CoSe2 (a&#8208;MoOx@CoSe2) pre&#8208;catalyst into Co&#8208;based oxyhydroxide (Mo&#8208;CoOOH) through an ultra&#8208;fast self&#8208;reconstruction process during the OER process. This conceptual advance has been validated by operando characterizations, which reveals that the initially rapid Mo leaching can expedite the dynamic reconstruction of pre&#8208;catalyst, and simultaneously trap Mo species in high oxidation state into the lattice of in situ generated CoOOH support. Impressively, the OER kinetics of CoOOH has been greatly accelerated after the reverse decoration of Mo species, in which the Mo&#8208;CoOOH affords a markedly decreased overpotential of 297&#8197;mV at the current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Co species have been greatly activated via the effective electron coupling with Mo species in high oxidation state. These findings open new avenues toward directly synthesizing atomically dispersed electrocatalysts for high&#8208;efficiency water splitting.

Here, we develop a controllable atom-trapping strategy to extract isolated Mo atom from the amorphous MoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-decorated CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (a-MoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) pre-catalyst into Co-based oxyhydroxide (Mo-CoOOH) through an ultra-fast self-reconstruction process during the OER process. This conceptual advance has been validated by &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; characterizations, which reveals that the initially rapid Mo leaching can expedite the dynamic reconstruction of pre-catalyst, and simultaneously trap Mo species in high oxidation state into the lattice of &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; generated CoOOH support. Impressively, the OER kinetics of CoOOH has been greatly accelerated after the reverse decoration of Mo species, in which the Mo-CoOOH affords a markedly decreased overpotential of 297&#8197;mV at the current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Co species have been greatly activated via the effective electron coupling with Mo species in high oxidation state. These findings open new avenues toward directly synthesizing atomically dispersed electrocatalysts for high-efficiency water splitting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Engineering for Efficient Low&#8208;Temperature Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a high&#8208;quality SnO2 layer with decreased adsorbed oxygen (Ochem) active sites and oxygen vacancies (Ovac) was fabricated on a flexible substrate by introducing TiCl4 into the SnO2 bulk layer. The first evidence of flexible perovskite cells working at low temperature was demonstrated, with efficiency as high as 23.7&#8201;% based on an improved SnO2 layer.







Abstract
Photovoltaic technology with low weight, high specific power in cold environments, and compatibility with flexible fabrication is highly desired for near&#8208;space vehicles and polar region applications. Herein, we demonstrate efficient low&#8208;temperature flexible perovskite solar cells by improving the interfacial contact between electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and perovskite layer. We find that the adsorbed oxygen active sites and oxygen vacancies of flexible tin oxide (SnO2) ETL layer can be effectively decreased by incorporating a trace amount of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). The effective defects elimination at the interfacial increases the electron mobility of flexible SnO2 layer, regulates band alignment at the perovskite/SnO2 interface, induces larger perovskite crystal growth, and improves charge collection efficiency in a complete solar cell. Correspondingly, the improved interfacial contact transforms into high&#8208;performance solar cells under one&#8208;sun illumination (AM 1.5G) with efficiencies up to 23.7&#8201;% at 218&#8197;K, which might open up a new era of application of this emerging flexible photovoltaic technology to low&#8208;temperature environments such as near&#8208;space and polar regions.

         <title>The S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; Pocket of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Is Critical for Substrate Selectivity and Can Be Targeted with Covalent Inhibitors</title>

Substrate&#8208;peptide screening for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro was performed to select suitable residues for the S1&#8242;&#8211;S4&#8242; sites of Mpro. The Ala&#8722;Ile&#8722;Phe (AIF) motif was chosen as the scaffold for discovering inhibitors that target the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket. Warhead screening and structure&#8211;activity relationship studies revealed a covalent inhibitor, D&#8208;4&#8211;77, with an &#945;&#8208;bromoacetamide warhead that exhibited potent inhibitory activity in vitro.







Abstract
The main protease (Mpro) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is a well&#8208;characterized target for antiviral drug discovery. To date, most antiviral drug discovery efforts have focused on the S4&#8211;S1&#8242; pocket of Mpro; however, it is still unclear whether the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket per se can serve as a new site for drug discovery. In this study, the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket of Mpro was found to differentially recognize viral peptidyl substrates. For instance, S3&#8242; in Mpro strongly favors Phe or Trp, and S1&#8242; favors Ala. The peptidyl inhibitor D&#8208;4&#8211;77, which possesses an &#945;&#8208;bromoacetamide warhead, was discovered to be a promising inhibitor of Mpro, with an IC50 of 0.95&#8197;&#956;M and an antiviral EC50 of 0.49&#8197;&#956;M. The Mpro/inhibitor co&#8208;crystal structure confirmed the binding mode of the inhibitor to the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket and revealed a covalent mechanism. In addition, D&#8208;4&#8211;77 functions as an immune protectant and suppresses SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro&#8208;induced antagonism of the host NF&#8208;&#954;B innate immune response. These findings indicate that the S1&#8242;&#8211;S3&#8242; pocket of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro is druggable, and that inhibiting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Mpro can simultaneously protect human innate immunity and inhibit virion assembly.

By linking the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene group to the diarylboron&#8208;substituted isoquinolinyl moiety, two Ir(III) complexes were successfully obtained to show narrowband pure near&#8208;infrared emissions peaking around 730&#8197;nm with high photoluminescence efficiencies. Moreover, they could show impressively high electroluminescent performance in solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode with external quantum efficiency up to 16.43&#8201;%.







Abstract
Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters have significant applications in medical and optoelectronic fields, but the development stays a great challenge due to the energy gap law. Here, we report two NIR phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes which display emission peaks around 730&#8197;nm with a narrow full width at half maximum of only 43&#8197;nm. Therefore, pure NIR luminescence can be obtained without having a very long emission wavelength, thus alleviating the restriction of the energy gap law, and obtaining impressively high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 0.70. More importantly, the pure NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) fabricated by the solution&#8208;processed mothed shows outstanding device performance with the highest external quantum efficiency of 16.43&#8201;%, which sets a new record for solution&#8208;processed NIR&#8208;OLEDs based on different emitters. This work sheds light on the development of Ir(III) complexes with narrowband emissions as highly efficient pure NIR&#8208;emitters.

         <title>Enhancing Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence via Integrated Top&#8208;Down and Bottom&#8208;Up Approach</title>

Integrating bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down supramolecular methods enables substantial increases in the luminescence dissymmetry factor and the photoluminescence quantum yield.







Abstract
In the dynamic domain of chiroptical technologies, it is imperative to engineer emitters endowed with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties. This research demonstrates an advancement by employing a combined top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up strategy for the simultaneous amplification of photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;) and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum). Square&#8208;planar Pt(II) complexes form helical assemblies, driven by torsional strain induced by bis(nonyl) chains. Integration of chiral anions leads these assemblies to prefer distinct helical sense. This arrangement activates the metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MMLCT) transition that is CPL&#8208;active, with &#934; and |glum| observing an upswing contingent on the charge number and aryl substituents in chiral anions. Utilizing the soft&#8208;lithographic micromolding in capillaries technique, we could fabricate exquisitely&#8208;ordered, one&#8208;dimensional co&#8208;assemblies to achieve the metrics to &#934; of 0.32 and |glum| of 0.13. Finally, our spectroscopic research elucidates the underlying mechanism for the dual amplification, making a significant stride in the advancement of CPL&#8208;active emitters.

&lt;p&gt;In the dynamic domain of chiroptical technologies, it is imperative to engineer emitters endowed with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties. This research demonstrates an advancement by employing a combined top-down and bottom-up strategy for the simultaneous amplification of photoluminescence quantum yield (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;) and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;). Square-planar Pt(II) complexes form helical assemblies, driven by torsional strain induced by bis(nonyl) chains. Integration of chiral anions leads these assemblies to prefer distinct helical sense. This arrangement activates the metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MMLCT) transition that is CPL-active, with &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt; and |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| observing an upswing contingent on the charge number and aryl substituents in chiral anions. Utilizing the soft-lithographic micromolding in capillaries technique, we could fabricate exquisitely-ordered, one-dimensional co-assemblies to achieve the metrics to &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt; of 0.32 and |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| of 0.13. Finally, our spectroscopic research elucidates the underlying mechanism for the dual amplification, making a significant stride in the advancement of CPL-active emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Driven, Switchable Catalysis Based on Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembly of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the phosphorylation regulation of reactive sites of natural enzymes, this work focuses on the de novo design of peptide&#8208;based enzyme mimetics with switchable catalytic activity. The zipper&#8208;like four&#8208;ligand structure on the peptide/Cu assemblies is the catalytically active center, imparting these enzyme mimetics with remarkable activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Covalent regulatory systems of enzymes are widely used to modulate biological enzyme activities. Inspired by the regulation of reactive&#8208;site phosphorylation in organisms, we developed peptide&#8208;based catecholase mimetics with switchable catalytic activity and high selectivity through the co&#8208;assembly of nanofibers comprising peptides and copper ions (Cu2+). Through careful design and modification of the peptide backbone structure based on the change in the free energy of the system, we identified the peptide with the most effective reversible catalytic activity. Kinase/phosphatase switches were used to control the reversible transition of nanofiber formation and depolymerization, as well as to modulate the active&#8208;site microenvironment. Notably, the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly processes of nanofibers were simulated using coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics. Furthermore, theoretical calculations confirmed the coordination of the peptide and Cu2+, forming a zipper&#8208;like four&#8208;ligand structure at the catalytically active center of the nanofibers. Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the catalytic mechanism. This study opens novel avenues for designing biomimetic enzymes with ordered structures and dynamic catalytic activities.

         <title>Synthetic Heparanase Inhibitors Can Prevent Herpes Simplex Viral Spread</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of heparan sulfate (HS) oligossacharides was synthesized by a modular synthetic approach and evaluated as human heparanase (Hpse) inhibitors. Treatment of herpes simplex&#8208;1 virus (HSV&#8208;1) infected corneal epithelial cells with synthetic HS oligosaccharide inhibitors prevented shedding of cell&#8208;surface HS, thereby impeding viral release and spread to other cells.







Abstract
Herpes simplex virus (HSV&#8208;1) employs heparan sulfate (HS) as receptor for cell attachment and entry. During late&#8208;stage infection, the virus induces the upregulation of human heparanase (Hpse) to remove cell surface HS allowing viral spread. We hypothesized that inhibition of Hpse will prevent viral release thereby representing a new therapeutic strategy for HSV&#8208;1. A range of HS&#8208;oligosaccharides was prepared to examine the importance of chain length and 2&#8208;O&#8208;sulfation of iduronic moieties for Hpse inhibition. It was found that hexa&#8208; and octasaccharides potently inhibited the enzyme and that 2&#8208;O&#8208;sulfation of iduronic acid is tolerated. Computational studies provided a rationale for the observed structure&#8211;activity relationship. Treatment of human corneal epithelial cells (HCEs) infected with HSV&#8208;1 with the hexa&#8208; and octasaccharide blocked viral induced shedding of HS which significantly reduced spread of virions. The compounds also inhibited migration and proliferation of immortalized HCEs thereby providing additional therapeutic properties.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Site&#8208;Switchable Hydroarylation of Alkenes Controlled by Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed remote site&#8208;switchable hydroarylation of alkenes controlled by two different ligands was reported. The protocol enables access to the products functionalized at the subterminal methylene and terminal methyl positions on an alkyl chain in good results. The results of the control experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the reaction involves a chain&#8208;walking process and the modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8208;type mechanism.







Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed remote site&#8208;switchable hydroarylation of alkenes was reported, delivering the products functionalized at the subterminal methylene and terminal methyl positions on an alkyl chain controlled by two different ligands, respectively, in good yields and with good to excellent site&#8208;selectivities. The catalytic system showed good functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope, including unactivated and activated alkenes. More importantly, the regioconvergent transformations of mixtures of isomeric alkenes were also successfully realized. The results of the mechanistic studies demonstrate that the reaction undergoes a chain&#8208;walking process to give an [Ar&#8722;Ir&#8722;H] complex of terminal alkene. The subsequent processes proceed through the modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod&#8208;type mechanism via the migratory insertion of terminal alkene into the Ir&#8722;C bond followed by C&#8722;H reductive elimination to afford the hydrofunctionalization products site&#8208;selectively.

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products by Hydrophobicity&#8208;Induced Electro&#8208;Kinetic Retardation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electro&#8208;kinetic retardation strategy was developed to promote CO2 electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbon products. Slow reaction kinetics induced by the strong hydrophobicity of the ionomer prolongs the *CO intermediate residence on Cu surfaces, increasing the probability of C&#8722;C coupling. As a result, a multi&#8208;carbon product Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;90&#8201;% was achieved at a partial current density of 223&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Advancing the performance of the Cu&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is crucial for its practical applications. Still, the wettable pristine Cu surface often suffers from low exposure to CO2, reducing the Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) and current densities for multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. Recent studies have proposed that increasing surface availability for CO2 by cation&#8208;exchange ionomers can enhance the C2+ product formation rates. However, due to the rapid formation and consumption of *CO, such promotion in reaction kinetics can shorten the residence of *CO whose adsorption determines C2+ selectivity, and thus the resulting C2+ FEs remain low. Herein, we discover that the electro&#8208;kinetic retardation caused by the strong hydrophobicity of quaternary ammonium group&#8208;functionalized polynorbornene ionomers can greatly prolong the *CO residence on Cu. This unconventional electro&#8208;kinetic effect is demonstrated by the increased Tafel slopes and the decreased sensitivity of *CO coverage change to potentials. As a result, the strongly hydrophobic Cu electrodes exhibit C2+ Faradaic efficiencies of &#8776;90&#8201;% at a partial current density of 223&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, more than twice of bare or hydrophilic Cu surfaces.

A linker dimer acceptor (DOY&#8208;TVT) was designed and synthesized. When incorporation of the DOY&#8208;TVT in D18:N3 system, the ductility and morphological stability of ternary blend films was successfully improved. A stabilized PCE of 18.06&#8201;% was obtained for flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) with ultrahigh mechanical robustness by incorporating DOY&#8208;TVT. Impressively, the optimal f&#8208;OSCs retain 97&#8201;% of the initial PCE even after 3000 bending cycles.







Abstract
The wearable application of flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) necessitates high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness. However, photoactive films based on efficient non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) are typically brittle, leading to poor mechanical stability in devices. In this study, we achieved a remarkable PCE of 18.06&#8201;% in f&#8208;OSCs while maintaining ultrahigh mechanical robustness (with a crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) of higher than 11&#8201;%) by incorporating a linker dimerized acceptor (DOY&#8208;TVT). Compared to binary blends, ternary systems exhibit reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, suppressed crystallization and diffusion of NF&#8208;SMAs, and improved load distribution across the chain networks, enabling the dissipation of the load energy. Thus, the ternary f&#8208;OSCs developed in this study achieved, high PCE and stability, surpassing binary OSCs. Moreover, the developed f&#8208;OSCs retained 97&#8201;% of the initial PCE even after 3000 bending cycles, indicating excellent mechanical stability (9.1&#8201;% higher than binary systems). Furthermore, the rigid device with inverted structure based on the optimal active layer exhibited a substantial increase in efficiency retention, with 89.6&#8201;% after 865&#8197;h at 85&#8201;&#176;C and 93&#8201;% after more than 1300&#8197;h of shelf storage at 25&#8201;&#176;C. These findings highlight the potential of the linker oligomer acceptor for realizing high&#8208;performing f&#8208;OSCs with ultrahigh mechanical robustness.

         <title>Chemodivergent Staudinger Reactions of Secondary Phosphine Oxides and Application to the Total Synthesis of LL&#8211;D05139&#946; Potassium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented chemodivergent Staudinger reactions of secondary phosphine oxides (SPO) have been developed. Reagent&#8208;controlled 1&#8208; or 2&#8208;nitrogen atom exclusions from azides have been achieved. Conversion of a chiral SPO to a phosphinic amide was stereoretentive, and the potassium salt of natural product LL&#8208;D05139&#946; was synthesized for the first time.







Abstract
Unprecedented Staudinger reaction modes of secondary phosphine oxides (SPO) and organic azides are herein disclosed. By the application of various additives, selective nitrogen atom exclusion from the azide group has been achieved. Chlorotrimethylsilane mediates a stereoretentive Staudinger reaction with a 2&#8208;N exclusion which provides a valuable method for the synthesis of phosphinic amides and can be considered complementary to the stereoinvertive Atherton&#8211;Todd reaction. Alternatively, a 1&#8208;N exclusion pathway is promoted by acetic acid to provide the corresponding diazo compound. The effectiveness of this protocol has been further demonstrated by the total synthesis of the diazo&#8208;containing natural product LL&#8208;D05139&#946;, which was prepared as a potassium salt for the first time in 6&#8197;steps and 26.5&#8201;% overall yield.

         <title>Metal Free D&#246;tz&#8208;Type Aminobenzannulation Reaction via 1,1&#8208;Dipoles Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal free D&#246;tz&#8208;type Aminobenzannulation reaction via 1,1&#8208;dipoles cross&#8208;coupling is achieved. 100 examples including anilines, fused aryl amines and fused heteroaryl amines were synthesized through this versatile and practical strategy with broad substrate scope. Experimental and computational evidence confirms the key intermediate ketenimine, elucidates the reaction mechanism, and demonstrates the chemoselectivity in this approach.







Abstract
Aryl amines are of constant interest in organic synthesis owing to their ubiquity in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic materials. However, C&#8722;H amination or pre&#8208;functionalization frequently results in uncontrollable site selectivity, over activation and the generation of inseparable mixtures of regio&#8208;isomers. Here we present a novel metal free D&#246;tz&#8208;type aminobenzannulation reaction that circumvents the selectivity issues inherent in aromatic chemistry, as well as the use of stoichiometric unstable organolithium reagents and toxic chromium complexes. The concept of utilizing readily available isocyanides and Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) carbonates to achieve 1,1&#8208;dipoles cross&#8208;coupling to construct ketenimine is the key to success, which has been experimentally and computationally verified. The tandem 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/aromatization process offers a versatile method for synthesizing functionalized anilines, fused aryl amines and fused heteroaryl amines.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Trehalose Additive for Reversible Zinc Anodes with Improved Stability and Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trehalose (THL) is reported as electrolyte additive for the stabilization of zinc anodes. THL breaks the H&#8208;bond network of water and improves the interfacial reaction kinetics, realizing a stable and flat Zn deposition with exposure of the (002) plane. A highly reversible Zn anode was obtained, exhibiting a high CE of 99.8&#8201;% for 3000 cycles in Zn/Cu cells and a stable cycling for 1500&#8197;h under 9.0&#8201;% DOD in Zn symmetric cells.







Abstract
The moderate reversibility of Zn anodes, as a long&#8208;standing challenge in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, promotes the exploration of suitable electrolyte additives continuously. It is crucial to establish the absolute predominance of smooth deposition within multiple interfacial reactions for stable zinc anodes, including suppressing side parasitic reactions and facilitating Zn plating process. Trehalose catches our attention due to the reported mechanisms in sustaining biological stabilization. In this work, the inter&#8208;disciplinary application of trehalose is reported in the electrolyte modification for the first time. The pivotal roles of trehalose in suppressed hydrogen evolution and accelerated Zn deposition have been investigated based on the principles of thermodynamics as well as reaction kinetics. The electrodeposit changes from random accumulation of flakes to dense bulk with (002)&#8208;plane exposure due to the unlocked crystal&#8208;face oriented deposition with trehalose addition. As a result, the highly reversible Zn anode is obtained, exhibiting a high average CE of 99.8&#8201;% in the Zn/Cu cell and stable cycling over 1500&#8197;h under 9.0&#8201;% depth of discharge in the Zn symmetric cell. The designing principles and mechanism analysis in this study could serve as a source of inspiration in exploring novel additives for advanced Zn anodes.

         <title>Enhanced Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation by Interfacial Phase Transition and Photothermal Effect in Multiply Heterostructured Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S Nanohybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the low formation energy of Co3S4/Cu2S interface (&#8722;7.61&#8197;eV), the integration of Co9S8 and Cu2S tends to induce the interface phase transition of Co9S8, leading to multiple heterogeneous Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S nanohybrids, with reduced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) energy barrier, increased charge carrier density and notable photothermal effect, thereby contributing to remarkable electrocatalytic OER and overall water splitting performances.







Abstract
The rational design of advanced nanohybrids (NHs) with optimized interface electronic environment and rapid reaction kinetics is pivotal to electrocatalytic schedule. Herein, we developed a multiple heterogeneous Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S nanoparticle in which Co3S4 germinates between Co9S8 and Cu2S. Using high&#8208;angle annular&#8208;dark&#8208;field imaging and theoretical calculation, it was found that the integration of Co9S8 and Cu2S tends to trigger the interface phase transition of Co9S8, leading to Co3S4 interlayer due to the low formation energy of Co3S4/Cu2S (&#8722;7.61&#8197;eV) than Co9S8/Cu2S (&#8722;5.86&#8197;eV). Such phase transition not only lowers the energy barrier of oxygen evolution reaction (OER, from 0.335&#8197;eV to 0.297&#8197;eV), but also increases charge carrier density (from 7.76&#215;1014 to 2.09&#215;1015&#8197;cm&#8722;3), and creates more active sites. Compared to Co9S8 and Cu2S, the Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S NHs also demonstrate notable photothermal effect that can heat the catalyst locally, offset the endothermic enthalpy change of OER, and promote carrier migrate, reaction intermediates adsorption/deprotonation to improve reaction kinetics. Profiting from these favorable factors, the Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S catalyst only requires an OER overpotential of 181&#8197;mV and overall water splitting cell voltage of 1.43&#8197;V to driven 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under the irradiation of near&#8208;infrared light, outperforming those without light irradiation and many reported Co&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Deciphering the Primary Role of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X Hydrogen Bonding in Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>

Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X (X=N or C) hydrogen bonding interactions play a directing role in gold catalysis. DFT calculations on the free energy profile of the experimentally studied multicomponent A3&#8208;coupling reaction and topological analysis of the intermediates and transition states provide direct evidences.







Abstract
Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X (X=N or C) hydrogen bonding is gaining increasing interest, both in the study of its intrinsic nature and in their operability in different fields. While the role of these interactions has been studied in the stabilization of gold(I) complexes, their role during the minimum free energy reaction pathway of a given catalytic process remains unexplored. We report herein that complex [Au(C&#8801;CPh)(pip)] (pip=piperidine) catalyses the A3&#8208;coupling reaction for the synthesis of propargylamines, thanks to the ability of Au(I) to promote weak hydrogen bonding interactions with the reactants along the free energy profile. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show that these Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;X interactions play a directing role in the catalysed A3&#8208;coupling. Topological non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI), interaction region indicator (IRI) and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis in real space of the electron density provide a description of these interactions accurately.

         <title>Hollow STW&#8208;Type Zeolite Single Crystals with Aluminum Gradient for Highly Selective Production of p&#8208;Xylene from Methanol&#8208;Toluene Alkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical hollow single crystal STW&#8208;type zeolite is directly prepared in an alkalinous fluoride medium and exhibits excellent catalytic performance in toluene methylation reactions to p&#8208;xylene.







Abstract
Zeolites with uniform micropores are important shape&#8208;selective catalysts. However, the external acid sites of zeolites have a negative impact on shape&#8208;selective catalysis, and the microporosity may lead to serious diffusion limitation. Herein, we report on the direct synthesis of hierarchical hollow STW&#8208;type zeolite single crystals with a siliceous exterior. In an alkalinous fluoride medium, the nucleation of highly siliceous STW zeolites takes place first, and the nanocrystals are preferentially aligned on the outer surface of the gel agglomerates to grow into single crystalline shells upon crystallization. The lagged crystallization of the internal Al&#8208;rich amorphous gels onto the inner surface of nanocrystalline zeolite shells leads to the formation of hollow cavities in the core of the zeolite crystals. The hollow zeolite single crystals possess a low&#8208;to&#8208;high aluminum gradient from the surface to the core, resulting in an intrinsic inert external surface, and exhibit superior catalytic performance in toluene methylation reactions.

         <title>Potential Controllable Redox Couple for Mild and Efficient Lithium Recovery from Spent Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from their tunable electron affinities and tailored potential, PAHs were used to extract active lithium from spent batteries without discharging. Furthermore, the reducing Li&#8208;PAHs solution can be used for direct regeneration of spent cathodes and pre&#8208;lithiation of anodes, which has great prospects in the sustainable development of the battery recycling industry.







Abstract
The prosperity of the lithium&#8208;ion battery market is dialectically accompanied by the depletion of corresponding resources and the accumulation of spent batteries. It is an urgent priority to develop green and efficient battery recycling strategies for helping ease resources and environmental pressures at the current stage. Here, we propose a mild and efficient lithium extracting strategy based on potential controllable redox couples. Active lithium in the spent battery without discharging is extracted using a series of tailored aprotic solutions comprised of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ethers. This ensures a safe yet efficient recycling process with nearly &#8776;100&#8201;% lithium recovery. We further investigate the Li+&#8208;electron concerted redox reactions and the effect of solvation structure on kinetics during the extraction, and broaden the applicability of the Li&#8208;PAHs solution. This work can stimulate new inspiration for designing novel solutions to meet efficient and sustainable demands in recycling batteries.

         <title>Multiblock Copolymers Based on Highly Crystalline Polyethylene and Soft Poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) Segments: Towards Polyolefin Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Block copolymers of highly crystalline polyethylene and soft ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) were prepared in a single reactor by coordinative chain transfer polymerization. Triblock and multiblock copolymers self&#8208;organized into lamellar structures and displayed excellent mechanical properties leading to a new class of polyolefin thermoplastic elastomers.







Abstract
Block copolymers based on polyethylene (PE) and ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) were obtained by successive controlled coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) of a mixture of ethylene and butadiene (80/20) and pure ethylene. EBR&#8208;b&#8208;PE diblock copolymers were synthesized using the {Me2Si(C13H8)2Nd(BH4)2Li(THF)}2 complex in combination with n&#8208;butyl,n&#8208;octyl magnesium (BOMAG) used as both the alkylating and chain transfer agent (CTA). Triblock and multiblock copolymers featuring highly semi&#8208;crystalline PE hard segments and soft EBR segments were further obtained by the development of a bimetallic CTA, the pentanediyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;di(magnesium bromide) (PDMB).

     alt="Multiblock Copolymers Based on Highly Crystalline Polyethylene and Soft Poly(ethylene-co-butadiene) Segments: Towards Polyolefin Thermoplastic Elastomers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block copolymers of highly crystalline polyethylene and soft ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) were prepared in a single reactor by coordinative chain transfer polymerization. Triblock and multiblock copolymers self-organized into lamellar structures and displayed excellent mechanical properties leading to a new class of polyolefin thermoplastic elastomers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block copolymers based on polyethylene (PE) and ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) were obtained by successive controlled coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) of a mixture of ethylene and butadiene (80/20) and pure ethylene. EBR-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PE diblock copolymers were synthesized using the {Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si(C&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Nd(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li(THF)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex in combination with n-butyl,n-octyl magnesium (BOMAG) used as both the alkylating and chain transfer agent (CTA). Triblock and multiblock copolymers featuring highly semi-crystalline PE hard segments and soft EBR segments were further obtained by the development of a bimetallic CTA, the pentanediyl-1,5-di(magnesium bromide) (PDMB). These new block copolymers undergo crystallization-driven organization into lamellar structures and exhibit a variety of mechanical properties, including excellent extensibility and elastic recovery in the case of triblock and multiblock copolymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diaryl Dihydrophenazine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers Enhance Synergistic Catalysis in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diaryl dihydrophenazine&#8208;based porous organic polymers display extraordinary activities toward visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P bond forming cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The enhanced activity and stability of the porous organic polymers over small molecular counterparts leads to a more than 30&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity and enables catalyst recovery and reuse.







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged as a novel class of porous materials that are synthesized by the polymerization of various organic monomers with different geometries and topologies. The molecular tunability of organic building blocks allows the incorporation of functional units for photocatalytic organic transformations. Here, we report the synthesis of two POP&#8208;based photocatalysts via homopolymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized diaryl dihydrophenazine (DADHP) monomer (POP1) and copolymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized DADHP and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine monomers (POP2). The fluorescence lifetimes of DADHP units in the POPs significantly increased, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performances over homogeneous controls. POP1 is highly effective in catalysing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven C&#8722;N bond forming cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Upon coordination with Ni2+ ions, POP2&#8208;Ni shows strong synergy between photocatalytic and Ni catalytic cycles due to the confinement effect within the POP framework, leading to high efficiency in energy, electron, and organic radical transfer. POP2&#8208;Ni displays excellent activity in catalysing C&#8722;P bond forming reactions between diarylphosphine oxides and aryl iodides. They increased the photocatalytic activities by more than 30&#8208;fold in C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These POP catalysts were readily recovered via centrifugal separation and reused in six catalytic cycles without loss of activities. Thus, photosensitizer&#8208;based POPs provide a promising platform for heterogeneous photocatalytic organic transformations.

         <title>Regulating Relative Nitrogen Locations of Diazine Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relative nitrogen locations of diazine rings on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are finely tailored to maximize the photocatalytic performance for producing H2O2 with O2 and pure water. Benefiting from effective electron&#8208;hole separation, low charge transfer resistance, and reactive sites for the direct 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway, the pyridazine&#8208;based COF exhibits an excellent H2O2 production rate of 7327&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising candidates for the overall photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the effects of the relative nitrogen locations remain obscured and photocatalytic performances of COFs need to be further improved. Herein, a collection of COFs functionalized by various diazines including pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine have been judiciously designed and synthesized for photogeneration of H2O2 without sacrificial agents. Compared with pyrimidine and pyrazine, pyridazine embedded in TpDz tends to stabilize endoperoxide intermediate species, leading toward the more efficient direct 2e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. Benefiting from the effective electron&#8208;hole separation, low charge transfer resistance, and high&#8208;efficiency ORR pathway, an excellent production rate of 7327&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) value of 0.62&#8201;% has been achieved by TpDz, which ranks one of the best COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work might shed fresh light on the rational design of functional COFs targeting photocatalysts in H2O2 production.

         <title>Annulation&#8208;Induced Hidden Reactivity of the 1,2,4&#8208;Triazole Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual hidden reactivity of the 1,2,4&#8208;triazole backbone was unveiled that involves the elusive N&#8722;N bond&#8208;cleaving ring&#8208;opening reaction. This reactivity allows access to a novel class of unsymmetrically substituted 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamines (dpa), which were used to prepare unsymmetrical boron aza&#8208;dipyridylmethene fluorescent dyes suitable for intracellular selective lipid droplet imaging studies.







Abstract
Triazoles are an important class of compounds with widespread applications. Functionalization of the triazole backbone is thus of significant interest. In comparison to 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles, C&#8722;H activation&#8208;functionalization of the congeners 1,2,4&#8208;triazoles is surprisingly underdeveloped. Indeed, no such C&#8722;H activation&#8208;functionalization has been reported for 4&#8208;substituted 1,2,4&#8208;triazole cores. Furthermore, although denitrogenative ring&#8208;opening of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles is well&#8208;explored, 1,2,4&#8208;triazole/triazolium substrates have not been known to exhibit N&#8722;N bond&#8208;cleaving ring&#8208;opening reactivity so far. In this work, we unveiled an unusual hidden reactivity of the 1,2,4&#8208;triazole backbone involving the elusive N&#8722;N bond&#8208;cleaving ring&#8208;opening reaction. This new reactivity was induced by a Satoh&#8208;Miura&#8208;type C&#8722;H activation&#8208;annulation at the 1,2,4&#8208;triazole motif appended with a pyridine directing group. This unique reaction allowed ready access to a novel class of unsymmetrically substituted 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamines, with one pyridine ring fully&#8208;substituted with alkyl groups. The unsymmetrical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridylamines were utilized to access unsymmetrical boron&#8208;aza&#8208;dipyridylmethene fluorescent dyes. Empowered with desirable optical/physical properties such as large Stokes shifts and suitable hydrophobicity arising from optimal alkyl chain length at the fully&#8208;substituted pyridine&#8208;ring, these dyes were used for intracellular lipid droplet&#8208;selective imaging studies, which provided useful information toward designing suitable lipid droplet&#8208;selective imaging probes for biomedical applications.

         <title>Catalytic ipso&#8208;Nitration of Organosilanes Enabled by Electrophilic N&#8208;Nitrosaccharin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deploying N&#8208;nitrosaccharin reagents in combination with Lewis acid activation enables the facile, regio&#8208; and chemoselective nitration of (het)aryl silanes, allowing the introduction of nitro group under unprecedently mild conditions suitable for the late&#8208;stage nitration of complex and polyfunctionalized molecules. Theoretical and experimental mechanistic investigations formulate a plausible mechanism involving a &#8220;Wheland transition state&#8221;.







Abstract
Nitroaromatic compounds represent one of the essential classes of molecules that are widely used as feedstock for the synthesis of intermediates, the preparation of nitro&#8208;derived pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials on both laboratory and industrial scales. We herein disclose the efficient, mild, and catalytic ipso&#8208;nitration of organotrimethylsilanes, enabled by an electrophilic N&#8208;nitrosaccharin reagent and allows chemoselective nitration under mild reaction conditions, while exhibiting remarkable substrate generality and functional group compatibility. Additionally, the reaction conditions proved to be orthogonal to other common functionalities, allowing programming of molecular complexity via successive transformations or late&#8208;stage nitration. Detailed mechanistic investigation by experimental and computational approaches strongly supported a classical electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) mechanism, which was found to proceed through a highly ordered transition state.

&lt;p&gt;Deploying &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nitrosaccharin reagents in combination with Lewis acid activation enables the facile, regio- and chemoselective nitration of (het)aryl silanes, allowing the introduction of nitro group under unprecedently mild conditions suitable for the late-stage nitration of complex and polyfunctionalized molecules.

         <title>Repurposing Iron&#8208; and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Oxygenases to Catalyze Olefin Hydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that the 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate coordination triad commonly deployed in Fe/2OG&#8208;dependent enzymes can be used as a general ligand system to support sequential hydrogen atom transfer and oxygenation at a mononuclear iron center. This new type of reactivity not observed in nature delivered Mukaiyama hydration products of various styrene derivatives.







Abstract
Mononuclear nonheme iron(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (Fe/2OG)&#8208;dependent oxygenases and halogenases are known to catalyze a diverse set of oxidative reactions, including hydroxylation, halogenation, epoxidation, and desaturation in primary metabolism and natural product maturation. However, their use in abiotic transformations has mainly been limited to C&#8722;H oxidation. Herein, we show that various enzymes of this family, when reconstituted with Fe(II) or Fe(III), can catalyze Mukaiyama hydration&#8212;a redox neutral transformation. Distinct from the native reactions of the Fe/2OG enzymes, wherein oxygen atom transfer (OAT) catalyzed by an iron&#8208;oxo species is involved, this nonnative transformation proceeds through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathway in a 2OG&#8208;independent manner. Additionally, in contrast to conventional inorganic catalysts, wherein a dinuclear iron species is responsible for HAT, the Fe/2OG enzymes exploit a mononuclear iron center to support this reaction. Collectively, our work demonstrates that Fe/2OG enzymes have utility in catalysis beyond the current scope of catalytic oxidation.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Polyanionic Electrolytes for Highly Stable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biomass seaweed plants, an anionic polyelectrolyte alginate acid (SA) was used to initiate the in situ formation of the high&#8208;performance solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Zn anode. Attribute to the anionic groups of &#8722;COO&#8722;, the affinity of Zn2+ ions to alginate acid induces a well&#8208;aligned accelerating channel for uniform plating. The SEI also regulates the desolvation structure of Zn2+ and facilitates the formation of compact Zn (002) lattice planes.







Abstract
For zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), the non&#8208;uniform Zn plating/stripping results in a high polarization and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), hindering the large&#8208;scale application of ZIBs. Here, inspired by biomass seaweed plants, an anionic polyelectrolyte alginate acid (SA) was used to initiate the in situ formation of the high&#8208;performance solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Zn anode. Attribute to the anionic groups of &#8722;COO&#8722;, the affinity of Zn2+ ions to alginate acid induces a well&#8208;aligned accelerating channel for uniform plating. This SEI regulates the desolvation structure of Zn2+ and facilitates the formation of compact Zn (002) crystal planes. Even under high depth of discharge conditions (DOD), the SA&#8208;coated Zn anode still maintains a stable Zn stripping/plating behavior with a low potential difference (0.114&#8197;V). According to the classical nucleation theory, the nucleation energy for SA&#8208;coated Zn is 97&#8201;% less than that of bare Zn, resulting in a faster nucleation rate. The Zn||Cu cell assembled with the SA&#8208;coated electrode exhibits an outstanding average CE of 99.8&#8201;% over 1,400 cycles. The design is successfully demonstrated in pouch cells, where the SA&#8208;coated Zn exhibits capacity retention of 96.9&#8201;% compared to 59.1&#8201;% for bare Zn anode, even under the high cathode mass loading (&gt;10&#8197;mg/cm2).

         <title>Durable Multiblock Poly(biphenyl alkylene) Anion Exchange Membranes with Microphase Separation for Hydrogen Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiblock poly(biphenyl ammonium&#8208;b&#8208;biphenyl phenyl) was successfully synthesized, which displayed excellent OH&#8722; conductivity of 162.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 along with a low swelling rate of 26.3&#8201;% (80&#8201;&#176;C). Importantly, the related anion exchange membrane (AEM) fuel cells possessed a peak power density of 2.41&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the AEM water electrolysis achieved a current density of 6.25&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V along with outstanding in situ durability for 3250&#8197;h.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and water electrolysis (AEMWE) show great application potential in the field of hydrogen energy conversion technology. However, scalable anion exchange membranes (AEMs) with desirable properties are still lacking, which greatly hampers the commercialization of this technology. Herein, we propose a series of novel multiblock AEMs based on ether&#8208;free poly(biphenyl ammonium&#8208;b&#8208;biphenyl phenyl)s (PBPA&#8208;b&#8208;BPPs) that are suitable for use in high performance AEMFC and AEMWE systems because of their well&#8208;formed microphase separation structures. The developed AEMs achieved outstanding OH&#8722; conductivity (162.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C) with a low swelling ratio, good alkaline stability, and excellent mechanical durability (tensile strength &gt;31&#8197;MPa and elongation at break &gt;147&#8201;% after treatment in 2&#8197;M NaOH at 80&#8201;&#176;C for 3750&#8197;h). A PBPA&#8208;b&#8208;BPP&#8208;based AEMFC demonstrated a remarkable peak power density of 2.41&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and in situ durability for 330&#8197;h under 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 70&#8201;&#176;C. An AEMWE device showed a promising performance (6.25&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V, 80&#8201;&#176;C) and outstanding in situ durability for 3250&#8197;h with a low voltage decay rate (&lt;28&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1). The newly developed PBPA&#8208;b&#8208;BPP AEMs thus show great application prospects for energy conversion devices.

A direct, efficient, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic functionalization of allylic C&#8722;H bonds integrated with CO2 reduction to syngas, over SiO2&#8208;supported single Ni atom&#8208;decorated CdS quantum dots (QDs), is reported for the first time. Such a protocol not only bypasses additional oxidant/reductant and pre&#8208;functionalization to afford a broad range of allylic C&#8722;C products with moderate to excellent yields, but also efficiently produces tuneable syngas.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction integrated with C&#8722;C/C&#8722;X bond&#8208;forming organic synthesis represents a substantially untapped opportunity to simultaneously tackle carbon neutrality and create an atom&#8208;/redox&#8208;economical chemical synthesis. Herein, we demonstrate the first cooperative photoredox catalysis of efficient and tunable CO2 reduction to syngas, paired with direct alkylation/arylation of unactivated allylic sp3 C&#8722;H bonds for accessing allylic C&#8722;C products, over SiO2&#8208;supported single Ni atoms&#8208;decorated CdS quantum dots (QDs). Our protocol not only bypasses additional oxidant/reductant and pre&#8208;functionalization of organic substrates, affording a broad of allylic C&#8722;C products with moderate to excellent yields, but also produces syngas with tunable CO/H2 ratios (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8211;5&#8201;:&#8201;1). Such win&#8208;win coupling catalysis highlights the high atom&#8208;, step&#8208; and redox&#8208;economy, and good durability, illuminating the tantalizing possibility of a renewable sunlight&#8208;driven chemical feedstocks manufacturing industry.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Engineering in Perovskite Solar Cells with 2D Carbides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>

Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) carbides Ti3C2Clx Nano&#8208;MXene and o&#8208;TB&#8208;GDY NanoGDY are successfully employed to passivate the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces, respectively. Due to significantly inhibited non&#8208;radiative recombination, enhanced energy band alignment, and improved charge&#8208;carrier extraction, the n&#8208;i&#8208;p devices obtain a high efficiency of 24.86&#8201;% with improved long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Passivating the interfaces between the perovskite and charge transport layers is crucial for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here we report a dual&#8208;interface engineering approach to improving the performance of FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3&#8208;based PSCs by incorporating Ti3C2Clx Nano&#8208;MXene and o&#8208;TB&#8208;GDY nanographdiyne (NanoGDY) into the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite and perovskite/ hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces, respectively. The dual&#8208;interface passivation simultaneously suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination and promotes carrier extraction by forming the Pb&#8722;Cl chemical bond and strong coordination of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation with undercoordinated Pb defects. The resulting perovskite film has an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 10&#8197;&#956;s and an enlarged crystal size exceeding 2.5&#8197;&#956;m. A maximum PCE of 24.86&#8201;% is realized, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.20&#8197;V. Unencapsulated cells retain 92&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1464&#8197;hours in ambient air and 80&#8201;% after 1002&#8197;hours of thermal stability test at 85&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Directing (110) Oriented Lithium Deposition through High&#8208;flux Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
(110) orientated lithium (Li) deposition is achieved via high&#8208;flux solid electrolyte interphase. Bravais rule and Curie&#8208;Wulff principle clarify Li electrocrystallization process. Long&#8208;term Li deposition regulation ability is realized. Planar and dendrite&#8208;free (110) orientated Li enables Li||LiFePO4, Li||NCM811 cells in practical conditions dramatically improved electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Controlling lithium (Li) electrocrystallization with preferred orientation is a promising strategy to realize highly reversible Li metal batteries (LMBs) but lack of facile regulation methods. Herein, we report a high&#8208;flux solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) strategy to direct (110) preferred Li deposition even on (200)&#8208;orientated Li substrate. Bravais rule and Curie&#8208;Wulff principle are expanded in Li electrocrystallization process to decouple the relationship between SEI engineering and preferred crystal orientation. Multi&#8208;spectroscopic techniques combined with dynamics analysis reveal that the high&#8208;flux CF3Si(CH3)3 (F3) induced SEI (F3&#8208;SEI) with high LiF and &#8722;Si(CH3)3 contents can ingeniously accelerate Li+ transport dynamics and ensure the sufficient Li+ concentration below SEI to direct Li (110) orientation. The induced Li (110) can in turn further promote the surface migration of Li atoms to avoid tip aggregation, resulting in a planar, dendrite&#8208;free morphology of Li. As a result, our F3&#8208;SEI enables ultra&#8208;long stability of Li||Li symmetrical cells for more than 336&#8197;days. Furthermore, F3&#8208;SEI modified Li can significantly enhance the cycle life of Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NCM811 coin and pouch full cells in practical conditions. Our crystallographic strategy for Li dendrite suppression paves a path to achieve reliable LMBs and may provide guidance for the preferred orientation of other metal crystals.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Prolinyl Nucleotides Drive Enzyme&#8208;Free Genetic Copying of RNA (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synergy between fundamental classes of biomolecules is reported by Clemens Richert et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202307591). Prolinyl nucleotides, such as the one shown in the upper right&#8208;hand corner of the image, act as building blocks in the enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying of RNA. The cyclic amino acid is the leaving group when new phosphodiesters are formed on the RNA template, as shown in the growing duplex in the center. That a proteinogenic amino acid can replace the pyrophosphate of polymerase&#8208;driven replication processes of extant biology helps to fill a gap in our understanding of the molecular origin of life.

A chemical vapor deposition strategy is leveraged to create a high&#8208;density Fe single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst, where 3.97 wt% Fe atoms are coordinated with square&#8208;planar para&#8208;positioned nitrogen and phosphorus atoms in a hierarchical carbon framework. The as&#8208;crafted atomically dispersed Fe catalyst manifests an outstanding activity towards oxygen reduction reaction over the entire pH range, as demonstrated by Qixing Zhou, Zhiqun Lin et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202307504).

         <dc:description>
Transparent aerogels of biopolymer&#8211;polysiloxane double networks have been developed. In their Research Article (e202306518), Satoru Takeshita and Takumi Ono have established a sequential protocol for condensation of methyltrimethoxysilane and crosslinking of various biopolymers such as alginate, carrageenan, pectin, and carboxymethyl cellulose in the same space. The drawbacks of biopolymers or polysiloxane alone can be overcome in their homogeneous composites, opening up a new concept for functional aerogels.

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Cobalt Catalysed Hydrogen Atom Transfer for the Hydrofunctionalisation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt catalysis is an effective method for transferring a hydrogen atom to olefins, forming the corresponding branched alkyl radicals and leading to Markovnikov hydrofunctionalisation products. The recent merger of this area with photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;catalysis has introduced new reactivity, milder reaction conditions and improved functional group tolerance. This review summarises these advances and provides an outlook for future developments.







Abstract
Catalytic hydrogen atom transfer from metal&#8208;hydrides to alkenes allows feedstock olefins to be used as alkyl radical precursors. The chemoselectivity of this process makes it an attractive synthetic tool and as such it has been regularly used in synthesis of complex molecules. However, onwards reactivity is limited by compatibility with the conditions which form the key metal&#8208;hydride species. Now, through the merger with photocatalysis or electrochemistry, milder methods are emerging which can unlock entirely new reactivity and offer perspectives on expanding these methods in unprecedented directions. This review outlines the most recent developments in electro&#8208; and photochemical cobalt catalysed methods and offers suggestions on the future outlook.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Towards Spintronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances of spintronics based on two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) were summarized in terms of spintronics materials, application of 2D MOFs in spin transport, as well as spin manipulation using 2D MOFs with bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS) characteristics.







Abstract
The intrinsic properties of predesignable topologies and tunable electronic structures, coupled with the increase of electrical conductivity, make two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) highly prospective candidates for next&#8208;generation electronic/spintronic devices. In this Minireview, we present an outline of the design principles of 2D MOF&#8208;based spintronics materials. Then, we highlight the spin&#8208;transport properties of 2D MOF&#8208;based organic spin valves (OSVs) as a notable achievement in the progress of 2D MOFs for spintronics devices. After that, we discuss the potential for spin manipulation in 2D MOFs with bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS) properties as a promising field for future research. Finally, we provide a brief summary and outlook to encourage the development of novel 2D MOFs for spintronics applications.

         <title>Transition Metal Catalysis in Living Cells: Progress, Challenges, and Novel Supramolecular Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal catalysis is a powerful tool in synthetic chemistry; however, it has yet to reach its full potential in living cells. The hostile environment of cells towards metal complexes means that new strategies need to be developed to overcome poor reactivity.







Abstract
The importance of transition metal catalysis is exemplified by its wide range of applications, for example in the synthesis of chemicals, natural products, and pharmaceuticals. However, one relatively new application is for carrying out new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions inside living cells. The complex environment of a living cell is not welcoming to transition metal catalysts, as a diverse range of biological components have the potential to inhibit or deactivate the catalyst. Here we review the current progress in the field of transition metal catalysis, and evaluation of catalysis efficiency in living cells and under biological (relevant) conditions. Catalyst poisoning is a ubiquitous problem in this field, and we propose that future research into the development of physical and kinetic protection strategies may provide a route to improve the reactivity of catalysts in cells.

         <title>Catalytic Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(Hetero)arylethylamines: Modern Strategies and Advances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent progresses made in the catalytic synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamines, which have become widespread scaffolds in drug discovery. During the past decade, this field of research has expanded tremendously thanks to the development of enabling technologies such as C&#8722;H activation, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and organocatalysis, whose illustrative examples will be highlighted.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;(Hetero)arylethylamines appear in a myriad of pharmaceuticals due to their broad spectrum of biological properties, making them prime candidates for drug discovery. Conventional methods for their preparation often require engineered substrates that limit the flexibility of the synthetic routes and the diversity of compounds that can be accessed. Consequently, methods that provide rapid and versatile access to those scaffolds remain limited. To overcome these challenges, synthetic chemists have designed innovative and modular strategies to access the &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamine motif, paving the way for their more extensive use in future pharmaceuticals. This review outlines recent progresses in the synthesis of (hetero)arylethylamines and emphasizes how these innovations have enabled new levels of molecular complexity, selectivity, and practicality.

         <title>Vibrational Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy of Chiral Molecular Crystals: Insights from Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the concept of molecular (RS&#8208;) chirality is ubiquitous in chemistry, there are further forms of structural chirality, such as the enantiomorphism of crystals that describes the lack of mirror symmetry in the unit cell. This minireview sets a theoretical focus on how chiral crystals can be studied with vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) and how computations become reliable.







Abstract
Chirality is a curious phenomenon that appears in various forms. While the concept of molecular (RS&#8208;)chirality is ubiquitous in chemistry, there are also more intricate forms of structural chirality. One of them is the enantiomorphism of crystals, especially molecular crystals, that describes the lack of mirror symmetry in the unit cell. Its relation to molecular chirality is not obvious, but still an open question, which can be addressed with chiroptical tools. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) denotes chiral infrared (IR) spectroscopy that is susceptible to both, the molecular as well as the intermolecular space by means of vibrational transitions. When carried out in the solid state, VCD delivers a very rich set of non&#8208;local contributions that are determined by crystal packing and collective motion. Since its discovery in the 1970s, VCD has become the method of choice for the determination of absolute configurations, but its applicability reaches beyond towards the study of different crystal forms and polymorphism. This brief review summarises the theoretical concepts of crystal chirality and how computations of solid&#8208;state VCD can shed light into the intimate connection of chiral structure and vibrational optical activity.

         <title>Macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;Sheets Stabilized by Hydrogen Bond Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>

This manuscript describes the synthesis of turn&#8208;less &#946;&#8208;sheet mimics. Synthetic &#946;&#8208;turns are important components of &#946;&#8208;sheet mimics; however, the impact of the designed &#946;&#8208;turns on &#946;&#8208;sheet stabilization is often dependent on the strand sequence. We show that conformationally&#8208;defined macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;sheet mimics can be accessed by replacing interstrand hydrogen bonds with covalent bonds.







Abstract
Mimics of protein secondary and tertiary structure offer rationally&#8208;designed inhibitors of biomolecular interactions. &#946;&#8208;Sheet mimics have a storied history in bioorganic chemistry and are typically designed with synthetic or natural turn segments. We hypothesized that replacement of terminal inter&#8208;&#946;&#8208;strand hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond surrogates (HBS) may lead to conformationally&#8208;defined macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;sheets without the requirement for natural or synthetic &#946;&#8208;turns, thereby providing a minimal mimic of a protein &#946;&#8208;sheet. To access turn&#8208;less antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet mimics, we developed a facile solid phase synthesis protocol. We surveyed a dataset of protein &#946;&#8208;sheets for naturally observed interstrand side chain interactions. This bioinformatics survey highlighted an over&#8208;abundance of aromatic&#8211;aromatic, cation&#8208;&#960; and ionic interactions in &#946;&#8208;sheets. In correspondence with natural &#946;&#8208;sheets, we find that minimal HBS mimics show robust &#946;&#8208;sheet formation when specific amino acid residue pairings are incorporated. In isolated &#946;&#8208;sheets, aromatic interactions endow superior conformational stability over ionic or cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopies, along with high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray crystallography, support our design principles.

         <title>Carbonate Hydrogenated to Formate in the Aqueous Phase over Nickel/TiO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonate hydrogenation to formate is a promising route to convert captured carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals. Developing inexpensive catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability remains challenging. The catalytic properties of nickel can be greatly changed through the regulation of the electronic structure by the support, which makes it possible to improve the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Carbonate hydrogenation to formate is a promising route to convert captured carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals, thus reducing carbon emissions and creating a revenue return. Developing inexpensive catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability remains challenging. We report a supported non&#8208;noble metal catalyst, Ni/TiO2, with great selectivity over 96&#8201;% and excellent stability in catalyzing the conversion of carbonate into formate in aqueous solution. Ni0 and Ni2+ species are both observed in Ni/TiO2 catalysts, and the synergistic effect of these two Ni components leads to high activity and high selectivity of carbonate hydrogenation to formate.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Characterization of a High&#8208;Spin Aza&#8208;[5]&#8208;Triangulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aza&#8208;[5]&#8208;triangulene was synthesized using on&#8208;surface synthesis strategies and its structure imaged with bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy. A cationic ground state with high spin was deduced by detection of a weak zero&#8208;bias spectral resonance, which splits with magnetic fields, attributed to the Kondo effect. The precise spin state and charge stabilization on a gold surface was corroborated by combining advanced theoretical models.







Abstract
Triangulenes are a class of open&#8208;shell triangular graphene flakes with total spin increasing with their size. In the last years, on&#8208;surface&#8208;synthesis strategies have permitted fabricating and engineering triangulenes of various sizes and structures with atomic precision. However, direct proof of the increasing total spin with their size remains elusive. In this work, we report the combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis of a large nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene (aza&#8208;[5]&#8208;triangulene) on a Au(111) surface, and the detection of its high&#8208;spin ground state. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy images uncovered radical states distributed along the zigzag edges, which were detected as weak zero&#8208;bias resonances in scanning tunneling spectra. These spectral features reveal the partial Kondo screening of a high&#8208;spin state. Through a combination of several simulation tools, we find that the observed distribution of radical states is explained by a quintet ground state (S=2), instead of the quartet state (S=3/2) expected for the neutral species. This confirms that electron transfer to the metal substrate raises the spin of the ground state. We further provide a qualitative description of the change of (anti)aromaticity introduced by N&#8208;substitution, and its role in the charge stabilization on a surface, resulting in an S=2 aza&#8208;triangulene on Au(111).

         <title>Environment&#8208;Responsive Peptide Dimers Bind and Stabilize Double&#8208;Stranded RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA shows immense biomedical potential but applications are limited by its instability and poor cellular uptake. Herein, we present a general approach of reversibly binding peptide dimers that stabilize double&#8208;stranded RNA, protect it against degradation by nucleases and enhance cellular RNA uptake. Under reducing conditions peptide dimers monomerize thereby triggering a controlled release of RNA.







Abstract
Double&#8208;stranded RNAs (dsRNA) possess immense potential for biomedical applications. However, their therapeutic utility is limited by low stability and poor cellular uptake. Different strategies have been explored to enhance the stability of dsRNA, including the incorporation of modified nucleotides, and the use of diverse carrier systems. Nevertheless, these have not resulted in a broadly applicable approach thereby preventing the wide&#8208;spread application of dsRNA for therapeutic purposes. Herein, we report the design of dimeric stapled peptides based on the RNA&#8208;binding protein TAV2b. These dimers are obtained via disulfide formation and mimic the natural TAV2b assembly. They bind and stabilize dsRNA in the presence of serum, protecting it from degradation. In addition, peptide binding also promotes cellular uptake of dsRNA. Importantly, peptide dimers monomerize under reducing conditions which results in a loss of RNA binding. These findings highlight the potential of peptide&#8208;based RNA binders for the stabilization and protection of dsRNA, representing an appealing strategy towards the environment&#8208;triggered release of RNA. This can broaden the applicability of dsRNA, such as short interfering RNAs (siRNA), for therapeutic applications.

         <title>Bismuth in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry: Access to a Bowl&#8208;Type Macrocycle and a Barrel&#8208;Type Heptanuclear Complex Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bi&#8722;C bonds in a dinuclear organometallic bismuth(III) compound with a thioxanthene linker are highly susceptible to transformations in the realm of dynamic covalent chemistry. Control of the reactions is obtained through template strategies, solvent effects, and the utilization of catalysts. This grants access to novel macrocyclic and barrel&#8208;type compounds, including a well&#8208;defined heptanuclear cationic complex.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) is a powerful and widely applied tool in modern synthetic chemistry, which is based on the reversible cleavage and formation of covalent bonds. One of the inherent strengths of this approach is the perspective to reversibly generate in an operationally simple approach novel structural motifs that are difficult or impossible to access with more traditional methods and require multiple bond cleaving and bond forming steps. To date, these fundamentally important synthetic and conceptual challenges in the context of DCvC have predominantly been tackled by exploiting compounds of lighter p&#8208;block elements, even though heavier p&#8208;block elements show low bond dissociation energies and appear to be ideally suited for this approach. Here we show that a dinuclear organometallic bismuth compound, containing BiMe2 groups that are connected by a thioxanthene linker, readily undergoes selective and reversible cleavage of its Bi&#8722;C bonds upon exposure to external stimuli. The exploitation of DCvC in the field of organometallic heavy p&#8208;block chemistry grants access to unprecedented macrocyclic and barrel&#8208;type oligonuclear compounds.

         <title>Hybrid Vesicles Enable Mechano&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report a strategy that enables the development of a mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogel capable of on&#8208;demand degradation. Phospholipid&#8208;block copolymer hybrid vesicles embedded in a hydrogel matrix can act as signal transducers, releasing encapsulated compounds that control the hydrogel network when an external compressive stress is applied. This generalizable approach holds promise for the creation of diverse functional hydrogels.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels are intriguing biomimetic materials. Previous efforts to develop mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogels have mostly relied on chemical modifications of the hydrogel structures. Here, we present a simple, generalizable strategy that confers mechano&#8208;responsive behavior on hydrogels. Our approach involves embedding hybrid vesicles, composed of phospholipids and amphiphilic block copolymers, within the hydrogel matrix to act as signal transducers. Under mechanical stress, these vesicles undergo deformation and rupture, releasing encapsulated compounds that can control the hydrogel network. To demonstrate this concept, we embedded vesicles containing ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a calcium chelator, into a calcium&#8208;crosslinked alginate hydrogel. When compressed, the released EGTA sequesters calcium ions and degrades the hydrogel. This study provides a novel method for engineering mechano&#8208;responsive hydrogels that may be useful in various biomedical applications.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Activated Self&#8208;Immolation of Hydrogels via Signal Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a hydrogel system that self&#8208;destroys after mechanical activation via the combination of a mechano&#8211;to&#8211;chemo signal translation and a chemical signal amplifier module to trigger many chain breaks following one single mechano event. Self&#8208;regulating soft robotic elements and mechano&#8208;induced debonding in adhesives can be realized.







Abstract
Cellular organisms possess intricate mechano&#8208;adaptive systems that enable them to sense forces and process them with (bio)chemical circuits for functional adaptation. Inspired by such processes, this study introduces a hydrogel system capable of mechanically activated and chemically transduced self&#8208;destruction. Our judiciously designed hydrogels can mechanically generate radicals that are processed and amplified in a self&#8208;propagating radical de&#8208;crosslinking reaction, ultimately leading to mechanically triggered self&#8208;immolation. We put such systems to work in mechano&#8208;induced debonding, and in a bilayer actuator, where swelling&#8208;induced bending generates sufficient force for selective degradation of one layer, leading to autonomous self&#8208;regulation associated with unbending. Our work helps define design criteria for molecularly controlled adaptive and self&#8208;regulating materials with embodied mechano&#8208;chemical information processing, and showcases their potential for adhesives and soft robotics.

We put such systems to work in mechano-induced debonding, and in a bilayer actuator, where swelling-induced bending generates sufficient force for selective degradation of one layer, leading to autonomous self-regulation associated with unbending. Our work helps define design criteria for molecularly controlled adaptive and self-regulating materials with embodied mechano-chemical information processing, and showcases their potential for adhesives and soft robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cationic Metal Glue Strategy for Expanding Paramagnetic Hetero&#8208;Multinuclear Metal&#8208;Oxo Clusters within Polyoxometalate Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;cationic metal glue strategy&#8221; for increasing the size and nuclearity of hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters is demonstrated by using lacunary&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) as rigid multidentate ligands. The method enabled the expansion of {FeMn4} to {(FeMn4)Mn2Ln2(FeMn4)} oxo clusters (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy, and Lu), which are the largest among previously reported paramagnetic hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters in POMs.







Abstract
Precise structural design of large hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters is crucial for controlling their large spin ground states and multielectron redox properties for application as a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM), molecular magnetic refrigeration, and efficient redox catalyst. However, it is difficult to synthesize large hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal oxo clusters as designed because the final structures are unpredictable when employing conventional one&#8208;step condensation reaction of metal cations and ligands. Herein, we report a &#8220;cationic metal glue strategy&#8221; for increasing the size and nuclearity of hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters by using lacunary&#8208;type anionic molecular metal oxides (polyoxometalates, POMs) as rigid multidentate ligands. The employed method enabled the synthesis of {(FeMn4)Mn2Ln2(FeMn4)} oxo clusters (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy, and Lu), which are the largest among previously reported paramagnetic hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal&#8208;oxo clusters in POMs and showed unique SMM properties. These clusters were synthesized by conjugating {FeMn4} oxo clusters with Mn and Ln cations as glues in a predictable way, indicating that the &#8220;cationic metal glue strategy&#8221; would be a powerful tool to construct desired large hetero&#8208;multinuclear metal clusters precisely and effectively.

         <title>Chiral Hybrid Germanium(II) Halide with Strong Nonlinear Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral germanium halide is synthesized, which exhibits strong nonlinear chiroptical property. The second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism of the chiral germanium halide can reach 0.48, which is the highest value among lead&#8208;free chiral metal halides. Moreover, a large effective second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient of 0.86&#8197;pm/V and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 38.46&#8197;GW/cm2 are also obtained.







Abstract
Due to the pronounced anisotropic response to circularly polarized light, chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides have been regarded as promising candidates for the application in nonlinear chiroptics, especially for the second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) effect. However, designing novel lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid metal halides with large anisotropy factors and high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LDT) of SHG&#8208;CD remains challenging. Herein, we develop the first chiral hybrid germanium halide, (R/S&#8208;NEA)3Ge2I7&#8901;H2O (R/S&#8208;NGI), and systematically investigated its linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. S&#8208;NGI and R&#8208;NGI exhibit large anisotropy factors (gSHG&#8208;CD) of 0.45 and 0.48, respectively, along with a high LDT of 38.46&#8197;GW/cm2; these anisotropy factors were the highest values among the reported lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid metal halides. Moreover, the effective second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient of S&#8208;NGI could reach up to 0.86&#8197;pm/V, which was 2.9 times higher than that of commercial Y&#8208;cut quartz. Our findings facilitate a new avenue toward lead&#8208;free chiral hybrid metal halides, and their implementation in nonlinear chiroptical applications.

         <title>Selectivity Control of the Ligand Exchange at Carbon in &#945;&#8208;Metallated Ylides as a Route to Ketenyl Anions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbonylation of metallated ylides was found to result in competing phosphine versus metal salt elimination. The selectivity can effectively be controlled to enable selective isolation of the tosyl&#8208;substituted ketenyl anion. Its cryptand complex featured the &#8220;naked&#8221; ketenyl anion [Ts&#8722;C=C=O]&#8722; in the solid state, which exhibited an only slightly bent S&#8722;C&#8722;C linkage indicating a pronounced ynolate character.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Metallated ylides have recently been reported to undergo phosphine by CO exchange at the ylidic carbon atom to form isolable ketenyl anions. Systematic studies on the tosyl&#8208;substituted yldiides, R3P=C(M)Ts (M=Li, Na, K), now reveal that carbonylation may lead to a competing metal salt (MTs) elimination. This side&#8208;reaction can be controlled by the choice of phosphine, metal cation, solvent and co&#8208;ligands, thus enabling the selective isolation of the ketenyl anion [Ts&#8722;CCO]M (2&#8208;M). Complexation of 2&#8208;Na by crown ether or cryptand allowed structure elucidation of the first free ketenyl anion [Ts&#8722;CCO]&#8722;, which showed an almost linear Ts&#8722;C&#8722;C linkage indicative for a pronounced ynolate character. However, DFT studies support a high charge at the ketenyl carbon atom, which is reflected in the selective carbon&#8208;centered reactivity. Overall, the present study provides important information on the selectivity control of ketenyl anion formation which will be crucial for future applications.

         <title>Separating Xylene Isomers with a Calcium Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208; and adsorbate&#8208;dependent adsorption of xylene isomers on a calcium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework has led to full separation of p&#8208;xylene from its isomers with high selectivity.







Abstract
The purification of p&#8208;xylene (pX) from its xylene isomers represents a challenging but important industrial process. Herein, we report the efficient separation of pX from its ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208; isomers by a microporous calcium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework material (HIAM&#8208;203) with a flexible skeleton. At 30&#8201;&#176;C, all three isomers are accommodated but the adsorption kinetics of o&#8208;xylene (oX) and m&#8208;xylene (mX) are substantially slower than that of pX, and at an elevated temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C, oX and mX are fully excluded while pX can be adsorbed. Multicomponent column breakthrough measurements and vapor&#8208;phase/liquid&#8208;phase adsorption experiments have demonstrated the capability of HIAM&#8208;203 for efficient separation of xylene isomers. Ab initio calculations have provided useful information for understanding the adsorption mechanism.

         <title>Highly Selective Electrocatalytic Olefin Hydrogenation in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic hydrogenation of purely aliphatic and functionalized olefins was achieved by using graphdiyne&#8208;based copper oxide quantum dots as cathodic electrodes and water as the hydrogen source, with high activity and selectivity in aqueous solution at high current density under ambient temperature and pressure.







Abstract
Selective hydrogenation of olefins with water as the hydrogen source at ambient conditions is still a big challenge in the field of catalysis. Herein, the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of purely aliphatic and functionalized olefins was achieved by using graphdiyne based copper oxide quantum dots (CuxO/GDY) as cathodic electrodes and water as the hydrogen source, with high activity and selectivity in aqueous solution at high current density under ambient temperature and pressure. In particular, the sp&#8208;/sp2&#8208;hybridized graphdiyne catalyst allows the selective hydrogenation of cis&#8208;trans isomeric olefins. The chemical and electronic structure of the GDY results in the incomplete charge transfer between GDY and Cu atoms to optimize the adsorption/desorption of the reaction intermediates and results in high reaction selectivity and activity for hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Precision Graphene Nanoribbon Heterojunctions by Chain&#8208;Growth Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 41, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated the controlled synthesis of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) heterojunctions for the first time from block polyphenylene precursor that was achieved by chain&#8208;growth polymerization. This synthetic strategy opens a door for the rational synthesis of unexplored GNR heterojunctions with diverse topologies and emerging physicochemical properties.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. In particular, GNR heterojunctions have received considerable attention due to their exotic topological electronic phases at the heterointerface. However, strategies for their precision synthesis remain at a nascent stage. Here, we report a novel chain&#8208;growth polymerization strategy that allows for constructing GNR heterojunction with N=9 armchair and chevron GNRs segments (9&#8208;AGNR/cGNR). The synthesis involves a controlled Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization (SCTP) between 2&#8208;(6&#8242;&#8208;bromo&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;ditetradecyl&#8208;[1,1&#8242;:2&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;3&#8242;&#8208;yl) boronic ester (M1) and 2&#8208;(7&#8208;bromo&#8208;9,12&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;10,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;tetradecylphenyl)&#8208;triphenylene&#8208;2&#8208;yl) boronic ester (M2), followed by the Scholl reaction of the obtained block copolymer (poly&#8208;M1/M2) with controlled Mn (18&#8197;kDa) and narrow &#272; (1.45). NMR and SEC analysis of poly&#8208;M1/M2 confirm the successful block copolymerization. The solution&#8208;mediated cyclodehydrogenation of poly&#8208;M1/M2 toward 9&#8208;AGNR/cGNR is unambiguously validated by FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV/Vis spectroscopies. Moreover, we also demonstrate the on&#8208;surface formation of pristine 9&#8208;AGNR/cGNR from the unsubstituted copolymer precursor, which is unambiguously characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

         <dc:description>Here, we show the conversion of unactivated alkenes into &#945;&#8208;branched enones via regioselective chloroacylation with acyl chlorides. The method relies upon the initial in&#8208;situ generation of chlorine radicals directly from the acyl chloride precursor under cooperative nickel/photoredox catalysis. Subsequent HCl elimination provides enones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters that are not accessible via the conventional acylation approaches that provide the other, linear constitutional isomer.</dc:description>

The establishment of a time&#8208;temperature&#8208;transformation (TTT) diagram captures the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline LLZO transformation based on crystallization enthalpy analysis and confirms stabilization of cubic&#8208;phase LLZO at record low temperatures of 500&#8201;&#176;C. Technologically, the newly proposed low&#8208;temperature processing routes benefit the integration and scale&#8208;up of LLZO&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries at reduced costs and carbon footprint.







Abstract
Efficient and affordable synthesis of Li+ functional ceramics is crucial for the scalable production of solid electrolytes for batteries. Li&#8208;garnet Li7La3Zr2O12&#8722;d (LLZO), especially its cubic phase (cLLZO), attracts attention due to its high Li+ conductivity and wide electrochemical stability window. However, high sintering temperatures raise concerns about the cathode interface stability, production costs, and energy consumption for scalable manufacture. We show an alternative &#8220;sinter&#8208;free&#8221; route to stabilize cLLZO as films at half of its sinter temperature. Specifically, we establish a time&#8208;temperature&#8208;transformation (TTT) diagram which captures the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline LLZO transformation based on crystallization enthalpy analysis and confirm stabilization of thin&#8208;film cLLZO at record low temperatures of 500&#8201;&#176;C. Our findings pave the way for low&#8208;temperature processing via TTT diagrams, which can be used for battery cell design targeting reduced carbon footprints in manufacturing.

         <title>B&#8722;N/B&#8722;O Contained Heterocycles as Fusion Locker in Multi&#8208;Resonance Frameworks towards Highly&#8208;efficient and Stable Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is reported to realize ultra&#8208;narrowband emission by incorporating B&#8722;N/B&#8722;O heterocycles as fusion lockers into conventional multi&#8208;resonant frameworks. Three emitters exhibited bright sky&#8208;blue emission with remarkably small full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) of only 17&#8211;18&#8197;nm in solution. A high&#8208;performance OLED device was achieved with a small FWHM of merely 19&#8197;nm and a high EQE of up to 31.9&#8201;% with alleviated efficiency attenuation.







Abstract
Fusing condensed aromatics into multi&#8208;resonance (MR) frameworks has been an exquisite strategy to modulate the optoelectronic properties, which, however, always sacrifices the small full width at half maxima (FWHM). Herein, we strategically embed B&#8722;N/B&#8722;O contained heterocycles as fusion locker into classical MR prototypes, which could enlarge the &#960;&#8208;extension and alleviate the steric repulsion for an enhanced planar skeleton to suppress the high&#8208;frequency stretching/ scissoring vibrations for ultra&#8208;narrowband emissions. Sky&#8208;blue emitters with extremely small FWHMs of 17&#8211;18&#8197;nm are thereafter obtained for the targeted emitters, decreased by (1.4&#8211;1.9)&#8208;fold compared with the prototypes. Benefiting from their high photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;90&#8201;% and fast radiative decay rates of &gt;108&#8197;s&#8722;1, one of those emitters shows a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.9&#8201;% in sensitized devices, which remains 25.8&#8201;% at a practical luminance of 1,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 with a small FWHM of merely 19&#8197;nm. Notably a long operation half&#8208;lifetime of 1,278&#8197;h is also recorded for the same device, representing one of the longest lifetimes among sky&#8208;blue devices based on MR emitters.

         <title>Urea&#8208;Functionalized Fe4L6 Cages for Supramolecular Gold Catalyst Encapsulation to Control Substrate Activation Modes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonate&#8208;functionalized gold catalyst and urea substrate have been found to be encapsulated in a urea&#8208;functionalized Fe4L6 cage through hydrogen bonding. The caged catalyst presents excellent performances compared to the free catalyst, with high selectivity obtained from the site&#8208;isolation effect imposed by the cage only allowing catalysis by &#960; activation of the substrate. The high reactivity arises from stabilization of the transition state.







Abstract
The excellent catalytic performances of enzymes in terms of activity and selectivity are an inspiration for synthetic chemists and this has resulted in the development of synthetic containers for supramolecular catalysis. In such containers the local environment and pre&#8208;organization of catalysts and substrates leads to control of the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Herein we report a supramolecular strategy to encapsulate single catalysts in a urea&#8208;functionalized Fe4L6 cage, which can co&#8208;encapsulate a functionalized urea substrate through hydrogen bonding. Distinguished selectivity is obtained, imposed by the cage as site isolation only allows catalysis through &#960; activation of the substrate and as a result the selectivity is independent of catalyst concentration. The encapsulated catalyst is more active than the free analogue, an effect that can be ascribed to transitionstate stabilization rather than substrate pre&#8208;organization, as revealed by the MM kinetic data. The simple strategy reported here is expected to be of general use in many reactions, for which the catalyst can be functionalized with a sulfonate group required for encapsulation.

         <title>Integrated Tandem Electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electrochemical Coupling of Biomass and Nitrate to Sustainable Alanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the integrated tandem electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electrochemical strategy, the biomass&#8208;derived pyruvic and waste nitrate were coupled into an amino acid, alanine. In detail, NO3&#8722; was electro&#8208;reduced to NH2OH, which could interact with PA to the form pyruvic oxime, and then the pyruvic oxime was electro&#8208;reduced to the desired alanine.







Abstract
Alanine is widely employed for synthesizing polymers, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. Electrocatalytic coupling of biomass molecules and waste nitrate is attractive for the nitrate removal and alanine production under ambient conditions. However, the reaction efficiency is relatively low due to the activation of the stable substrates, and the coupling of two reactive intermediates remains challenging. Herein, we realize the integrated tandem electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electochemical synthesis of alanine from the biomass&#8208;derived pyruvic acid (PA) and waste nitrate (NO3&#8722;) catalyzed by PdCu nano&#8208;bead&#8208;wires (PdCu NBWs). The overall reaction pathway is demonstrated as a multiple&#8208;step catalytic cascade process via coupling the reactive intermediates NH2OH and PA on the catalyst surface. Interestingly, in this integrated tandem electrochemical&#8208;chemical&#8208;electrochemical catalytic cascade process, Cu facilitates the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to NH2OH intermediates, which chemically couple with PA to form the pyruvic oxime, and Pd promotes the electrochemical reduction of pyruvic oxime to the desirable alanine. This work provides a green strategy to convert waste NO3&#8722; to wealth and enriches the substrate scope of renewable biomass feedstocks to produce high&#8208;value amino acids.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution and solid&#8208;state measurements provide support for the first example of two&#8208;step magnetic switching in a mononuclear monodioxolene cobalt complex. Employing a dynamic ligand scaffold may be the key to stabilizing the rare low spin Co(II) intermediate state and traversing both valence tautomeric and spin crossover transitions.







Abstract
Mononuclear monodioxolene valence tautomeric (VT) cobalt complexes typically exist in their low spin (l.s.) CoIII(cat2&#8722;) and high spin (h.s.) CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;) forms (cat2&#8722;=catecholato, and sq&#8901;&#8722;=seminquinonato forms of 3,5&#8722;di&#8722;tBu&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxolene), which reversibly interconvert via temperature&#8208;dependent intramolecular electron transfer. Typically, the remaining four coordination sites on cobalt are supported by a tetradentate ligand whose properties influence the temperature at which VT occurs. We report that replacing one chelating pyridyl arm of tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (tpa) with a weaker field ortho&#8208;anisole moiety facilitates access to a third magnetic state, and examine a series of related complexes. Variable temperature crystallographic, magnetic, calorimetric, and spectroscopic studies support that this third state is consistent with l.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;). Thus, our ligand modifications not only provide access to the VT transition from l.s. CoIII(cat2&#8722;) to l.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;), but at higher temperatures, the complex undergoes spin crossover from l.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;) to h.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;), representing the first example of two&#8208;step magnetic switching in a mononuclear monodioxolene cobalt complex. We hypothesize that ligand dynamicity may facilitate access to the rarely observed l.s. CoII(sq&#8901;&#8722;) intermediate state, suggesting a new design criterion in the development of stimulus&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;state molecular switches.

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Specific Silicon&#8208;Containing Conjugating Reagent: &#946;&#8208;Silyl Alkynyl Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of silicon&#8208;containing alkynone reagents that target free thiols to produce the stable vinyl&#8208;sulfide linker under biocompatible conditions is reported. Besides simple aliphatic and aromatic thiols, this approach is also applicable to the labeling of thiols present in proteins, sugars and pharmaceuticals with full retention of silicon handles in most cases.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific modification of thiol&#8208;containing biomolecules has been recognized as a versatile and powerful strategy for probing our biological systems and discovering novel therapeutics. The addition of lipophilic silicon moiety opens up new avenues for multi&#8208;disciplinary research with broad applications in both the medicinal and material sciences. However, adhering to the strict biocompatibility requirements, and achieving the introduction of labile silicon handle and high chemo&#8208;selectivity have been formidable. In this paper, we report silicon&#8208;based conjugating reagents including &#946;&#8208;trialkylsilyl and silyl ether&#8208;tethered alkynones that selectively react with thiols under physiological conditions. The pH&#8208;neutral, metal&#8208;free and additive&#8208;free reaction yields stable products with broad substrate compatibility and full retention of silicon handles in most cases. Besides simple aliphatic and aromatic thiols, this approach is applicable in the labeling of thiols present in proteins, sugars and payloads, thereby expanding the toolbox of thiol conjugation.

         <title>Combination of Resonance and Non&#8208;Resonance Chiral Raman Scattering in a Cobalt(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonance Raman optical activity is becoming a useful tool to study geometry and electronic structure of molecules. For a cobalt complex we report large signal enhancement, unique resonance spectral pattern, and an advanced analysis based on vibrational functions of the ground and excited electronic state. For the first time, a dual circular polarization signal coming from asymmetric molecular polarizabilities was verified on enantiomers.







Abstract
Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) spectra with high sensitivity reveal details on molecular structure, chirality, and excited electronic properties. Despite the difficulty of the measurements, the recorded data for the Co(III) complex with S,S&#8208;N,N&#8208;ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid are of exceptional quality and, coupled with the theory, spectacularly document the molecular behavior in resonance. This includes a huge enhancement of the chiral scattering, contribution of the antisymmetric polarizabilities to the signal, and the Herzberg&#8208;Teller effect significantly shaping the spectra. The chiral component is by about one order of magnitude bigger than for an analogous aluminum complex. The band assignment and intensity profile were confirmed by simulations based on density functional and vibronic theories. The resonance was attributed to the S0&#8594;S3 transition, with the strongest signal enhancement of Raman and ROA spectral bands below about 800&#8197;cm&#8722;1. For higher wavenumbers, other excited electronic states contribute to the scattering in a less resonant way. RROA spectroscopy thus appears as a unique tool to study the structure and electronic states of absorbing molecules in analytical chemistry, biology, and material science.

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Enhanced Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Polymer Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disorder is usually considered to cause photoluminescence quenching by dissipating excited&#8208;state energy, here we challenge the conventional wisdom by showing that increased disorder from crystalline to polymer media actually enhances room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, when a mediating charge&#8208;transfer state is involved.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers have important applications for biological imaging, oxygen sensing, data encryption, and photodynamic therapy. Despite the many advantages polymeric materials offer such as great control over gas permeability and processing flexibility, disorder is traditionally considered as an intrinsic negative impact on the efficiency for embedded RTP luminophores, as various allowed thermal motions could quench the emitting states. However, we propose that such disorder&#8208;enabled freedoms of microscopic motions can be beneficial for charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated RTP, which is facilitated by molecular conformational changes among different electronic transition states. Using the &#8220;classic&#8221; pyrene&#8208;aniline exciplex as an example, we demonstrate the mutual enhancement of red/near&#8208;infrared and green RTP emissions from the pyrene and aniline moieties, respectively, upon doping the aniline polymer with trace pyrene derivatives. In comparison, a pyrene&#8208;doped crystal formed with the same aniline structure exhibits only charge&#8208;transfer fluorescence with no red or green RTP observed, suggesting that order suppresses the RTP channels. The proposed polymerization strategy may be used as a unified method to generate multi&#8208;emissive polymeric RTP materials from a vast pool of known and unknown exciplexes and charge&#8208;transfer complexes.

         <title>Nanosheet&#8208;Assembled Zirconium&#8208;Porphyrin Frameworks Enabling Surface&#8208;Confined, Initiator&#8208;Free Photosynthesis of Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanosheet&#8208;assembled Zr&#8208;porphyrin hexagonal prisms exhibit broadband photon harvesting and excellent photocatalytic ability, enabling controlled photosynthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight (Mn&gt;1,500,000) polymers with low dispersity (&#272;&#8776;1.5) in an initiator&#8208;free, oxygen&#8208;tolerant reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization system regulated by full&#8208;range visible light and natural sunlight.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks with well&#8208;organized low&#8208;dimensional architectures provide significant thermodynamic and/or kinetic benefits for diverse applications. We present here the controlled synthesis of a novel class of hierarchical zirconium&#8208;porphyrin frameworks (ZrPHPs) with nanosheet&#8208;assembled hexagonal prism morphology. The crystal growth behaviors and structural evolution of ZrPHPs in an additive&#8208;modulated solvothermal synthesis are examined, showing an &#8220;assembly&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;reassembly&#8221; mechanism towards the formation of 2D nanosheets with ordered arrangement. Because of the highly&#8208;accessible active sites harvesting broadband photons, ZrPHPs serve as adaptable photocatalysts to regulate macromolecular synthesis under full&#8208;range visible light and natural sunlight. An initiator&#8208;free, oxygen&#8208;tolerant photopolymerization system is established, following a distinctive mechanism involving direct photo&#8208;induced electron transfer to dormant species and hole&#8208;mediated reversible deactivation. Specifically, ZrPHPs provide a surface&#8208;confined effect towards the propagating chains which inhibits their recombination termination, enabling the highly&#8208;efficient synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight polymers (Mn &gt;1,500,000) with relatively low dispersity (&#272;&#8776;1.5).

Because of the highly-accessible active sites harvesting broadband photons, &lt;b&gt;ZrPHPs&lt;/b&gt; serve as adaptable photocatalysts to regulate macromolecular synthesis under full-range visible light and natural sunlight. An initiator-free, oxygen-tolerant photopolymerization system is established, following a distinctive mechanism involving direct photo-induced electron transfer to dormant species and hole-mediated reversible deactivation. Specifically, &lt;b&gt;ZrPHPs&lt;/b&gt; provide a surface-confined effect towards the propagating chains which inhibits their recombination termination, enabling the highly-efficient synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight polymers (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt;1,500,000) with relatively low dispersity (&lt;i&gt;&#272;&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;1.5).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent and Selective Light Alkene Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed Heck coupling, a reductive Heck coupling, and a Heck/Kumada coupling of light alkenes are reported herein. These strategies enable highly efficient hydro&#8208;arylation/&#8208;vinylation, (di)arylation, vinylation, and aryl&#8208;vinylation transformations thus accessing alkyl arenes and complex alkenes. This coupling strategy provides a modular and divergent platform for upgrading feedstock light alkenes.







Abstract
Light olefins are abundantly manufactured in the petroleum industry and thus represent ideal starting materials for modern chemical synthesis. Selective and divergent transformations of feedstock light olefins to value&#8208;added chemicals are highly sought&#8208;after but remain challenging. Herein we report an exceptionally regioselective carbonickelation of light alkenes followed by in situ trapping with three types of nucleophiles, namely a reductant, base, or Grignard reagent. This protocol enables efficient 1,2&#8208;hydrofunctionalization, dicarbofunctionalization, and branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling of light alkenes with aryl and alkenyl reagents to streamline access to diverse alkyl arenes and complex alkenes. Harnessing bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands with acenaphthyl backbones for nickel catalysts is crucial to attain high reactivity and selectivity. This strategy provides a rare, modular, and divergent platform for upgrading feedstock alkenes and is expected to find broad applications in medicinal chemistry and industrial processes.

Selective and divergent transformations of feedstock light olefins to value-added chemicals are highly sought-after but remain challenging. Herein we report an exceptionally regioselective carbonickelation of light alkenes followed by in situ trapping with three types of nucleophiles, namely a reductant, base, or Grignard reagent. This protocol enables efficient 1,2-hydrofunctionalization, dicarbofunctionalization, and branched-selective Heck-type cross-coupling of light alkenes with aryl and alkenyl reagents to streamline access to diverse alkyl arenes and complex alkenes. Harnessing bulky &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene ligands with acenaphthyl backbones for nickel catalysts is crucial to attain high reactivity and selectivity. This strategy provides a rare, modular, and divergent platform for upgrading feedstock alkenes and is expected to find broad applications in medicinal chemistry and industrial processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controllable Topological Transformations of 818 Molecular Metalla&#8208;knots via Oxidation of Thiazole&#8208;based Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By exploiting coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, high yields of two 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots could be obtained using a thiazole&#8208;moiety&#8208;containing asymmetric dipyridyl ligand 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzo[d]thiazole (L1), as confirmed using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, electrospray ionization&#8211;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry (ESI&#8211;TOF/MS), and detailed liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To modulate the self&#8208;assembled structures, m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) was utilized to oxidize thiazole&#8208;based ligand L1 to N&#8208;thiazole&#8208;oxide&#8208;based ligand 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzo[d]thiazole 3&#8208;oxide (L2), which enabled the selective construction of corresponding tetranuclear macrocycles. Notably, two molecular metalla&#8208;knots could be topologically transformed from 818 knots to simple monocycles because the L1 alkyne bond was inert toward m&#8208;CPBA, as confirmed based on liquid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, ESI&#8211;TOF/MS, and elemental analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Recyclable and Tough Elastic Vitrimers from a Defined Polydimethylsiloxane Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite intensive research on sustainable elastomers, achieving elastic vitrimers with significantly improved mechanical properties and recyclability remains a scientific challenge. Herein, inspired by the classical elasticity theory, we present a design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers with a defined network constructed by chemically crosslinking the pre&#8208;synthesized disulfide&#8208;containing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chains with tetra&#8208;arm polyethylene glycol (PEG). The defined network is achieved by the reduced dangling short chains and the relatively uniform molecular weight of network strands. Such elastic vitrimers with the defined network, i.e., PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D, exhibit significantly improved mechanical performance than random analogous, previously reported PDMS vitrimers, and even commercial silicone&#8208;based thermosets. Moreover, unlike the vitrimers with random network that show obvious loss in mechanical properties after recycling, those with the defined network enable excellent thermal recyclability. The PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D also deliver comparable electrochemical signals if utilized as substrates for electromyography sensors after the recycling. The multiple relaxation processes are revealed via a unique physical approach. Multiple techniques are also applied to unravel the microscopic mechanism of the excellent mechanical performance and recyclability of such defined network.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deuterium labelling of organic compounds is an important process in chemistry. We report the first example of photocatalytic dehalogenative deuteration of both arylhalides and alkylhalides (40 substrates) over a metal&#8208;organic framework, MFM&#8208;300(Cr), using CD3CN as the deuterium source at room temperature. MFM&#8208;300(Cr) catalyses high deuterium incorporation and shows excellent tolerance to various functional groups. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction reveals the activation of halogenated substrates via confined binding within MFM&#8208;300(Cr). In situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy confirms the formation of carbon&#8208;based radicals as intermediates and reveals the reaction pathway. This protocol removes the use of precious&#8208;metal catalysts from state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art processes based upon direct hydrogen isotope exchange and shows high photocatalytic stability, thus enabling multiple catalytic cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomer Effect on Energy Storage of &#960;&#8208;Extended S&#8208;Shaped Double[6]Heterohelicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, chiral and nonplanar cutouts of graphene have been the favorites due to their unique optical, electronic, and redox properties and high solubility compared with their planar counterparts. Despite the remarkable progress in helicenes, &#960;&#8208;extended heterohelicenes have not been widely explored. As an anode in a lithium&#8208;ion battery, the racemic mixture of &#960;&#8208;extended double heterohelical nanographene containing thienothiophene core exhibited a high lithium storage capability, attaining a specific capacity of 424 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 with excellent rate capability and superior long&#8208;term cycling performance over 6000 cycles with negligible fade. As a first report, the &#960;&#8208;extended helicene isomer (PP and MM), with the more interlayer distance that helps faster diffusion of ions, has exhibited a high capacity of 300 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2 A g&#8208;1 with long&#8208;term cycling performance over 1500 cycles compared to the less performing MP and PM isomer and racemic mixture (150 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2 A g&#8208;1). As supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, a unique molecular design of nanographenes with a fixed (helical) molecular geometry, avoiding restacking of the layers, renders better performance as an anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Interestingly, the recycled nanographene anode material displayed comparable performance.</dc:description>

Interestingly, the recycled nanographene anode material displayed comparable performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Enantioselective Hydrosulfonylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyls with Sulfonyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This research explores the enantioselective hydrosulfonylation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds via the use of visible light and redox&#8208;active chiral Ni&#8208;catalysis, facilitating the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones with remarkable enantioselectivity (exceeding 99% ee). A significant challenge entails enhancing the reactivity between chiral metal&#8208;coordinated carbonyl compounds and moderate electrophilic sulfonyl radicals, aiming to minimize the background reactions. The success of our approach stems from two distinctive attributes: 1) the Cl&#8208;atom abstraction employed for sulfonyl radical generation from sulfonyl chlorides, and 2) the single&#8208;electron reduction to produce a key enolate radical Ni&#8208;complex. The latter process appears to enhance the feasibility of the sulfonyl radical's addition to the electron&#8208;rich enolate radical. An in&#8208;depth investigation into the reaction mechanism, supported by both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, offers insight into the intricate reaction process. Moreover, the versatility of our methodology is highlighted through its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules, demonstrating its practicality as a strategy for producing &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Capture of CO2 Boosting Its Electroreduction in the Micropores of a Metal&#8208;organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integration of CO2 capture capability from flue gas and electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) active sites into a catalyst is a promising cost&#8208;effective strategy for carbon neutrality, but is of great difficulty. Herein, combining the mixed gas breakthrough experiments and eCO2RR tests, we showed that a Ag12 cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (1&#8722;NH2, aka Ag12bpy&#8722;NH2), simultaneously possessing CO2 capture sites as "CO2 relays" and eCO2RR active sites, can not only utilize its micropores to efficiently capture CO2 from simulated flue gas (CO2:N2 = 15:85, at 298 K), but also catalyze eCO2RR of the adsorbed CO2 into CO with an ultra&#8208;high CO2 conversion of 60%. More importantly, its eCO2RR performance (a Faradaic efficiency (CO) of 96% with a commercial current density of 120 mA cm&#8722;2 at a very low cell voltage of &#8722;2.3 V for 300 hours and the full&#8208;cell energy conversion efficiency of 56%) under simulated flue gas atmosphere is close to that under 100% CO2 atmosphere, and higher than those of all reported catalysts at higher potential under 100% CO2 atmosphere. This work bridges the gap between CO2 enrichment/capture and eCO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualizing the Structure, Composition and Activity of Single Catalyst Particles for Olefin Polymerization and Polyolefin Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural and morphological characterization of individual catalyst particles for olefin polymerization, as well as for the reverse process of polyolefin decomposition, can provide an improved understanding for how these catalysts operate under &#160;reaction conditions. In this review, we discuss an emerging toolbox of chemical imaging techniques that is suitable for investigating the chemistry and reactivity of related catalysts. While synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray microscopy still provides spatial resolutions in 2D and 3D, a number of laboratory&#8208;based techniques, most notably focused ion beam&#8208;scanning electron microscopy, confocal fluorescence microscopy, infrared photoinduced force microscopy and laboratory&#8208;based X&#8208;ray nano&#8208;computed tomography, have helped to expand the arsenal of tools available to scientists in catalysis and polymer science. In terms of future research, the review outlines the role and impact of in situ and operando (spectro&#8208;)microscopy experiments, involving sophisticated reactors as well as online reactant and product analysis, to obtain real&#8208;time information on the formation, decomposition, and mobility of polymer phases within catalyst particles. Furthermore, the potential of fluorescence, X&#8208;ray&#160;and optical microscopy is highlighted for the high&#8208;throughput characterization of olefin polymerization and polyolefin decomposition catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Sialyl Lewisa Antigen and the Effective Anticancer Activity of Its Bacteriophage Q&#946; Conjugate as an Anticancer Vaccine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sialyl Lewisa (sLea), also known as cancer antigen 19&#8208;9 (CA19&#8208;9), is a tumor associated carbohydrate antigen. The overexpression of sLea on the surface of a variety of cancer cells makes it an attractive target for anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. However, sLea based anticancer vaccines have been under&#8208;explored. To develop a new vaccine, efficient stereoselective synthesis of sLea with an amine bearing linker was achieved, which was subsequently conjugated with a powerful carrier bacteriophage Q&#946;. Mouse immunization with the Q&#946;&#8208;sLea conjugate generated strong and long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;sLea IgG antibody responses, which were superior to those induced by the corresponding conjugate of sLea with the benchmark carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies elicited by Q&#946;&#8208;sLea were highly selective toward sLea structure, could bind strongly with sLea expressing cancer cells and human pancreatic cancer tissues, and kill tumor cells via complement mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, vaccination with Q&#946;&#8208;sLea significantly reduced tumor development in a metastatic cancer model in mice, demonstrating tumor protection for the first time by a sLea based vaccine highlighting the significant potential of sLea as a promising cancer antigen.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioactive Luminescent Silver Clusters Confined in Zeolites Enable Quick and Wash&#8208;Free Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simultaneous capture and detection of biomolecules is crucial for revolutionizing bioanalytical platforms in terms of portability, response time and cost&#8208;efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate how the sensitivity to external stimuli and changes in the local electronic environment of silver clusters lead to an advantageous biosensing platform based on the fluorometric response of bioactive silver clusters (BioLuSiC) confined in faujasite X zeolites functionalized with antibodies. The photoluminescence response of BioLuSiC was enhanced upon immunocomplex formation, empowering a wash&#8208;free and quick biodetection system offering optimal results from 5 min. Proteins and pathogens (immunoglobulin G and Escherichia coli) were targeted to demonstrate the biosensing performance of BioLuSiC, and a human serum titration assay was also established. BioLuSiC will pave the way for innovative bioanalytical platforms, including real&#8208;time monitoring systems, point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices and bioimaging techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>An Oxysulfide Photocatalyst Evolving Hydrogen with an Apparent Quantum Efficiency of 30% under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic water splitting is a simple means of converting solar energy into storable hydrogen energy. Narrow&#8208;bandgap oxysulfide photocatalysts have attracted much attention in this regard owing to the significant visible&#8208;light absorption and relatively high stability of these compounds. However, existing materials suffer from low efficiencies due to difficulties in synthesizing these oxysulfides with suitable degrees of crystallinity and particle sizes, and in constructing effective reaction sites. The present work demonstrates the production of a Gd2Ti2O5S2 (&#955; &lt; 650 nm) photocatalyst capable of efficiently driving photocatalytic reactions. Single&#8208;crystalline, plate&#8208;like Gd2Ti2O5S2 particles with atomically ordered surfaces were synthesized by flux and chemical etching methods. Ultrafine Pt&#8208;IrO2 cocatalyst particles that promoted hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions were subsequently loaded on the Gd2Ti2O5S2 while ensuring an intimate contact by employing a microwave&#8208;heating technique. The optimized Gd2Ti2O5S2 was found to evolve H2 from an aqueous methanol solution with a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 30% at 420 nm. This material was also stable during O2 evolution in the presence of a sacrificial reagent. The results presented herein demonstrates a highly efficient narrow&#8208;bandgap oxysulfide photocatalyst with potential applications in practical solar hydrogen production and also elucidate the associated mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Counting d Orbital Vacancy of Transition&#8208;metal Catalysts for the Sulfur Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) would allow the production of renewable high&#8208;capacity rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries using sustainable, and nontoxic elemental sulfur as a cathode material, but its slow reaction rate causes a serious shuttle effect and dramatically reduces the capacity. We found that a catalyst composed of Pd nanoparticles supported by ordered mesoporous carbon (Pd/OMC) had a high reaction rate in the SRR, and a Li&#8208;S battery assembled with this catalyst had a low shuttle constant of 0.031 h&#8208;1 and a high&#8208;rate performance with a specific capacity of 1527 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C which is close to the theoretical value. The high activity of Pd/OMC with a d orbital vacancy of 0.87 e was predicted from a volcano relationship between the d charge for the metal and the adsorption activation entropy and reaction rate for the SRR by examining Pd, Au, Pt, Rh, and Ru transition&#8208;metal nanocatalysts. The strategy of using a single electronic structure descriptor to design high&#8208;efficiency SRR catalysts has suggested a way to produce practical Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation Engineering the Spin Change of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks via Cluster Deconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin crossover (SCO) materials with new architectures will expand and enrich the research in the SCO field. Here, we report two metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) containing tetradentate organic ligands and hexatopic linkers [Ag8X8(CN)6]6&#8722; (X = Br and I), which represents the first SCO MOF with clusters as building blocks. The silver halide cluster can be further removed after reacting with LiTCNQ. Such post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is realized via single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation from urk to nbo topology. Accordingly, the spin state and fluorescence properties are greatly modified by cluster deconstruction. These achievements will provide new ideas for the design of new SCO systems and the development of PSM methods.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probe for Precise Detection of the Pulmonary Metastatic Tumors: A Traditional Molecule Having a Stunning Turn</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An accurate detection of lung metastasis is of great significance for making better treatment choices and improving cancer prognosis, but remains a big challenge in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a reinventing strategy to develop a pH&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent nanoprobe, pulmonary metastasis tracer (denoted as PMT), based on assembly of NIR dye IR780 and calcium phosphate (CaP). By delicately tuning the intermolecular interactions during the assembly process and dye doping content, as well as the synthetic condition of probe, the fluorescence of PMT could be finely adjusted via the tumor acidity&#8208;triggered disassembly. Notably, the selected PMT9 could sharply convert subtle pH variations into a distinct fluorescence signal to generate high fluorescence ON/OFF contrast, dramatically reducing the background signals. Benefiting from such preferable features, PMT9 is able to precisely identify not only the tumor sites in orthotopic lung cancer models but also the pulmonary metastases in mice with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR). This study provides a unique strategy to turn shortcomings of traditional dye IR780 during in vivo imaging into advantages and further expand the application of fluorescent probe to image lung associated tumor lesions</dc:description>

         <title>The Molecular Basis of Catalysis by SDR Family Members Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Reductase FabG and Enoyl&#8208;ACP Reductase FabI in Type&#8208;II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily members acyl&#8208;ACP reductases FabG and FabI are indispensable core enzymatic modules and catalytic orientation controllers in type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthetic route, and are used as key catalysts in producing numerous pro&#8208;pharmaceutical chiral intermediate. How they perform distinct asymmetric reduction remains unclear. Here, we report their distinct substrate allosteric recognition and enantioselective reduction mechanisms. FabG achieves allosteric regulation of ACP and NADPH through ACP binding across two adjacent FabG monomers, while FabI follows an irreversible compulsory&#8208;order of substrate binding in that NADH binding must precede that of ACP on a discrete FabI monomer. Moreover, FabG and FabI utilize a backdoor residue Phe187 or a &#8220;rheostat&#8221; &#945;8 helix for acyl chain length selection, and their corresponding triad residues Ser142 or Tyr145 recognized the keto&#8208; or enoyl&#8208;acyl substrates respectively, facilitating initiation of nucleophilic attack by NAD(P)H. Other two triad residues (Tyr and Lys) mediate subsequent proton transfer and R&#8208;chiral 3&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208; or saturated acyl&#8208;ACP production. Our results provide key mechanistic insights into these acyl&#8208;ACP reductases, which are conserved through FAS, PKS, and NRPS analogous biosynthetic routes for future antibacterial drug design, and provide fundamental molecular basis for protein engineering and optimization for synthetic biological and pharmaceutical industry applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrazine&#8208;linked Iron&#8208;coordinated Tetrapyrrole Conjugated Organic Polymer Catalyst with Spatially Proximate Donor&#8208;Acceptor Pairs for Oxygen Reduction in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated iron (Fe&#8208;N4) materials represent the most promising non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of fuel cells. However, molecular&#8208;level structure design of Fe&#8208;N4 electrocatalyst remains a great challenge. In this study, we develop a novel Fe&#8208;N4 conjugated organic polymer (COP) electrocatalyst, which allows for precise design of the Fe&#8208;N4 structure, leading to unprecedented ORR performance. At the molecular level, we have successfully organized spatially proximate iron&#8208;pyrrole/pyrazine (FePr/Pz) pairs into fully conjugated polymer networks, which in turn endows FePr sites with firmly covalent&#8208;bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and highly dense distribution. The resulting pyrazine&#8208;linked iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (Pz&#8208;FeTPr) COP electrocatalyst exhibits superior performance compared to most ORR electrocatalysts, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.933&#8201;V and negligible activity decay after 40,000 cycles. When used as the cathode electrocatalyst in a hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell, the Pz&#8208;FeTPr COP achieves a peak power density of ~210 mW cm&#8208;2. We anticipate the COP based Fe&#8208;N4 catalyst design could be an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance catalyst for facilitating the progress of fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of&#160;a&#160;Potent Deubiquitinase (DUB)&#160;Small Molecule Activity&#8208;based Probe Enables Broad Spectrum DUB&#160;Activity Profiling in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are a family of &gt;100 proteases that hydrolyze isopeptide bonds linking ubiquitin to protein substrates. This leads to reduced substrate degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. Deregulation of DUB activity has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration and auto&#8208;inflammation, and several have been recognized as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Ubiquitin&#8208;derived covalent activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) provide a powerful tool for DUB activity profiling, but their large recognition element impedes cellular permeability and presents an unmet need for small molecule ABPs which can account for regulation of DUB activity in intact cells or organisms. Here, through comprehensive chemoproteomic warhead profiling, we identify cyanopyrrolidine (CNPy) probe IMP&#8208;2373 (12) as a small molecule pan&#8208;DUB ABP to monitor DUB activity in physiologically relevant live cells. Through proteomics and targeted assays, we demonstrate that IMP&#8208;2373 quantitatively engages more than 35 DUBs across a range of non&#8208;toxic concentrations in diverse cell lines. We further demonstrate its application to quantification of changes in intracellular DUB activity during pharmacological inhibition and during MYC deregulation in a model of B cell lymphoma. IMP&#8208;2373 thus offers a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs to monitor dynamic DUB activity in the context of disease&#8208;relevant phenotypes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are a family of &amp;gt;100 proteases that hydrolyze isopeptide bonds linking ubiquitin to protein substrates. This leads to reduced substrate degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system.

         <title>Achiral Dichroic Dyes&#8208;mediated Circularly Polarized Emission Regulated by Orientational Order Parameter through Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is noteworthy that cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) platforms have been witnessed in high&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) behaviors through the highly organized chiral co&#8208;assembled arrangement of achiral dyes. However, most CPL&#8208;active design strategies are closely relative to the helix co&#8208;assembly structure of CLC rather than achiral dyes. Herein, we developed an intriguing regulation strategy for CPL&#8208;active CLC materials. They were regulated using the orientational order parameter (SF) of achiral dichroic dyes as an incisive probe for the order arrangement degree of achiral dyes in CLC media. The I&#8208;shaped phenothiazine derivative PHECN dye (SF =0.30) emitted a strong CPL signal (|glum| = 0.47). In contrast, the T&#8208;shaped derivative (PHEBen) dye (SF =0.09) showed a weak circular polarization level (|glum| = 0.07) at similar CLC textures. Most interestingly, this kind of dichroic PHECN dye with a higher SF could greatly improve the contrast ratio of CPL (&#916;glum = 0.47) and emission intensity (&#916;FL = 46.0%) at direct&#8208;current electric field compared with the T&#8208;shaped PHEBen (&#916;glum = 0.07 and &#916;FL = 1.0%) in CLCs. This work demonstrates that an induced CPL emission can be mediated using achiral dichroic dye, which will open a new avenue for developing excellent CPL&#8208;active display materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Persistent Circularly Polarized Luminescence from a Host&#8208;Guest System Regulated by the Multiple Roles of Gold(I)&#8208;Carbene Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The promotion of intersystem crossing (ISC) is critical for achieving a high&#8208;efficiency long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) from organic materials. However, the use of transition metal complex for LPL materials has not been explored because it can also shorten emission lifetime by accelerating the phosphorescence decay. Here, we report a new class of LPL materials by doping a monovalent Au&#8208;carbene complex into a boron&#8208;embedded molecular host . The donor&#8208;acceptor systems exhibit photoluminescence with both high efficiencies (&gt; 57%) and long lifetimes (ca. 40 ms) at room temperature. It is revealed that the Au atom promotes the population of low&#8208;lying triplet excited states of the host aggregate (T1*) which can be converted to the charge&#8208;transfer &#65288;CT&#65289;state, resulting in afterglow luminescence. Moreover, the use of a chirality unit on the guest molecule makes the LPL circularly polarized. This work manifests that transition metal complexes can be used for developing organic afterglow systems by exquisite control over the excited state mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Guanidinate Anions [CN3]5&#8208; in Calcite&#8208;Type SbCN3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stabilization of nitrogen&#8208;rich phases presents a significant chemical challenge due to the inherent stability of the dinitrogen molecule. This stabilization can be achieved by utilizing strong covalent bonds in complex anions with carbon, such as cyanide CN&#8208; and NCN2&#8208;&#160;carbodiimide, while more nitrogen&#8208;rich carbonitrides are hitherto unknown. Following a rational chemical design approach, we synthesized antimony guanidinate SbCN3 at pressures of 32&#8208;38 GPa using various synthetic routes in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. SbCN3, which is isostructural to calcite CaCO3, can be recovered under ambient conditions. Its structure contains the previously elusive guanidinate anion [CN3]5&#8208;, marking a fundamental milestone in nitridocarbonate&#160;chemistry. The crystal structure of SbCN3 was solved and refined from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and was fully corroborated by theoretical calculations, which also predict that SbCN3 has a direct band gap with the value 2.20 eV. This study opens a straightforward route to the entire new family of inorganic nitridocarbonates.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Decorated Organoboron Emitters with Low&#8208;Lying HOMO Levels for Solution&#8208;Processed Narrowband Blue Hyperfluorescence OLED Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hyperfluorescence has drawn great attention in achieving efficient narrowband emitting devices based on multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. However, achieving efficient solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices is still a challenge, due to the unbalanced charge transport and serious exciton quenching caused by that the holes are easily trapped on the high&#8208;lying HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) level of traditional diphenylamine&#8208;decorated emitters. Here, we developed two narrowband blue organoboron emitters with low&#8208;lying HOMO levels by decorating the MR&#8208;TADF core with weakly electron&#8208;donating carbazoles, which could suppress the hole trapping effect by reducing the hole traps between host and MR&#8208;TADF emitter from deep (0.40 eV) to shallow (0.14/0.20 eV) ones for facilitating hole transport and exciton formation, as well as avoiding exciton quenching. And the large dihedral angle between the carbazole and MR&#8208;TADF core makes the carbazole act as a steric hindrance to inhibit molecular aggregation. Accordingly, the optimized solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices simultaneously realize record external quantum efficiency of 29.2%, narrowband emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 16.6 nm, and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.139, 0.189), which is the best result for the solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Depolymerization of Plastic Waste Enabled by Plastic&#8208;Catalyst Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depolymerization of condensation polymers by chemolysis often suffers from the large usage of solvents and homogeneous catalysts such as acids, bases, and metal salts. The catalytic efficiency of heterogeneous catalysts is largely constrained by the poor interfacial contact between solid catalysts and solid plastics below melting points. We report here our discovery of autogenous heterogeneous catalyst layer on polyethylene terephthalate surfaces during the generally believed homogeneous catalytic depolymerization process. Inspired by the &#8220;contact mass&#8221; concept in industrial chlorosilane production, we further demonstrate that the construction of plastic&#8208;catalyst solid&#8208;solid interfaces enables solvent&#8208;free depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate by vapor phase methanolysis at relatively low temperatures. Trace amounts of earth&#8208;abundant element (zinc) introduced by electrostatic adsorption is sufficient for catalyzing the depolymerization. The concept of plastic&#8208;catalyst contact mass interfacial catalysis might inspire new pathways for tackling plastic waste problems.</dc:description>

To construct high&#8208;performance narrowband fluorophores to satisfy requirements of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays, a strategy fusing multi&#8208;resonance BN&#8208;doped moieties to naphthalene is proposed to construct two novel narrowband fluorophores.&#160;Green Na&#8208;sBN and red Na&#8208;dBN, manifest narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima of 31 nm, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and molecular horizontal dipole ratios above 90%. Their OLEDs exhibit the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances including high external quantum efficiencies (EQE), ultra&#8208;low efficiency roll&#8208;off and long&#160;operational lifetimes. The Na&#8208;sBN&#8208;based device achieves EQE as high as 28.8% and remains 19.8% even at luminance of 100,000 cd m&#8208;2, and Na&#8208;dBN&#8208;based device acquires a record&#8208;high EQE of 25.2% among all red OLEDs using pure&#160;fluorescent emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Catalytic Potential: Exploring the Impact of Thermal Treatment on Enhanced Electrocatalysis of Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the evolving field of electrocatalysis, thermal treatment of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts has become an essential strategy for performance enhancement. This review systematically investigates the impact of various thermal treatments on the catalytic potential of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts. The focus encompasses an in&#8208;depth analysis of the changes induced in structural, morphological, and compositional properties, as well as alterations in electro&#8208;active surface area, surface chemistry, and crystal defects. By providing a comprehensive comparison of commonly used thermal techniques, such as annealing, calcination, sintering, pyrolysis, hydrothermal, and solvothermal methods, this review serves as a scientific guide for selecting the right thermal technique and favorable temperature to tailor the nano&#8208;electrocatalysts for optimal electrocatalysis. The resultant modifications in catalytic activity are explored across key electrochemical reactions such as electrochemical (bio)sensing, catalytic degradation, oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, fuel cells, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Through a detailed examination of the underlying mechanisms and synergistic effects, this review contributes to a fundamental understanding of the role of thermal treatments in enhancing electrocatalytic properties. The insights provided offer a roadmap for future research aimed at optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of nanomaterials, fostering the development of next&#8208;generation sensors and energy conversion technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Multivariate hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with tunable permanent porosity for a mustard gas simulant capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise synthesis of topologically predictable and discrete molecular crystals with permanent porosities remains a long&#8208;term challenge. Here, we report the first successful synthesis of a series of isoreticular multivariate hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MTV&#8208;HOFs) from pyrene&#8208;based derivatives bearing &#8208;H, &#8208;CH3, &#8208;NH2 and &#8208;F groups achieved by a shape&#8208;fitted, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly strategy. These MTV&#8208;HOFs are single&#8208;crystalline materials composed of tectons with as many as 4 different functionalities, verified by single&#8208;crystal diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, and Raman spectra. These MTV&#8208;HOFs exhibit tunable hydrophobicity with water uptake starting from 50 to 80% relative humidity, by adjusting the combinations and ratios of functional groups. As a proof of application, the resulting MTV&#8208;HOFs were shown to be capable of capturing a mustard gas simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) from moisture. The location of different functional groups within the pores of MTV&#8208;HOFs leads to a synergistic effect, which resulted in a superior CEES/H2O selectivity (up to 94%) to that of the HOFs with only pure component and enhanced breakthrough performance (up to 4000 min/g) when compared to benchmark MOF materials. The synthesis of MTV&#8208;HOFs provides a platform for the development of porous molecular materials for numerous applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting the Catenane Mechanical Bond Effect for Selective Halide Anion Transmembrane Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first examples of [2]catenanes capable of selective anion transport across a lipid bilayer are reported. The neutral halogen bonding (XB) [2]catenanes were prepared via a chloride template&#8208;directed strategy in an unprecedented demonstration of using XB&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;anion interactions to direct catenane assembly from all&#8208;neutral components. Anion binding experiments in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media revealed strong halide over oxoanion selectivity, and a marked enhancement in the chloride and bromide affinities of the catenanes relative to their constituent macrocycles. The catenanes displayed an anti&#8208;Hofmeister binding preference for bromide over the larger iodide anion, illustrating the efficacy of employing sigma&#8208;hole interactions in conjunction with the mechanical bond effect to tune receptor selectivity. Transmembrane anion transport studies conducted in POPC LUVs revealed that the catenanes were more effective anion transporters than the constituent macrocycles, with high chloride over hydroxide selectivity, which is critical to potential therapeutic applications of anionophores. Remarkably these outperform existing acyclic halogen bonding anionophores with regards to this selectivity. Record chloride over nitrate anion transport selectivity was also observed. This represents a rare example of the direct translation of intrinsic anion binding affinities to anion transport behaviour, and demonstrates the key role of the catenane mechanical bond effect for enhanced anion transport selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A High Pressure Operando Spectroscopy Examination of Bimetal Interactions in &#8216;Metal Efficient&#8217; Palladium/In2O3/Al2O3 Catalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando spectroscopy under CO2 hydrogenation conditions reveals the importance of catalyst design in a metal&#8208;efficient Palladium/In2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. Concurrent X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements of Pd and In, combined with infrared techniques reveals the roles of the two metals, relating them to the catalytic mechanism with vital insights for future multimetallic catalyst development.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has the potential to serve as a sustainable route to a wide variety of hydrocarbons, fuels and plastics in the quest for net zero. Synergistic Pd/In2O3 (Palldium on Indium Oxide) catalysts show high CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity, enhancing methanol yield. The identity of the optimal active site for this reaction is unclear, either as a Pd&#8722;In alloy, proximate metals, or distinct sites. In this work, we demonstrate that metal&#8208;efficient Pd/In2O3 species dispersed on Al2O3 can match the performance of pure Pd/In2O3 systems. Further, we follow the evolution of both Pd and In sites, and surface species, under operando reaction conditions using X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscpy (XAS) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. In doing so, we can determine both the nature of the active sites and the influence on the catalytic mechanism.

         <title>A Deeper Understanding of Metal Nucleation and Growth in Rechargeable Metal Batteries Through Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable metal batteries are still at the forefront of battery research. Each battery cell component that relates to anode performance (the current collector, anode surface, solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), and electrolyte) is described by a unique set of applicable models and theories to better understand and predict metal nucleation and growth.







Abstract
Lithium and sodium metal batteries continue to occupy the forefront of battery research. Their exceptionally high energy density and nominal voltages are highly attractive for cutting&#8208;edge energy storage applications. Anode&#8208;free metal batteries are also coming into the research spotlight offering improved safety and even higher energy densities than conventional metal batteries. However, uneven metal nucleation and growth which leads to dendrites continues to limit the commercialisation of conventional and anode&#8208;free metal batteries alike. This review connects models and theories from well&#8208;established fields in metallurgy and electrodeposition to both conventional and anode&#8208;free metal batteries. These highly applicable models and theories explain the driving forces of uneven metal growth and can inform future experiment design. Finally, the models and theories that are most relevant to each anode&#8208;related cell component are identified. Keeping these specific models and theories in mind will assist with rational design for these components.

         <title>Increasing the Magnetic Blocking Temperature of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite three decades of intensive investigation of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) there are still unexplored roads towards increasing their magnetization blocking temperature. In this Review, after short overview of key SMM compounds, the basic strategies for further enhancement of SMM performance for mononuclear and polynuclear complexes are presented.







Abstract
The synthesis of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), magnetic complexes capable of retaining magnetization blocking for a long time at elevated temperatures, has been a major concern for magnetochemists over the last three decades. In this review, we describe basic SMMs and the different approaches that allow high magnetization&#8208;blocking temperatures to be reached. We focus on the basic factors affecting magnetization blocking, magnetic axiality and the height of the blocking barrier, which can be used to group different families of complexes in terms of their SMM efficiency. Finally, we discuss several practical routes for the design of mono&#8208; and polynuclear complexes that could be applied in memory devices.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Olefin Based Crystalline Schlenk Hydrocarbon Diradicals with a Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable crystalline Schlenk hydrocarbon diradical was isolated without any kinetic blocking at the central m&#8208;phenylene bridge. An EPR study and quantum chemical calculations suggest the triplet state to be the ground state.







Abstract
A modular approach for the synthesis of isolable crystalline Schlenk hydrocarbon diradicals from m&#8208;phenylene bridged electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;triazaalkenes as synthons is reported. EPR spectroscopy confirms their diradical nature and triplet electronic structure by revealing a half&#8208;field signal. A computational analysis confirms the triplet state to be the ground state. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the modular methodology, the 4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;m&#8208;phenylene was further utilized as a coupling unit between two alkene motifs. The steric conjunction of the 4,6&#8208;dimethyl groups substantially twists the substituents at the nonbonding electron bearing centers relative to the central coupling m&#8208;phenylene motif. As a result, the spin delocalization is decreased and the exchange coupling between the two unpaired spins, hence, significantly reduced. Notably, 108&#8197;years after Schlenk's m&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl) synthesis as a diradical, for the first time we were able to isolate its derivative with the same spacer, i.e. m&#8208;phenylene, between two radical centers in a crystalline form.

         <title>Bioelectrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Mo&#8208;Dependent Formylmethanofuran Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electroenzymatic catalysis of the multisubunit complex formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase was investigated (left panel). The O2&#8208;sensitive enzyme isolated from a thermophilic methanogen reduces CO2 with high faradaic efficiency upon deposition on a graphite rod electrode (middle panel). The low affinity for formate (right panel) favoured its accumulation, an interesting property for CO2&#8208;conversion technologies.







Abstract
Massive efforts are invested in developing innovative CO2&#8208;sequestration strategies to counter climate change and transform CO2 into higher&#8208;value products. CO2&#8208;capture by reduction is a chemical challenge, and attention is turned toward biological systems that selectively and efficiently catalyse this reaction under mild conditions and in aqueous solvents. While a few reports have evaluated the effectiveness of isolated bacterial formate dehydrogenases as catalysts for the reversible electrochemical reduction of CO2, it is imperative to explore other enzymes among the natural reservoir of potential models that might exhibit higher turnover rates or preferential directionality for the reductive reaction. Here, we present electroenzymatic catalysis of formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase, a CO2&#8208;reducing&#8208;and&#8208;fixing biomachinery isolated from a thermophilic methanogen, which was deposited on a graphite rod electrode to enable direct electron transfer for electroenzymatic CO2 reduction. The gas is reduced with a high Faradaic efficiency (109&#177;1&#8201;%), where a low affinity for formate prevents its electrochemical reoxidation and favours formate accumulation. These properties make the enzyme an excellent tool for electroenzymatic CO2&#8208;fixation and inspiration for protein engineering that would be beneficial for biotechnological purposes to convert the greenhouse gas into stable formate that can subsequently be safely stored, transported, and used for power generation without energy loss.

         <title>Tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;based Chelating Ligand Additive as a Molecular Sieving Interfacial Barrier toward Durable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustained water consumption and uncontrollable dendrite growth strongly hamper the practical applications of rechargeable zinc (Zn) metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate that trace amount of chelate ligand additive can serve as a &#8220;molecular sieve&#8208;like&#8221; interfacial barrier and achieve highly efficient Zn plating/stripping. As verified by theoretical modeling and experimental investigations, the benzenesulfonic acid groups on the additive molecular not only facilitates its water solubility and selective adsorption on the Zn anode, but also effectively accelerates the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of Zn2+. Meanwhile, the central porphyrin ring on the chelate ligand effectively expels free water molecules from Zn2+ via chemical binding against hydrogen evolution, and reversibly releases the captured Zn2+ to endow a dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. By virtue of this non&#8208;consumable additive, high average Zn plating/stripping efficiency of 99.7% over 2100 cycles together with extended lifespan and suppressed water decomposition in the Zn||MnO2 full battery were achieved, thus opening a new avenue for developing highly durable ZMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Simple Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic direct functionalization/acylation of strong aliphatic C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds is disclosed via an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of aldehydes with simple alkanes. The inert aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds are efficiently cleaved through intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer, providing an alternative organocatalytic approach for alkane C&#8722;H functionalization under transition metal&#8208; and light free conditions.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds to form carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds offers vast potential for chemical synthesis and therefore receives increasing attention. At present, most successes come from strategies using metal catalysts/reagents or photo/electrochemical processes. The use of organocatalysis for this purpose remains scarce, especially when dealing with challenging C&#8722;H bonds such as those from simple alkanes. Here we disclose the first organocatalytic direct functionalization/acylation of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds of completely unfunctionalized alkanes. Our approach involves N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst&#8208;mediated carbonyl radical intermediate generation and coupling with simple alkanes (through the corresponding alkyl radical intermediates generated via a hydrogen atom transfer process). Unreactive C&#8722;H bonds are widely present in fossil fuel feedstocks, commercially important organic polymers, and complex molecules such as natural products. Our present study shall inspire a new avenue for quick functionalization of these molecules under the light&#8208; and metal&#8208;free catalytic conditions.

Crosstalk between the liver and tumor can significantly impact the tumor targeting efficiency of thiol&#8208;responsive nanoparticles through hepatic glutathione efflux.







Abstract
The elevated glutathione (GSH) level in solid tumors has been used as a major hallmark for GSH&#8208;responsive nanoparticles to enhance targeting efficiency and specificity. Meanwhile, GSH is mainly synthesized inside the hepatocytes of the liver in the body and constantly released into the blood through hepatic GSH efflux to regulate redox potential of the entire body. However, it remains largely unknown how this hepatic GSH efflux affects the tumor targeting of GSH&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. Herein, we report that depletion of hepatic GSH enhanced the tumor targeting of GSH&#8208;responsive indocyanine green&#8208;conjugated Au25 nanoclusters coated with 18 GSH ligand (ICG&#8208;Au25SG18). The dissociation of ICG from Au25SG18 by the hepatic GSH through thiol&#8208;exchange reaction and the subsequent hepatobiliary clearance of the detached ICG were slowed down by GSH depletion, which in turn prolonged the blood circulation of intact ICG&#8208;Au25SG18 and enhanced its tumor targeting. Our work highlights glutathione&#8208;mediated crosstalk between the liver and tumor, in addition to well&#8208;known Kupffer cell&#8208;mediated uptake, in the tumor targeting of engineered nanoparticles, which could be modulated to enhance targeting efficiency and specificity of cancer nanomedicines while reducing their nonspecific accumulation.

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly from Crystals to Helices of Protic Acyclic Carbene AuI&#8208;Enantiomers with Chirality Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel protic acyclic carbene&#8208;AuI enantiomers exhibited solvation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly from crystals to helices driven by synergetic aurophilicity and H&#8208;bonds. Three polymorphs showed intense thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with high quantum yield (&#934;FL). Extended helical Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au chains in helices amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with boosted luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) and CPL brightness (BCPL).







Abstract
Constructing chiral supramolecular assembly and exploring the underlying mechanism are of great significance in promoting the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. Herein, we report a solvation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly from single&#8208;crystals to helical nanofibers based on the first protic acyclic (methoxy)(amino)carbenes (pAMACs) AuI&#8208;enantiomers driven by a synergetic aurophilic interactions and H&#8208;bonds. Their aggregation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties with high quantum yields (&#934;FL) up to 95&#8201;% were proved to be attributed to packing modes of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au dimers with &#960;&#8208;stacking or one&#8208;dimensional extended Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au chains. Via drop&#8208;casting method, supramolecular P&#8208; or M&#8208;helices were prepared. Detailed studies on the helices demonstrate that formations of extended helical Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au molecular chains amplify supramolecular chirality, leading to strong CPL with high dissymmetry factor (|glum|=0.030, &#934;FL=67&#8201;%) and high CPL brightness (BCPL) of 4.87&#215;10&#8722;3. Our findings bring new insights into the fabrication of helical structures to improve CPL performance by modifying aurophilic interactions.

         <title>Pd Loaded NiCo Hydroxides for Biomass Electrooxidation: Understanding the Synergistic Effect of Proton Deintercalation and Adsorption Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By loading Pd NCs on the Co&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2, we were able to promote the proton deintercalation process on the catalyst surface as well as HMF adsorption, respectively. As a result, a comprehensive optimization in performance by simultaneously decreasing the onset potential of the reaction and enhancing the current density can be achieved.







Abstract
The key issue in the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) is to understand the synergistic mechanism involving the protons deintercalation of catalyst and the adsorption of the substrate. In this study, a Pd/NiCo catalyst was fabricated by modifying Pd clusters onto a Co&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 support, in which the introduction of Co induced lattice distortion and optimized the energy band structure of Ni sites, while the Pd clusters with an average size of 1.96&#8197;nm exhibited electronic interactions with NiCo support, resulting in electron transfer from Pd to Ni sites. The resulting Pd/NiCo exhibited low onset potential of 1.32&#8197;V and achieved a current density of 50&#8197;mA/cm2 at only 1.38&#8197;V. Compared to unmodified Ni(OH)2, the Pd/NiCo achieved an 8.3&#8208;fold increase in peak current density. DFT calculations and in situ XAFS revealed that the Co sites affected the conformation and band structure of neighboring Ni sites through CoO6 octahedral distortion, reducing the proton deintercalation potential of Pd/NiCo and promoting the production of Ni3+&#8722;O active species accordingly. The involvement of Pd decreased the electronic transfer impedance, and thereby accelerated Ni3+&#8722;O formation. Moreover, the Pd clusters enhanced the adsorption of HMF through orbital hybridization, kinetically promoting the contact and reaction of HMF with Ni3+&#8722;O.

         <title>An Organic Coordination Manganese Complex as Cathode for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Zinc&#8208;metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the coordination stabilization of PAL ligands, the highly reversible high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;phase Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple is realized in near&#8208;neutral aqueous Zn&#8722;Mn batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8722;Mn battery has been considered as the most promising scalable energy&#8208;storage system due to its intrinsic safety and especially ultralow cost. However, the traditional Zn&#8722;Mn battery mainly using manganese oxides as cathode shows low voltage and suffers from dissolution/disproportionation of the cathode during cycling. Herein, for the first time, a high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle Zn&#8722;Mn battery based on a highly reversible organic coordination manganese complex cathode (Manganese polyacrylate, PAL&#8722;Mn) was constructed. Benefiting from the insoluble carboxylate ligand of PAL&#8722;Mn that can suppress shuttle effect and disproportionationation reaction of Mn3+ in a mild electrolyte, Mn3+/Mn2+ reaction in coordination state is realized, which not only offers a high discharge voltage of 1.67&#8197;V but also exhibits excellent cyclability (100&#8201;% capacity retention, after 4000 cycles). High voltage reaction endows the Zn&#8722;Mn battery high specific energy (600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), indicating a bright application prospect. The strategy of introducing carboxylate ligands in Zn&#8722;Mn battery to harness high&#8208;voltage reaction of Mn3+/Mn2+ well broadens the research of high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8722;Mn batteries under mild electrolyte conditions.

         <title>Enantioselective De Novo Synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Diaryl Ketones from Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones from alkynes through chiral phosphoric acid catalysis is demonstrated. This method also serves as an efficient deuteration method for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;deuterated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones. Using the methodology, bioactive molecules, including one of the best&#8208;selling anti&#8208;breast cancer drugs, tamoxifen, are readily synthesized.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones are structural motifs commonly present in bioactive molecules, and they are also valuable building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. However, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones bearing a tertiary stereogenic center remains largely unsolved. Herein, we report a catalytic de novo enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones from simple alkynes via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. A broad range of enolizable &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones are prepared in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. The described protocol also serves as an efficient deuteration method for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched deuterated &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones. Using the methodology reported, bioactive molecules, including one of the best&#8208;selling anti&#8208;breast cancer drugs, tamoxifen, are readily synthesized.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization of a Pyrene&#8208;Substituted Diamide and Its Ensemble of Kinetically Trapped Configurations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic characteristics of the kinetic state in supramolecular polymerization must be thoroughly understood to advance the design and synthesis of functional soft materials. This molecular dynamics study provides the same, along with new insights into the monomeric and thermodynamic states, thus addressing the origin of the lag phase. It also describes the minimum free&#8208;energy path from the kinetic to the thermodynamic states.







Abstract
The prevalence of kinetically accessible states in supramolecular polymerization pathways has been exploited to control the growth of the polymer and thereby to obtain niche morphologies. Yet, these pathways themselves are not easily amenable for experimental delineation but could potentially be understood through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Herein, we report an extensive investigation of the self&#8208;assembly of pyrene&#8208;substituted diamide (PDA) monomers in solution, conducted using atomistic MD simulations and advanced sampling methods. We characterize such kinetic and thermodynamic states as well as the transition pathways and free energy barriers between them. PDA forms a dimeric segment with the N&#8208; to C&#8208;termini vectors of the diamide moieties arranged either in parallel or anti&#8208;parallel fashion. This characteristic, combined with the molecule's torsional flexibility and pyrene&#8211;solvent interactions, presents an ensemble of molecular configurations contributing to the kinetic state in the polymerization pathway. While this ensemble primarily comprises short oligomers containing a mix of anti&#8208;parallel and parallel dimeric segments, the thermodynamic state of the assembly is a right&#8208;handed polymer featuring parallel ones only. Our work thus offers an approach by which the landscape of any specific supramolecular polymerization can be deconstructed.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aminomethylation of Alkyl Halides Enabled by Sterically Hindered N&#8208;Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalyzed aminomethylation of alkyl halides was realized for the synthesis of tertiary amines bearing bulky substituents and it involves radical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. The bulky N&#8208;substituents serve as an activation group to overcome the redox&#8208;potential barrier in these reactions, allowing synthesis of sterically congested tertiary amines.







Abstract
The catalytic C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling of alkyl halides and tertiary amines offers a promising tool for the rapid decoration of amine skeletons. However, this approach has not been well established, partially due to the challenges in precisely distinguishing and controlling the reactivity of amine&#8208;coupling partners and their product homologues. Herein, we developed a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic system for the aminomethylation of alkyl halides through radical&#8208;involved C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation, allowing for the synthesis of sterically congested tertiary amines that are of interest in organic synthesis but not easily prepared by other methods. Mechanistic studies disclosed that sterically hindered N&#8208;substituents are key to activate the amine coupling partners by tuning their redox potentials to drive the reaction forward.

         <title>Multimode Luminescence Tailoring and Improvement of Cs2NaHoCl6 Cryolite Crystals via Sb3+/Yb3+ Alloying for Versatile Photoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cryolite material (Cs2NaHoCl6) has been successfully synthesized, showing remarkable characteristics including anti&#8208;thermal quenching and multimode photoluminescence. Further, its luminescence efficiency can be effectively improved and the emission was tailored through alloying Sb3+ ions (s&#8208;p energy levels) and Yb3+ ions (f&#8208;f energy levels). These findings highlight the immense potential in multifunctional photoelectric applications.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites are currently gaining significant attention owing to their exceptional environmental friendliness, structural adjustability as well as self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. However, stable and efficient double perovskite with multimode luminescence and tunable spectra are still urgently needed for multifunctional photoelectric application. Herein, holmium based cryolite materials (Cs2NaHoCl6) with anti&#8208;thermal quenching and multimode photoluminescence were successfully synthesized. By the further alloying of Sb3+ (s&#8208;p transitions) and Yb3+ (f&#8208;f transitions) ions, its luminescence properties can be well modulated, originating from tailoring band gap structure and enriching electron transition channels. Upon Sb3+ substitution in Cs2NaHoCl6, additional absorption peaking at 334&#8197;nm results in the tremendous increase of photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Meanwhile, not only the typical NIR emission around 980&#8197;nm of Ho3+ is enhanced, but also the red and NIR emissions show a diverse range of anti&#8208;thermal quenching photoluminescence behaviors. Furthermore, through designing Yb3+ doping, the up&#8208;conversion photoluminescence can be triggered by changing excitation laser power density (yellow&#8208;to&#8208;orange) and Yb3+ doping concentration (red&#8208;to&#8208;green). Through a combined experimental&#8208;theoretical approach, the related luminescence mechanism is revealed. In general, by alloying Sb3+/Yb3+ in Cs2NaHoCl6, abundant energy level ladders are constructed and more luminescence modes are derived, demonstrating great potential in multifunctional photoelectric applications.

Freezing a droplet containing DNA on gold surfaces gives rise to a uniform DNA monolayer with vertically standing up and laterally separated conformations. Compared to DNA surfaces obtained by traditional methods, the freezing&#8208;induced surface is remarkably stable over electrochemical interrogation and long&#8208;term storage. The uniform conformation increases the binding affinity of DNA by over 40&#8208;fold and enhances the antifouling performance in undiluted whole blood.







Abstract
Assembling DNA on solid surfaces is fundamental to surface&#8208;based DNA technology. However, precise control over DNA conformation and organization at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces remains a challenge, resulting in limited stability and sensitivity in biosensing applications. We herein communicate a simple and robust method for creating highly uniform DNA monolayers on gold surfaces by a freeze&#8208;thawing process. Using Raman spectroscopy, fluorescent imaging, and square wave voltammetry, we demonstrate that thiolated DNA is concentrated and immobilized on gold surfaces with an upright conformation. Moreover, our results reveal that the freezing&#8208;induced DNA surfaces are more uniform, leading to improved DNA stability and target recognition. Lastly, we demonstrate the successful detection of a model drug in undiluted whole blood while mitigating the effects of biofouling. Our work not only provides a simple approach to tailor the DNA&#8208;gold surface for biosensors but also sheds light on the unique behavior of DNA oligonucleotides upon freezing on the liquid&#8208;solid interface.

         <title>The Ambiguous Origin of Thermochromism in Molecular Crystals of Dichalcogenides: Chalcogen Bonds versus Dynamic Se&#8722;Se/Te&#8722;Te Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive thermochromism observed in dichalcogenide molecular crystals with no clear structural origin or associated phase transitions is found to be linked to the subtle changes in torsional vibrational modes around the dynamic Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonds.







Abstract
We report thermochromism in crystals of diphenyl diselenide (dpdSe) and diphenyl ditelluride (dpdTe), which is at variance with the commonly known mechanisms of thermochromism in molecular crystals. Variable temperature neutron diffraction studies indicated no conformational change, tautomerization or phase transition between 100&#8197;K and 295&#8197;K. High&#8208;pressure crystallography studies indicated no associated piezochromism in dpdSe and dpdTe crystals. The evolution of the crystal structures and their electronic band structure with pressure and temperature reveal the contributions of intramolecular and intermolecular factors towards the origin of thermochromism&#8212;especially the intermolecular Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se and Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds and torsional modes of vibrations around the dynamic Se&#8722;Se and Te&#8722;Te bonds. Further, a co&#8208;crystal of dpdSe with iodine (dpdSe&#8208;I2) and an alloy crystal of dpdSe and dpdTe implied a predominantly intramolecular origin of the observed thermochromism associated with vibronic coupling.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Diacetoxylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient electrocatalytic 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation of alkenes utilizing readily available materials in ambient conditions is developed. The protocol is widely applicable to aliphatic and aromatic alkenes with excellent faradaic efficiencies and yields of up to 96&#8201;%. The versatility of the method is expanded with alkenoic acids towards lactone derivatives and with other carboxylic acids like HCOOH.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Dioxygenation of alkenes leads to a structural motif ubiquitous in organic synthons, natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Straightforward and green synthesis protocols starting from abundant raw materials are required for facile and sustainable access to these crucial moieties. Especially industrially abundant aliphatic alkenes have proven to be arduous substrates in sustainable 1,2&#8208;dioxygenation methods. Here, we report a highly efficient electrocatalytic diacetoxylation of alkenes under ambient conditions using a simple iodobenzene mediator and acetic acid as both the solvent and an atom&#8208;efficient reactant. This transition metal&#8208;free method is applicable to a wide range of alkenes, even challenging feedstock alkenes such as ethylene and propylene, with a broad functional group tolerance and excellent faradaic efficiencies up to 87&#8201;%. In addition, this protocol can be extrapolated to alkenoic acids, resulting in cyclization of the starting materials to valuable lactone derivatives. With aromatic alkenes, a competing mechanism of direct anodic oxidation exists which enables reaction under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic method is extensively investigated with cyclic voltammetry.

         <title>Gallium Sulfide Quantum Dots with Zinc Sulfide and Alumina Shells Showing Efficient Deep Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga2S3 nanocrystals constitute a novel type of quantum dots exempt from toxic heavy metals whose fluorescence can be tuned from broad trap&#8208;state to narrow band&#8208;edge emission in the deep blue range by coating their surface with a ZnS shell. An additional alumina shell enhances the photoluminescence quantum yield close to 50&#8201;% while maintaining a short lifetime around 1&#8197;ns.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed quantum dot (QD) based blue emitters are of paramount importance in the field of optoelectronics. Despite large research efforts, examples of efficient deep blue/near UV&#8208;emitting QDs remain rare due to lack of luminescent wide band gap materials and high defect densities in the existing ones. Here, we introduce a novel type of QDs based on heavy metal free gallium sulfide (Ga2S3) and their core/shell heterostructures Ga2S3/ZnS as well as Ga2S3/ZnS/Al2O3. The photoluminescence (PL) properties of core Ga2S3 QDs exhibit various decay pathways due to intrinsic defects, resulting in a broad overall PL spectrum. We show that the overgrowth of the Ga2S3 core QDs with a ZnS shell results in the suppression of the intrinsic defect&#8208;mediated states leading to efficient deep&#8208;blue emission at 400&#8197;nm. Passivation of the core/shell structure with amorphous alumina yields a further enhancement of the PL quantum yield approaching 50&#8201;% and leads to an excellent optical and colloidal stability. Finally, we develop a strategy for the aqueous phase transfer of the obtained QDs retaining 80&#8201;% of the initial fluorescence intensity.

         <title>Photocatalytic Free Radical&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photogenerated radicals effectively inhibit metal atom aggregation and facilitate their cooperative anchoring with nitrogen species and lattice oxygen on the support, thereby enabling precise synthesis of Single&#8208;atom catalysts.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as crucial players in catalysis research, prompting extensive investigation and application. The precise control of metal atom nucleation and growth has garnered significant attention. In this study, we present a straightforward approach for preparing SACs utilizing a photocatalytic radical control strategy. Notably, we demonstrate for the first time that radicals generated during the photochemical process effectively hinder the aggregation of individual atoms. By leveraging the cooperative anchoring of nitrogen atoms and crystal lattice oxygen on the support, we successfully stabilize the single atom. Our Pd1/TiO2 catalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activity and stability in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, which was 43 times higher than Pd/C. Furthermore, we successfully depose Pd atoms onto various substrates, including TiO2, CeO2, and WO3. The photocatalytic radical control strategy can be extended to other single&#8208;atom catalysts, such as Ir, Pt, Rh, and Ru, underscoring its broad applicability.

         <title>Tuning the Stacking Modes of Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheet Membranes for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking of two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets is controlled by solvent droplet dynamic behaviors at different temperatures of drop coating. The unique binary stacking modes of the [Cu2Br(IN)2]n nanosheets offers a chance to understand the relationship between nanosheet stacking behaviors and the gas separation performance of the resulting membranes.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes are considered potential gas separation membranes of the next generation due to their structural diversity and geometrical functionality. However, achieving a rational structure design for a 2D MOF membrane and understanding the impact of MOF nanosheet stacking modes on membrane separation performance remain challenging tasks. Here, we report a novel kind of 2D MOF membrane based on [Cu2Br(IN)2]n (IN=isonicotinato) nanosheets and propose that synergetic stacking modes of nanosheets have a significant influence on gas separation performance. The stacking of the 2D MOF nanosheets is controlled by solvent droplet dynamic behaviors at different temperatures of drop coating. Our 2D MOF nanosheet membranes exhibit high gas separation performances for H2/CH4 (selectivity &gt;290 with H2 permeance &gt;520 GPU) and H2/CO2 (selectivity &gt;190 with H2 permeance &gt;590 GPU) surpassing the Robeson upper bounds, paving a potential way for eco&#8208;friendly H2 separation.

&lt;p&gt;The stacking of two-dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets is controlled by solvent droplet dynamic behaviors at different temperatures of drop coating. The unique binary stacking modes of the [Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br(IN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets offers a chance to understand the relationship between nanosheet stacking behaviors and the gas separation performance of the resulting membranes.

         <title>Tetracopper &#963;&#8208;Bound &#956;&#8208;Acetylide and &#8208;Diyne Units Stabilized by a Naphthyridine&#8208;based Dinucleating Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of two equivalents of a dicopper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide species with an appropriate acetylide synthon allowed the rational synthesis of a molecular tetracopper(I) acetylide, which possesses an unusual &#956;4&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1 coordination mode. This geometry opens the door to higher nuclearity homo&#8208; or heterometallic architectures, as demonstrated by the formation of a pentacopper(I) complex.







Abstract
Reactions of a dicopper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide complex with alkynes possessing boryl or silyl capping groups resulted in formation of unprecedented tetracopper(I) &#956;&#8208;acetylide/diyne complexes that were characterized by NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These compounds possess an unusual &#956;4&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1 coordination mode for the bridging organic fragment, enforced by the rigid and dinucleating nature of the ligand utilized. Thus, the central &#960; system remains unperturbed and accessible for subsequent reactivity and modification. This has been corroborated by addition of a fifth copper atom, giving rise to a pentacopper acetylide complex. This work may provide a new approach by which metal&#8208;metal cooperativity can be exploited in the transformation of acetylide and diyne groups to a variety of substrates, or as a starting point for the controlled synthesis of copper(I) alkyne&#8208;containing clusters.

         <title>Adaptive Supramolecular Networks: Emergent Sensing from Complex Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining three supramolecular sensing elements in a single solution forms an adaptive network of equilibrating sensors. Fingerprint sensor&#8208;sensor and sensor&#8208;analyte interactions results in emergent photophysical responses, allowing for the discrimination of highly similar challenging analytes.







Abstract
Molecular differentiation by supramolecular sensors is typically achieved through sensor arrays, relying on the pattern recognition responses of large panels of isolated sensing elements. Here we report a new one&#8208;pot systems chemistry approach to differential sensing in biological solutions. We constructed an adaptive network of three cross&#8208;assembling sensor elements with diverse analyte&#8208;binding and photophysical properties. This robust sensing approach exploits complex interconnected sensor&#8208;sensor and sensor&#8208;analyte equilibria, producing emergent supramolecular and photophysical responses unique to each analyte. We characterize the basic mechanisms by which an adaptive network responds to analytes. The inherently data&#8208;rich responses of an adaptive network discriminate among very closely related proteins and protein mixtures without relying on designed protein recognition elements. We show that a single adaptive sensing solution provides better analyte discrimination using fewer response observations than a sensor array built from the same components. We also show the network's ability to adapt and respond to changing biological solutions over time.

Whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) microcavities featuring distinguishable sharp peaks in a broadband exhibit enormous advantages in the field of miniaturized photonic barcodes. In their Research Article (e202310263), Zhenhua Gao, Yong Sheng Zhao et&#8197;al. have developed a surface tension assisted heterogeneous assembly strategy to construct WGM hetero&#8208;microrings through regulating the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions along circular boundaries, which remarkably promotes the security level and encoding capacity of the barcodes.

         <title>Photoinduced Cobalt Catalysis for the Reductive Coupling of Pyridines and Dienes Enabled by Paired Single&#8208;Electron Transfer
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, regioselective method for the hydropyridylation of diene feedstocks is reported, and is amenable to late&#8208;stage&#8208;functionalisation. Experiments and DFT calculations suggest a mechanism involving non&#8208;reversible hydrogen atom transfer, resulting in a reaction that is uniquely selective for dienes in the presence of other olefins.







Abstract
Selective hydroarylation of dienes has potential to provide swift access to useful building blocks. However, most existing methods rely on dienes stabilised by an aromatic group and transmetallation or nucleophilic attack steps require electron&#8208;rich aryl coupling partners. As such, there are few examples which tolerate wide&#8208;spread heteroarenes such as pyridine. Whilst allylic C&#8722;H functionalisation could be considered an alternative approach, the positional selectivity of unsymmetrical substrates is hard to control. Here, we report a general approach for selective hydropyridylation of dienes under mild conditions using metal catalysed hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer. Photoinduced, reductive conditions enable simultaneous formation of a cobalt&#8208;hydride catalyst and the persistent radical of easily&#8208;synthesised pyridyl phosphonium salts. This facilitates selective coupling of dienes in a traceless manner at the C4&#8208;position of a wide&#8208;range of pyridine substrates. The mildness of the method is underscored by its functional&#8208;group tolerance and demonstrated by applications in late&#8208;stage functionalisation. Based on a combination of experimental and computational studies, we propose a mechanistic pathway which proceeds through non&#8208;reversible hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) from a cobalt hydride species which is uniquely selective for dienes in the presence of other olefins due to a much higher relative barrier associated with olefin HAT.

         <title>Cover Picture: Regioselective and Stereospecific &#946;&#8208;Arabinofuranosylation by Boron&#8208;Mediated Aglycon Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient &#946;&#8208;arabinofuranosylation utilizing boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) is presented by Kazunobu Toshima, Daisuke Takahashi, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202307015). The glycosylations proceeded smoothly for a variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors under mild conditions with predictable regioselectivity and complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. Furthermore, the cover image shows that the regioselectivity in the BMAD reaction could be reversed by examining the reaction conditions and catalyst.

     alt="Cover Picture: Regioselective and Stereospecific &#946;-Arabinofuranosylation by Boron-Mediated Aglycon Delivery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly efficient &#946;-arabinofuranosylation utilizing boron-mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) is presented by Kazunobu Toshima, Daisuke Takahashi, and co-workers in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202307015"&gt;e202307015&lt;/a&gt;). The glycosylations proceeded smoothly for a variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors under mild conditions with predictable regioselectivity and complete &#946;-stereoselectivity. Furthermore, the cover image shows that the regioselectivity in the BMAD reaction could be reversed by examining the reaction conditions and catalyst.

         <title>A Carbene Relay Strategy for Cascade Insertion Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We streamline the synthesis of ketones and esters with multiple &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms by sequentially generating two heteroatom metal carbenes using a designer I(III)/S(VI) reagent. This strategy enables the selective addition of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or carbon atoms, incorporating up to three functional groups at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of carbonyls in a single step.







Abstract
Insertion reactions that involve stabilized electrophilic metallocarbenes are of great importance for installing &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms to carbonyl compounds. Nevertheless, the limited availability of carbene precursors restricts the introduction of only a single heteroatom. In this report, we describe a new approach based on an I(III)/S(VI) reagent that promotes the cascade insertion of heteroatoms. This is achieved by sequentially generating two &#945;&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted metal carbenes in one reaction. We found that this mixed I(III)/S(VI) ylide reacts efficiently with a transition metal catalyst and an X&#8722;H bond (where X=O, N). This transformation leads to the sequential formation of a sulfoxonium&#8208; and an X&#8208;substituted Rh&#8208;carbenes, enabling further reactions with another Y&#8722;H bond. Remarkably, a wide range of symmetrical and unsymmetrical &#945;,&#945;&#8208;O,O&#8208;, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;O,N&#8208;, and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;N,N&#8208;subsituted ketones can be prepared under mild ambient conditions. In addition, we successfully demonstrated other cascades, such as CN/CN double amidation, C&#8722;H/C&#8722;S double insertion, and C&#8722;S/Y&#8722;H double insertion (where Y=S, N, O, C). Notably, the latter two cascades enabled the simultaneous installation of three functional groups to the &#945;&#8208;carbon of carbonyl compounds in a single step. These reactions demonstrate the versatility of our approach, allowing for the synthesis of ketones and esters with multiple &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms using a common precursor.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Pyridine Oximes using in Situ Generated NH2OH from NO species on Nanofiber Membranes Derived from NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;53(Al)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of converting NO into pyridine oximes utilizing in situ generated NH2OH for organophpsphorus poisoning is realized by electrocatalysis over Al coordinated on nanofiber membrane, which offers great significance to synthesize medicine and multidisciplinary science, providing new insights for constructing new efficient system for NH2OH production and utilization.







Abstract
Pyridine oximes produced from aldehyde or ketone with hydroxylamine (NH2OH) have been widely applied in pharmaceutics, enzymatic and sterilization. However, the important raw material NH2OH exhibits corrosive and unstable properties, leading to substantial energy consumption during storage and transportation. Herein, this work presents a novel method for directly synthesizing highly valuable pyridine oximes using in situ generated NH2OH from electrocatalytic NO reduction with well&#8208;design nanofiber membranes (Al&#8208;NFM) derived from NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;53(Al). Particularly, 2&#8208;pyridinealdoxime, the precursor of antidote pralidoxime (2&#8208;PAM) for nerve agents suffering from scarcity and high cost, was achieved with a Faraday efficiency up to 49.8&#8201;% and a yield of 92.1&#8201;%, attributing to the high selectivity of NH2OH production on Al&#8208;NFM, further easily reacted with iodomethane to produce 2&#8208;PAM. This study proposes a creative approach, having wide universality for synthesizing pyridine and other oximes with a range of functional groups, which not only facilitates the conversion of exhaust gas (NO) and waste water (NO2&#8722;) into valuable chemicals especially NH2OH production and in situ utilization through electrochemistry, but also holds significant potential for synthesis of neuro detoxifying drugs to humanity security.

         <title>A Photolabile Curcumin&#8208;Diazirine Analogue Enables Phototherapy with Physically and Molecularly Produced Light for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photolabile curcumin analogue CRANAD&#8208;147 is reported. It could lead to changes in properties, structures (sequences) and neurotoxicity of amyloid beta (A&#946;) species in vitro and in transgenic 5xFAD mice in vivo with molecularly generated light (dubbed as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;) from chemiluminescence probe ADLumin&#8208;4. It has great potential as an alternative approach for AD drug discovery.







Abstract
The development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) drugs has recently witnessed substantial achievement. To further enhance the pool of drug candidates, it is crucial to explore non&#8208;traditional therapeutic avenues. In this study, we present the use of a photolabile curcumin&#8208;diazirine analogue, CRANAD&#8208;147, to induce changes in properties, structures (sequences), and neurotoxicity of amyloid beta (A&#946;) species both in cells and in vivo. This manipulation was achieved through irradiation with LED light or molecularly generated light, dubbed as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;, emitted by the chemiluminescence probe ADLumin&#8208;4. Next, aided by molecular chemiluminescence imaging, we demonstrated that the combination of CRANAD&#8208;147/LED or CRANAD&#8208;147/ADLumin&#8208;4 (molecular light) could effectively slow down the accumulation of A&#946;s in transgenic 5xFAD mice in vivo. Leveraging the remarkable tissue penetration capacity of molecular light, phototherapy employing the synergistic effect of a photolabile A&#946; ligand and molecular light emerges as a promising alternative to conventional AD treatment interventions.

         <title>Sulfonium Salt Reagents for the Introduction of Deuterated Alkyl Groups in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile deuterated reagents, namely, dn&#8208;alkyl sulfonium salts, dn&#8208;alkyl halides, a dn&#8208;alkyl azide, and a dn&#8208;alkyl amine, were prepared and used to efficiently introduce dn&#8208;alkyl groups into drug candidates and their analogues with complex skeletons. A liver microsomal metabolism study using 7&#8208;(d2&#8208;ethoxy)flavone as a model compound revealed a significant deuterium kinetic isotope effect due to the installed d2&#8208;ethoxy group.







Abstract
The pharmacokinetics of pharmaceutical drugs can be improved by replacing C&#8722;H bonds with the more stable C&#8722;D bonds at the &#945;&#8208;position to heteroatoms, which is a typical metabolic site for cytochrome P450 enzymes. However, the application of deuterated synthons is limited. Herein, we established a novel concept for preparing deuterated reagents for the successful synthesis of complex drug skeletons with deuterium atoms at the &#945;&#8208;position to heteroatoms. (dn&#8208;Alkyl)diphenylsulfonium salts prepared from the corresponding nondeuterated forms using inexpensive and abundant D2O as the deuterium source with a base, were used as electrophilic alkylating reagents. Additionally, these deuterated sulfonium salts were efficiently transformed into dn&#8208;alkyl halides and a dn&#8208;alkyl azide as coupling reagents and a dn&#8208;alkyl amine as a nucleophile. Furthermore, liver microsomal metabolism studies revealed deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIE) in 7&#8208;(d2&#8208;ethoxy)flavone. The present concept for the synthesis of deuterated reagents and the first demonstration of a KIE in a d2&#8208;ethoxy group will contribute to drug discovery research based on deuterium chemistry.

         <title>Rapidly Synthesized Single&#8208;Ion Conductive Hydrogel Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

Utilized sulfonic acid&#8208;modified COFs (TCOF&#8208;S) photo&#8208;catalyst to generate free radicals to trigger the rapid in situ light solidification of acrylamide in the pore channels of COFs. Formed TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel has combined polymer gel electrolytes (PGE) with single&#8208;ion conductors (SICs) and make them complement each other.







Abstract
Single&#8208;ion conductive electrolytes can largely eliminate electrode polarization, reduce the proportion of anion migration and inhibit side reactions in batteries. However, they usually suffer from insufficient ion conductivity due to the strong interaction between cations and cationic receptors. Here we report an ultrafast light&#8208;responsive covalent organic frameworks (COF) with sulfonic acid groups modification as the acrylamide polymerization initiator. Benefiting from the reduced electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and sulfonic acid groups through solvation effects, the as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;based hydrogel electrolyte (TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel) receives an ion conductivity of up to 27.2&#8197;mS/cm and Zn2+ transference number of up to 0.89. In addition, sufficient hydrogen bonds endow the single&#8208;ion conductive TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel electrolyte to have good water retention and superb mechanical properties. The assembled Zn||TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel||MnO2 full zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits high discharge capacity (248&#8197;mAh/g at 1C), excellent rate capability (90&#8197;mAh/g at 10C) and superior cycling performance. These enviable results enlist the instantaneously photocured TCOF&#8208;S&#8208;Gel electrolyte to be qualified to large&#8208;scaled flexible high&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Activation of Transesterification by Chemical Amplification in Dynamic Thiol&#8208;Ene Photopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of chemical amplification has been explored for the on&#8208;demand release of hydroxy groups in dynamic covalent thiol&#8208;ene photopolymers by controlled activation of a photoacid. In a domino effect fashion, a single photon event leads to a cascade of reactions, which ultimately endow the polymers with the ability to flow as a result of thermo&#8208;activated transesterification.







Abstract
Chemical amplification is a well&#8208;established concept in photoresist technology, wherein one photochemical event leads to a cascade of follow&#8208;up reactions that facilitate a controlled change in the solubility of a polymer. Herein, we transfer this concept to dynamic polymer networks to liberate both catalyst and functional groups required for bond exchange reactions under UV irradiation. For this, we exploit a photochemically generated acid to catalyse a deprotection reaction of an acid&#8208;labile tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl group, which is employed to mask the hydroxy groups of a vinyl monomer. At the same time, the released acid serves as a catalyst for thermo&#8208;activated transesterifications between the deprotected hydroxy and ester moieties. Introduced in an orthogonally cured (450&#8197;nm) thiol&#8208;click photopolymer, this approach allows for a spatio&#8208;temporally controlled activation of bond exchange reactions, which is crucial in light of the creep resistance versus reflow ability trade&#8208;off of dynamic polymer networks.

         <title>Design of an Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant Photo&#8208;RAFT System for Protein&#8208;Polymer Conjugation Achieving High Bioactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the effects of ROS on protein activity and secondary structure during photocatalysis. Specifically, it offers valuable insights into synthesizing protein&#8208;polymer conjugates while preserving high enzymatic activity under mild and aerobic conditions. The EY/TEOA system is identified as the optimal method for preparing conjugates, offering a simple and robust strategy with excellent oxygen tolerance in a minimal reaction volume.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;polymer conjugates have significant potential in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. To enable their widespread use, robust conjugation techniques are crucial. This study introduces a photo&#8208;initiated reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (Photo&#8208;RAFT) polymerization system that exhibits excellent oxygen tolerance. This system allows for the synthesis of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates with high bioactivity under mild and aerobic conditions. Three photocatalytic systems utilizing Eosin&#8197;Y (EY) as the photocatalyst with two different cocatalysts (ascorbic acid and triethanolamine) were investigated, each generating distinct reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. The impact of these ROS on three model proteins (lysozyme, albumin, and myoglobin) was evaluated, demonstrating varying bioactivities based on the ROS produced. The EY/TEOA system was identified as the optimal photo&#8208;RAFT initiating system, enabling the preparation of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates under aerobic conditions while maintaining high protein enzymatic activity. To showcase the potential of this approach, lysozyme&#8208;poly(dimethylaminoethyl acrylate) conjugates were successfully prepared and exhibited enhanced antimicrobial property against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework to Upgrade Cycling Stability and Rate Capability of Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyano hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework has been applied to a Li&#8208;CO2 battery for the first time. The HOF endows Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with significantly enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of rate capability and cycling stability.







Abstract
Elaborately designed multifunctional electrocatalysts capable of promoting Li+ and CO2 transport are essential for upgrading the cycling stability and rate capability of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with open channels and easily functionalized surfaces hold great potential for applications in efficient cathodes of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Herein, a robust HOFS (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1) is introduced for the first time as a co&#8208;catalyst in the cathode material of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 with cyano groups located periodically in the pore can induce homogeneous deposition of discharge products and accommodate volumetric expansion of discharge products during cycling. Besides, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 enables effective interaction between Ru0 nanoparticles and cyano groups, thus forming efficient and uniform catalytic sites for CRR/CER. Moreover, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 with regularly arranged open channels are beneficial for CO2 and Li+ transport, enabling rapid redox kinetic conversion of CO2. Therefore, the HOF&#8208;based Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are capable of stable operation at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 1800&#8197;h and maintain a low overpotential of 1.96&#8197;V even at high current densities up to 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work provides valuable guidance for developing multifunctional HOF&#8208;based catalysts to upgrade the longevity and rate capability of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Building Block&#8208;Inspired Hybrid Perovskite Derivatives for Ferroelectric Channel Layers with Gate&#8208;Tunable Memory Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A building block assembling method allows a series of ferroelectric semiconductors of 2D hybrid perovskites to be constructed. The resulting species have unprecedent gate&#8208;tunable memory behaviors potentially boosting future non&#8208;volatile memory applications.







Abstract
Ferroelectric photovoltaics driven by spontaneous polarization (Ps) holds a promise for creating the next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, spintronics and non&#8208;volatile memories. However, photoactive ferroelectrics are quite scarce in single homogeneous phase, owing to the severe Ps fatigue caused by leakage current of photoexcited carriers. Here, through combining inorganic and organic components as building blocks, we constructed a series of ferroelectric semiconductors of 2D hybrid perovskites, (HA)2(MA)n&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 (n=1&#8211;5; HA=hexylamine and MA=methylamine). It is intriguing that their Curie temperatures are greatly enhanced by reducing the thickness of inorganic frameworks from MAPbBr3 (n=&#8734;, Tc=239&#8197;K) to n=2 (Tc=310&#8197;K, &#916;T=71&#8197;K). Especially, on account of the coupling of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity (Ps&#8776;1.5&#8197;&#956;C/cm2) and photoconductivity, n=3 crystal wafer was integrated as channel field effect transistor that shows excellent a large short&#8208;circuit photocurrent &#8776;19.74&#8197;&#956;A/cm2. Such giant photocurrents can be modulated through manipulating gate voltage in a wide range (&#177;60&#8197;V), exhibiting gate&#8208;tunable memory behaviors of three current states (&#8220;&#8208;1/0/1&#8221; states).

&lt;p&gt;A building block assembling method allows a series of ferroelectric semiconductors of 2D hybrid perovskites to be constructed. The resulting species have unprecedent gate-tunable memory behaviors potentially boosting future non-volatile memory applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroelectric photovoltaics driven by spontaneous polarization (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) holds a promise for creating the next-generation optoelectronics, spintronics and non-volatile memories. However, photoactive ferroelectrics are quite scarce in single homogeneous phase, owing to the severe &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; fatigue caused by leakage current of photoexcited carriers. Here, through combining inorganic and organic components as building blocks, we constructed a series of ferroelectric semiconductors of 2D hybrid perovskites, (HA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(MA)&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3n+1&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=1&#8211;5; HA=hexylamine and MA=methylamine). It is intriguing that their Curie temperatures are greatly enhanced by reducing the thickness of inorganic frameworks from MAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=&#8734;, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;=239&#8197;K) to &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2 (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;=310&#8197;K, &#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;=71&#8197;K). Especially, on account of the coupling of room-temperature ferroelectricity (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;1.5&#8197;&#956;C/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and photoconductivity, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=3 crystal wafer was integrated as channel field effect transistor that shows excellent a large short-circuit photocurrent &#8776;19.74&#8197;&#956;A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Such giant photocurrents can be modulated through manipulating gate voltage in a wide range (&#177;60&#8197;V), exhibiting gate-tunable memory behaviors of three current states (&#8220;-1/0/1&#8221; states). We believe that this work sheds light on further exploration of ferroelectric materials toward new non-volatile memory devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfur Changes the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Pathway over Cu Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S atoms adsorbed on metallic Cu surfaces can significantly inhibit CO2 reduction to CO while promoting formate formation in the electrochemical reduction of CO2.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals or fuels offers a promising approach to reduce carbon emissions and alleviate energy shortage. Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been widely reported as capable of reducing CO2 to produce a variety of multicarbon products (e.g., ethylene and ethanol). In this work, we develop sulfur&#8208;doped Cu2O electrocatalysts, which instead can electrochemically reduce CO2 to almost exclusively formate. We show that a dynamic equilibrium of S exists at the Cu2O&#8208;electrolyte interface, and S&#8208;doped Cu2O undergoes in situ surface reconstruction to generate active S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu sites during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with in situ infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu surface can not only promote the formation of the *OCHO intermediate but also greatly suppress *H and *COOH adsorption, thus facilitating CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion during the electrochemical CO2RR.

         <title>BiBr3&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Prins Cyclization of Aza&#8208;Achmatowicz Rearrangement Products: Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Suaveoline and Sarpagine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed to construct the versatile 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;ABN) ring system with a variety of substitution patterns and then applied to the asymmetric total synthesis of six suaveoline and sarpagine alkaloids: macrophylline, suaveoline, norsuaveoline, affinisine, normacusine B and Na&#8208;Me&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine.







Abstract
An intramolecular aza&#8208;Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed in which bismuth tribromide (BiBr3) plays a dual role as an efficient Lewis acid and source of the bromide nucleophile. This approach enables the facile construction of highly functionalized 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes (9&#8208;ABNs), which are valuable synthetic building blocks and a powerful platform for the synthesis of a variety of alkaloid natural products and drug molecules. Suitable substrates for the aza&#8208;Prins cyclization include 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, alkynes, and allenes, with good to excellent yields observed. Finally, we showcase the application of this new approach to the enantioselective total synthesis of six indole alkaloids: (&#8722;)&#8208;suaveoline (1), (&#8722;)&#8208;norsuaveoline (2), (&#8722;)&#8208;macrophylline (3), (+)&#8208;normacusine B (4), (+)&#8208;Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine (5) and (+)&#8208;affinisine (6) in a total of 9&#8211;14&#8197;steps. This study significantly expands the synthetic utility of the aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement, and the strategy (aza&#8208;Achmatowicz/aza&#8208;Prins) is expected to be applicable to the total synthesis of other members of the big family of macroline and sarpagine indole alkaloids.

         <title>Efficient Intersystem Crossing and Long&#8208;lived Charge&#8208;Separated State Induced by Space Intramolecular Charge Transfer in a Parallel Geometry Carbazole&#8208;Bodipy Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through space intramolecular charge transfer, a compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor (cabazole&#8208;bodipy) dyad with face&#8208;to&#8208;face geometry exhibits long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (&#964;CSS=24&#8197;ns) and efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916;=61&#8201;%). This discovery opens a new avenue for designing efficient photosensitizers and photonic applications that depend on long&#8208;lived excited states generation.







Abstract
The design of efficient heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) based on through bond charge transfer (TBCT) features is a formidable challenge due to the criteria of orthogonal donor&#8208;acceptor geometry. Herein, we propose using parallel (face&#8208;to&#8208;face) conformation carbazole&#8208;bodipy donor&#8208;acceptor dyads (BCZ&#8208;1 and BCZ&#8208;2) featuring through space intramolecular charge transfer (TSCT) process as efficient triplet PS. Efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916;=61&#8201;%) and long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (&#964;T=186&#8197;&#956;s) were observed in the TSCT dyad BCZ&#8208;1 compared to BCZ&#8208;3 (&#934;&#916;=0.4&#8201;%), the dyad involving TBCT, demonstrating the superiority of the TSCT approach over conventional donor&#8208;acceptor system. Moreover, the transient absorption study revealed that TSCT dyads have a faster charge separation and slower intersystem crossing process induced by charge recombination compared to TBCT dyad. A long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (CSS) was observed in the BCZ&#8208;1 (&#964;CSS=24&#8197;ns). For the first time, the TSCT dyad was explored for the triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion, and a high upconversion quantum yield of 11&#8201;% was observed. Our results demonstrate a new avenue for designing efficient PSs and open up exciting opportunities for future research in this field.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;to&#8208;Small Molecule Converter through Amplified Hairpin DNA Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realize the conversion of nucleic acid input into small molecule output using hairpin DNA circuits. The systems are combined with the biorthogonal Staudinger reduction to release fluorophore, dye, and anticancer agent triggered by oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Our approach would have great potential for efficient detection and chemotherapy of cancers based on nucleic acid expression profiles.







Abstract
Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are characteristically found in cancer cells, making miRNAs promising marker biomolecules for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. However, it is challenging to use miRNA as a cancer signature because it is difficult to convert the nucleic acid sequence information into molecular functionality. To address this challenge, we realize nucleic acid&#8208;to&#8208;small molecule converters using hairpin DNA circuits. Harnessing a Staudinger reduction as a trigger for the conversion, we constructed hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) circuits that respond to oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Fluorophore and dye molecules were released in response to miR&#8208;21 through the HCR, providing fluorogenic and chromogenic readouts. Selective cytotoxicity in miR&#8208;21&#8208;abundant cells was realized by the CHA to release the anticancer drug SN&#8208;38. This would be the first example of selective activation of a small&#8208;molecule prodrug triggered by oncogenic miRNA in human living cells.

         <title>Unravelling the Molecular Structure and Confining Environment of an Organometallic Catalyst Heterogenized within Amorphous Porous Polymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural elucidation of active sites in amorphous host materials is demonstrated by combining cutting&#8208;edge NMR techniques with pair distribution function analysis and computational chemistry. The detailed structure of the heterogenized organometallic complex and its confinement within two amorphous porous organic polymers is revealed by computation and confirmed by dedicated NMR techniques.







Abstract
The catalytic activity of multifunctional, microporous materials is directly linked to the spatial arrangement of their structural building blocks. Despite great achievements in the design and incorporation of isolated catalytically active metal complexes within such materials, a detailed understanding of their atomic&#8208;level structure and the local environment of the active species remains a fundamental challenge, especially when these latter are hosted in non&#8208;crystalline organic polymers. Here, we show that by combining computational chemistry with pair distribution function analysis, 129Xe NMR, and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization enhanced NMR spectroscopy, a very accurate description of the molecular structure and confining surroundings of a catalytically active Rh&#8208;based organometallic complex incorporated inside the cavity of amorphous bipyridine&#8208;based porous polymers is obtained. Small, but significant, differences in the structural properties of the polymers are highlighted depending on their backbone motifs.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Arylglycines via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Sch&#246;llkopf Bis&#8208;Lactim Ethers with Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic methylnaphthyl(XPhos)&#8208;palladium bromide promote the coupling of chiral tert&#8208;leucine&#8208;derived Sch&#246;llkopf bis&#8208;lactim ether with cheap aryl chlorides at room temperature in yields up to 95&#8201;% and &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr. This enables a convenient access to non&#8208;natural tertiary arylglycines, which are key structural motifs in several top&#8208;selling drugs. This protocol is also suitable for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of common pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Arylglycines are important pharmacophores present in several top&#8208;selling drugs. This compound class has now been made accessible from abundant aryl chlorides by a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Sch&#246;llkopf&#8208;type amino acid synthesis. In the presence of the catalyst methylnaphthyl(XPhos)&#8208;palladium bromide, the base lithium 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidide and the additive ZnCl2, tert&#8208;leucine&#8208;derived bis&#8208;lactim ethers were efficiently arylated at room temperature, reaching yields of 95&#8201;% and diastereoselectivities of 98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Hydrolysis gave the corresponding arylglycines in high enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Total Biosynthesis of Melleolides from Basidiomycota Fungi: Mechanistic Analysis of the Multifunctional GMC Oxidase Mld7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the total biosynthesis of the melleolide sesquiterpenoids produced by Basidiomycota fungi revealed that the glucose&#8208;methanol&#8208;choline oxidase enzyme Mld7 is a key enzyme that catalyzes multistep reactions leading to two different types of melleolides. Notably, these two reactions are highly regulated by interaction with the cell membrane.







Abstract
Mushroom terpenoids are biologically and chemically diverse fungal metabolites. Among them, melleolides are representative sesquiterpenoids with a characteristic protoilludane skeleton. In this study, we applied a recently established hot spot knock&#8208;in method to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway leading to 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxymelleolide. The biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene core involves the cytochrome P450 catalyzing stepwise hydroxylation of the &#916;6&#8208;protoilludene framework and a stereochemical inversion process at the C5 position catalyzed by short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins. The highlight of the biosynthesis is that the flavoprotein Mld7 catalyzes an oxidation&#8208;triggered double&#8208;bond shift accompanying dehydration and acyl&#8208;group&#8208;assisted substitution with two different nucleophiles at the C6 position to afford the &#916;7&#8208;protoilludene derivatives, such as melleolide and armillarivin. The complex reaction mechanism was proposed by DFT calculations. Of particular importance is that product distribution is regulated by interaction with the cell membrane.
