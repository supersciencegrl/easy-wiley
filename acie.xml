         <title>Synergistic Fe&#8208;Se Atom Pairs as Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysts Boost Low&#8208;Temperature Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we successfully constructed bifunctional electrocatalysts by constructing atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;Se atom pairs supported on N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8208;Se/NC). The obtained Fe&#8208;Se/NC shows a noteworthy bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance with a low potential difference of 0.698 V, far superior to that of reported Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts. The theoretical calculations reveal that p&#8208;d orbital hybridization around the Fe&#8208;Se atom pairs lead to remarkably asymmetrical polarized charge distributions. Fe&#8208;Se/NC based solid&#8208;state rechargeable ZABs (ZABs&#8208;Fe&#8208;Se/NC) present stable charge/discharge of 200 h (1090 cycles) at 20 mA/cm2 at 25 oC, which is 6.9 times of ZABs&#8208;Pt/C+Ir/C. At extremely low temperature of &#8208;40 oC, ZABs&#8208;Fe&#8208;Se/NC display an ultra&#8208;robust cycling performance of 741 h (4041 cycles) at 1 mA/cm2, which is about 11.7 times longer that of ZABs&#8208;Pt/C+Ir/C. More importantly, ZABs&#8208;Fe&#8208;Se/NC could be operated for 133 h (725 cycles) even at 5 mA/cm2.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenolysis of readily available aryl triflates via   desymmetrization and kinetic&#160;resolution&#160;for facile construction of axially chiral biaryl scaffolds with excellent enantioselectivities and s selectivity factors. The axially chiral monophosphine ligands could be prepared from these chiral biaryl compounds and were further applied to palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation with excellent ee values and high branched and linear ratio, which demonstrated the potential utility of this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Strained Oxygen&#8208;doped Chiral Molecular Belts of Zigzag&#8208;type with Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a two&#8208;directional cyclization strategy for the synthesis of highly strained depth&#8208;expanded oxygen&#8208;doped chiral molecular belts of zigzag&#8208;type. From the easily accessible resorcin[4]arenes, an unprecedented cyclization cascade generating fused 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;phenalenes is developed to access expanded molecular belts. Stitching up the fjords through intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution and ring closing olefin metathesis reactions furnished a highly strained O&#8208;doped C2&#8208;symmetric belt. The enantiomers of the acquired compounds exhibited excellent chiroptical properties. The calculated parallelly aligned electric (m) and magnetic (m) transition dipole moments are translated to the high dissymmetry factor (|glum| up to 0.022). Our study provides not only an appealing and useful strategy for the synthesis of strained molecular belts but also a new paradigm for the fabrication of belt&#8208;derived chiroptical materials with high CPL activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Active Sites Formed on Cobalt Oxyhydroxide in Glucose Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based oxyhydroxides are efficient catalysts in biomass electrooxidation towards fossil fuel&#8208;free production of valuable chemicals. However, identification of active sites remains elusive. Herein, using cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) as the archetype and electrooxidation of glucose (GOR) as the model reaction, we track dynamic transformation of electronic and atomic structure of the catalyst using a suite of operando and ex situ techniques. We reveal that two types of reducible Co3+&#8722;oxo species are affordable for GOR, including adsorbed hydroxyl on Co3+ ion (&#181;1&#8722;OH&#8722;Co3+) and di&#8208;Co3+&#8208;bridged lattice oxygen (&#181;2&#8722;O&#8722;Co3+). Moreover, theoretical calculations unveil that &#181;1&#8722;OH&#8722;Co3+ is responsible for oxygenation, while &#181;2&#8722;O&#8722;Co3+ mainly contributes to dehydrogenation, both as key oxidative steps in glucose&#8208;to&#8208;formate transformation. This work provides a framework for mechanistic understanding of the complex near&#8208;surface chemistry of metal oxyhydroxides in biomass electrorefining.</dc:description>

         <title>Deacylative Thiolation by Redox&#8208;Neutral Aromatization&#8208;Driven C&#8722;C Fragmentation of Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the development of deacylative thiolation of diverse methyl ketones. The reaction is redox&#8208;neutral, and heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free, which provides a new way to introduce thioether groups site&#8208;specifically to unactivated aliphatic positions. It also features excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, thus allowing late&#8208;stage derivatization. The process benefits from efficient condensation between the activation reagent and ketone substrates, which triggers aromatization&#8208;driven C&#8722;C fragmentation and rapid radical coupling with thiosulfonates. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest the involvement of a radical chain pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular engineering to enhance reactivity and selectivity in an ultrafast photoclick reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;induced 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone&#8208;electron&#8208;rich alkene (PQ&#8208;ERA) photocycloadditions are an attractive new type of photoclick reaction, featuring fast conversions and high biocompatibility. However, the tunability of the reaction was hardly investigated up to now. To this end, we explored the influence of substituents on both reaction partners and the reaction rate between the PQs and ERAs. We identified new handles for functionalization and discovered that using enamines as ERAs led to drastically enhanced rates (&gt;5400 times faster), high photoreaction quantum yields (&#934;P, up to 65 %), and multicolor emission output as well as high fluorescence quantum yield of the adducts (&#934;F, up to 97%). Further investigation of the photophysical and photochemical properties provided the insights to design orthogonal reaction systems both in solution and on nanoparticle surfaces for ultrafast chemoselective functionalization by photoclick.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Cascade Reaction in an Engineered Protein Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we describe the creation of an artificial protein cage housing a dual metal&#8208;tagged guest protein that catalyzes a linear, two&#8208;step sequential cascade reaction. The guest protein consists of a fusion protein of HaloTag and monomeric rhizavidin. Inside the protein capsid, we establish a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed allylcarbamate deprotection followed by a gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing hydroamination reaction that leads to indoles and phenanthridines with an overall yield of up to 66% in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, we show that the encapsulation stabilizes the metal catalysts against deactivation by air, proteins and cell lysate.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Narrowband Circularly Polarized Light Emitters Based on 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded Rigid Donor&#8211;Acceptor Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrow&#8208;band emission is essential for applicable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active materials in ultrahigh&#8208;definition CP&#8208;OLEDs. One of the most promising classes of CPL active molecules, helicenes, however, typically exhibit broad emission with a large Stokes shift. We present, herein, a design strategy capitalizing on intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions between nitrogen and boron atoms to address this issue. 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded configurationally stable single&#8208; and double helicenes were synthesized straightforwardly. Both helicenes show unprecedentedly narrow fluorescence and CPL bands (full width at half maximum between 17&#8211;28 nm, 0.07&#8211;0.13 eV) along with high fluorescence quantum yields (72&#8211;85%). Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the relative localization of the natural transition orbitals, mainly on the rigid core of the molecule, and small values of root&#8208;mean&#8208;square displacements between S0 and S1 state geometries, contribute to the narrower emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Polyethylene&#8208;like Sulfur&#8208;Containing Plastics from Sustainable Feedstocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new family of chemically recyclable polymers in a large scale from sustainable monomers of H2O, COS, and diacrylates. Such resultant polymers manifest impressive toughness and ductility comparable to commodity polyethylene. The chemical recycling of these polymers can be readily achieved through two closed loops.







Abstract
The green revolution in plastics should be accelerated due to growing sustainability concerns. Here, we develop a series of chemically recyclable polymers from the first reported cascade polymerization of H2O, COS, and diacrylates. In addition to abundant feedstocks, the method is efficient and air&#8208;tolerant, uses common organic bases as catalysts, and yields polymers with high molecular weights under mild conditions. Such polymers, structurally like polyethylene with low&#8208;density in&#8208;chain polar groups, manifest impressive toughness and ductility comparable to high&#8208;density polyethylene. The in&#8208;chain ester group acts as a breaking point, enabling these polymers to undergo chemical recycling through two loops. The structures and properties of these polymers also have an immeasurably expanded range owing to the versatility of our method. The readily available raw materials, facile synthesis, and high performance make these polymers promising prospects as sustainable materials in practice.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of Cyclobutenone Ketals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report bench&#8208;stable cyclobutenone surrogates that undergo Rh&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl&#8208; and vinylboronic acids to yield cyclobutenyl enol ethers in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. This transformation proceeds via enantioselective carbometalation to give cyclobutyl&#8208;rhodium intermediates, followed by &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination. The reaction is fast and proceeds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Complex cyclobutanes are important motifs in both bioactive molecules and natural products, yet their enantioselective preparation has not been widely explored. In this work, we describe rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective additions of aryl and vinyl boronic acids to cyclobutenone ketals. This transformation involves enantioselective carbometalation to give cyclobutyl&#8208;rhodium intermediates, followed by &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination to afford enantioenriched enol ethers. Overall, this addition serves as a surrogate for Rh&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;additions to cyclobutenone.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Molecule&#8208;Regulated Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Solvation Electrolyte for Li&#8208;Metal Batteries at Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new amphiphilic solvent is rationally designed to induce self&#8208;assembly of the electrolyte solution to form a peculiar core&#8208;shell&#8208;solvation structure. Such unique solvation structure bestows improved ionic conductivity, low desolvation energy, and highly robust and conductive SEI, which overcomes the long&#8208;standing Li compatibility and deposition kinetic challenges, enabling the stable operation of Li&#8208;metal battery under ultra&#8208;low temperature.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries hold great promise for promoting energy density and operating at low temperatures, yet they still suffer from insufficient Li compatibility and slow kinetic, especially at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. Herein, we rationally design and synthesize a new amphiphilic solvent, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;3&#8208;methoxypropane, for use in battery electrolytes. The lithiophilic segment is readily to solvate Li+ to induce self&#8208;assembly of the electrolyte solution to form a peculiar core&#8208;shell&#8208;solvation structure. Such unique solvation structure not only largely improves the ionic conductivity to allow fast Li+ transport and lower the desolvation energy to enable facile desolvation, but also leads to the formation of a highly robust and conductive inorganic SEI. The resulting electrolyte demonstrates high Li efficiency and superior cycling stability from room temperature to &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C at high current densities. Meanwhile, anode&#8208;free high&#8208;voltage cell retains 87&#8201;% capacity after 100 cycles.

         <title>Plasmonic Cu Nanoparticles for the Low&#8208;temperature Photo&#8208;driven Water&#8208;gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered double hydroxide&#8208;derived plasmonic Cu catalyst was synthesized for the photo&#8208;driven water&#8208;gas shift reaction (WGSR). Light&#8208;induced hot electrons led to efficient *H2O activation and *H combination via a carboxyl pathway. High hydrogen production rate (114.35&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) was realized at 200&#8201;&#176;C through the plasmonic Cu&#8208;mediated strategy, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for (photo&#8208;)thermal WGSR catalyst at low temperatures.







Abstract
The activation of water molecules in thermal catalysis typically requires high temperatures, representing an obstacle to catalyst development for the low&#8208;temperature water&#8208;gas shift reaction (WGSR). Plasmonic photocatalysis allows activation of water at low temperatures through the generation of light&#8208;induced hot electrons. Herein, we report a layered double hydroxide&#8208;derived copper catalyst (LD&#8208;Cu) with outstanding performance for the low&#8208;temperature photo&#8208;driven WGSR. LD&#8208;Cu offered a lower activation energy for WGSR to H2 under UV/Vis irradiation (1.4&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) compared to under dark conditions. Detailed experimental studies revealed that highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles created an abundance of hot electrons during light absorption, which promoted *H2O dissociation and *H combination via a carboxyl pathway, leading to the efficient production of H2. Results demonstrate the benefits of exploiting plasmonic phenomena in the development of photo&#8208;driven low&#8208;temperature WGSR catalysts.

         <title>Electrochemical Interfacial Polymerization toward Ultrathin COF Membranes for Brine Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy, which actively manipulates the self&#8208;healing effect and self&#8208;inhibiting effect during electrochemical process, is developed for fabricating ultrathin and robust COF membranes for efficient brine desalination.







Abstract
Ultrathin covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are urgently demanded in molecular/ionic separations. Herein, we reported an electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy to fabricate ultrathin COF membranes with thickness of 85&#8197;nm, by actively manipulate self&#8208;healing effect and self&#8208;inhibiting effect. The resulting COF membrane exhibited superior performance in brine desalination with the permeation flux of 92&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and the rejection of 99.96&#8201;%. Our electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy enriches the fabrication approach of COF membranes and facilitates the rational design of ultrathin membranes.

         <title>Ion Co&#8208;storage in Porous Organic Frameworks through On&#8208;site Coulomb Interactions for High Energy and Power Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Coulomb interaction&#8208;promoted ion kinetics enables a dual&#8208;ion co&#8208;storage electrode with high energy and power densities.







Abstract
Fast and continuous ion insertion is blocked in the common electrodes operating with widely accepted single&#8208;ion storage mechanism, primarily due to Coulomb repulsion between the same ions. It results in an irreconcilable conflict between capacity and rate performance. Herein, we designed a porous organic framework with novel multiple&#8208;ion co&#8208;storage modes, including PF6&#8722;/Li+, OTF&#8722;/Mg2+, and OTF&#8722;/Zn2+ co&#8208;storage. The Coulomb interactions between cationic and anionic carriers in the framework can significantly promote electrode kinetics, by rejuvenating fast ion carrier migration toward framework interior. Consequently, the framework via PF6&#8722;/Li+ co&#8208;storage mode shows a high energy density of 878&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 cycled more than 20&#8201;000 cycles, with an excellent power density of 28&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 that is already comparable to commercial supercapacitors. The both greatly improved energy and power densities via the co&#8208;storage mode may pave a way for exploring new electrodes that are not available from common single&#8208;ion electrodes.

         <title>Evidence of AlII Radical Addition to Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron reduction of diamido&#8208;naphthyl aluminum iodide in benzene produces dialuminyl substituted Birch&#8208;type reduction product. Time dependent EPR experiments in combination with DFT calculations suggest a reaction mechanism where stable AlII radical intermediates play a crucial role for the reaction outcome. The aluminum radical stability is a consequence of a rigid supporting ligand with silyl protective substituents.







Abstract
Electrophilic AlIII species have long dominated the aluminum reactivity towards arenes. Recently, nucleophilic low&#8208;valent AlI aluminyl anions have showcased oxidative additions towards arenes C&#8722;C and/or C&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we communicate compelling evidence of an AlII radical addition reaction to the benzene ring. The electron reduction of a ligand stabilized precursor with KC8 in benzene furnishes a double addition to the benzene ring instead of a C&#8722;H bond activation, producing the corresponding cyclohexa&#8208;1,3(orl,4)&#8208;dienes as Birch&#8208;type reduction product. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT results suggest this reactivity proceeds through a stable AlII radical intermediate, whose stability is a consequence of a rigid scaffold in combination with strong steric protection.

         <title>Directed Asymmetric Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive 1,2&#8208;Diarylation of Electronically Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly diastereoselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated internal alkenes was developed. Additionally, the enantioselective variant with unactivated terminal and challenging internal alkenes was also achieved, delivering various polyarylalkanes bearing benzylic stereocenters with good to high enantioselectivities and excellent diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diarylation of electronically unactivated alkenes has emerged as an extensive research topic in organic synthesis. However, most examples are mainly limited to terminal alkenes. Furthermore, transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated alkenes still remains unsolved and is a formidable challenge. Herein, we describe a highly efficient directed nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive 1,2&#8208;diarylation of unactivated internal alkenes with high diastereoselectivities. More importantly, our further effort towards enantioselective 1,2&#8208;diarylation of the unactivated terminal and challenging internal alkenes is achieved, furnishing various polyarylalkanes featuring benzylic stereocenters in high yields and with good to high enantioselectivities and high diastereoselectivities. Interestingly, the generation of cationic Ni&#8208;catalyst by adding alkali metal fluoride is the key to increased efficiency of this enantioselective reaction.

         <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations Guide Chimeragenesis and Engineered Control of Chemoselectivity in Diketopiperazine Dimerases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of C&#8722;N bond forming diketopiperazine dimerase, AspB, was solved. However, the near complete superposition of active site residues and bound substrates in AspB/NzeB masked the molecular basis for their orthogonal chemoselectivities. Molecular dynamics simulations guided rational chimeragenesis to reprogram NzeB dimerase selectivity. Substrate mimics further validated differential substrate binding by the chemodivergent dimerases.







Abstract
In the biosynthesis of the tryptophan&#8208;linked dimeric diketopiperazines (DKPs), cytochromes P450 selectively couple DKP monomers to generate a variety of intricate and isomeric frameworks. To determine the molecular basis for selectivity of these biocatalysts we obtained a high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of selective Csp2&#8722;N bond forming dimerase, AspB. Overlay of the AspB structure onto C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond forming homolog NzeB revealed no significant structural variance to explain their divergent chemoselectivities. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations identified a region of NzeB with increased conformational flexibility relative to AspB, and interchange of this region along with a single active site mutation led to a variant that catalyzes exclusive C&#8722;N bond formation. MD simulations also suggest that intermolecular C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N bond formation results from a change in mechanism, supported experimentally through use of a substrate mimic.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for enantioselective intermolecular benzylic C&#8722;H amidation and amination is reported. This dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation displays broad substrate scope and good atom economy, is amenable to late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization, and enables easy access to 15N&#8208;labeling from cheap [15N]&#8208;NH4Cl.







Abstract
A method for direct access to enantioenriched benzylic amides and carbamate&#8208;protected primary benzylamines by C&#8722;H functionalization is reported. The C&#8722;H substrate is used as limiting reagent with only a small excess of the unactivated amide or carbamate nucleophile. The enantioselective intermolecular dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation is enabled by a combination of a chiral copper catalyst, a photocatalyst, and an oxidant, and it takes place under mild conditions, which allow for a broad substrate scope. The method is compatible with late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization, and it provides easy access to 15N&#8208;labeled amides and amines starting from cheap 15NH4Cl.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Independent and Cell&#8208;Free Biosynthesis of &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids Using Vinyl Esters as Smart Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4&#8208;enzyme cell&#8208;free system transforms vinyl esters into &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids in the absence of ATP and ancillary electron donors through concurrent abiotic thiolysis, non&#8208;decarboxylating Claisen condensation, ketone reduction and hydrolysis steps. The same substrate provides the energy to activate the acyl group and the redox power to reduce the condensed ketone.







Abstract
In vitro biosynthetic pathways that condense and reduce molecules through coenzyme A (CoASH) activation demand energy and redox power in the form of ATP and NAD(P)H, respectively. These coenzymes must be orthogonally recycled by ancillary reactions that consume chemicals, electricity, or light, impacting the atom economy and/or the energy consumption of the biosystem. In this work, we have exploited vinyl esters as dual acyl and electron donor substrates to synthesize &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids through a non&#8208;decarboxylating Claisen condensation, reduction and hydrolysis stepwise cascade, including a NADH recycling step, catalyzed by a total of 4 enzymes. Herein, the chemical energy to activate the acyl group with CoASH and the redox power for the reduction are embedded into the vinyl esters. Upon optimization, this self&#8208;sustaining cascade reached a titer of (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy butyrate of 24&#8197;mM without requiring ATP and simultaneously recycling CoASH and NADH. This work illustrates the potential of in vitro biocatalysis to transform simple molecules into multi&#8208;functional ones.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Investigation, Storage, and Separation of Pyrophoric PH3 and P2H4 with &#945;&#8208;Mg Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphane, PH3, is a highly pyrophoric and toxic gas that is often contaminated with H2 and P2H4. The inexpensive &#945;&#8208;Mg formate MOF adsorbs up to 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% of PH3 and allows safe handling of phosphane in air. This MOF is moreover a candidate for PH3 purification and longtime P2H4 storage in air and at room temperature.







Abstract
Phosphane, PH3&#8212;a highly pyrophoric and toxic gas&#8212;is frequently contaminated with H2 and P2H4, which makes its handling even more dangerous. The inexpensive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) magnesium formate, &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], can adsorb up to 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% of PH3. The PH3&#8208;loaded MOF, PH3@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], is a non&#8208;pyrophoric, recoverable material that even allows brief handling in air, thereby minimizing the hazards associated with the handling and transport of phosphane. &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] further plays a critical role in purifying PH3 from H2 and P2H4: at 25&#8201;&#176;C, H2 passes through the MOF channels without adsorption, whereas PH3 adsorbs readily and only slowly desorbs under a flow of inert gas (complete desorption time&#8776;6&#8197;h). Diphosphane, P2H4, is strongly adsorbed and trapped within the MOF for at least 4&#8197;months. P2H4@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] itself is not pyrophoric and is air&#8208; and light&#8208;stable at room temperature.

         <title>Amphoteric Cellulose&#8208;Based Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel Electrolyte Toward Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a flexible amphoteric cellulose&#8208;based double&#8208;network hydrogel electrolyte. The amphoteric groups not only promoted the desolvation process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ to eliminate side reactions, but also guided the Zn2+ deposition to inhibit dendrite growth, thus resulting in a ultra&#8208;stable Zn anode.







Abstract
Zinc (Zn) metal anode suffers from uncontrollable Zn dendrites and parasitic side reactions at the interface, which restrict the practical application of aqueous rechargeable zinc batteries (ARZBs). Herein, an amphoteric cellulose&#8208;based double&#8208;network is introduced as hydrogel electrolyte to overcome these obstacles. On one hand, the amphoteric groups build anion/cation transport channels to regulate electro&#8208;deposition behavior on Zn (002) crystal plane enabled by homogenizing Zn2+ ions flux. On the other hand, the strong bonding between negatively charged carboxyl groups and Zn2+ ions promote the desolvation process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ to eliminate side reactions. Based on the above two functions, the hydrogel electrolyte enables an ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a cumulative capacity of 7&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn cell. This work provides significant concepts for developing hydrogel electrolytes to realize stable anode for high&#8208;performance ARZBs.

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Based Nitric Oxide&#8208;Responsive Nanosensor for Photoacoustic Imaging in the SWIR Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A panel of new SWIR dyes based on the xanthene core was synthesized using C&#8722;H activation chemistry. We showcased the biomedical utility of these imaging agents by selecting one example for the development of a ratiometric nanosensor, which we employed to detect elevated levels of nitric oxide in a murine model of drug&#8208;induced liver injury via SWIR PA imaging.







Abstract
Shortwave infrared (SWIR) dyes are characterized by their ability to absorb light from 900 to 1400&#8197;nm, which is ideal for deep tissue imaging owing to minimized light scattering and interference from endogenous pigments. An approach to access such molecules is to tune the photophysical properties of known near&#8208;infrared dyes. Herein, we report the development of a series of easily accessible (three steps) SWIR xanthene dyes based on a dibenzazepine donor conjugated to thiophene (SCR&#8208;1), thienothiophene (SCR&#8208;2), or bithiophene (SCR&#8208;3). We leverage the fact that SCR&#8208;1 undergoes a bathochromic shift when aggregated for in vivo studies by developing a ratiometric nanoparticle for NO (rNP&#8208;NO), which we employed to successfully visualize pathological levels of nitric oxide in a drug&#8208;induced liver injury model via deep tissue SWIR photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Our work demonstrates how easily this dye series can be utilized as a component in nanosensor designs for imaging studies.

We leverage the fact that &lt;b&gt;SCR-1&lt;/b&gt; undergoes a bathochromic shift when aggregated for in vivo studies by developing a ratiometric nanoparticle for NO (&lt;b&gt;rNP-NO&lt;/b&gt;), which we employed to successfully visualize pathological levels of nitric oxide in a drug-induced liver injury model via deep tissue SWIR photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Our work demonstrates how easily this dye series can be utilized as a component in nanosensor designs for imaging studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Diode&#8208;Like Dye&#8208;Cu Anisotropic Junction in a Coordination Polymer as a Logic State Ratchet for Intratumor Redox Photomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox logic materials offer new avenues to modulate intracellular pathologic redox environment area&#8208;specifically, but the unambiguity of redox logic states and their unidirectional and repetitive switchability are challenging to realize. By merging a bistable diisophthalic phenazine dye ligand with Cu(II) salt, a multistable coordination polymer (CP) was constructed, of which the dye&#8208;Cu anisotropic junction achieved the diode&#8208;like unidirectional electron transfer and logic state ratchet for the first time. Radical cationic CP maintained OFF status with low toxicity in healthy tissues, but was reduced to the neutral SERVO state by the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in hypoxic tumors. After photoirradiation, the stabilized charge&#8208;separated ON status promoted photo&#8208;Fenton reaction for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signal transduction, and simultaneously recovered the initial state for catalytic signal amplification of ROS, furnishing intratumor redox photomodulation for therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy of Metal/Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbons in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) are promising candidates as oxygen electrocatalysts due to their low cost, tunable catalytic activity and selectivity, and well&#8208;dispersed morphologies. To improve the electrocatalytic performance of such systems, it is critical to gain a detailed understanding of their structure and properties through advanced characterization. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) serves as a powerful tool to probe both the active sites and structural evolution of catalytic materials under reaction conditions. In this review, we firstly provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of XAS and then comprehensively review the setup and application of in situ XAS, introducing electrochemical XAS cells, experimental methods, as well as primary functions on catalytic applications. The active sites and the structural evolution of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction are subsequently discussed in detail. Finally, major challenges and future opportunities in this exciting field are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Deprotonation of CH3CN by an Iron&#8211;Aluminium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present the first double deprotonation of acetonitrile (CH3CN) using two equivalents of a bimetallic iron&#8208;aluminium complex. The products of this reaction contain an exceeding simple yet rare [CHCN]2&#8211; dianion moiety that bridges two metal fragments. DFT calculations suggest that the bonding to the metal centres occurs through heavily polarised covalent interactions. Mechanistic studies reveal the intermediacy of a monomeric [CH2CN]&#8211; complex, which has been characterised in&#8208;situ. Our findings provide an important example in which a bimetallic metal complex achieves a new type of reactivity not previously encountered with monometallic counterparts.&#160;The isolation of a [CHCN]2&#8211; dianion through simple deprotonation of CH3CN also offers the possibility of a establishing a broader chemistry of this motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternating Metal&#8208;Ligand Coordination Improves Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by a Mononuclear Ru Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular electrocatalysts for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion often operate at large overpotentials, due to the large barrier for C&#8208;O bond cleavage. Illustrated with ruthenium polypyridyl catalysts, we herein propose a mechanistic route that involves one metal center that acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid at different stages of the catalytic cycle, by density functional theory in corroboration with experimental FTIR. The nucleophilic character of the Ru center manifests itself in the initial attack on CO2 to form [Ru&#8208;CO2]0, while its electrophilic character allows for the formation of a 5&#8208;membered metallacyclic intermediate, [Ru&#8208;CO2CO2]0,c, by addition of a second CO2 molecule and intramolecular cyclization. The calculated activation barrier for C&#8208;O bond cleavage via the metallacycle is decreased by 34.9 kcal mol&#8210;1 as compared to the non&#8208;cyclic adduct. Such metallacyclic intermediates in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction offer a new design feature that can be implemented consciously in future catalyst designs.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the Structure&#8208;Performance Relationships in Designing Non&#8208;Fused Ring Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prerequisite for commercially viable organic solar cells (OSC) is to reduce the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;cost gap. Therefore, the cost of organic materials should be reduced by minimizing the synthetic steps, yet maintaining the molecular planarity and efficiencies achieved by the fused ring acceptors (FRA).&#160;In this respect, developing non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRA) with suitable functionalization to favor conformational planarity and effective molecular packing is beneficial and cost&#8208;effective. Presently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for NFRAs is around 16%, yet lower than the 19% achieved for FRAs. Despite their potential, a thorough understanding of the effective structural design of NFRAs is necessary for developing efficient OSCs. This article pays special attention to the molecular design concept for NFRAs developed in the last years and analyzed the approach toward materials design and efficiency improvement, an important step toward technological application.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Alignment&#8208;Induced Chemically&#8208;Patchy Uniaxial Nanoparticles and Their Applications in Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Self&#8208;Assembled Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an unusual strategy for synthesizing patchy nanoparticles (NPs) by controlling the orientation of the molecules that form the NPs. This is realized by synchronous polymerization and crystallization of liquid crystal (LC) monomers during scalable precipitation polymerization. The resulting NPs are cylinders with highly uniform shapes and have only a single LC domain. The patchy properties originate from the discrepancy of surface chemical compositions on flat and side surfaces and can be switched on and off by solvent. Extra colloidal blocks can be grown onto the patches, resulting in highly uniform triblock patchy dumbbells, which have integrated optical properties, and as demonstrated, show triple&#8208;mode optical authentication in anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels or patterns. We also demonstrate that the triblock patchy cylinders are attractive building blocks for long LC rods or porous colloidal materials through polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Interfacial Polarization in Non&#8208;stoichiometric Lead&#8208;Free Perovskites by Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For perovskites, it is challenging to quantitatively study the concentration of defects. A theoretical relationship between defect concentration, conductivity, and oxygen partial pressure can be established based on the defect chemistry equilibria. The type and concentration of defects are reflected through the conductivity variation with oxygen partial pressure.







Abstract
Recent advances in perovskite ferroelectrics have fostered a host of exciting sensors and actuators. Defect engineering provides critical control of the performance of ferroelectric materials, especially lead&#8208;free ones. However, it remains a challenge to quantitatively study the concentration of defects due to the complexity of measurement techniques. Here, a feasible approach to analyzing the A&#8208;site defect and electron in alkali metal niobate is demonstrated. The theoretical relationships among defect concentration, conductivity, and oxygen partial pressure can be established based on the defect chemistry equilibria. The type and concentration of defects are reflected through the conductivity variation with oxygen partial pressure. As a result, the variation of defect concentration gives rise to defect&#8208;driven interfacial polarization, which further leads to distinct properties of the ceramics. e.g., abnormal dielectric behavior.

     alt="Identifying the Interfacial Polarization in Non-stoichiometric Lead-Free Perovskites by Defect Engineering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For perovskites, it is challenging to quantitatively study the concentration of defects. A theoretical relationship between defect concentration, conductivity, and oxygen partial pressure can be established based on the defect chemistry equilibria. The type and concentration of defects are reflected through the conductivity variation with oxygen partial pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in perovskite ferroelectrics have fostered a host of exciting sensors and actuators. Defect engineering provides critical control of the performance of ferroelectric materials, especially lead-free ones. However, it remains a challenge to quantitatively study the concentration of defects due to the complexity of measurement techniques. Here, a feasible approach to analyzing the A-site defect and electron in alkali metal niobate is demonstrated. The theoretical relationships among defect concentration, conductivity, and oxygen partial pressure can be established based on the defect chemistry equilibria. The type and concentration of defects are reflected through the conductivity variation with oxygen partial pressure. As a result, the variation of defect concentration gives rise to defect-driven interfacial polarization, which further leads to distinct properties of the ceramics. e.g., abnormal dielectric behavior. Furthermore, this study also suggests a strategy to manipulate defects and charges in perovskite oxides for performance optimization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In situ Detection of Cobaloxime Intermediates During Photocatalysis Using Hollow&#8208;Core Photonic Crystal Fiber Microreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic intermediates can be observed on microliter volumes using in situ fiber&#8208;based spectroscopy. The hydrogen&#8208;evolving reaction driven by the combination of cobaloxime hydrogen evolution catalysts with [Ru (bpy)3]2+ photosensitizers reveal the formation of a transient CoI species and a steady&#8208;state CoII species.







Abstract
Hollow&#8208;core photonic crystal fibers (HC&#8208;PCFs) provide a novel approach for in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy with enhanced detection sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate that longer optical path lengths than afforded by conventional cuvette&#8208;based UV/Vis spectroscopy can be used to detect and identify the CoI and CoII states in hydrogen&#8208;evolving cobaloxime catalysts, with spectral identification aided by comparison with DFT&#8208;simulated spectra. Our findings show that there are two types of signals observed for these molecular catalysts; a transient signal and a steady&#8208;state signal, with the former being assigned to the CoI state and the latter being assigned to the CoII state. These observations lend support to a unimolecular pathway, rather than a bimolecular pathway, for hydrogen evolution. This study highlights the utility of fiber&#8208;based microreactors for understanding these and a much wider range of homogeneous photocatalytic systems in the future.

         <title>Gaseous Nitrogen Oxides Catholyte for Rechargeable Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high potential (0.5&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+) catholyte for redox flow batteries was developed. Both the charged and discharged species are gaseous nitrogen oxides (NOx), allowing the redox active components to be liberated from the liquid electrolyte and stored in a separate gas container.







Abstract
There is a strong interest in finding highly soluble redox compounds to improve the energy density of redox flow batteries (RFBs). However, the performance of electrolytes is often negatively influenced by high solute concentration. Herein, we designed a high&#8208;potential (0.5&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+) catholyte for RFBs, where the charged and discharged species are both gaseous nitrogen oxides (NOx). These species can be liberated from the liquid electrolyte and stored in a separate gas container, allowing scale&#8208;up of storage capacity without increasing the concentration and volume of the electrolyte. The oxidation of NO in the presence of NO3&#8722; affords N2O3, and the reduction of N2O3 regenerates NO and NO3&#8722;, together affording the electrochemical reaction: NO3&#8722;+3&#8201;NO&#8652;2&#8201;N2O3+e&#8722; with a low mass/charge ratio of 152&#8197;grams per mole of stored electron. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept NOx symmetric H&#8208;cell shows 200 stable cycles over 400&#8197;hours with &gt;97&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency and negligible capacity decay.

         <title>A Photoacoustic Probe with Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier Crossing Ability for Imaging Oxidative Stress Dynamics in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BODIPY&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with blood&#8208;brain barrier crossing ability for imaging oxidative stress dynamics in the mouse brain was designed. The probe shows reversible and ratiometric response behavior to oxidative stress. In vivo studies reveal the great potential of the probe in photoacoustic imaging of oxidative stress in neurodegeneration diseases.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal assessment of the oxidative stress dynamics in the brain is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing oxidative stress probes have poor blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability or poor penetration depth, making them unsuitable for brain imaging. Herein, we developed a photoacoustic probe that enables real&#8208;time imaging of oxidative stress dynamics in the mouse brain. The probe not only responds to oxidative stress in a reversible and ratiometric manner, but it can also cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier of the mouse brain. Notably, the probe displayed excellent photoacoustic imaging of oxidative stress dynamics in the brains of Parkinson's disease mouse models. In addition, we investigated the antioxidant properties of natural polyphenols in the brain of a Parkinson's disease mouse model using the probe as an imaging agent and suggested the potential of the probe for screening anti&#8208;oxidative stress agents.

         <title>Oxidation&#8208;Reduction Molecular Junction Covalent Organic Frameworks for Full Reaction Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of oxidation&#8208;reduction molecular junction covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (TTF&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) has been prepared through the covalent&#8208;coupling between oxidation group (TTF) and reduction group (BT), which can be successfully applied for the efficient full reaction photosynthesis of H2O2.







Abstract
The full reaction photosynthesis of H2O2 that can combine water&#8208;oxidation and oxygen&#8208;reduction without sacrificial agents is highly demanded to maximize the light&#8208;utilization and overcome the complex reaction&#8208;process of anthraquinone&#8208;oxidation. Here, a kind of oxidation&#8208;reduction molecular junction covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (TTF&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) has been synthesized through the covalent&#8208;coupling of tetrathiafulvalene (photo&#8208;oxidation site) and benzothiazole (photo&#8208;reduction site), which presents visible&#8208;light&#8208;adsorption region, effective electron&#8208;hole separation&#8208;efficiency and photo&#8208;redox sites that enables full reaction generation of H2O2. Specifically, a record&#8208;high yield (TTF&#8208;BT&#8208;COF, &#8776;276&#8201;000&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) for H2O2 photosynthesis without sacrificial agents has been achieved among porous crystalline photocatalysts. This is the first work that can design oxidation&#8208;reduction molecular junction COFs for full reaction photosynthesis of H2O2, which might extend the scope of COFs in H2O2 production.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Pyrazolines and Pyrazoles via [3+2] Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically initiated [3 2] cycloaddition reactions of readily available and less toxic starting materials enable a facile synthesis of pyrazolines and pyrazoles. Application of a biphasic system and sodium iodide in a dual role as mediator and electrolyte allows for selective reactions with outstanding robustness towards scalability.







Abstract
Pyrazolines and pyrazoles are common and important motifs of pharmaceutical agents and agrochemicals. Herein, the first electrochemical approach for their direct synthesis from easily accessible hydrazones and dipolarophiles up to decagram scale is presented. The application of a biphasic system (aqueous/organic) even allows for the conversion of highly sensitive alkenes, wherein inexpensive sodium iodide is employed in a dual role as supporting electrolyte and mediator. In addition, mechanistic insight into the reaction is given by the isolation of key step intermediates. The relevance of the presented reaction is underlined by the synthesis of commercial herbicide safener mefenpyr&#8208;diethyl in good yields.

         <title>TADF Invariant of Host Polarity and Ultralong Fluorescence Lifetimes in a Donor&#8208;Acceptor Emitter Featuring a Hybrid Sulfone&#8208;Triarylboron Acceptor
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly electron&#8208;accepting (LUMO=&#8722;3.4&#8197;eV) hybrid sulfone&#8208;triarylboron scaffold was successfully employed for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring unusual long prompt fluorescence lifetimes (&#964;=83&#8211;394&#8197;ns). Organic light&#8208;emitting devices have demonstrated excellent TADF and roll&#8208;off performance remaining invariant to host polarity environment owing to the efficient reverse intersystem crossing mediated by an upper triplet charge transfer state.







Abstract
10H&#8208;Dibenzo[b,e][1,4]thiaborinine 5,5&#8208;dioxide (SO2B)&#8212;a high triplet (T1=3.05&#8197;eV) strongly electron&#8208;accepting boracycle was successfully utilised in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters PXZ&#8208;Dipp&#8208;SO2B and CZ&#8208;Dipp&#8208;SO2B. We demonstrate the near&#8208;complete separation of highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals leading to a low oscillator strength of the S1&#8594;S0 CT transition, resulting in very long ca. 83&#8197;ns and 400&#8197;ns prompt fluorescence lifetimes for CZ&#8208;Dipp&#8208;SO2B and PXZ&#8208;Dipp&#8208;SO2B, respectively, but retaining near unity photoluminescence quantum yield. OLEDs using CZ&#8208;Dipp&#8208;SO2B as the luminescent dopant display high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.3&#8201;% and maximum luminance of 18600&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 with low efficiency roll off at high brightness. For CZ&#8208;Dipp&#8208;SO2B, reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) is mediated through the vibronic coupling of two charge transfer (CT) states, without involving the triplet local excited state (3LE), resulting in remarkable rISC rate invariance to environmental polarity and polarisability whilst giving high organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) efficiency. This new form of rISC allows stable OLED performance to be achieved in different host environments.

         <title>Structurally Diverse Bench&#8208;Stable Nickel(0) Pre&#8208;Catalysts: A Practical Toolkit for In Situ Ligation Protocols
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of air&#8208;stable Ni0 pre&#8208;catalysts of the general type Ni (COD) (L) are described, where L=thiophene oxide, quinone, cyclopentadienone, or fulvene. The properties of the complexes are analyzed through computational and experimental techniques. The precatalysts are competent in a variety of nickel&#8208;catalyzed reactions and together constitute a toolkit that overcomes the limitations of both Ni (COD)2 and Ni (COD) (DQ).







Abstract
A flurry of recent research has centered on harnessing the power of nickel catalysis in organic synthesis. These efforts have been bolstered by contemporaneous development of well&#8208;defined nickel (pre)catalysts with diverse structure and reactivity. In this report, we present ten different bench&#8208;stable, 18&#8208;electron, formally zero&#8208;valent nickel&#8211;olefin complexes that are competent pre&#8208;catalysts in various reactions. Our investigation includes preparations of novel, bench&#8208;stable Ni(COD)(L) complexes (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), in which L=quinone, cyclopentadienone, thiophene&#8208;S&#8208;oxide, and fulvene. Characterization by NMR, IR, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and natural bond orbital analysis sheds light on the structure, bonding, and properties of these complexes. Applications in an assortment of nickel&#8208;catalyzed reactions underscore the complementary nature of the different pre&#8208;catalysts within this toolkit.

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Allenes with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Adjacent Central Chiralities Empowered by Synergistic Pd/Cu Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Pd/Cu co&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic allenylic alkylation of racemic allenylic acetates with aldimine esters has been developed. Various allenes bearing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;adjacent central chiralities were obtained with excellent stereoselectivities. The easy interconversion between the uncommon &#951;3&#8208;butadienyl palladium intermediates featuring a weak C=C/Pd coordination bond and a stable Csp2&#8722;Pd bond is crucial for the title reaction.







Abstract
The stereodivergent synthesis of allene compounds bearing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;adjacent central chiralities has been realized via the Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric alkylation of racemic allenylic esters. The matched reactivity of bimetallic catalytic system enables the challenging reaction of racemic aryl&#8208;substituted allenylic acetates with sterically crowded aldimine esters smoothly under mild reaction conditions. Various chiral non&#8208;natural amino acids bearing a terminal allenyl group are easily synthesized in high yields and with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Importantly, all four stereoisomers of the product can be readily accessed by switching the configurations of the two chiral metal catalysts. Furthermore, the easy interconversion between the uncommon &#951;3&#8208;butadienyl palladium intermediate featuring a weak C=C/Pd coordination bond and a stable Csp2&#8722;Pd bond is beneficial for the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process (DyKAT).

         <title>Engineering a Highly Regioselective Fungal Peroxygenase for the Synthesis of Hydroxy Fatty Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biocatalytic hydroxylation of fatty acids is an appealing reaction, but the generation of over&#8208;oxidation by&#8208;products and the lack of selectivity hampers its transfer to industry. Now a highly selective and efficient peroxygenase has been engineered for the production of hydroxy fatty acids through a synthetic procedure that can be rapidly adapted to the preparative scale.







Abstract
The hydroxylation of fatty acids is an appealing reaction in synthetic chemistry, although the lack of selective catalysts hampers its industrial implementation. In this study, we have engineered a highly regioselective fungal peroxygenase for the &#969;&#8208;1 hydroxylation of fatty acids with quenched stepwise over&#8208;oxidation. One single mutation near the Phe catalytic tripod narrowed the heme cavity, promoting a dramatic shift toward subterminal hydroxylation with a drop in the over&#8208;oxidation activity. While crystallographic soaking experiments and molecular dynamic simulations shed light on this unique oxidation pattern, the selective biocatalyst was produced by Pichia pastoris at 0.4&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 in a fed&#8208;batch bioreactor and used in the preparative synthesis of 1.4&#8197;g of (&#969;&#8208;1)&#8208;hydroxytetradecanoic acid with 95&#8201;% regioselectivity and 83&#8201;% ee for the S enantiomer.

&lt;p&gt;The biocatalytic hydroxylation of fatty acids is an appealing reaction, but the generation of over-oxidation by-products and the lack of selectivity hampers its transfer to industry. Now a highly selective and efficient peroxygenase has been engineered for the production of hydroxy fatty acids through a synthetic procedure that can be rapidly adapted to the preparative scale.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Computer&#8208;Driven Development of Ylide Functionalized Phosphines for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hiyama Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ylide functionalized phosphines were tailored supported by computational inverse catalyst design to fit the requirements of mild Hiyama couplings of aryl chlorides. YPhos/Pd catalyst is highly efficient for the coupling with aryl chlorides in general, and the reaction shows excellent functional group compatibility.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings of silicon enolates with aryl electrophiles are of great synthetic utility, but often limited to expensive bromide substrates. A comparative experimental study confirmed that none of the established ligand systems allows to couple inexpensive aryl chlorides with &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilyl alkylnitriles. In contrast, ylide functionalized phosphines (YPhos) led to encouraging results. A statistical model was developed that correlates the reaction yields with ligand features. It was employed to predict catalyst structures with superior performance. With this cheminformatics approach, YPhos ligands were tailored specifically to the demands of Hiyama couplings. The newly synthesized ligands displayed record&#8208;setting activities, enabling the elusive coupling of aryl chlorides with &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilyl alkyl nitriles. The preparative utility of the catalyst system was demonstrated by the synthesis of pharmaceutically meaningful &#945;&#8208;aryl alkylnitriles, &#945;&#8208;arylcarbonyls and biaryls.

         <title>One&#8208;Step In Situ Polymerization: A Facile Design Strategy for Block Copolymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined block copolymer electrolytes (BCPEs) are achieved in one&#8208;step by combining reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer polymerization and carboxylic acid&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization. The resulting BCPEs show good thermal stability, high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity, improved lithium&#8208;ion transference number, and outstanding electrochemical stability window.







Abstract
To optimize the rapid transport of lithium ions (Li+) inside lithium metal batteries (LMBs), block copolymer electrolytes (BCPEs) have been fabricated in situ in LMBs via a one&#8208;step method combining reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and carboxylic acid&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP). The BCPEs balanced the Li+ coordination characteristics of the polyether&#8208; and polyester&#8208;based electrolytes to achieve a rapid Li+ migration in the SPEs. The carboxylic acid played a dual role since it both catalyzed the ROP and stabilized the interface. Furthermore, the in situ assembly of LMBs did effectively enable an efficient intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation of Li+ at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The in situ assembled Li/BCPE4/LFP exhibited high&#8208;capacity retention of 92&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. The one&#8208;step in situ fabrication of BCPEs provides a new direction for the design of polymer electrolytes.

We report the first catalytic example of PdII&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;selective &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;C (sp3)&#8722;H aza&#8208;heteroarylation of free carboxylic acids. A sequence of three consecutive mono&#8208;selective C (sp3)&#8722;H activation reactions of pivalic acid provides an unique platform for constructing diverse quaternary carbon centers containing heteroaryls which could serve as an enabling tool for escaping the flat land in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
PdII&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of free carboxylic acids represents a significant advance from conventional cyclopalladation initiated reactions. However, developing a modular synthetic platform for diverse quaternary and tertiary carbon centers based on this reactivity, two challenges remain to be addressed: mono&#8208;selectivity in each consecutive C&#8722;H functionalization step; compatibility with heteroatoms. While the exclusive mono&#8208;selectivity was achieved by &#946;&#8208;lactonization/nucleophilic attack, the latter limitation remains to be overcome. Herein, we report the PdII&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H heteroarylation of free carboxylic acids using pyridine&#8208;pyridone ligands capable of overcoming these limitations. A sequence of three consecutive C(sp3)&#8722;H activation reactions of pivalic acid provides an unique platform for constructing diverse quaternary carbon centers containing heteroaryls which could serve as an enabling tool for escaping the flat land in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Elastic Organic Crystals as Bioinspired Hair&#8208;Like Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;aspect ratio, elastically bendable organic single crystal is presented as a hair air&#8208;flow sensor. The crystal acts as a passive light&#8208;transducing medium that is stamped with a fluorescent dye to track its deformation upon exposure to nitrogen gas. Furthermore, the modelling analysis of the air&#8208;flow&#8208;induced crystal deformation, and the response to flow dynamics around the crystal body are presented.







Abstract
One of the typical haptic elements are natural hairy structures that animals and plants rely on for feedback. Although these hair sensors are an admirable inspiration, the development of active flow sensing components having low elastic moduli and high aspect ratios remains a challenge. Here, we report a new sensing approach based on a flexible, thin and optically transmissive organic crystal of high aspect ratio, which is stamped with fluorescent dye for tracking. When subjected to gas flow and exposed to laser, the crystal bends due to exerted pressure and acts as an optical flow (hair) sensor with low detection limit (&#8776;1.578&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1) and fast response time (&#8776;2.70&#8197;s). The air&#8208;flow&#8208;induced crystal deformation and flow dynamics response are modelled by finite element analysis. Due to having a simple design and being lightweight and mechanically robust this prototypical crystal hair&#8208;like sensor opens prospects for a new class of sensing devices ranging from wearable electronics to aeronautics.

         <title>Conjugated and Non&#8208;conjugated Polymers Containing Two&#8208;Electron Redox Dihydrophenazines for Lithium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two p&#8208;type redox polymers, conjugated poly(diethyldihydrophenazine vinylene) (CPP) and non&#8208;conjugated poly(diethyldihydrophenazine ethylidene) (NCPP), have been polymerized from an identical monomer. Compared with NCPP, the conjugated linkage among the two&#8208;electron redox centers in CPP is more favorable for the effective charge delocalization on the conjugated polymer backbone and the sufficient oxidation in the higher potential range.







Abstract
Organic p&#8208;type cathode materials have recently attracted increasing attention due to their higher redox potentials and rate capabilities in comparison to n&#8208;type cathodes. However, most of the p&#8208;type cathodes based on one&#8208;electron redox still suffer from limited stability and low specific capacity (&lt;150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Herein, two polymers, conjugated poly(diethyldihydrophenazine vinylene) (CPP) and non&#8208;conjugated poly(diethyldihydrophenazine ethylidene) (NCPP) containing two&#8208;electron redox dihydrophenazine, have been developed as p&#8208;type cathode materials. It is experimentally and theoretically found that the conjugated linkage among the redox centers in polymer CPP is more favorable for the effective charge delocalization on the conjugated polymer backbone and the sufficient oxidation in the higher potential region (3.3&#8211;4.2&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+). Consequently, the CPP cathode displays a higher reversible specific capacity of 184&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with excellent cycling stability.

         <title>Direct Detection of FeVI Water Oxidation Intermediates in an Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly&#8208;oxidized FeVI intermediates formed in a self&#8208;healing water oxidation cycle of a NiFe&#8208;based catalyst are directly detected by UV/Vis spectroelectrochemistry, confirming Fe as the active center in NiFe&#8208;based OER catalyst. Upon introducing Co into the NiFe&#8208;based catalyst, the formation of FeVI active species was further promoted, thus enhancing the OER activity of the NiCoFe&#8208;based catalyst.







Abstract
In situ detection of highly&#8208;oxidized metal intermediates is the key to identifying the active center of an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, but it remains challenging for NiFe&#8208;based catalysts in an aqueous solution under working conditions. Here, by utilizing the dynamic stability of the FeVIO42&#8722; intermediates in a self&#8208;healing water oxidation cycle of NiFe&#8208;based catalyst, the highly&#8208;oxidized FeVI intermediates leached into the electrolyte are directly detected by simple spectroelectrochemistry. Our results provide direct evidence that Fe is the active center in NiFe&#8208;based OER catalysts. Furthermore, it is revealed that the incorporation of Co into NiFe&#8208;based catalyst facilitates the formation of FeVI active species, thus enhancing the OER activity of NiCoFe&#8208;based catalyst. The insights into the mechanisms for the sustainable generation of FeVI active species in these NiFe&#8208;based catalysts lay the foundation for the design of more efficient and stable OER catalysts.

         <title>Aminopeptidase N&#8208;Responsive Conjugates with Tunable Charge&#8208;Reversal Properties for Highly Efficient Tumor Accumulation and Penetration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminopeptidase N (APN)&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;reversal polymer&#8208;drug conjugates with tunable charge&#8208;reversal rates were synthesized. The monomeric unit structure (&#945;&#8208;substituent of the amide) and polymer chain structure determined the enzymatic hydrolysis and charge&#8208;reversal rates, and accordingly, the transcytosis and tumor accumulation and penetration of the APN&#8208;responsive conjugates. The conjugate with moderate APN responsiveness balanced the in vitro and in vivo delivery efficiency and achieved the best antitumor efficacy.







Abstract
Tumor enzyme&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;reversal carriers can induce efficient transcytosis and lead to efficient tumor infiltration and potent anticancer efficacy. However, the correlations of molecular structure with charge&#8208;reversal property, tumor penetration, and drug delivery efficiency are unknown. Herein, aminopeptidase N (APN)&#8208;responsive conjugates were synthesized to investigate these correlations. We found that the monomeric unit structure and the polymer chain structure determined the enzymatic hydrolysis and charge&#8208;reversal rates, and accordingly, the transcytosis and tumor accumulation and penetration of the APN&#8208;responsive conjugates. The conjugate with moderate APN responsiveness balanced the in vitro transcytosis and in vivo overall drug delivery process and achieved the best tumor delivery efficiency, giving potent antitumor efficacy. This work provides new insight into the design of tumor enzyme&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;reversal nanomedicines for efficient cancer drug delivery.

         <title>Tunable Multivalent Platform for Immune Recruitment to Lower Antigen Expressing Cancers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional chemical immunotherapeutics allow endogenous immune components to identify and destroy diseased targets. Herein we introduce and optimize polymeric antibody recruiting molecules (pARMs) for simultaneous avidity enhanced binding to prostate cancer cells and anti&#8208;dinitrophenyl antibodies. The tunability and avidity&#8208;enhanced potency of pARMs allows for increased immune proximity induction as compared to a monomeric construct.







Abstract
Chemical immunotherapeutic strategies including Antibody Recruiting Molecules (ARMs &#8208; bivalent small molecules containing an antibody&#8208;binding domain (ABD) and a target&#8208;binding domain (TBD)) direct immune&#8208;mediated clearance of diseased cells. Anti&#8208;cancer ARM function relies on high tumor antigen valency, limiting function against lower antigen expressing tumors. To address this limitation, we report a tunable multivalent immune recruitment (MIR) platform to amplify/stabilize antibody recruitment to cells with lower antigen valencies. An initial set of polymeric ARMs (pARMs) were synthesized and screened to evaluate ABD/TBD copy number, ratio, and steric occlusion on specific immune induction. Most pARMs demonstrated simultaneous high avidity binding to anti&#8208;dinitrophenyl antibodies and prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigens on prostate cancer. Optimized pARMs mediated enhanced anti&#8208;cancer immune function against lower antigen expressing target cells compared to an analogous ARM.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Deficient Molybdenum Oxide Nanosensitizers for Ultrasound&#8208;Enhanced Cancer Metalloimmunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
MoOX nanomaterials were prepared as novel sonosensitizers and TME stimulants for ultrasound&#8208;enhanced cancer metalloimmunotherapy. Under US irradiation, they could generate a massive amount of ROS to induce cell damage and strong ICD. MoOX&#8208;PEG itself could also stimulate the maturation of dendritic cells and activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Thus, MoOX&#8208;triggered SDT combined with aCTLA&#8208;4 could elicit robust immune responses for antitumor therapy.







Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;deficient molybdenum oxide (MoOX) nanomaterials are prepared as novel nanosensitizers and TME&#8208;stimulants for ultrasound (US)&#8208;enhanced cancer metalloimmunotherapy. After PEGylation, MoOX&#8208;PEG exhibits efficient capability for US&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Under US irradiation, MoOX&#8208;PEG generates a massive amount of ROS to induce cancer cell damage and immunogenic cell death (ICD), which can effectively suppress tumor growth. More importantly, MoOX&#8208;PEG itself further stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and triggeres the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to enhance the immunological effect. Due to the robust ICD induced by SDT and efficient DC maturation stimulated by MoOX&#8208;PEG, the combination treatment of MoOX&#8208;triggered SDT and aCTLA&#8208;4 further amplifies antitumor therapy, inhibits cancer metastases, and elicits robust immune responses to effectively defeat abscopal tumors.

&lt;p&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; nanomaterials were prepared as novel sonosensitizers and TME stimulants for ultrasound-enhanced cancer metalloimmunotherapy. Under US irradiation, they could generate a massive amount of ROS to induce cell damage and strong ICD. MoO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-PEG itself could also stimulate the maturation of dendritic cells and activate the cGAS-STING pathway. Thus, MoO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-triggered SDT combined with aCTLA-4 could elicit robust immune responses for antitumor therapy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen-deficient molybdenum oxide (MoO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;) nanomaterials are prepared as novel nanosensitizers and TME-stimulants for ultrasound (US)-enhanced cancer metalloimmunotherapy. After PEGylation, MoO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-PEG exhibits efficient capability for US-triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Under US irradiation, MoO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-PEG generates a massive amount of ROS to induce cancer cell damage and immunogenic cell death (ICD), which can effectively suppress tumor growth. More importantly, MoO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-PEG itself further stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and triggeres the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway to enhance the immunological effect. Due to the robust ICD induced by SDT and efficient DC maturation stimulated by MoO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-PEG, the combination treatment of MoO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-triggered SDT and aCTLA-4 further amplifies antitumor therapy, inhibits cancer metastases, and elicits robust immune responses to effectively defeat abscopal tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phenoxazine Polymer&#8208;based p&#8208;type Positive Electrode for Aluminum&#8208;ion Batteries with Ultra&#8208;long Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8208;type poly(vinylbenzyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenoxazine) (PVBPX) positive electrode is developed for Al&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). The N and O dual active sites in the PVBPX perform a reversible two&#8208;step redox reaction with AlCl4&#8722;, contributing to a high specific capacity. The expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated construction, insolubility, and anionic redox chemistry without bond rearrangement of PVBPX for AIBs contribute to an amazing ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 50000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the abundant reserves, low cost, good safety, and high theoretical capacity of Al. However, AIBs with inorganic positive electrodes still suffer from sluggish kinetics and structural collapse upon cycling. Herein, we propose a novel p&#8208;type poly(vinylbenzyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenoxazine) (PVBPX) positive electrode for AIBs. The dual active sites enable PVBPX to deliver a high capacity of 133&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. More impressively, the expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated construction, insolubility, and anionic redox chemistry without bond rearrangement of PVBPX for AIBs contribute to an amazing ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 50000&#8197;cycles. The charge storage mechanism is that the AlCl4&#8722; ions can reversibly coordinate/dissociate with the N and O sites in PVBPX sequentially, which is evidenced by both experimental and theoretical results. These findings establish a foundation to advance organic AIBs for large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <dc:description>
The enantioselective construction of silicon&#8208;stereocenter by asymmetric enamine catalysis is reported. The reaction proceeds via an unprecedented desymmetric intramolecular aldolization of prochiral siladials for the diverse synthesis of multifunctional silicon&#8208;stereogenic silacycles.







Abstract
We report the first highly enantioselective construction of silicon&#8208;stereocenters by asymmetric enamine catalysis. An unprecedented desymmetric intramolecular aldolization of prochiral siladials was thus developed for the facile access of multifunctional silicon&#8208;stereogenic silacycles in high to excellent enantioselectivity. With an enal moiety, these adducts could be readily elaborated for the diverse synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic compounds, and for late&#8208;stage modification.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nickel on Carbon Nitride Photocatalyst Achieves Semihydrogenation of Alkynes with Water Protons via Monovalent Nickel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven semihydrogenation of alkynes with water as the hydrogen source was achieved over single&#8208;atom Ni supported on carbon nitride (CN). The Ni site, paired up with the pyridinic N of the CN scaffold, mediated proton/deuterium transport from water/deuterium oxide (H2O/D2O) to alkynes, producing a diverse range of (deuterated) alkenes with high selectivity.







Abstract
Prospects in light&#8208;driven water activation have prompted rapid progress in hydrogenation reactions. We describe a Ni2+&#8722;N4 site built on carbon nitride for catalyzed semihydrogenation of alkynes, with water supplying protons, powered by visible&#8208;light irradiation. Importantly, the photocatalytic approach developed here enabled access to diverse deuterated alkenes in D2O with excellent deuterium incorporation. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, evolution of a four&#8208;coordinate Ni2+ species into a three&#8208;coordinate Ni+ species was spectroscopically identified. In combination with theoretical calculations, the photo&#8208;evolved Ni+ is posited as HO&#8722;Ni+&#8722;N2 with an uncoordinated, protonated pyridinic nitrogen, formed by coupled Ni2+ reduction and water dissociation. The paired Ni&#8722;N prompts hydrogen liberation from water, and it renders desorption of alkene preferred over further hydrogenation to alkane, ensuring excellent semihydrogenation selectivity.

         <title>Tough and Conductive Nacre&#8208;inspired MXene/Epoxy Layered Bulk Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural nacre provides an inspiration for fabricating tough and conductive MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites through strong interfacial interactions between MXene and epoxy resin. The resultant conductive nacre&#8208;like layered bulk nanocomposites show self&#8208;monitoring of the structural integrity and outstanding electromagnetic interference shielding.







Abstract
A long&#8208;standing quest in materials science has been the development of tough epoxy resin nanocomposites for use in numerous applications. Inspired by nacre, here we report tough and conductive MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites. The orientation of MXene lamellar scaffolds is enhanced by annealing treatment. The improved interfacial interactions between MXene lamellar scaffold and epoxy through surface chemical modification resulted in a synergistic effect. Tailoring the interlayer spacing of MXene nanosheets to a critical distance resulted in a fracture toughness about eight times higher than that of pure epoxy, surpassing other epoxy nanocomposites. Our nacre&#8208;inspired MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites also show high electrical conductivity that provides self&#8208;monitoring capability for structural integrity and exhibits an excellent electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency. Our proposed strategy provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance epoxy nanocomposites.

We describe an enantioselective C4&#8208;dearomatization of methoxypyridine derivatives for the preparation of functionalised enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams using chiral copper catalysis. Experimental 13C kinetic isotope effects and density functional theory calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;bearing rings are common features in the molecular structures of modern drugs, with chiral &#948;&#8208;lactams being an important subclass due to their known pharmacological properties. Catalytic dearomatization of preactivated pyridinium ion derivatives emerged as a powerful method for the rapid construction of chiral N&#8208;heterocycles. However, direct catalytic dearomatization of simple pyridine derivatives are scarce and methodologies yielding chiral &#948;&#8208;lactams are yet to be developed. Herein, we describe an enantioselective C4&#8208;dearomatization of methoxypyridine derivatives for the preparation of functionalised enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams using chiral copper catalysis. Experimental 13C kinetic isotope effects and density functional theory calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Approach for Constructing High&#8208;Density Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts toward Overall Water Splitting at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a catalyst containing high&#8208;density Pt and Ir single atoms anchored on Co (OH)2 was prepared by a one&#8208;step approach, and required only 4 and 178&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, close to the world record level. Mechanistic studies revealed that reconstructed Ir&#8722;O6 single atoms and remodeled Pt triple&#8208;atom sites play key roles in water splitting. Finally, 20 other single&#8208;atom catalysts were synthesized by this approach.







Abstract
The construction of highly active, durable, and cost&#8208;effective catalysts is urgently needed for green hydrogen production. Herein, catalysts consisting of high&#8208;density Pt (24&#8197;atoms&#8201;nm&#8722;2) and Ir (32&#8197;atoms&#8201;nm&#8722;2) single atoms anchored on Co(OH)2 were constructed by a facile one&#8208;step approach. Remarkably, Pt1/Co(OH)2 and Ir1/Co(OH)2 only required 4 and 178&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Moreover, the assembled Pt1/Co(OH)2//Ir1/Co(OH)2 system showed mass activity of 4.9&#8197;A&#8201;mgnoble&#8201;metal&#8722;1 at 2.0&#8197;V in an alkaline water electrolyzer, which is 316.1 times higher than that of Pt/C//IrO2. Mechanistic studies revealed that reconstructed Ir&#8722;O6 single atoms and remodeled Pt triple&#8208;atom sites enhanced the occupancy of Ir&#8722;O bonding orbitals and improved the occupation of Pt&#8722;H antibonding orbital, respectively, contributing to the formation of the O&#8722;O bond and the desorption of hydrogen. This one&#8208;step approach was also generalized to fabricate other 20 single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled Transformations of a Dynamic Cage&#8208;Based Molecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of a photoswitchable imine cage has been altered by irradiation with light. This facilitates the transformation of the cage upon application of external stimuli. A four&#8208;step opening/closing cycle has been achieved by controlling the rates of nuchleophile/imine exchange with an amine, which drives the system out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium. Furthermore, a light&#8208;induced cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation has been demonstrated using the same principle.







Abstract
In a chemical equilibrium, the formation of high&#8208;energy species&#8212;in a closed system&#8212;is inefficient due to microscopic reversibility. Here, we demonstrate how this restriction can be circumvented by coupling a dynamic equilibrium to a light&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization of an azobenzene imine cage. The stable E&#8208;cage resists intermolecular imine exchange reactions that would &#8220;open&#8221; it. Upon switching, the strained Z&#8208;cage isomers undergo imine exchange spontaneously, thus opening the cage. Subsequent isomerization of the Z&#8208;open compounds yields a high&#8208;energy, kinetically trapped E&#8208;open species, which cannot be efficiently obtained from the initial E&#8208;cage, thus shifting an imine equilibrium energetically uphill in a closed system. Upon heating, the nucleophile is displaced back into solution and an opening/closing cycle is completed by regenerating the stable all&#8208;E&#8208;cage. Using this principle, a light&#8208;induced cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation is performed by the addition of a ditopic aldehyde.

         <title>Selective Formal Carbene Insertion into Carbon&#8208;Boron Bonds of Diboronates by N&#8208;Trisylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular reaction of N&#8208;trisylhydrazones with bis (boryl) methane led to the transformation of 1,1&#8208;diboronate into 1,2&#8208;bis(boronates) via 1,2&#8208;borylmethyl migration. With unsymmetric diboronates with two different boryl moieties, the reaction proceeded with excellent regioselectivity. DFT studies reveal an unusual neighbouring boryl group effect that accounts for the observed regioselectivity.







Abstract
Bisborylalkanes play important roles in organic synthesis as versatile bifunctional reagents. The two boron moieties in these compounds can be selectively converted into other functional groups through cross&#8208;coupling, oxidation or radical reactions. Thus, the development of efficient methods for synthesizing bisborylalkanes is highly demanded. Herein we report a new strategy to access bisborylalkanes through the reaction of N&#8208;trisylhydrazones with diboronate, in which the bis(boryl) methane is transformed into 1,2&#8208;bis(boronates) via formal carbene insertion. Since the N&#8208;trisylhydrazones can be readily derived from the corresponding aldehydes, this strategy represents a practical synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diboronates with broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies reveal an unusual neighboring group effect of 1,1&#8208;bis(boronates), which accounts for the observed regioselectivity when unsymmetric 1,1&#8208;diboronates are applied.

         <title>Nitrogen Plasma Enhanced Low Temperature Atomic Layer Deposition of Magnesium Phosphorus Oxynitride (MgPON) Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic layer deposition (ALD) process with a double nitrogen plasma process successfully produces nitrogen&#8208;incorporated magnesium phosphorus oxynitride (MgPON) solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) thin films at a low deposition temperature of 125&#8201;&#176;C and exhibits the ability of conformal deposition nitride SSEs onto 3D patterned substrates with a high aspect ratio, which is attractive for using nitride ion&#8208;conducing films in solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) that use solid electrolytes instead of flammable liquid electrolytes have the potential to generate higher specific capacity and offer better safety. Magnesium (Mg) based SSBs with Mg metal anodes are considered to be one of the most promising energy storage candidates, because it gives high theoretical volumetric capacities of 3830&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3. Here, we demonstrate an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process with a double nitrogen plasma process that successfully produces nitrogen&#8208;incorporated magnesium phosphorus oxynitride (MgPON) solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) thin films at a low deposition temperature of 125&#8201;&#176;C. The ALD MgPON SSEs exhibit an ionic conductivity of 0.36 and 1.2&#8197;&#956;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 450 and 500&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The proposed ALD strategy shows the ability of conformal deposition nitrogen&#8208;doped SSEs on pattered substrates and is attractive for using nitride ion&#8208;conducing films as protective or wetting interlayers in solid&#8208;state Mg and Li batteries.

&lt;p&gt;An atomic layer deposition (ALD) process with a double nitrogen plasma process successfully produces nitrogen-incorporated magnesium phosphorus oxynitride (MgPON) solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) thin films at a low deposition temperature of 125&#8201;&#176;C and exhibits the ability of conformal deposition nitride SSEs onto 3D patterned substrates with a high aspect ratio, which is attractive for using nitride ion-conducing films in solid-state batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state batteries (SSBs) that use solid electrolytes instead of flammable liquid electrolytes have the potential to generate higher specific capacity and offer better safety. Magnesium (Mg) based SSBs with Mg metal anodes are considered to be one of the most promising energy storage candidates, because it gives high theoretical volumetric capacities of 3830&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Here, we demonstrate an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process with a double nitrogen plasma process that successfully produces nitrogen-incorporated magnesium phosphorus oxynitride (MgPON) solid-state electrolyte (SSE) thin films at a low deposition temperature of 125&#8201;&#176;C. The ALD MgPON SSEs exhibit an ionic conductivity of 0.36 and 1.2&#8197;&#956;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 450 and 500&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The proposed ALD strategy shows the ability of conformal deposition nitrogen-doped SSEs on pattered substrates and is attractive for using nitride ion-conducing films as protective or wetting interlayers in solid-state Mg and Li batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Profiling the Heme&#8208;Binding Proteomes of Bacteria Using Chemical Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heme homeostasis is critical for bacterial survival, but the heme interactome is not yet fully characterised. Herein we report a chemical proteomics method for global profiling of heme&#8208;binding proteins in live cells. Applying 6 heme probes and optimised labelling conditions, we accessed 32&#8211;54&#8201;% of the known heme&#8208;binding proteomes in major pathogenic Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.







Abstract
Heme is a cofactor with myriad roles and essential to almost all living organisms. Beyond classical gas transport and catalytic functions, heme is increasingly appreciated as a tightly controlled signalling molecule regulating protein expression. However, heme acquisition, biosynthesis and regulation is poorly understood beyond a few model organisms, and the heme&#8208;binding proteome has not been fully characterised in bacteria. Yet as heme homeostasis is critical for bacterial survival, heme&#8208;binding proteins are promising drug targets. Herein we report a chemical proteomics method for global profiling of heme&#8208;binding proteins in live cells for the first time. Employing a panel of heme&#8208;based clickable and photoaffinity probes enabled the profiling of 32&#8211;54&#8201;% of the known heme&#8208;binding proteomes in Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. This simple&#8208;to&#8208;implement profiling strategy could be interchangeably applied to different cell types and systems and fuel future research into heme biology.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization of Polymeric Nanorods Mediated by Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular polymerization of polymeric nanorods mediated by block copolymers has been demonstrated. The block copolymers concentrate around the nanorod ends and leave hydrophobic sides exposed. Driven by hydrophobic interactions, the nanorods connect to form bundles. As polymerization progresses, the copolymers gradually deposit and assemble into helical nanopatterns on the bundle surface, which terminates supramolecular polymerization.







Abstract
Introducing a second component is an effective way to manipulate polymerization behavior. However, this phenomenon has rarely been observed in colloidal systems, such as polymeric nanoparticles. Here, we report the supramolecular polymerization of polymeric nanorods mediated by block copolymers. Experimental observations and simulation results illustrate that block copolymers surround the polymeric nanorods and mainly concentrate around the two ends, leaving the hydrophobic side regions exposed. These polymeric nanorods connect in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side manner through hydrophobic interactions to form bundles. As polymerization progresses, the block copolymers gradually deposit onto the bundles and finally assemble into helical nanopatterns on the outermost surface, which terminates the polymerization. It is anticipated that this work could offer inspiration for a general strategy of controllable supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Fast Li&#8208;ion Storage and Dynamics in TiO2 Nanoparticle Clusters Probed by Smart Scanning Electrochemical Cell Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (s&#8208;SECCM), achieved through in situ interference reflection microscopy, enables the high throughput analysis of individual TiO2 nanoparticle clusters to estimate the Li+ diffusivity and reveal the inherent fast charging capability of small TiO2 nanoparticle clusters.







Abstract
Anatase TiO2 is a promising material for Li&#8208;ion (Li+) batteries with fast charging capability. However, Li+ (de)intercalation dynamics in TiO2 remain elusive and reported diffusivities span many orders of magnitude. Here, we develop a smart protocol for scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) with in situ optical microscopy (OM) to enable the high&#8208;throughput charge/discharge analysis of single TiO2 nanoparticle clusters. Directly probing active nanoparticles revealed that TiO2 with a size of &#8776;50&#8197;nm can store over 30&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity at an extremely fast charge/discharge rate of &#8776;100&#8197;C. This finding of fast Li+ storage in TiO2 particles strengthens its potential for fast&#8208;charging batteries. More generally, smart SECCM&#8208;OM should find wide applications for high&#8208;throughput electrochemical screening of nanostructured materials.

         <title>Expediting Oxygen Evolution by Optimizing Cation and Anion Complexity in Electrocatalysts Based on Metal Phosphorous Trichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) increases with the cation/anion complexity of the employed electrocatalysts based on metal phosphorous trichalcogenides. The most complex catalyst has a nearly optimum OER activity descriptor value and a different rate&#8208;determining step with respect to its sibling catalysts, making it the most active catalyst in the family.







Abstract
Purposely changing the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major challenge for enhancing the energy efficiency of electrochemical splitting of water. Here we show that the OER RDS can be regulated by simply varying the cation and anion complexity in a family of the metal phosphorous trichalcogenide electrocatalysts (MPT3, where M=Fe, Ni; T=S, Se), achieving an exceptionally high OER activity in (Ni,Fe)P(S,Se)3, as demonstrated by its ultra&#8208;low Tafel slope (34&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1) and a very low overpotential compared to many relevant OER catalysts. This is strongly supported by density functional theory calculations, which showed that this catalyst has a nearly optimal OER activity descriptor value of &#916;G(O*)&#8722;&#916;G(OH*)=1.5&#8197;eV. We also found that the activity descriptor is proportional to a newly proposed cation/anion complexity index that consists of pairwise contributions from cation&#8208;anion bonds in a catalyst compound, revealing the pivotal role of the cation&#8208;anion interactions in determining the catalyst performance and providing a simple way for predicting catalytic activities.

         <title>Tandem Mass Spectrometry Imaging Enables High Definition for Mapping Lipids in Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiplexed MS/MS imaging method is developed that can provide MS2 images for 10 lipid species or more for each sampling spot on tissue samples. Coupling with on&#8208;tissue photochemical derivatization, this method enables sensitive imaging of multiple phospholipid C=C location isomers in cancerous tissue sections.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of lipids in biological tissues is useful for correlating molecular distribution with pathological results, which could provide useful information for both biological research and disease diagnosis. It is well understood that the lipidome could not be clearly deciphered without tandem mass spectrometry analysis, but this is challenging to achieve in MSI due to the limitation in sample amount at each image spot. Here we develop a multiplexed MS2 imaging (MS2I) method that can provide MS2 images for 10 lipid species or more for each sampling spot, providing spatial structural lipidomic information. Coupling with on&#8208;tissue photochemical derivatization, imaging of 20 phospholipid C=C location isomers is also realized, showing enhanced molecular images with high definition in structure for mouse brain and human liver cancer tissue sections. Spatially mapped t&#8208;distributed stochastic neighbor embedding has also been adopted to visualize the tumor margin with enhancement by structural lipidomic information.

         <title>Electrochemical Reactivation of Dead Li2S for Li&#8722;S Batteries in Non&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated the fast capacity decay of Li&#8722;S batteries in non&#8208;solvating electrolytes is due to the formation and accumulation of dead Li2S aggregate. An electrochemical approach is proposed to reactivate the dead Li2S and strengthen the cyclability.







Abstract
The use of non&#8208;solvating, or as&#8208;called sparingly&#8208;solvating, electrolytes (NSEs), is regarded as one of the most promising solutions to the obstacles to the practical applications of Li&#8722;S batteries. However, it remains a puzzle that long&#8208;life Li&#8722;S batteries have rarely, if not never, been reported with NSEs, despite their good compatibility with Li anode. Here, we find the capacity decay of Li&#8722;S batteries in NSEs is mainly due to the accumulation of the dead Li2S at the cathode side, rather than the degradation of the anodes or electrolytes. Based on this understanding, we propose an electrochemical strategy to reactivate the accumulated Li2S and revive the dead Li&#8722;S batteries in NSEs. With such a facile approach, Li&#8722;S batteries with significantly improved cycling stability and accelerated dynamics are achieved with diglyme&#8208;, acetonitrile&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane&#8208;based NSEs. Our finding may rebuild the confidence in exploiting non&#8208;solvating Li&#8722;S batteries with practical competitiveness.

         <title>Transformable Plasmonic Helix with Swinging Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a transformable plasmonic helix, in which multiple AuNPs can programmable move around a shared DNA origami shaft. To enable the translocations of multiple AuNPs in large leaps without detachment, the AuNPs are guided by DNA swingarms extended from the origami to target positions through sequence&#8208;specific DNA interactions.







Abstract
Control over multiple optical elements that can be dynamically rearranged to yield substantial three&#8208;dimensional structural transformations is of great importance to realize reconfigurable plasmonic nanoarchitectures with sensitive and distinct optical feedback. In this work, we demonstrate a transformable plasmonic helix system, in which multiple gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be directly transported by DNA swingarms to target positions without undergoing consecutive stepwise movements. The swingarms allow for programmable AuNP translocations in large leaps within plasmonic nanoarchitectures, giving rise to tailored circular dichroism spectra. Our work provides an instructive bottom&#8208;up solution to building complex dynamic plasmonic systems, which can exhibit prominent optical responses through cooperative rearrangements of the constituent optical elements with high fidelity and programmability.

         <title>Giant Tunability of Charge Transport in 2D Inorganic Molecular Crystals by Pressure Engineering</title>

Giant tunability of charge transport in two&#8208;dimensional inorganic molecular crystals, from an insulator to a semiconductor, is revealed for the first time through in situ high&#8208;pressure experimental characterizations.







Abstract
The unique intermolecular van der Waals force in emerging two&#8208;dimensional inorganic molecular crystals (2DIMCs) endows them with highly tunable structures and properties upon applying external stimuli. Using high pressure to modulate the intermolecular bonding, here we reveal the highly tunable charge transport behavior in 2DIMCs for the first time, from an insulator to a semiconductor. As pressure increases, 2D &#945;&#8208;Sb2O3 molecular crystal undergoes three isostructural transitions, and the intermolecular bonding enhances gradually, which results in a considerably decreased band gap by 25&#8201;% and a greatly enhanced charge transport. Impressively, the in situ resistivity measurement of the &#945;&#8208;Sb2O3 flake shows a sharp drop by 5 orders of magnitude in 0&#8211;3.2&#8197;GPa. This work sheds new light on the manipulation of charge transport in 2DIMCs and is of great significance for promoting the fundamental understanding and potential applications of 2DIMCs in advanced modern technologies.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Containing Dual O2 Reduction Centers for Overall Photosynthetic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two crystalline heptazine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (HEP&#8208;COFs) with spatially separated redox centers are designed for efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2O2 production from O2 and water without using any sacrificial agents. HEP&#8208;COFs with dual O2 reduction centers aid charge separation to give improved photocatalytic performance. The rational design of metal&#8208;free polymeric photocatalysts boosts the efficiency of artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are highly desirable for achieving high&#8208;efficiency overall photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via molecular design. However, precise construction of COFs toward overall photosynthetic H2O2 remains a great challenge. Herein, we report the crystalline s&#8208;heptazine&#8208;based COFs (HEP&#8208;TAPT&#8208;COF and HEP&#8208;TAPB&#8208;COF) with separated redox centers for efficient H2O2 production from O2 and pure water. The spatially and orderly separated active sites in HEP&#8208;COFs can efficiently promote charge separation and enhance photocatalytic H2O2 production. Compared with HEP&#8208;TAPB&#8208;COF, HEP&#8208;TAPT&#8208;COF exhibits higher H2O2 production efficiency for integrating dual O2 reduction active centers of s&#8208;heptazine and triazine moieties. Accordingly, HEP&#8208;TAPT&#8208;COF bearing dual O2 reduction centers exhibits a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.65&#8201;% with a high apparent quantum efficiency of 15.35&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, surpassing previously reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of Unprotected &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines by Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Aminoarylation of Alkenes in Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprotected &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines were directly accessed via 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation of alkenes under operationally simple conditions, thanks to a cooperative effect between an iron (II) catalyst and the solvent hexafluoroisopropanol. This one&#8208;pot sequential protocol did not require pre&#8208;activated (hetero)arenes and proved compatible with a broad range of drug&#8208;oriented functional groups.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines are prevalent structural motifs in molecules exhibiting biological activity. Here we report a sequential one&#8208;pot protocol for the 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation of alkenes with hydroxylammonium triflate salts and (hetero)arenes. Unlike existing methods, this reaction provides a direct entry to unprotected &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with remarkable functional group tolerance, allowing key drug&#8208;oriented functional groups to be installed in a two&#8208;step process. The use of hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent in combination with an iron(II) catalyst proved essential to reaching high&#8208;value nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Swelling&#8208;induced Mechanochromism in Multinetwork Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Swelling&#8208;force&#8208;induced mechanochemical reactions were observed in multinetwork polymers. Sequential swelling of network polymers stretches the network strands, and finally induces selective mechanical scission events at the difluorenylsuccinonitrile (DFSN) mechano&#8208;responsive units, which generate air&#8208;stable radicals with pink color. The increased thermal reactivity of DFSN and kinetic stability of the resulting radicals were also discovered.







Abstract
We report a novel and versatile approach to achieving swelling&#8208;induced mechanochemistry using a multinetwork (MN) strategy that enables polymer networks to repeatedly swell with monomers and solvents. The isotropic expansion of the first network (FN) provides sufficient force to drive the mechanochemical scission of a radical&#8208;based mechanophore, difluorenylsuccinonitrile (DFSN). Although prompt recombination generally occurs in such highly mobile environments, the resulting pink radicals are kinetically stabilized in the gels, probably due to limited diffusion in the extended polymer chains. Moreover, the DFSN embedded in the isotropically strained chain exhibits increased thermal reactivity, which can be reasonably explained by an entropic contribution of the FN to the dissociation. The utility of the MN polymers is demonstrated not only in terms of swelling&#8208;force&#8208;induced network modification, but also in the context of tunable reactivity of the dissociative unit through proper design of the hierarchical network architecture.

         <title>Integrating Chemical Pre&#8208;Potassiation with Pre&#8208;Modulated KF&#8208;Rich Electrolyte Interfaces for Dual&#8208;Carbon Potassium Ion Hybrid Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical pre&#8208;potassiation strategy is developed to simultaneously pre&#8208;potassiate anode and cathode, and induce the formation of KF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI)/cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI), thus assisting the rapid ion transport for anode and inhibiting the electrolyte oxidation decomposition at cathode, which contribute to higher energy density and longer cycling life of potassium ion hybrid capacitors.







Abstract
Herein, a chemical pre&#8208;potassiation strategy via simultaneously treating both glucose derived carbon (GDC) anode and commercial activated carbon (CAC) cathode in potassium&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;tetrahydrofuran solution is developed for potassium ion hybrid capacitor (PIHC). Combined with in situ and ex situ characterizations, a radical reaction between pre&#8208;potassiation reagent and carbon electrodes is confirmed, which not only deactivates electrochemical irreversible sites, but also promotes to pre&#8208;form a uniform and dense KF&#8208;rich electrolyte film on the electrodes. As a result, the pre&#8208;potassiation treatment presents multiple advantages: (I)&#8197;the initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the GDC anode increases from 45.4&#8201;% to 84.0&#8201;% with higher rate capability; (II)&#8197;the CAC cathode exhibits the improved cycling CEs and stability due to the enhanced resistance to electrolyte oxidation at 4.2&#8197;V; (III) the assembled PIHC achieves a high energy density of 172.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with cycling life over 10000 cycles.

         <title>A Convergent, Modular Approach to Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Bearing 5&#8208;Membered Rings via Catalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular approach to access CF3&#8208;bearing 5&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles via catalytic C (sp3)&#8722;H insertion is demonstrated. In the case of carbocycles, an asymmetric benzylic C&#8722;H insertion process allowed to reach high regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. This protocol can be applied to the synthesis of chiral CF3 analogues of medicinal agents and natural products. The origin of selectivity was investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Trifluoromethyl&#8208;bearing 5&#8208;membered rings are prevalent in bioactive molecules, but modular approaches to these compounds by functionalization of robust C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in a direct and selective manner are extremely challenging. Herein we report the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene insertion into C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of a broad range of substrates to access 7 types of CF3&#8208;bearing saturated 5&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. The reaction is particularly effective for benzylic C&#8722;H insertion exerting good site&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol, and applicable to the synthesis of chiral CF3 analogues of bioactive molecules. Ruthenium &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene complexes underwent stoichiometric reactions to give C&#8722;H insertion products, lending evidence for the involvement of metal &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene species in the catalytic cycle. DFT calculations revealed that the &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; attraction and intra&#8208;carbene C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bond elucidate the origin of selectivity of the benzylic C&#8722;H insertion reactions.

         <title>An Atomically Precise Pyrazolate&#8208;Protected Copper Nanocluster Exhibiting Exceptional Stability and Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically precise pyrazolate&#8208;protected copper nanocluster exhibits extraordinary chemical stability toward oxygen, heat, oxidant (8&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2O2), acid (1&#8197;M HCl) and base (20&#8197;M KOH). It has been used as stable homogeneous catalysts for synthesis of indolizine with exceptional catalytic activity, delivering superior TOF (3380&#8197;h&#8722;1) compared to other reported catalysts.







Abstract
The synthesis of atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu&#8208;NCs) with high chemical stability is a prerequisite for practical applications, yet still remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we have prepared a pyrazolate&#8208;protected Cu&#8208;NC (Cu8), which exhibited exceptional chemical stability either in solid&#8208;state or in solution. The crystals of Cu8 are still suitable for single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis even after being treated with boiling water, 8&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2O2, high concentrated acid (1&#8197;M HCl) or saturated base (&#8776;20&#8197;M KOH), respectively. More importantly, the structure of Cu8 in solution also remained intact toward oxygen, organic acid (100&#8197;eq. HOAc) or base (400&#8197;eq. dibutylamine) confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR and UV/Vis analysis. Taking advantage of high alkali&#8208;resistant, Cu8 illustrates excellent catalytic activity for the synthesis of indolizines, and it can be reused for at least 10 cycles without losing catalytic performance.

It has been used as stable homogeneous catalysts for synthesis of indolizine with exceptional catalytic activity, delivering superior TOF (3380&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to other reported catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu-NCs) with high chemical stability is a prerequisite for practical applications, yet still remains a long-standing challenge. Herein, we have prepared a pyrazolate-protected Cu-NC (&lt;b&gt;Cu8&lt;/b&gt;), which exhibited exceptional chemical stability either in solid-state or in solution. The crystals of &lt;b&gt;Cu8&lt;/b&gt; are still suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis even after being treated with boiling water, 8&#8197;wt&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, high concentrated acid (1&#8197;M HCl) or saturated base (&#8776;20&#8197;M KOH), respectively. More importantly, the structure of &lt;b&gt;Cu8&lt;/b&gt; in solution also remained intact toward oxygen, organic acid (100&#8197;eq. HOAc) or base (400&#8197;eq. dibutylamine) confirmed by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR and UV/Vis analysis. Taking advantage of high alkali-resistant, &lt;b&gt;Cu8&lt;/b&gt; illustrates excellent catalytic activity for the synthesis of indolizines, and it can be reused for at least 10 cycles without losing catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Configuration&#8208;Induced Multichromism of Phenanthridine Derivatives: A Type of Versatile Fluorescent Probe for Microenvironmental Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In sharp contrast to conventional fluorophores that can only detect one or few stimuli in microenvironments, a group of phenanthridine&#8208;based fluorophores, namely B1, F1, and T1 with 1D, 2D, and 3D molecular configurations, respectively, have been developed. They show excellent capability in tracking a variety of stimuli through distinct fluorescence evolutions, thus offering promising applications in bioimaging, optical sensing, and many others.







Abstract
Fluorescent probes are attractive in diagnosis and sensing. However, most reported fluorophores can only detect one or few analytes/parameters, notably limiting their applications. Here we have designed three phenanthridine&#8208;based fluorophores (i.e., B1, F1, and T1 with 1D, 2D, and 3D molecular configuration, respectively) capable of monitoring various microenvironments. In rigidifying media, all fluorophores show bathochromic emissions but with different wavelength and intensity changes. Under compression, F1 shows a bathochromic emission of over 163&#8197;nm, which results in organic fluorophore&#8208;based full&#8208;color piezochromism. Moreover, both B1 and F1 exhibit an aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) behavior, while T1 is an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophore. Further, F1 and T1 selectively concentrate in cell nucleus, whereas B1 mainly stains the cytoplasm in live cell imaging. This work provides a general design strategy of versatile fluorophores for microenvironmental monitoring.

         <title>Regulating Frozen Electrolyte Structure with Colloidal Dispersion for Low Temperature Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;temperature performance of ABs was significantly improved with the colloidal electrolyte design with the use of graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs), which effectively inhibits the growth of ice crystals and expands the liquid regions for facial ion transport.







Abstract
Electrolyte freezing under low temperatures is a critical challenge for the development of aqueous batteries (ABs). While lowering the freezing point of the electrolyte has caught major research efforts, limited attention has been paid to the structural evolution during the electrolyte freezing process and regulating the frozen electrolyte structure for low temperature ABs. Here, we reveal the formation process of interconnected liquid regions for ion transport in frozen electrolytes with various in situ variable&#8208;temperature technologies. More importantly, the low&#8208;temperature performance of ABs was significantly improved with the colloidal electrolyte design using graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs), which effectively inhibits the growth of ice crystals and expands the interconnected liquid regions for facial ion transport. This work provides new insights and a promising strategy for the electrolyte design of low&#8208;temperature ABs.

         <title>Diradical B/N&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extension of a B/N&#8208;heterocycle has led to the generation of B/N&#8208;type organic diradicaloids. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the two quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extended B/N&#8208;doped polycyclic hydrocarbons synthesized have enhanced open&#8208;shell diradical structures, modulated (anti)aromaticity, as well as intriguing properties, such as magnetic activities, narrow energy gaps, and highly red&#8208;shifted absorptions.







Abstract
Heterocyclic diradicaloids with atom&#8208;precise control over open&#8208;shell nature are promising materials for organic electronics and spintronics. Herein, we disclose quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extension of a B/N&#8208;heterocycle for generating B/N&#8208;type organic diradicaloids. Two quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extended B/N&#8208;doped polycyclic hydrocarbons that feature fusion of the B/N&#8208;heterocycle motif with the antiaromatic s&#8208;indacene or dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalene core were synthesized. This quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extension and B/N&#8208;heterocycle leads to their open&#8208;shell electronic nature, which stands in contrast to the multiple&#8208;resonance effect of conventional B/N&#8208;type emitters. These B/N&#8208;type diradicaloids have modulated (anti)aromaticity and enhanced diradical characters comparing with the all&#8208;carbon analogues, as well as intriguing properties, such as magnetic activities, narrow energy gaps and highly red&#8208;shifted absorptions. This study thus opens the new space for both of B/N&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems and heterocyclic diradicaloids.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hydrogenation with Hydrogen Spillover Enabled by Nitrogen Vacancies on Boron Nitride&#8208;Supported Pd Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
h&#8208;BN containing abundant nitrogen vacancies is demonstrated as an effective support for Pd nanocatalysts to develop the capability for the hydrogenation of aldehydes/ketones to alcohols with hydrogen spillover. While nitrogen vacancies play a crucial role in the spillover of H atoms from Pd onto h&#8208;BN, high selectivity to alcohols by hydrogen spillover is ascribed to the weak adsorption of alcohols to the hydrogenation sites (nitrogen vacancies).







Abstract
Heterogeneous hydrogenation with hydrogen spillover has been demonstrated as an effective route to achieve high selectivity towards target products. More effort should be paid to understand the complicated correlation between the nature of supports and hydrogenation involving hydrogen spillover. Herein, we report the development of the hydrogenation system of hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN)&#8208;supported Pd nanoparticles for the hydrogenation of aldehydes/ketones to alcohols with hydrogen spillover. Nitrogen vacancies in h&#8208;BN determine the feasibility of hydrogen spillover from Pd to h&#8208;BN. The hydrogenation of aldehydes/ketones with hydrogen spillover from Pd proceeds on nitrogen vacancies on h&#8208;BN. The weak adsorption of alcohols to h&#8208;BN inhibits the deep hydrogenation of aldehydes/ketones, thus leading to high catalytic selectivity to alcohols. Moreover, the hydrogen spillover&#8208;based hydrogenation mechanism makes the catalyst system exhibit a high tolerance to CO poisoning.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible molecular probe, NEP3, for the detection of neutrophil elastase (NE), free from the interference of structural changes of NE, was developed. NEP3 was applied to the ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) and near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of NE levels in vivo, providing a method for developing more specific fluorogenic probes for other enzymes.







Abstract
Neutrophil elastase (NE) plays a key role in chronic inflammation and acute responses to infection and injury. Effective disease interventions thus call for precise identification of NE to aid the clinical treatment of such diseases. However, the detection process suffers from the interference of structural changes of NE. Herein, we introduce a molecular probe with high biocompatibility to overcome the interference, which was achieved by combining theoretical calculations and experimental studies, that permits highly specific and sensitive detection of NE in cells and in vivo. The upregulated NE accumulation was specifically measured in inflammation by ratiometric photoacoustic and near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging, providing a new method for developing more specific fluorogenic probes for other enzymes.

         <title>Bonding and Reactivity in Terminal versus Bridging Arenide Complexes of Thorium Acting as ThII Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mononuclear arenide complex and an inverse&#8208;sandwich complex of thorium can perform multielectron reductive chemistry with a range of substrates acting as ThII synthons. The mononuclear complex shows higher reactivity towards an diazoolefine yielding a ThIV amidoacetylido complex via a vinylidene intermediate suggesting that the Th reactivity is tuned by the arenide binding mode.







Abstract
Thorium redox chemistry is extremely scarce due to the high stability of ThIV. Here we report two unique examples of thorium arenide complexes prepared by reduction of a ThIV&#8208;siloxide complex in presence of naphthalene, the mononuclear arenide complex [K(OSi(OtBu)3)3Th(&#951;6&#8208;C10H8)] (1) and the inverse&#8208;sandwich complex [K(OSi(OtBu)3)3Th]2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;C10H8)] (2). The electrons stored in these complexes allow the reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, AdN3, CO2, HBBN). Higher reactivity was found for the complex 1 which reacts with the diazoolefin IDipp=CN2 to yield the unexpected ThIV amidoalkynyl complex 5 via a terminal N&#8208;heterocyclic vinylidene intermediate. This work showed that arenides can act as convenient redox&#8208;active ligands for implementing thorium&#8208;ligand cooperative multielectron transfer and that the reactivity can be tuned by the arenide binding mode.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Lasing from a Microcavity Filled with Achiral Single&#8208;Crystalline Microribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized lasing with high dissymmetry factors has been realized in an organic crystal&#8208;filled cavity without any chiral materials or structures. The fundamental principle is the Rashba&#8208;Dresselhaus effect induced spin&#8208;splitting as well as the unique properties of the organic single crystals.







Abstract
Organic circularly polarized (CP) lasers have received increasing attention due to their future photoelectric applications. Here, we demonstrate a CP laser from a pure organic crystal&#8208;filled microcavity without any chiral molecules or chiral structures. Benefited from the giant anisotropy and excellent laser gain of organic crystals, optical Rashba&#8208;Dresselhaus spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect can be induced and is conductive to the CP laser in such microcavities. The maximum dissymmetry factor of the CP lasing with opposite helicities reachs 1.2. Our strategy may provide a new idea for the design of CP lasers towards future 3D laser displays, information storage and other fields.

         <title>Rational Design of Covalent Organic Frameworks as Gas Diffusion Layers for Multi&#8208;atmosphere Lithium&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A moisture&#8208;sieving gas diffusion layer based on covalent organic frameworks has been developed for non&#8208;aqueous electrochemical systems, enabling a Li&#8208;gas battery that can stably cycle under different atmospheres with high humidity.







Abstract
Non&#8208;aqueous Li&#8208;air batteries, despite their high energy density and low cost, have not been deployed practically due to their instability in ambient air, where moisture causes parasitic reactions and shortens their life drastically. Here, we demonstrate the rational design of nanoporous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as effective gas diffusion layers (GDLs) to address this constraint. The COF GDLs, with a tailor&#8208;made pore size of &#8776;1.4&#8197;nm and superhydrophobicity, can limit the intrusion of organic electrolytes and moisture into the gas diffusion channels, enabling high capacity, fast kinetics, and excellent stability of the Li&#8208;air batteries. Moreover, we achieve multi&#8208;atmosphere Li&#8208;air batteries, which can stably cycle under open ambient air (relative humidity up to 95&#8201;%) and even in various atmospheres with looping oxygen, humid air, and carbon dioxide. The design principles of our COF GDLs can be universally applied in energy storage and electrochemical systems using organic electrolytes.

         <title>The Biosynthetic Gene Cluster of Mushroom&#8208;Derived Antrocin Encodes Two Dual&#8208;Functional Haloacid Dehalogenase&#8208;like Terpene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We uncovered the biosynthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;antrocin, from the medicinal mushroom Antrodia cinnamomea, using genetic and biochemical approaches. Furthermore, two unusual dual&#8208;functional haloacid dehalogenase&#8208;like terpene cyclases, AncA and AncC, which generate cyclofarnesoid&#8208; and drimane&#8208;type products, respectively, were characterized. These findings lay the foundation for the biotechnological production of antrocins independent of the Antrodia mushroom.







Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Antrocin (1), produced by the medicinal mushroom Antrodia cinnamomea, is a potent antiproliferative compound. The biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 was identified, and the pathway was characterized by heterologous expression. We characterized a haloacid dehalogenase&#8208;like terpene cyclase AncC that biosynthesizes the drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;albicanol (2) from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Biochemical characterization of AncC, including kinetic studies and mutagenesis, demonstrated the functions of two domains: a terpene cyclase (TC) and a pyrophosphatase (PPase). The TC domain first cyclizes FPP to albicanyl pyrophosphate, and the PPase domain then removes the pyrophosphate to form 2. Intriguingly, AncA (94&#8201;% sequence identity to AncC), in the same gene cluster, converts FPP into (R)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#947;&#8208;monocyclofarnesol instead of 2. Notably, Y283/F375 in the TC domain of AncA serve as a gatekeeper in controlling the formation of a cyclofarnesoid rather than a drimane&#8208;type scaffold.

         <title>Wurtzite CuGaS2 with an In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed CuO Layer Photocatalyzes CO2 Conversion to Ethylene with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates strain&#8208;induced in situ surface reconstruction in wurtzite CuGaS2, leading to heterojunction formation under basic conditions. The oxidation state of Cu was finetuned to modulate the pathway of the CO2 reduction reaction to the formation of ethylene with high selectivity. Detailed mechanistic insight was obtained from DFT calculations and in situ DRIFTS, which reveal a new pathway for C&#8722;C coupling and ethylene production.







Abstract
We present surface reconstruction&#8208;induced C&#8722;C coupling whereby CO2 is converted into ethylene. The wurtzite phase of CuGaS2. undergoes in situ surface reconstruction, leading to the formation of a thin CuO layer over the pristine catalyst, which facilitates selective conversion of CO2 to ethylene (C2H4). Upon illumination, the catalyst efficiently converts CO2 to C2H4 with 75.1&#8201;% selectivity (92.7&#8201;% selectivity in terms of Relectron) and a 20.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 evolution rate. Subsequent spectroscopic and microscopic studies supported by theoretical analysis revealed operando&#8208;generated Cu2+, with the assistance of existing Cu+, functioning as an anchor for the generated *CO and thereby facilitating C&#8722;C coupling. This study demonstrates strain&#8208;induced in situ surface reconstruction leading to heterojunction formation, which finetunes the oxidation state of Cu and modulates the CO2 reduction reaction pathway to selective formation of ethylene.

         <title>Liquid Metal as Bioinspired and Unusual Modulator in Bioorthogonal Catalysis for Tumor Inhibition Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a heterogeneous LM&#8208;Pd catalyst with liquid metal as a bioinspired and unusual modulator to realize efficient bioorthogonal catalysis for potent tumor inhibition. This appealing strategy will not only broaden the application of liquid metals but also provide new insight into the design and construction of novel bioorthogonal catalysts.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal catalysis mediated by Pd&#8208;based transition metal catalysts has sparked increasing interest in combating diseases. However, the catalytic and therapeutic efficiency of current Pd0 catalysts is unsatisfactory. Herein, inspired by the concept that ligands around metal sites could enable enzymes to catalyze astonishing reactions by changing their electronic environment, a LM&#8208;Pd catalyst with liquid metal (LM) as an unusual modulator has been designed to realize efficient bioorthogonal catalysis for tumor inhibition. The LM matrix can serve as a &#8220;ligand&#8221; to afford an electron&#8208;rich environment to stabilize the active Pd0 and promote nucleophilic turnover of the &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium species to accelerate the uncaging process. Besides, the photothermal properties of LM can lead to the enhanced removal of tumor cells by photo&#8208;enhanced catalysis and photothermal effect. We believe that our work will broaden the application of LM and motivate the design of bioinspired bioorthogonal catalysts.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Switching of CO2 Hydrogenation Pathway towards CH3OH Production over Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2(Co)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main product of CO2 hydrogenation is switched from CO under thermocatalysis condition to CH3OH upon light irradiation over atomically dispersed Co decorated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 with encapsulation of ultra&#8208;fine Pt nanoparticles.







Abstract
It is highly desired to achieve controllable product selectivity in CO2 hydrogenation. Herein, we report light&#8208;induced switching of reaction pathways of CO2 hydrogenation towards CH3OH production over actomically dispersed Co decorated Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. CO, being the main product in the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) pathway under thermocatalysis condition, is switched to CH3OH via the formate pathway with the assistance of light irradiation. Impressively, the space&#8208;time yield of CH3OH in photo&#8208;assisted thermocatalysis (1916.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) is about 7.8 times higher than that without light at 240&#8201;&#176;C and 1.5&#8197;MPa. Mechanism investigation indicates that upon light irradiation, excited UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can transfer electrons to Pt nanoparticles and Co sites, which can efficiently catalyze the critical elementary steps (i.e., CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*HCOO conversion), thus suppressing the RWGS pathway to achieve a high CH3OH selectivity.

         <title>Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen Radical (H&#8901;) with GSH for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic photocatalytic hydrogen radical (H&#8901;) generator is activated by glutathione (GSH) for enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) against normoxic tumor cells via a hybrid ferroptosis&#8208;apoptosis pathway. H&#8901; therapy is also effective in fighting tumors under hypoxic conditions through biological reduction.







Abstract
As a reactive hydrogen species, the hydrogen radical (H&#8901;) scarcely sees applications in tumor biological therapy due to the very limited bio&#8208;friendly sources of H&#8901;. In this work, we report that TAF can act as an organic photosensitizer as well as an efficient photocatalytic H&#8901; generator with reduced glutathione (GSH) as a fuel. The photoactivation of TAF leads to cell death in two ways including triple amplification of oxidative stress via ferroptosis&#8208;apoptosis under normoxia and apoptosis through biological reductions under hypoxia. TAF presents excellent biosafety with ultrahigh photocytotoxicity index at an order of magnitude of 102&#8211;103 on both normoxic and hypoxic cells. The in vitro data suggest that H&#8901; therapy is promising to overcome the challenge of tumor hypoxia at low doses of both photocatalyst and light. In addition, the capability of near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon excitation would benefit broad biological applications.

         <title>Subsurface Engineering Induced Fermi Level De&#8208;pinning in Metal Oxide Semiconductors for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of universal subsurface oxygen vacancy strategy, the surface Fermi level de&#8208;pinning in a series of metal oxide semiconductor are achieved while retaining the active defective structure. The completely splitted quasi Fermi level of holes and electrons induces enhanced open&#8208;circuit photovoltage, providing sufficient driving force for charge transfer, to achieve robust photoelectrochemical water splitting.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising approach for renewable solar light conversion. However, surface Fermi level pinning (FLP), caused by surface trap states, severely restricts the PEC activities. Theoretical calculations indicate subsurface oxygen vacancy (sub&#8208;Ov) could release the FLP and retain the active structure. A series of metal oxide semiconductors with sub&#8208;Ov were prepared through precisely regulated spin&#8208;coating and calcination. Etching X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and electron energy loss spectra (EELS) demonstrated Ov located at sub &#8764;2&#8211;5&#8197;nm region. Mott&#8211;Schottky and open circuit photovoltage results confirmed the surface trap states elimination and Fermi level de&#8208;pinning. Thus, superior PEC performances of 5.1, 3.4, and 2.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE were achieved on BiVO4, Bi2O3, TiO2 with outstanding stability for 72&#8197;h, outperforming most reported works under the identical conditions.

     alt="Subsurface Engineering Induced Fermi Level De-pinning in Metal Oxide Semiconductors for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By means of universal subsurface oxygen vacancy strategy, the surface Fermi level de-pinning in a series of metal oxide semiconductor are achieved while retaining the active defective structure. The completely splitted quasi Fermi level of holes and electrons induces enhanced open-circuit photovoltage, providing sufficient driving force for charge transfer, to achieve robust photoelectrochemical water splitting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising approach for renewable solar light conversion. However, surface Fermi level pinning (FLP), caused by surface trap states, severely restricts the PEC activities. Theoretical calculations indicate subsurface oxygen vacancy (sub-O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) could release the FLP and retain the active structure. A series of metal oxide semiconductors with sub-O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; were prepared through precisely regulated spin-coating and calcination. Etching X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and electron energy loss spectra (EELS) demonstrated O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; located at sub &#8764;2&#8211;5&#8197;nm region. Mott&#8211;Schottky and open circuit photovoltage results confirmed the surface trap states elimination and Fermi level de-pinning. Thus, superior PEC performances of 5.1, 3.4, and 2.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE were achieved on BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with outstanding stability for 72&#8197;h, outperforming most reported works under the identical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>H+&#8722;H&#8722; Pairs in Partially Oxidized MAX Phases for Bifunctional Catalytic Conversion of Furfurals into Linear Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated Lewis H+&#8722;H&#8722; pairs, generated in situ by hydrogen spillover on partially oxidized MAX phases, act as the hydrogenation sites for C=O hydrogenation and provide acid sites for ring opening. The close intimate hydrogenation and acid sites demonstrate unprecedented bifunctional catalytic performance for the conversion of furfurals.







Abstract
Currently, less favorable C=O hydrogenation and weak concerted acid catalysis cause unsatisfactory catalytic performance in the upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived furfurals (i.e., furfural, 5&#8208;methyl furfural, and 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural) to ketones (i.e., cyclopentanone, 2,5&#8208;hexanedione, and 1&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;hexanedione). A series of partially oxidized MAX phase (i.e., Ti3AlC2, Ti2AlC, Ti3SiC2) supporting Pd catalysts were fabricated, which showed high catalytic activity; Pd/Ti3AlC2 in particular displayed high performance for conversion of furfurals into targeted ketones. Detailed studies of the catalytic mechanism confirm that in situ hydrogen spillover generates Frustrated Lewis H+&#8722;H&#8722; pairs, which not only act as the hydrogenation sites for selective C=O hydrogenation but also provide acid sites for ring opening. The close intimate hydrogenation and acid sites promote bifunctional catalytic reactions, substantially reducing the reported minimum reaction temperature of various furfurals by at least 30&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Swelling&#8208;induced Mechanochromism in Multinetwork Polymers (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 9/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The swelling force exerted by solvents in polymer gels is revealed to trigger mechanochemical reactions, as reported by Takuma Watabe and Hideyuki Otsuka in their Research Article (e202216469). A multinetwork strategy based on sequential monomer swelling and polymerization processes makes the original network sensitive to mechanical stimuli. A slight volume expansion caused by swelling leads to the activation of mechanoresponsive linkers in the first network, exhibiting a notable color change.

         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized lasing with high dissymmetry factors has been realized in an organic&#8208;crystal&#8208;filled cavity without any chiral materials or structures, as reported by Qing Liao, Hongbing Fu, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202213229). The anisotropic refractive properties of two&#8208;dimensional organic single crystals lead to the Rashba&#8211;Dresselhaus effect inducing spin&#8208;splitting of cavity modes. The results provide a new idea for the design of CP lasers towards future 3D laser displays, information storage, and other fields.

DNA swingarms enable the efficient and reliable translocation of multiple optical elements along a shared DNA origami track. Na Liu et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Research Article (e202213992) that the dynamic rearrangement of AuNPs with large leaps in space can be facilitated by swinging motion, which is substantiated by distinct optical response changes.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The defined reticular lattice, precise structure of the active sites and the wide range of transition metals make MOF composites promising candidates as advanced electrocatalysts for a variety of reactions. However, electrical conductivity and stability issues are two main drawbacks that hinder their wide applicability at high current densities. The various strategies to circumvent the bottlenecks are described.







Abstract
Transition metal complexes are well&#8208;known homogeneous electrocatalysts. In this regard, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be considered as an ensemble of transition metal complexes ordered in a periodic arrangement. In addition, MOFs have several additional positive structural features that make them suitable for electrocatalysis, including large surface area, high porosity, and high content of accessible transition metal with exchangeable coordination positions. The present review describes the current state in the use of MOFs as electrocatalysts, both as host of electroactive guests and their direct electrocatalytic activity, particularly in the case of bimetallic MOFs. The field of MOF&#8208;derived materials is purposely not covered, focusing on the direct use of MOFs or its composites as electrocatalysts. Special attention has been paid to present strategies to overcome their poor electrical conductivity and limited stability.

         <title>Reverse Engineering Caged Compounds: Design Principles for their Application in Biology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caged compounds are optical probes in which biological signaling molecules are rendered inert by attachment of a photosensitive protecting group (PPG). Following Wittgenstein's dictum &#8220;Meaning is use&#8221;, the key features of such probes are deduced by consideration of the properties of the most widely used caged compounds that have been successfully applied to test numerous biological hypotheses.







Abstract
Light passes through biological tissue, and so it is used for imaging biological processes in situ. Such observation is part of the very essence of science, but mechanistic understanding requires intervention. For more than 50&#8197;years a &#8220;second function&#8221; for light has emerged; namely, that of photochemical control. Caged compounds are biologically inert signaling molecules that are activated by light. These optical probes enable external instruction of biological processes by stimulation of an individual element in complex signaling cascades in its native environment. Cause and effect are linked directly in spatial, temporal, and frequency domains in a quantitative manner by their use. I provide a guide to the basic properties required to make effective caged compounds for the biological sciences.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries: Towards Harnessing their Full Power with Darwinian Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking cues from Darwinian evolution, is it possible to apply molecular evolution to drug&#8208;like molecules? This Review covers technologies for the synthesis of DNA&#8208;encoded libraries enabling translation of the DNA code into synthetic products, explores the different selection format, and discusses how these can be brought together to evolve synthetic molecules with Darwinian selection pressure.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technologies are transforming the drug discovery process, enabling the identification of ligands at unprecedented speed and scale. DEL makes use of libraries that are orders of magnitude larger than traditional high&#8208;throughput screens. While a DNA tag alludes to a genotype&#8211;phenotype connection that is exploitable for molecular evolution, most of the work in the field is performed with libraries where the tag serves as an amplifiable barcode but does not allow &#8220;translation&#8221; into the synthetic product it is linked to. In this Review, we cover technologies that enable the &#8220;translation&#8221; of the genetic tag into synthetic molecules, both biochemically and chemically, and explore how it can be used to harness Darwinian evolutionary pressure.

         <title>The Asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Amination Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric version of the Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig reaction has been developed as a powerful asymmetric&#8208;catalysis tool bolstered by the great success of its achiral version in the pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis fields. This review showcases research into the use of the asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig reaction for constructing centered, axial, and planar chiralities. A brief overview of the chemistry is also provided based on this research.







Abstract
Over the past few decades, the Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig reaction has emerged as a powerful tool for forging C&#8722;N bonds, and has been vital to the pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis fields. However, asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination reactions for constructing centered chirality, planar chirality, and axial chirality remain in their infancy owing to limited substrate scope and laggard ligand design. The recent surge in interest in the synthesis of C&#8722;N/N&#8722;N atropisomers, has witnessed a renaissance in asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination chemistry as the first practical protocol for the preparation of C&#8722;N atropisomers. This review highlights reported asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination protocols and provides a brief overview of their chemical practicality.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Machine Learning for Understanding Surface Structures of Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous catalytic reactions occur at the surface of catalysts. The catalyst surface structure is highly complex and changes with reaction conditions and surrounding micro&#8208;environment. This Minireviewsummarizes recent progress in using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art data&#8208;driven machine&#8208;learning (ML) to accelerate the research in heterogeneous catalyst surface by assisting catalysis experiments, in&#8208;situ characterizations, and operando computational simulations.







Abstract
The design of heterogeneous catalysts is necessarily surface&#8208;focused, generally achieved via optimization of adsorption energy and microkinetic modelling. A prerequisite is to ensure the adsorption energy is physically meaningful is the stable existence of the conceived active&#8208;site structure on the surface. The development of improved understanding of the catalyst surface, however, is challenging practically because of the complex nature of dynamic surface formation and evolution under in&#8208;situ reactions. We propose therefore data&#8208;driven machine&#8208;learning (ML) approaches as a solution. In this Minireview we summarize recent progress in using machine&#8208;learning to search and predict (meta)stable structures, assist operando simulation under reaction conditions and micro&#8208;environments, and critically analyze experimental characterization data. We conclude that ML will become the new norm to lower costs associated with discovery and design of optimal heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Immuno&#8208;Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging Identifies Functional Macromolecules by Using Microdroplet&#8208;Cleavable Mass Tags</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;microdroplet&#8208;cleavable, bifunctional boronate mass tags are introduced to conduct cell&#8208;resolved immunofluorescence imaging followed by multiplex immuno&#8208;desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging.







Abstract
We present immunoassay&#8208;based desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (immuno&#8208;DESI&#8208;MSI) to visualize functional macromolecules such as drug targets and cascade signaling factors. A set of boronic acid mass tags (BMTs) were synthesized to label antibodies as MSI probes. The boronic ester bond is employed to cross&#8208;link the BMT with the galactosamine&#8208;modified antibody. The BMT can be released from its tethered antibody by ultrafast cleavage of the boronic ester bond caused by the acidic condition of sprayed DESI microdroplets containing water. The fluorescent moiety enables the BMT to work in both optical and MS imaging modes. The positively charged quaternary ammonium group enhances the ionization efficiency. The introduction of the boron element also makes mass tags readily identified because of its unique isotope pattern. Immuno&#8208;DESI&#8208;MSI provides an appealing strategy to spatially map macromolecules beyond what can be observed by conventional DESI&#8208;MSI, provided antibodies are available to the targeted molecules of interest.

         <title>Springtail&#8208;inspired Light&#8208;driven Soft Jumping Robots Based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers with Monolithic Three&#8208;leaf Panel Fold Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A springtail&#8208;inspired light&#8208;driven monolithic soft robot is constructed using a double&#8208;folded liquid crystal elastomer ribbon with a three&#8208;leaf panel fold structure. This easy&#8208;to&#8208;manufacture double&#8208;folded ribbon jumping robot delivers excellent jump performance, with the highest jumping height, longest jumping distance, and maximum take&#8208;off velocity reaching 87&#8197;body length (BL), 65&#8197;BL, and 930&#8197;BL&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Jump is an important form of motion that enables animals to escape from predators, increase their range of activities, and better adapt to the environment. Inspired by springtails, we describe a light&#8208;driven soft jumping robot based on a double&#8208;folded liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) ribbon actuator with a monolithic three&#8208;leaf panel fold structure. This robot can achieve remarkable jumping height, jumping distance, and maximum take&#8208;off velocity, of up to 87&#8197;body length (BL), 65&#8197;BL, and 930&#8197;BL&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. Further, it is possible to control the height, distance, and direction of jump by changing the size and crease angle of the double&#8208;folded LCE ribbon actuators. These robots can efficiently jump over obstacles and can jump continuously, even in complex environments. Our simple design strategy improves the performance of jumping actuators and we expect it to have a wide&#8208;ranging impact on the strength, continuity, and adaptability of future soft robots.

         <title>Discrete Molecular Copper(II) Complex for Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Above Room&#8208;Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the discrete molecular ferroelectric complex [Cu (L&#8208;phe) (bpy) (H2O)]PF6&#8901;H2O (1) (Tc=350&#8197;K) with a large piezoelectric co&#8208;efficient (d33=10&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1), is exploited for piezoelectric energy harvesting. Among the devices prepared with the composite films of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and various weight % composition of 1, the 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% composite shows an output current of 5&#8197;&#956;A is which is the highest for any discrete inorganic complex reported so far.







Abstract
Developing robust, wearable, and biocompatible energy harvesting devices with bulk oxides (ceramics and perovskites) is extremely hard to achieve due to their zero mechanical flexibility, heavy metal toxicity, and tunability of properties. Alternatively, discrete inorganic complexes can be an excellent choice to overcome the above&#8208;stated issues, thanks to appropriate molecular engineering. Herein, we report an above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric discrete molecular complex [Cu(L&#8208;phe)(bpy)(H2O)]PF6&#8901;H2O (1) which is suitable for piezoelectric energy harvesting due to its large values of piezoelectric co&#8208;efficient (d33=10&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1) and spontaneous polarization (Ps=1.3&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Among the devices prepared with the composite films of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and various weight % composition of 1, the 10&#8197;Wt&#8201;% composite shows the highest output voltage of 8&#8197;V, a power density of 0.85&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and output current of 5&#8197;&#956;A, which is highest for any discrete inorganic complex reported to date.

         <title>Ligand Hybridization for Electro&#8208;reforming Waste Glycerol into Isolable Oxalate and Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybridizing chelating phenanthrolines with heterogeneous nickel hydroxides can efficiently tune the glycerol electrooxidation selectivities via controlling the catalyst electronic states. The selectivities almost linearly scale with the Hammett parameters of the functional groups on the phenanthrolines, creating new rationales for the design of selective catalysts.







Abstract
The electro&#8208;reforming of glycerol is an emerging technology of simultaneous hydrogen production and biomass valorization. However, its complex reaction network and limited catalyst tunability restrict the precise steering toward high selectivity. Herein, we incorporated the chelating phenanthrolines into the bulk nickel hydroxide and tuned the electronic properties by installing functional groups, yielding tunable selectivity toward formate (max 92.7&#8201;%) and oxalate (max 45.3&#8201;%) with almost linear correlation with the Hammett parameters. Further combinatory study of intermediate analysis and various spectroscopic techniques revealed the electronic effect of tailoring the valence band that balances between C&#8722;C cleavage and oxidation through the key glycolaldehyde intermediate. A two&#8208;electrode electro&#8208;reforming setup using the 5&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;nickel hydroxide catalyst was further established to convert crude glycerol into pure H2 and isolable sodium oxalate with high efficiency.

         <title>Controlling the Photofunctionality of a Polyanionic Heteroleptic Copper(I) Photosensitizer for CO2 Reduction Using Its Ion&#8208;pair Formation with Polycationic Ammonium in Aqueous Media</title>

A trianionic diimine diphosphine copper (I) photosensitizer [CuI (N^N) (P^P)]3&#8722; forms a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ion&#8208;pair adduct with alkyl ammonium dications (hexamethonium; HM2+) leading to suppress the water solvates in water to largely prevent the non&#8208;radiative decay process. The resulting long lifetime of the triplet together with the improved electron transfer efficiency is discussed on the basis of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble trianionic heteroleptic copper(I) photosensitizer having four sulfonate groups (CuPS3&#8722;) was found to afford the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ion&#8208;pair adduct with dicationic alkylammonium (hexamethonium) cations (HM2+) in aqueous media, leading to exhibit excellent photophysical and photocatalytic performances owing to the substantial suppression of water&#8208;derived non&#8208;radiative decay of the photoexcited state.

         <title>Intense d&#8208;p Hybridization in Nb3O15 Tripolymer Induced the Largest Second Harmonic Generation Response and Birefringence in Germanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>

K3Nb3Ge2O13 is shown to be an excellent nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal with the largest second harmonic generation (SHG) response and birefringence found in germinates, as well as a large band gap and low phonon energy.







Abstract
We herein report two asymmetric germanate crystals, KNbGe3O9 and K3Nb3Ge2O13, with different structures and optical properties derived from divergent polymerized forms of GeO4 and NbO6 groups. Remarkably, K3Nb3Ge2O13 achieved a rare combination of the strongest second harmonic generation (SHG) response of 17.5&#215;KDP&#8201;@&#8201;1064&#8197;nm and the largest birefringence of 0.196&#8201;@&#8201;546&#8197;nm in germanates. It features unique [Nb3O12]&#8734; tubular chains constructed by circular Nb3O15 tripolymers. Theoretical calculations reveal that the d&#8208;p interactions in the Nb3O15 group are responsible for outstanding optical properties. This work emphasizes the significance of the polymerizable functional units in obtaining high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals.

Herein, hydrogen&#8208;bond chemistry in 2, 7&#8208; diamino&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;tetraone (PTO&#8208;NH2) crystal structure is applied to inhibit the dissolution of small organic materials, which enables Li//PTO&#8208;NH2 battery with excellent cycling stability.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity small organic materials are plagued by their high solubility. Here we proposed constructing hydrogen bond networks (HBN) via intermolecular hydrogen bonds to suppress the solubility of active material. The illustrated 2, 7&#8208; diamino&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;tetraone (PTO&#8208;NH2) molecule with intermolecular hydrogen (H) bond between O in &#8722;C=O and H in &#8722;NH2, which make PTO&#8208;NH2 presents transverse two&#8208;dimensional extension and longitudinal &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking structure. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has tracked the reversible evolution of H&#8208;bonds, further confirming the existence of HBN structure can stabilize the intermediate 2&#8208;electron reaction state. Therefore, PTO&#8208;NH2 with HBN structure has higher active site utilization (95&#8201;%), better cycle stability and rate performance. This study uncovers the H&#8208;bond effect and evolution during the electrochemical process and provides a strategy for materials design.

         <title>Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H Functionalization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides with Thianthrenium Salts: Conjugation and Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with readily accessible and modular arylthianthrenium salts was investigated. The modular nature of this arylating agent allowed the expedient stitching of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with drug, natural product, and peptidic scaffolds by forging sterically congested biaryl linkages.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal late&#8208;stage diversification of structurally complex peptides bears enormous potential for drug discovery and molecular imaging, among other applications. Herein, we report on a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with readily accessible and modular arylthianthrenium salts. Under exceedingly mild reaction conditions, the late&#8208;stage diversification of structurally complex peptides was accomplished. The tunability and ease of preparation of arylthianthrenium salts allowed the expedient stitching of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with drug, natural product, and peptidic scaffolds by forging sterically congested biaryl linkages. The robustness of the palladium catalysis regime was reflected by the full tolerance of a plethora of sensitive and coordinating functional groups. Hence, our manifold enabled efficient access to highly decorated, labelled, conjugated, and ligated linear and cyclic peptides.

&lt;p&gt;Palladium-catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of tryptophan-containing peptides with readily accessible and modular arylthianthrenium salts was investigated. The modular nature of this arylating agent allowed the expedient stitching of tryptophan-containing peptides with drug, natural product, and peptidic scaffolds by forging sterically congested biaryl linkages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioorthogonal late-stage diversification of structurally complex peptides bears enormous potential for drug discovery and molecular imaging, among other applications. Herein, we report on a palladium-catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of tryptophan-containing peptides with readily accessible and modular arylthianthrenium salts. Under exceedingly mild reaction conditions, the late-stage diversification of structurally complex peptides was accomplished. The tunability and ease of preparation of arylthianthrenium salts allowed the expedient stitching of tryptophan-containing peptides with drug, natural product, and peptidic scaffolds by forging sterically congested biaryl linkages. The robustness of the palladium catalysis regime was reflected by the full tolerance of a plethora of sensitive and coordinating functional groups. Hence, our manifold enabled efficient access to highly decorated, labelled, conjugated, and ligated linear and cyclic peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Urethanases for the Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Low Molecular Weight Carbamates and the Recycling of Polyurethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We made a metagenome library and discovered urethanases that can hydrolyse a broad range of industrially relevant dicarbamates resulting from glycolysis of polyether&#8208;polyurethanes. This enables a two&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic recycling procedure consisting of glycolysis followed by enzymatic hydrolysis, allowing both the polyether polyols and the aromatic diamines to be recovered from polyether&#8208;polyurethane foams.







Abstract
Enzymatic degradation and recycling can reduce the environmental impact of plastics. Despite decades of research, no enzymes for the efficient hydrolysis of polyurethanes have been reported. Whereas the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in polyester&#8208;polyurethanes by cutinases is known, the urethane bonds in polyether&#8208;polyurethanes have remained inaccessible to biocatalytic hydrolysis. Here we report the discovery of urethanases from a metagenome library constructed from soil that had been exposed to polyurethane waste for many years. We then demonstrate the use of a urethanase in a chemoenzymatic process for polyurethane foam recycling. The urethanase hydrolyses low molecular weight dicarbamates resulting from chemical glycolysis of polyether&#8208;polyurethane foam, making this strategy broadly applicable to diverse polyether&#8208;polyurethane wastes.

         <title>Molecular Nickel Thiolate Complexes for Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to C1&#8211;3 Hydrocarbons</title>

A series of bioinspired molecular nickel thiolate complexes exhibit impressive electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction on carbon paper, with a Faradaic efficiency of 41&#8201;% for hydrocarbons. C3 hydrocarbons were reported for the first time from molecular complexes.







Abstract
We report the unprecedented electrocatalytic activity of a series of molecular nickel thiolate complexes (1&#8211;5) in reducing CO2 to C1&#8211;3 hydrocarbons on carbon paper in pH&#8208;neutral aqueous solutions. Ni(mpo)2 (3, mpo=2&#8208;mercaptopyridyl&#8208;N&#8208;oxide), Ni(pyS)3&#8722; (4, pyS=2&#8208;mercaptopyridine), and Ni(mp)2&#8722; (5, mp=2&#8208;mercaptophenolate) were found to generate C3 products from CO2 for the first time in molecular complex. Compound 5 exhibits Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of 10.6&#8201;%, 7.2&#8201;%, 8.2&#8201;% for C1, C2, C3 hydrocarbons respectively at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Addition of CO to the system significantly promotes the FEC1&#8211;C3 to 41.1&#8201;%, suggesting that a key Ni&#8722;CO intermediate is associated with catalysis. A variety of spectroscopies have been performed to show that the structures of nickel complexes remain intact during CO2 reduction.

         <title>Electrochemical Single&#8208;Cell Protein Therapeutics Using a Double&#8208;Barrel Nanopipette</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical single&#8208;cell protein therapeutics was devised with an engineered &#952;&#8208;nanopipette and exemplified by protein DJ&#8208;1 enabled neuroprotection. Upon DJ&#8208;1 injection through the delivery lumen, upregulation of the antioxidant protein could protect neural PC&#8208;12 cells against oxidative stress from phorbol myristate acetate exposure, as deduced by targeting of the cytosolic H2O2 by the detecting lumen.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell protein therapeutics is expected to promote our in&#8208;depth understanding of how a specific protein with a therapeutic dosage treats the cell without population averaging. However, it has not yet been tackled by current single&#8208;cell nanotools. We address this challenge by the use of a double&#8208;barrel nanopipette, in which one lumen was used for electroosmotic cytosolic protein delivery and the other was customized for ionic evaluation of the consequence. Upon injection of protein DJ&#8208;1 through the delivery lumen, upregulation of the antioxidant protein could protect neural PC&#8208;12 cells against oxidative stress from phorbol myristate acetate exposure, as deduced by targeting of the cytosolic hydrogen peroxide by the detecting lumen. The nanotool developed in this study for single&#8208;cell protein therapeutics provides a perspective for future single&#8208;cell therapeutics involving different therapeutic modalities, such as peptides, enzymes and nucleic acids.

         <title>Light Alters the NH3 vs N2H4 Product Profile in Iron&#8208;catalyzed Nitrogen Reduction via Dual Reactivity from an Iron Hydrazido (Fe=NNH2) Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light irradiation of a tris(phosphine)borane iron (P3BFe) catalyst system during nitrogen reduction (N2R) catalysis alters its product selectivity profile, producing significant N2H4 alongside NH3. Only trace N2H4 is otherwise produced. This study provides insight into the dominant factors determining the selectivity of this catalysis and implicates dual reactivity from a singlet ground versus a triplet excited state hydrazido (Fe=NNH2) intermediate.







Abstract
Whereas synthetically catalyzed nitrogen reduction (N2R) to produce ammonia is widely studied, catalysis to instead produce hydrazine (N2H4) has received less attention despite its considerable mechanistic interest. Herein, we disclose that irradiation of a tris(phosphine)borane (P3B) Fe catalyst, P3BFe+, significantly alters its product profile to increase N2H4 versus NH3; P3BFe+ is otherwise known to be highly selective for NH3. We posit a key terminal hydrazido intermediate, P3BFe=NNH2, as selectivity&#8208;determining. Whereas its singlet ground state undergoes protonation to liberate NH3, a low&#8208;lying triplet excited state leads to reactivity at N&#945; and formation of N2H4. Associated electrochemical and spectroscopic studies establish that N2H4 lies along a unique product pathway; NH3 is not produced from N2H4. Our findings are distinct from the canonical mechanism for hydrazine formation, which proceeds via a diazene (HN=NH) intermediate and showcase light as a tool to tailor selectivity.

         <title>Synthetic Receptors with Micromolar Affinity for Chloride in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 9, February 20, 2023. </description>

Water&#8208;soluble coordination cages have been obtained by the reaction of Pd (NO3)2 with 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene ligands featuring a short PEG chain. The Pd&#8208;based coordination cages are able to bind chloride in buffered aqueous solution with apparent binding constants exceeding 105&#8197;M&#8722;1.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble coordination cage was obtained by reaction of Pd(NO3)2 with a 1,3&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzene ligand featuring a short PEG chain. The cavity of the metal&#8208;organic cage contains one nitrate anion, which is readily replaced by chloride. The apparent association constant for chloride binding in buffered aqueous solution is Ka=1.8(&#177;0.1)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. This value is significantly higher than what has been reported for other macrocyclic chloride receptors. The heavier halides Br&#8722; and I&#8722; compete with binding or self&#8208;assembly, but the receptor displays very good selectivity over common anions such as phosphate, acetate, carbonate, and sulfate. A further increase of the chloride binding affinity by a factor of 3 was achieved using a fluorinated dipyridyl ligand.

         <title>ECNU&#8208;13: A High&#8208;Silica Zeolite with Three&#8208;Dimensional and High&#8208;Connectivity Multi&#8208;Pore Structures for Selective Alkene Cracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A high&#8208;silica zeolite ECNU&#8208;13 (Si/Al = 23) with a new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pore system and a nanosized morphology has been developed, consisting of multitudes of 10&#8208;membered ring (10&#8208;R) medium pores and one set of 8&#8208;R small pores. A phase&#8208;discrimination&#160;strategy was proposed to synthesize ECNU&#8208;13 by regulating the gel compositions and nucleation processes that were used for preparing 12&#8208;R large&#8208;pore germanosilicate IM&#8208;20 with the known UWY topology. The crystallization was directed towards forming one set of single four&#8208;ring (s4r) composite building units together with one set of double four&#8208;ring (d4r) rather than two different types of d4r units in IM&#8208;20. The electron crystallographic investigations elucidated that the ECNU&#8208;13 structure was composed of two kinds of polymorphs as a result of distinct atomic positionings in s4r units. In catalytic cracking of 1&#8208;butene, ECNU&#8208;13 exhibited high propene selectivity (55.6%) and propene to ethylene molar ratio (&gt; 4.7) superior to well&#8208;studied conventional ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalyst.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of alkane isomers is an important yet challenging process in the petrochemical industry. Being a crucial step to produce premium gasoline components as well as optimum ethylene feed, the current industrial separation by distillation is extremely energy intensive. Adsorptive separation based on zeolite is limited by insufficient adsorption capacity. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold enormous promise as alternative adsorbents due to their diverse structural tunability and exceptional porosity. Precise control of their pore geometry/dimensions has led to superior performance. In this minireview, we highlight the recent progresses in developing MOFs for the separation of C6 alkane isomers. Representative MOFs are reviewed based on their separation mechanisms. Emphasis is put on the material design rationale for achieving optimal separation capability. Finally, we briefly discuss the existing challenges, possible solutions, and future directions of this important field.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Iron Porphyrins Catalyze Enantioselective Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Amination Upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed for the chiral iron porphyrin catalyzed transformation of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides into chiral indolines and sultams, respectively. The reaction proceeds upon visible light irradiation and with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric amination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is appealing for synthetic applications due to the biocompatibility and high earth abundance of iron, but examples of such reactions are sparse. Herein we describe chiral iron complexes of meso&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;substituted&#8208;porphyrins that can catalyze asymmetric intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides to afford chiral indolines (29 examples) and benzofused cyclic sulfonamides (17 examples), respectively, with up to 93&#8201;% ee (yield: up to 99&#8201;%) using 410&#8197;nm light under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, for the reactions of arylsulfonyl azides reveal that the Fe(NSO2Ar) intermediate generated in situ under photochemical conditions reacts with the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond through a stepwise hydrogen atom transfer/radical rebound mechanism, with enantioselectivity arising from cooperative noncovalent interactions between the Fe(NSO2Ar) unit and the peripheral substituents of the chiral porphyrin scaffold.

         <title>Preferential Adsorption of Ethylene Oxide on Fe and Chlorine on Ni Enabled Scalable Electrosynthesis of Ethylene Chlorohydrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preferential adsorption of ethylene oxide on Fe and chlorine on Ni enable electrosynthesis of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) with high conversion and selectivity. Scalable production of 185.1&#8197;mmol of ECH with 92.5&#8201;% yield at 55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;h, paired synthesis of ECH and 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylicacid (an herbicide), and successful fabrication of a series of other chloro&#8208; and bromoethanols highlight the potential utilities.







Abstract
Industrial manufacturing of ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) critically requires excess corrosive hydrochloric acid or hypochlorous acid with dealing with massive by&#8208;products and wastes. Here we report a green and efficient electrosynthesis of ECH from ethylene oxide (EO) with NaCl over a NiFe2O4 nanosheet anode. Theoretical results suggest that EO and Cl preferentially adsorb on Fe and Ni sites, respectively, collaboratively promoting the ECH synthesis. A Cl radical&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening process is proposed and confirmed, and the key Cl and carbon radical species are identified by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. This strategy can enable scalable electrosynthesis of 185.1&#8197;mmol of ECH in 1&#8197;h with 92.5&#8201;% yield at a 55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density. Furthermore, a series of other chloro&#8208; and bromoethanols with good to high yields and paired synthesis of ECH and 4&#8208;amino&#8208;3,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylicacid via respectively loading and unloading Cl are achieved, showing the promising potential of this strategy.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Radical 1,2&#8208;Carbophosphonylation of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective radical 1,2&#8208;carbophosphonylation of styrenes from readily available alkyl halides and dialkyl phosphites is developed. The key to the success of the strategy lies in not only the proper choosing of phosphorus reagents to suppress the reverse chemoselectivity but also the utilization of a chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligand to forge chiral C(sp3)&#8722;P bond.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective radical difunctionalization of alkenes from readily available alkyl halides and organophosphorus reagents possessing a P&#8722;H bond provides an appealing approach for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral alkyl phosphorus compounds. The major challenge arises from the easy generation of a P&#8208;centered radical from the P&#8722;H&#8208;type reagent and its facile addition to the terminal side of alkenes, leading to reverse chemoselectivity. We herein disclose a radical 1,2&#8208;carbophosphonylation of styrenes in a highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective manner. The key to the success lies in not only the implementation of dialkyl phosphites with a strong bond dissociation energy to promote the desired chemoselectivity but also the utilization of an anionic chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligand to forge the chiral C(sp3)&#8722;P bond. The developed Cu/N,N,N&#8208;ligand catalyst has enriched our library of single&#8208;electron transfer catalysts in the enantioselective radical transformations.

Precise and ultrafast ion sieving is highly desirable for versatile applications in environment&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and resource&#8208;related fields.

Abstract
Precise and ultrafast ion sieving is highly desirable for many applications in environment&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and resource&#8208;related fields. The development of a permselective lamellar membrane constructed from parallel stacked two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets opened a new avenue for the development of next&#8208;generation separation technology because of the unprecedented diversity of the designable interior nanochannels. In this Review, we first discuss the construction of homo&#8208; and heterolaminar nanoarchitectures from the starting materials to the emerging preparation strategies. We then explore the property&#8211;performance relationships, with a particular emphasis on the effects of physical structural features, chemical properties, and external environment stimuli on ion transport behavior under nanoconfinement. We also present existing and potential applications of 2D membranes in desalination, ion recovery, and energy conversion. Finally, we discuss the challenges and outline research directions in this promising field.

         <title>Halide Layer Cathodes for Compatible and Fast&#8208;Charged Halides&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithium intercalation chemistry in layered VX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) enabled by compatible halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes was explored for the first time. The electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial stability can be achieved in a thermodynamic manner instead of a passivation process, ensured by the good chemical stability between the VX3 cathode and halide electrolytes as well as the wide electrochemical stability windows.







Abstract
Insertion&#8208;type compounds based on oxides and sulfides have been widely identified and well&#8208;studied as cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, halides have rarely been used due to their high solubility in organic liquid electrolytes. Here, we reveal the insertion electrochemistry of VX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) by introducing a compatible halide solid&#8208;state electrolyte with a wide electrochemical stability window. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure analyses reveal a two&#8208;step lithiation process and the structural transition of typical VCl3. Fast Li+ insertion/extraction in the layered VX3 active materials and favorable interface guaranteed by the compatible electrode&#8208;electrolyte design enables high rate capability and stable operation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;VX3 batteries. The findings from this study will contribute to developing intercalation insertion electrochemistry of halide materials and exploring novel electrode materials in viable energy storage systems.

         <title>The Rise of Trichlorides Enabling an Improved Chlorine Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine is an indispensable base chemical that is used to produce numerous materials. To enable the chlorine industry to harvest renewable energies, a safe chlorine storage is of central importance. More recently, trichlorides, [Cl3]&#8722;, have evolved to a key technique for the storage of chlorine and for important chlorination reactions. In this minireview, the potential of trichlorides for academic research and the chlorine industry are outlined.







Abstract
Chlorine plays a central role for the industrial production of numerous materials with global relevance. More recently, polychlorides have been evolved from an area of academic interest to a research topic with enormous industrial potential. In this minireview, the value of trichlorides for chlorine storage and chlorination reactions are outlined. Particularly, the inexpensive ionic liquid [NEt3Me][Cl3] shows a similar and sometimes even advantageous reactivity compared to chlorine gas, while offering a superior safety profile. Used as a chlorine storage, [NEt3Me][Cl3] could help to overcome the current limitations of storing and transporting chlorine in larger quantities. Thus, trichlorides could become a key technique for the flexibilization of the chlorine production enabling an exploitation of renewable, yet fluctuating, electrical energy. As the loaded storage, [NEt3Me][Cl3], is a proven chlorination reagent, it could directly be employed for downstream processes, paving the path to a more practical and safer chlorine industry.

         <title>A Tetrahedral Bisacridine Donor Enables Fast Radiative Decay in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bisacridine donor enables both quasi&#8208;equatorial and quasi&#8208;axial geometries in TADF emitter, ensuring an efficient reversed intersystem crossing and an enhanced radiative decay, which results in high&#8208;performance OLEDs.







Abstract
Achieving high efficiency and low efficiency roll&#8208;off simultaneously is of great significance for further application of thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters. A balance between radiative decay and reversed intersystem crossing must be carefully established. Herein, we propose a qunolino&#8208;acridine (QAc) donor composing two acridine with both planar (pAc) and bended (bAc) geometries. Combining with triazine, a TADF emitter QAc&#8208;TRZ is assembled. The pAc provides a well interaction with triazine which ensures a decent TADF behavior, while the bAc offers a delocalization of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) which guarantees an enhancement of radiative decay. Remarkably, QAc&#8208;TRZ enables a highly efficient organic light emitting diode (OLED) with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3&#8201;%. More importantly, the efficiencies under 100/1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 stay 36.3&#8201;% and 31.7&#8201;%, respectively, and remain 21.5&#8201;% even under 10&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Atomic Structural Origin of Fictive Temperature Revealed by AZnP3O9 (A=K, Rb) Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new evaluation method is provided to judge the glass stability and glass&#8208;forming ability. As an example, the reported novel glass KZnP3O9 exhibits the highest &#948; (&#948;=1, nglass=8) that quantitatively identifies the short&#8208;range order similarity to its crystalline counterpart. The inverse &#948;&#8208;Tf correlation gives the direct evidence for the structural origin of fictive temperature revealing the relaxation thermodynamics.







Abstract
The fictive temperature (Tf) is widely applied to understand the relaxation thermodynamics of a glass; however, its atomic structural origin is still unclear. Here, we report two novel AZnP3O9 glasses obtained by melting the composition identical single crystals. These glasses exhibit structural inheritance within 5&#8197;&#197; from the single crystal counterparts that is quantified by &#948;=nglass/ncry (0&#8804;&#948;&#8804;1, n is the number of pair correlation functions). Among the available glass&#8208;formers, glassKZnP3O9 exhibits the highest structural inheritance (&#948;=1, nglass=8). More insightfully, a reverse correlation between &#948; and the relaxation thermodynamic parameters is observed in glassAZnP3O9, revealing for the first time the atomic structural origin of fictive temperature.

         <title>Structural Determination and Chemical Synthesis of the N&#8208;Glycan from the Hyperthermophilic Archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation, structural determination, and chemical synthesis of an N&#8208;glycan from the hyper&#8208;thermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis are reported. The identified N&#8208;glycan possesses a highly glycosylated myo&#8208;inositol moiety, which is linked to a disaccharide unit through a phosphodiester. Although myo&#8208;inositol is ubiquitous in archaea and eukaryotes, inositol&#8208;containing N&#8208;glycans were unknown until now.







Abstract
Asparagine&#8208;linked protein glycosylations (N&#8208;glycosylations) are one of the most abundant post&#8208;translational modifications and are essential for various biological phenomena. Herein, we describe the isolation, structural determination, and chemical synthesis of the N&#8208;glycan from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis. The N&#8208;glycan from the organism possesses a unique structure including myo&#8208;inositol, which has not been found in previously characterized N&#8208;glycans. In this structure, myo&#8208;inositol is highly glycosylated and linked with a disaccharide unit through a phosphodiester. The straightforward synthesis of this glycan was accomplished through diastereoselective phosphorylation and phosphodiester construction by SN2 coupling. Considering the early divergence of hyperthermophilic organisms in evolution, this study can be expected to open the door to approaching the primitive function of glycan modification at the molecular level.

         <title>Chemical Enhancement and Quenching in Single&#8208;Molecule Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We find that the tip&#8208;molecule point contact can dramatically enhance the molecular tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) signal via a combined physico&#8208;chemical mechanism induced by the ground&#8208;state charge transfer (GSCT). In contrast, the TERS signal from a planar molecule chemisorbed flatly on the silver substrate is significantly quenched, mainly due to the polarizability screening induced by the interfacial dynamic charge transfer (IDCT).







Abstract
Despite intensive research in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), the influence mechanism of chemical effects on Raman signals remains elusive. Here, we investigate such chemical effects through tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) of a single planar ZnPc molecule with varying but controlled contact environments. TERS signals are found dramatically enhanced upon making a tip&#8211;molecule point contact. A combined physico&#8208;chemical mechanism is proposed to explain such an enhancement via the generation of a ground&#8208;state charge&#8208;transfer induced vertical Raman polarizability that is further enhanced by the strong vertical plasmonic field in the nanocavity. In contrast, TERS signals from ZnPc chemisorbed flatly on substrates are found strongly quenched, which is rationalized by the Raman polarizability screening effect induced by interfacial dynamic charge transfer. Our results provide deep insights into the understanding of the chemical effects in TERS/SERS enhancement and quenching.

         <title>Enabled Efficient Ammonia Synthesis and Energy Supply in a Zinc&#8211;Nitrate Battery System by Separating Nitrate Reduction Process into Two Stages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the efficient electrocatalytic conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3, a two&#8208;stage process following the [2+6]&#8208;electron pathway is proposed inspired by biological nitrate respiration. This system produces NO2&#8722; and NH3 at low overpotentials (&gt;+0.1 vs. RHE), resulting in a low energy consumption of 17.7&#8197;kWh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for NH3 production and high energy density of 566.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery.







Abstract
The aqueous electrocatalytic reduction of NO3&#8722; into NH3 (NitrRR) presents a sustainable route applicable to NH3 production and potentially energy storage. However, the NitrRR involves a directly eight&#8208;electron transfer process generally required a large overpotential (&lt;&#8722;0.2&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) to reach optimal efficiency. Here, inspired by biological nitrate respiration, the NitrRR was separated into two stages along a [2+6]&#8208;electron pathway to alleviate the kinetic barrier. The system employed a Cu nanowire catalyst produces NO2&#8722; and NH3 with current efficiencies of 91.5&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively at lower overpotentials (&gt;+0.1 vs. RHE). The high efficiency for such a reduction process was further explored in a zinc&#8208;nitrate battery. This battery could be specified by a high output voltage of 0.70&#8197;V, an average energy density of 566.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a power density of 14.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is well beyond all previously reported similar concepts.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at low overpotentials (&amp;gt;+0.1 &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. RHE), resulting in a low energy consumption of 17.7&#8197;kWh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production and high energy density of 566.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for Zn&#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; battery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aqueous electrocatalytic reduction of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (NitrRR) presents a sustainable route applicable to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production and potentially energy storage. However, the NitrRR involves a directly eight-electron transfer process generally required a large overpotential (&amp;lt;&#8722;0.2&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (&lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. RHE)) to reach optimal efficiency. Here, inspired by biological nitrate respiration, the NitrRR was separated into two stages along a [2+6]-electron pathway to alleviate the kinetic barrier. The system employed a Cu nanowire catalyst produces NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with current efficiencies of 91.5&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively at lower overpotentials (&amp;gt;+0.1 &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. RHE). The high efficiency for such a reduction process was further explored in a zinc-nitrate battery. This battery could be specified by a high output voltage of 0.70&#8197;V, an average energy density of 566.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a power density of 14.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is well beyond all previously reported similar concepts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8220;Pore&#8208;Hopping&#8221; Ion Transport in Cellulose&#8208;Based Separator Towards High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immersion curing of a cellulose&#8208;based separators (CP) with poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) results in a cellulose&#8208;based composite separator (CP@PPC) for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The &#8220;pore&#8208;hopping&#8221; ion transport mechanism in CP@PPC allows a high Na+ transference number. PPC enhances the mechanical properties of the separator and the battery thermal safety, further promotes ion transport and improves the overall performance of the battery.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Cellulose is an attractive material for sustainable separators, but some key issues still exist affecting its application. Herein, a cellulose&#8208;based composite separator (CP@PPC) was prepared by immersion curing of cellulose&#8208;based separators (CP) with poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC). With the assistance of PPC, the CP@PPC separator is able to operate the cell stably at high voltages (up to 4.95&#8197;V). The &#8220;pore&#8208;hopping&#8221; ion transport mechanism in CP@PPC opens up extra Na+ migration paths, resulting in a high Na+ transference number (0.613). The separator can also tolerate folding, bending and extreme temperature under certain circumstances. Full cells with CP@PPC reveal one&#8208;up capacity retention (96.97&#8201;%) at 2C after 500 cycles compared to cells with CP. The mechanism highlights the merits of electrolyte analogs in separator modification, making a rational design for durable devices in advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Induced Spin State Switching in an FeIII Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversible proton&#8208;induced spin state switching of an FeIII complex in solution is observed at room temperature. A reversible magnetic response was detected in the complex, [FeIII(sal2323)]ClO4 (1), using Evans&#8217; method 1H NMR spectroscopy which indicated cumulative switching from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin upon addition of one and two equivalents of acid. Infrared spectroscopy suggests a coordination&#8208;induced spin state switching (CISSS) effect, whereby protonation displaces the metal&#8208;phenoxo donors. The analogous complex, [FeIII(4&#8208;NEt2&#8208;sal2323)]ClO4 (2), with a diethylamino group on the ligand, was used to combine the magnetic change with a colorimetric response. Comparison of the protonation responses of 1 and 2 reveals that the magnetic switching is caused by perturbation of the immediate coordination sphere of the complex. These complexes constitute a new class of analyte sensor which operate by magneto&#8208;modulation, and in the case of 2 also yield a colorimetric response.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Carbon Monoxide Electroreduction to &gt;1 A&#183;cm&#8208;2 C2+ Products Using Copper Catalysts Dispersed on MgAl Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheet House&#8722;of&#8722;Cards Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu catalysts are most apt for reducing CO(2) to multi&#8208;carbon products in aqueous electrolytes. To enhance the product yield, we can increase the overpotential and the catalyst mass loading. However, these approaches can cause inadequate mass transport of the CO(2) to the catalytic sites, which will then lead to H2 evolution dominating the product selectivity. Herein, we use a MgAl LDH nanosheet &#8216;house&#8208;of&#8208;cards&#8217; scaffold to disperse CuO&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu). With this support&#8208;catalyst design, at &#8722;0.7 VRHE, CO could be reduced to C2+ products with a current density (jC2+) of &#8722;1251 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2. This is 14&#215; that of the jC2+ shown by unsupported OD&#8208;Cu. The current densities of C2+ alcohols and C2H4 were also high at &#8722;369 and &#8722;816 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 respectively. We propose that the porosity of the LDH nanosheet scaffold enhances CO diffusion through the Cu sites. The CO reduction rate can thus be increased, while minimizing H2 evolution, even when high catalyst loadings and large overpotentials are used.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles: Straightforward Access to Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Polyaromatics from s&#8208;Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The straightforward access to a new class of aza&#8208;polyaromatics is reported starting from fluorinated s&#8208;tetrazine. The tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles display solid&#8208;state &#960;&#8208;stacking, low reduction potential, absorption in the visible range up to the near&#8208;infrared and intense fluorescence, depending on the molecular structure.







Abstract
The straightforward access to a new class of aza&#8208;polyaromatics is reported. Starting from readily available fluorinated s&#8208;tetrazine, a cyclization process with azide leads to the formation of an unprecedented tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazole or a bis&#8208;tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazole (cis and trans conformers). Based on the new nitrogen core, further N&#8208;directed palladium&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization allows the introduction of halides or acetates. The physicochemical properties of these compounds were studied by a joint experimental/theoretical approach. The tetrazo[1,2&#8208;b]indazoles display solid&#8208;state &#960;&#8208;stacking, low reduction potential, absorption in the visible range up to the near&#8208;infrared, and intense fluorescence, depending on the molecular structure.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Formal Double C&#8722;H Oxidation of Prenylated Molecules to Alkylidene Oxetanes and Azetidines by Strain&#8208;Enabled Cross&#8208;Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant, mild, formal double C&#8722;H oxidation protocol has been developed that can be used for the selective late&#8208;stage derivatization of prenylated compounds and natural products. This exocyclic&#8208;strain&#8208;driven cross&#8208;metathesis protocol allows the efficient coupling of highly substituted and electron&#8208;rich olefins.







Abstract
Prenylation is a ubiquitous late&#8208;stage modification in nature that often confers significantly improved bioactivity for secondary metabolites. While this lipophilic modification renders enhanced potency, the lipophilic tag(s) can diminish bioavailability and adversely alter drug transportation and metabolism. Thus, a functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant, mild, and selective late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of prenyl tags would present a great potential in drug discovery programs but could also impact other fields, such as agrochemistry and chemical biology. Herein we report an exocyclic&#8208;strain&#8208;driven cross&#8208;metathesis reaction of prenyl tags, a formal double C&#8722;H oxidation protocol, that can be used for the selective late&#8208;stage derivatization of prenylated compounds and natural products. This methodology avoids the need for prefunctionalization of target molecules and affords ready access to an unprecedented library of oxo&#8208; and aza&#8208;prenylated complex molecules. Thus, in a broader context, this methodology extends late&#8208;stage functionalization beyond that available to nature.

         <title>Tandem Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on MBenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MBenes are demonstrated to be a new class of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR). Taking FeB2 as the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept paradigm, mechanistic studies unveil that the synergistic tandem effect of Fe and B atoms promotes NO3&#8722; activation and intermediate hydrogenation to enhance the NO3RR activity and selectivity.







Abstract
We demonstrate the great feasibility of MBenes as a new class of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR). As a proof of concept, FeB2 is first employed as a model MBene catalyst for the NO3RR, showing a maximum NH3&#8208;Faradaic efficiency of 96.8&#8201;% with a corresponding NH3 yield of 25.5&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE. Mechanistic studies reveal that the exceptional NO3RR activity of FeB2 arises from the tandem catalysis mechanism, that is, B sites activate NO3&#8722; to form intermediates, while Fe sites dissociate H2O and increase *H supply on B sites to promote the intermediate hydrogenation and enhance the NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion.

         <title>Influencing Factors on Li&#8208;ion Conductivity and Interfacial Stability of Solid Polymer Electrolytes, Exampled by Polycarbonates, Polyoxalates and Polymalonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three families of ester&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes of polycarbonate, polyoxalate and polymalonate were prepared and investigated on their Li+&#8208;conductivity and antioxidation ability, demonstrating the performances of solid polymer electrolytes are affected by the coordinating capability with Li+, molecular asymmetry and existing modes of elemental F.







Abstract
The application of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state(ASS) batteries is hindered by lower Li+&#8208;conductivity and narrower electrochemical window. Here, three families of ester&#8208;based F&#8208;modified SPEs of poly&#8208;carbonate (PCE), poly&#8208;oxalate (POE) and poly&#8208;malonate (PME) were investigated. The Li+&#8208;conductivity of these SPEs prepared from pentanediol are all higher than the counterparts made of butanediol, owing to the enhanced asymmetry and flexibility. Because of stronger chelating coordination with Li+, the Li+&#8208;conductivity of PME and POE is around 10 and 5&#8197;times of PCE. The trifluoroacetyl&#8208;units are observed more effective than &#8722;O&#8722;CH2&#8722;CF2&#8722;CF2&#8722;CH2&#8722;O&#8722; during the in situ passivation of Li&#8208;metal. Using trifluoroacetyl terminated POE and PCE as SPE, the interfaces with Li&#8208;metal and high&#8208;voltage&#8208;cathode are stabilized simultaneously, endowing stable cycling of ASS Li/LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cells. Owing to an enol isomerization of malonate, the cycling stability of Li/PME/NCM622 is deteriorated, which is recovered with the introduce of dimethyl&#8208;group in malonate and the suppression of enol isomerization. The coordinating capability with Li+, molecular asymmetry and existing modes of elemental F, are all critical for the molecular design of SPEs.

         <title>Stacking Cyclophanes into Chiral Microvessels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights a recent study by Oki and colleagues on stacking bespoke chiral cyclophanes via non&#8208;covalent interactions that enable to craft synchronous crystalline 3D chiral microvessels with controlled orientation and conformational arrangements without the help of a template. The microvessels bear stereocontrolled skeletal morphology, recognize stereoisomers, and serve as containers; represnets a remarkable illustration of molecular engineering.







Abstract
Engineering novel micro&#8208;/nanoscale systems and devices based on supramolecular assembly has tremendous potential from diverse applications perspective. However, controlling the size, shape, spatial arrangements, and hierarchical transcription by a dimensional organizing principle (1D&#8211;3D arrangement) without the help of templates remains a challenging task. In this vein, a recent study by Oki and colleagues reporting the stacking of chiral cyclophanes via intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions for crafting synchronous microcrystalline 3D chiral vessels with controlled conformational arrangements represents a truly remarkable illustration of molecular engineering. The microvessels bear stereocontrolled skeletal morphology, recognize stereoisomers and serve as containers to accommodate microcrystals, polymer particles, and fluorescent dyes. The full application scope of this fascinating research is far beyond non&#8208;covalent interactions, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, and crystal engineering.

         <title>Tetranuclear CuII Cluster as the Ten Node Building Unit for the Construction of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ten&#8208;connected tetranuclear copper&#8208;based cluster node of [Cu4(PO3)2(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)2(CO2)4] formed by the organic ligand of H4L (3,5&#8208; dicarboxyphenylphosphonic acid) leads to a novel metal&#8211;organic framework FJU&#8208;112. BPE (1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane) divides the larger pore space of FJU&#8208;112 into a structure with smaller aperture size and infinite cages which greatly enhances the adsorption and selective separation performance for C2H2/CO2 mixtures.







Abstract
Rational design of high nuclear copper cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks has not been established yet. Herein, we report a novel MOF (FJU&#8208;112) with the ten&#8208;connected tetranuclear copper cluster [Cu4(PO3)2(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)2(CO2)4] as the node which was capped by the deprotonated organic ligand of H4L (3,5&#8208;Dicarboxyphenylphosphonic acid). With BPE (1,2&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane) as the pore partitioner, the pore spaces in the structure of FJU&#8208;112 were divided into several smaller cages and smaller windows for efficient gas adsorption and separation. FJU&#8208;112 exhibits a high separation performance for the C2H2/CO2 separation, which were established by the temperature&#8208;dependent sorption isotherms and further confirmed by the lab&#8208;scale dynamic breakthrough experiments. The grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) studies show that its high C2H2/CO2 separation performance is contributed to the strong &#960;&#8208;complexation interactions between the C2H2 molecules and framework pore surfaces, leading to its more C2H2 uptakes over CO2 molecules.

&lt;p&gt;The ten-connected tetranuclear copper-based cluster node of [Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] formed by the organic ligand of H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L (3,5- dicarboxyphenylphosphonic acid) leads to a novel metal&#8211;organic framework &lt;b&gt;FJU-112&lt;/b&gt;. BPE (1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane) divides the larger pore space of &lt;b&gt;FJU-112&lt;/b&gt; into a structure with smaller aperture size and infinite cages which greatly enhances the adsorption and selective separation performance for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational design of high nuclear copper cluster-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks has not been established yet. Herein, we report a novel MOF (&lt;b&gt;FJU-112&lt;/b&gt;) with the ten-connected tetranuclear copper cluster [Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] as the node which was capped by the deprotonated organic ligand of H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L (3,5-Dicarboxyphenylphosphonic acid). With BPE (1,2-Bis(4-pyridyl)ethane) as the pore partitioner, the pore spaces in the structure of &lt;b&gt;FJU-112&lt;/b&gt; were divided into several smaller cages and smaller windows for efficient gas adsorption and separation. &lt;b&gt;FJU-112&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a high separation performance for the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation, which were established by the temperature-dependent sorption isotherms and further confirmed by the lab-scale dynamic breakthrough experiments. The grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) studies show that its high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance is contributed to the strong &#960;-complexation interactions between the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and framework pore surfaces, leading to its more C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptakes over CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly as a Tool To Preserve the Electronic Purity of Perylene Diimide Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular chromophore cube&#160;based on perylene diimides (PDIs) is reported by Sascha Feldmann and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202216729). The rigid and shape&#8208;persistent cage preserves the electronic purity of its PDI constituents and enables the observation of delayed fluorescence due to a bright excited multimer state, acting as excitation reservoir. Self&#8208;assembly can thus serve as a powerful tool for controlling electronic properties in molecular electronics devices.

         <title>Dendronized DNA Chimeras Harness Scavenger Receptors To Degrade Cell Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient dendronized DNA chimera (DENTAC) strategy for targeted membrane protein degradation is reported. DENTAC comprises a protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest (POI) binder linked with a dendritic DNA, which engages cell surface scavenger receptors (SRs) to transport the POI into the lysosome for degradation.







Abstract
Bispecific chimeras bridging cell membrane proteins with lysosome&#8208;trafficking receptors (LTRs) provide an effective therapeutic approach through lysosomal degradation of disease&#8208;relevant targets. Here, we report a novel dendronized DNA chimera (DENTAC) strategy that uses a dendritic DNA to engage cell surface scavenger receptors (SRs) as LTR. Using bioorthogonal strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition to conjugate the dendritic DNA with protein binder, the resulting DENTAC is able to traffic the protein target into the lysosome for elimination. We demonstrated the utility of DENTAC by degrading oncogenic membrane nucleolin (NCL) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The anti&#8208;cancer application of NCL&#8208;targeting DENTAC was validated in a mouse xenograft model of lung cancer. This work thus presents a new avenue for rapid development of potent degraders against membrane proteins, with also broad research and therapeutic prospects.

         <title>Surface Engineering Stabilizes Rhombohedral Sodium Manganese Hexacyanoferrates for High&#8208;Energy Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate full&#8208;cell configurations show comparable energy density to that of the well&#8208;known LiFePO4 full cells.







Abstract
The rhombohedral sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) only containing cheap Fe and Mn metals was regarded as a scalable, low&#8208;cost, and high&#8208;energy cathode material for Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, the unexpected Jahn&#8208;teller effect and significant phase transformation would cause Mn dissolution and anisotropic volume change, thus leading to capacity loss and structural instability. Here we report a simple room&#8208;temperature route to construct a magical CoxB skin on the surface of MnHCF. Benefited from the complete coverage and the buffer effect of CoxB layer, the modified MnHCF cathode exhibits suppressed Mn dissolution and reduced intergranular cracks inside particles, thereby demonstrating thousands&#8208;cycle level cycling lifespan. By comparing two key parameters in the real energy world, i.e., cost per kilowatt&#8208;hours and cost per cycle&#8208;life, our developed CoxB coated MnHCF cathode demonstrates more competitive application potential than the benchmarking LiFePO4 for Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Total Biosynthesis of Mutaxanthene Unveils a Flavoprotein Monooxygenase Catalyzing Xanthene Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel aromatic polyketide containing a xanthene framework and belonging to the mutaxanthene family was discovered through genome mining. The total biosynthesis of this natural product was successfully accomplished using 14 reconstituted enzymes, revealing that a flavoprotein monooxygenase catalyzes a key ring rearrangement and generates the required xanthene ring through a multistep transformation.







Abstract
Flavoprotein monooxygenases (FPMOs) play important roles in generating structural complexity and diversity in natural products biosynthesized by type&#8197;II polyketide synthases (PKSs). In this study, we used genome mining to discover novel mutaxanthene analogues and investigated the biosynthesis of these aromatic polyketides and their unusual xanthene framework. We determined the complete biosynthetic pathway of mutaxathene through in vivo gene deletion and in vitro biochemical experiments. We show that a multifunctional FPMO, MtxO4, catalyzes ring rearrangement and generates the required xanthene ring through a multistep transformation. In addition, we successfully obtained all necessary enzymes for in vitro reconstitution and completed the total biosynthesis of mutaxanthene in a stepwise manner. Our results revealed the formation of a rare xanthene ring in type&#8197;II polyketide biosynthesis, and demonstrate the potential of using total biosynthesis for the discovery of natural products synthesized by type&#8197;II PKSs.

         <title>Alloying&#8208;Triggered Phase Engineering of NiFe System via Laser&#8208;Assisted Al Incorporation for Full Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;standing hybrid system consisting of Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe phases was constructed by laser&#8208;assisted aluminum incorporation on nickel foam (NF) for full water splitting. Ni18Fe12Al70 (Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe) delivers an extremely low overpotential to trigger HER and OER processes with better performance than individual Ni60Fe40 (Ni3Fe phase) and individual Ni30Al70 (Ni2Al3 phase), allowing a design strategy of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.







Abstract
It is challenging to design one non&#8208;noble material with balanced bifunctional performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for commercial sustainability at a low cost since the different electrocatalytic mechanisms are not easily matchable for each other. Herein, a self&#8208;standing hybrid system Ni18Fe12Al70, consisting of Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe phases, was constructed by laser&#8208;assisted aluminum (Al) incorporation towards full water splitting. It was found that the incorporation of Al could effectively tune the morphologies, compositions and phases. The results indicate that Ni18Fe12Al70 delivers an extremely low overpotential to trigger both HER (&#951;100=188&#8197;mV) and OER (&#951;100=345&#8197;mV) processes and maintains a stable overpotential for 100&#8197;h, comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The synergistic effect of Ni2Al3 and Ni3Fe alloys on the HER process is confirmed based on theoretical calculation.

Ni&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; (Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe) delivers an extremely low overpotential to trigger HER and OER processes with better performance than individual Ni&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; (Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe phase) and individual Ni&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; (Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phase), allowing a design strategy of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is challenging to design one non-noble material with balanced bifunctional performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for commercial sustainability at a low cost since the different electrocatalytic mechanisms are not easily matchable for each other. Herein, a self-standing hybrid system Ni&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, consisting of Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe phases, was constructed by laser-assisted aluminum (Al) incorporation towards full water splitting. It was found that the incorporation of Al could effectively tune the morphologies, compositions and phases. The results indicate that Ni&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; delivers an extremely low overpotential to trigger both HER (&#951;&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt;=188&#8197;mV) and OER (&#951;&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt;=345&#8197;mV) processes and maintains a stable overpotential for 100&#8197;h, comparable to state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. The synergistic effect of Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe alloys on the HER process is confirmed based on theoretical calculation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarises the progress of the recently developed locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs), including their physicochemical properties, solution structures, and applications in lithium&#8208;metal batteries with a variety of high&#8208;energy cathode materials. A perspective on the future research directions of LCILEs to further understanding and achieve improved cell performances is outlined.







Abstract
Non&#8208;flammable ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) are well&#8208;known candidates for safer and long&#8208;lifespan lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the high viscosity and insufficient Li+ transport limit their practical application. Recently, non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;viscosity co&#8208;solvents diluting ILEs without affecting the local Li+ solvation structure are employed to solve these problems. The diluted electrolytes, i.e., locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs), exhibiting lower viscosity, faster Li+ transport, and enhanced compatibility toward lithium metal anodes, are feasible options for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs. Herein, the progress of the recently developed LCILEs are summarised, including their physicochemical properties, solution structures, and applications in LMBs with a variety of high&#8208;energy cathode materials. Lastly, a perspective on the future research directions of LCILEs to further understanding and achieve improved cell performances is outlined.

         <title>Ring Expansion Strategies for the Synthesis of Medium Sized Ring and Macrocyclic Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ring expansion strategies are reported for the synthesis of medium sized and macrocyclic sulfonamides. Both methods proceed without using classical protecting groups, initiated by nitro reduction and amine conjugate addition respectively, to make diversely functionalised cyclic sulfonamides in a range of ring sizes. The ring size dependency of the synthetic reactions in good agreement with the outcomes modelled by Density Functional Theory.







Abstract
Two new ring expansion strategies are reported for the synthesis of medium sized ring and macrocyclic sulfonamides. Both methods can be performed without using classical protecting groups, with the key ring expansion step initiated by nitro reduction and amine conjugate addition respectively. Each method can be used to make diversely functionalised cyclic sulfonamides in good to excellent yields, in a range of ring sizes. The ring size dependency of the synthetic reactions is in good agreement with the outcomes modelled by Density Functional Theory calculations.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Framework as a Long&#8208;life and High&#8208;Rate Anode Suitable for Both Aqueous Acidic and Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared a covalent organic framework containing pyrazine (C=N) and phenylimino (&#8722;NH&#8722;) groups (HPP&#8208;COF) as an anode. The robust covalent linkage and the hydrogen bond network between &#8722;NH&#8722; and H2O collectively improve the acid&#8208;alkaline co&#8208;tolerance and promotes the rapid conduction of H+/OH&#8722; by the Grotthuss mechanism. Thus the HPP&#8208;COF exhibits superior cycle stability and rate performance in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries are prospective candidates for large&#8208;scale grid energy storage. However, traditional anode materials applied lack acid&#8208;alkali co&#8208;tolerance. Herein, we report a covalent organic framework containing pyrazine (C=N) and phenylimino (&#8722;NH&#8722;) groups (HPP&#8208;COF) as a long&#8208;cycle and high&#8208;rate anode for both acidic and alkaline batteries. The HPP&#8208;COF&#8242;s robust covalent linkage and the hydrogen bond network between &#8722;NH&#8722; and water molecules collectively improve the acid&#8208;alkaline co&#8208;tolerance. More importantly, the hydrogen bond network promotes the rapid transport of H+/OH&#8722; by the Grotthuss mechanism. As a result, the HPP&#8208;COF delivers a superior capacity and cycle stability (66.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1@ 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, over 40000 cycles in 1&#8197;M H2SO4 electrolyte; 91.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1@ 100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, over 30000 cycles @ 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M NaOH electrolyte). The work opens a new direction for the structural design and application of COF materials in acidic and alkaline batteries.

         <title>Rigid&#8208;Flexible Hybrid Porous Molecular Crystals with Guest&#8208;Induced Reversible Crystallinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A globally robust HOF with both rigidity and flexibility was constructed. The non&#8208;crystalline and crystalline phases of the HOF could be easily and reversibly switched at will with the specific solvent molecule. Furthermore, the obtained HOF exhibits excellent separation efficiency for benzene and cyclohexane (94.4&#8201;%).







Abstract
A weak CH/O hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) with both rigidity and flexibility that could easily and reversibly switch from a non&#8208;crystalline to a crystalline phase was constructed. The specific solvent molecule acts as a &#8220;key&#8221; to control the crystallinity, while the highly rigid triangle macrocycle as the building block is the &#8220;lock&#8221;. The introduction and removal of the &#8220;key&#8221; could influence the local flexibility of the whole framework and lead to switchable crystallinity. Furthermore, the obtained HOF exhibits excellent separation efficiency for benzene and cyclohexane (94.4&#8201;%).

         <title>Vanadium Oxides with Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Heterointerface Network for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium oxide materials with the unique amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterostructure are fabricated using an electrochemical method for the first time. The electrode displays good electrochemical performances as cathode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Experimental and simulation results suggest that the amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterostructure exhibits the favourable cation adsorption and ion diffusion properties compared to other modelling structures.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;VOx batteries are attracting attention in large scale energy storage applications. Yet, the sluggish Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and ambiguous structure&#8211;property relationship are always challenging to fulfil the great potential of the batteries. Here we electrodeposit vanadium oxide nanobelts (VO&#8208;E) with highly disordered structure. The electrode achieves high capacities (e.g., &#8776;5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 516&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), good rate and cycling performances. Detailed structure analysis indicates VO&#8208;E is composed of integrated amorphous&#8208;crystalline nanoscale domains, forming an efficient heterointerface network in the bulk electrode, which accounts for the good electrochemical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that the amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterostructure exhibits the favorable cation adsorption and lower ion diffusion energy barriers compared to the amorphous and crystalline counterparts, thus accelerating charge carrier mobility and electrochemical activity of the electrode.

         <title>Pore&#8208;Environment&#8208;Dependent Photoresponsive Oxidase&#8208;Like Activity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally explicit hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were used to mimic photo&#8208;responsive oxidase. It is shown by constructing isostructural HOFs that the pore environments play an important role in mediating the oxidase&#8208;like activity. The enzyme&#8208;like activity of the HOFs is associated with the substrate&#8208;pore interaction, reminiscent of the binding effect of the native enzyme pocket.







Abstract
Mimicking the bioactivity of native enzymes through synthetic chemistry is an efficient means to advance the biocatalysts in a cell&#8208;free environment, however, remains long&#8208;standing challenges. Herein, we utilize structurally explicit hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) to mimic photo&#8208;responsive oxidase, and uncover the important role of pore environments on mediating oxidase&#8208;like activity by means of constructing isostructural HOFs. We discover that the HOF pore with suitable geometry can stabilize and spatially organize the catalytic substrate into a favorable catalytic route, as with the function of the native enzyme pocket. Based on the desirable photo&#8208;responsive oxidase&#8208;like activity, a visual and sensitive HOFs biosensor is established for the detection of phosphatase, an important biomarker of skeletal and hepatobiliary diseases. This work demonstrates that the pore environments significantly influence the nanozymes&#8217; activity in addition to the active center.

         <title>Dredging the Charge&#8208;Carrier Transfer Pathway for Efficient Low&#8208;Dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of low&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskites (GABA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n=1, 2, 3, 4, MA+=CH3NH3+) with inhibited dielectric confinement were constructed with &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) as the spacer cation. The hydrogen bonds&#160;between the spacers link the adjacent spacing sheets, enabling the charges localized in the van der Waals gap. The power conversion efficiency of (GABA)2MA4Pb5I16 solar cells with excellent carrier transport properties is up to 18.73&#8201;%.







Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (LDRP) perovskites still suffer from inferior carrier transport properties. Here, we demonstrate that efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer can be achieved in LDRP perovskite by introducing &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a spacer. The hydrogen bonding links adjacent spacing sheets in (GABA)2MA3Pb4I13 (MA=CH3NH3+), leading to the charges localized in the van der Waals gap, thereby constructing &#8220;charged&#8208;bridge&#8221; for charge transfer through the spacing region. Additionally, the polarized GABA weakens dielectric confinement, decreasing the (GABA)2MA3Pb4I13 exciton binding energy as low as &#8776;73&#8197;meV. Benefiting from these merits, the resultant GABA&#8208;based solar cell yields a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.73&#8201;% with enhanced carrier transport properties. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device maintains 92.8&#8201;% of its initial PCE under continuous illumination after 1000&#8197;h and only lost 3&#8201;% of its initial PCE under 65&#8201;&#176;C for 500&#8197;h.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;long Near&#8208;infrared Repeatable Photochemical Afterglow Mediated by Reversible Storage of Singlet Oxygen for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a general strategy to realize repeatable photochemical afterglow (RPA) based on the reversible storage of singlet oxygen. Ultra&#8208;long near&#8208;infrared afterglow was achieved via the singlet oxygen&#8208;sensitized fluorescence approach, and its intensity shows no significant reduction over 50 excitation cycles. The RPA system was further applied for attacker&#8208;misleading information encryption, presenting a repeatable read&#8208;out.







Abstract
Photochemical afterglow systems have drawn considerable attention in recent years due to their regulable photophysical properties and charming application potential. However, conventional photochemical afterglow suffered from its unrepeatability due to the consumption of energy cache units as afterglow photons are emitted. Here we report a novel strategy to realize repeatable photochemical afterglow (RPA) through the reversible storage of 1O2 by 2&#8208;pyridones. Near&#8208;infrared afterglow with a lifetime over 10&#8197;s is achieved, and its initial intensity shows no significant reduction over 50 excitation cycles. A detailed mechanism study was conducted and confirmed the RPA is realized through the singlet oxygen&#8208;sensitized fluorescence emission. Furthermore, the generality of this strategy is demonstrated and tunable afterglow lifetimes and colors are achieved by rational design. The developed RPA is further applied for attacker&#8208;misleading information encryption, presenting a repeatable&#8208;readout.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonlinear optical (NLO) switch materials that turn on/off second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at a phase transition temperature (Tc) are promising for applications in the fields of photoswitching and optical computing. However, precise control of Tc remains challenging, mainly because a linearly tunable Tc has not been reported to date. Herein, we report a unique selenate, tetragonal P [[EQUATION]] 21c [Ag(NH3)2]2SeO4 with a = b = 8.5569(2) &#197; and c = 6.5208(2) &#197; that exhibits a strong SHG intensity (1.3 &#215; KDP) and a large birefringence (&#916;nobv. = 0.08). This compound forms a series of isostructural solid&#8208;solution crystals [Ag(NH3)2]2S x Se1&#8208; x O4 (x = 0&#8722;1.00) that exhibit excellent NLO switching performance and an unprecedented linearly tunable  [[EQUATION]]  spanning 430 to 356 K. The breaking of localized hydrogen bonds between SeO42&#8208; and the cation triggers a phase transition accompanied by hydrogen bond length changes with increasing x and a linear change in the enthalpy  [[EQUATION]] .</dc:description>

This compound forms a series of isostructural solid-solution crystals [Ag(NH3)2]2S x Se1- x O4 (x = 0&#8722;1.00) that exhibit excellent NLO switching performance and an unprecedented linearly tunable  [[EQUATION]]  spanning 430 to 356 K. The breaking of localized hydrogen bonds between SeO42- and the cation triggers a phase transition accompanied by hydrogen bond length changes with increasing x and a linear change in the enthalpy  [[EQUATION]] .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence Probe for Nuclear ATP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence monitoring of ATP in different organelles is now feasible with a few biosensors developed, which, however, show low sensitivity, limited biocompatibility, and accessibility. Small&#8208;molecule ATP probes that alleviate those limitations thus have received much attention recently, leading to a few ATP probes that target several organelles except for the nucleus. We disclose the first small&#8208;molecule probe that selectively detects nuclear ATP through reversible binding, with 25&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at pH 7.4 and excellent selectivity against various biologically relevant species. Using the probe, we observed 2.1&#8211;3.3&#8208;fold and 3.9&#8211;7.8&#8208;fold higher nuclear ATP levels in cancerous cell lines and tumor tissues compared with normal cell lines and tissues, respectively, which are explained by the higher nuclear ATP level in the mitosis phase. The probe has great potential for studying nuclear ATP&#8208;associated biology.</dc:description>

         <title>ARMOR: Auto&#8208;Assembled Resilient Biomimetic Calcified Ornaments for Selective Cell Protection by Dual&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;Driven Hybridization Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike plant and microbial cells having cell walls, the outermost layer of mammalian cell is a delicate, two&#8208;layered structure of phospholipids with proteins embedded, which is susceptible to environmental changes. It is necessary to create an &#8220;armor&#8221; on cell surface to protect cell integrity. Here, we propose an Auto&#8208;assembled Resilient bioMimetic calcified ORnaments (ARMOR) strategy driven by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and Ca2+ assisted calcification for selective cell protection. This co&#8208;recognition design enhances the selectivity and leverages robust in&#8208;situ signal amplification by HCR to improve the sensitivity. The calcified shell is cogenerated by crosslinking the alginate&#8208;HCR product with Ca2+ ion. ARMOR has high efficiency for shielding cells from environmental assaults, which can be applied to circulating tumor cell (CTC) protection, isolation, and identification, maintaining the native state and intact genetic information for downstream analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;Extended Pentadecabenzo[9]Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel chiral nanographene (i.e., EP9H) with pentadecabenzo[9]helicene core fragment has been synthesized and fully characterized. Notably, Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction unambiguously confirms the helical structure. The fluorescence emission of EP9H locates in the near infrared region (&#955;em = 684 nm) with a medium quantum yield (0.10) of helicene derivatives. Cyclic voltammetry reveals its seven quasi&#8208;reversible redox states from &#8208;2 to +5. Furthermore, enantiopure EP9H displays distinct CD signals in a broad spectral range from 300 to 700 nm. Compared to the reported small organic molecules, EP9H displays outstanding |glum| as 4.50 &#215; 10&#8208;2 and BCPL as 304 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Unequal Perylene Diimide Twins in a Quadruple Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural light&#8208;harvesting (LH) systems can divide identical dyes into unequal aggregate states, thereby achieving intelligent &#8220;allocation of labour&#8221;. From a synthetic point of view, construction of such kind of unequal and integrated systems without the help of proteinaceous scaffolding is challenging. Here, we show that four octatetrayne&#8208;bridged ortho&#8208;perylene diimide (PDI) dyads (POPs) self&#8208;assemble into a quadruple assembly (POP)4 both in solution and in the solid state. The two identical PDI units in each POP are compartmentalized into weakly coupled PDIs (P520) and closely stacked PDIs (P550) in (POP)4. The two extreme pools of PDI chromophores were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and NMR results. To interpret the formation of the discrete quadruple assembly, we also develop a two&#8208;step cooperative model. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations indicate the existence of multiple&#8208;couplings within and cross P520 and P550, which can satisfactorily describe the photophysical properties of the unequal quadruple assembly .  This finding is expected to help advance the rational design of dye stacks to emulate functions of natural LH systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Photoconversion Enabled&#160;by Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Triatomic Sites in Partially Oxidized Bimetallic Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective CO2 photoreduction into C2 fuels under mild conditions suffers from low product yield and poor selectivity owing to the kinetic challenge of C&#8211;C coupling. Here, triatomic sites are introduced into bimetallic sulfide to promote C&#8722;C coupling for selectively forming C2 products. As an example, FeCoS2 atomic layers with different oxidation degrees are first synthesized, demonstrated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy spectra. Both experiment and theoretical calculation verify more charges aggregate around the introduced oxygen atom, which enables the original Co&#8211;Fe dual sites to turn into Co&#8211;O&#8211;Fe triatomic sites, thus promoting C&#8211;C coupling of double *COOH intermediates. Accordingly, the mildly oxidized FeCoS2 atomic layers exhibit C2H4 formation rate of 20.1 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with the product selectivity and electron selectivity of 82.9% and 96.7%, outperforming most previously reported photocatalysts under similar conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Selectivity of Clamp&#8208;Shaped Cobalt(II) Porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular structure, electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) features of two Co(II) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) complexes bearing Ph or F5Ph groups at the two meso&#8208;positions of the macrocycle are examined. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis reveal a highly bent, nonplanar macrocyclic conformation of the complex resulting in clamp&#8208;shaped molecular structures. Cyclic voltammetry paired with UV&#8208;vis spectroelectrochemistry in PhCN/0.1 M TBAP suggest that the first electron addition correspond to a macrocyclic&#8208;centered reduction while spectral changes observed during the first oxidation are consistent with a metal&#8208;centered CoII/CoIII process. The activity of the clamp&#8208;shaped complexes towards heterogeneous ORR in 0.1 M KOH show selectivity towards the 4e&#8722; ORR pathway giving H2O. DFT first&#8208;principle calculations on the porphyrin catalyst indicates a lower overpotential for 4e&#8208; ORR as compared to the 2e&#8722; pathway, consistent with experimental data.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Porosity Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a synthetic strategy to link titanium&#8208;oxo (Ti&#8208;oxo) clusters into metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) glasses with high porosity though the carboxylate linkage. A new series of MOF glasses were synthesized by evaporation of solution containing Ti&#8208;oxo clusters Ti16O16(OEt)32, linkers, and m&#8208;cresol. The formation of carboxylate linkages between the Ti&#8208;oxo clusters and the carboxylate linkers was confirmed by Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy. The structural integrity of the Ti&#8208;oxo clusters within the glasses was evidenced by both X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and 17O magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR. After ligand exchange and activation, the fumarate&#8208;linked MOF glass, termed Ti&#8208;Fum, showed a N2 Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface areas of 923 m2 g&#8208;1, nearly three times as high as the phenolate&#8208;linked MOF glass with the highest BET surface area prior to this report.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore Aperture Control Toward Size&#8208;Exclusion&#8208;Based Hydrocarbon Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proposed as a promising material for non&#8208;thermal chemical separations owing to their high structural diversity and tunability. Here, we report the synthesis of a zinc&#8208;based MOF containing a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) linker, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, with high thermal stability towards the separation of hexane isomers. The incorporation of the 3D linker enhances the structural stability and provides well&#8208;defined pore apertures/channels with sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom precision. This precision allowed for the separation of similarly sized hexane isomers based on subtle differences in their kinetic diameters. Multi&#8208;component liquid phase batch experiments confirmed the separation of hexanes mixture into linear, monobranched, and dibranched isomers. This work represents a significant milestone in the construction of stable Zn&#8208;based MOFs and the incorporation of 3D linkers as a potential solution to challenging separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioisomeric Benzidine&#8208;Fullerenes: Tuning of the Diverse Hole&#8208;Distribution to Influence Charge Separation Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the influence of molecular structure on charge distribution and charge separation (CS) provides essential guidance for optoelectronic materials design. Here we propose a regioisomeric strategy to tune the diverse hole&#8208;distribution, and probe the influence on CS patterns. Para&#8208;, meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;substituted benzidine&#8208;fullerene, named 1p, 1m and 1o are designed. Following CS, hole&#8208;delocalization occurs in 1p, while hole&#8208;localization exists in 1m and 1o. The rates of charge separation (4.02&#215;1011 s&#8208;1) and recombination (9.8&#215;109 s&#8208;1) of 1p is about 20 and 12 times faster than 1m and 1o, indicating that para&#8208;determined delocalization promotes ultrafast CS, while meta&#8208; and ortho&#8208;generated localization contributes to long&#8208;lived CS states. Computational analysis further implies that localization results from the destruction of electronic conjugation for 1m, and limitation of conformational relaxation for 1o. Given that the universality and simplicity of regional isomerism, this work opens up new thoughts for molecular design with tunable charge separation patterns.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial Localization of Two&#160;Enzymes at Pickering Emulsion Droplet Interfaces for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing biocatalytic cascades in abiological conditions is of utmost significance, but such processes often suffer from low reaction efficiency because of incompatible reaction environments and suppressed intermediate transportation. Here we report a new fashion of biocatalytic cascades by localizing two different enzymes separately in the outer and inner interfacial layers of Pickering emulsion droplets. This versatile approach enables co&#8208;location of two enzymes in their preferred reaction microenvironments and simultaneously in nanoscale proximity of each other. The thus&#8208;designed interfacial biocatalytic cascades show an outstanding catalytic efficiency in the alkene epoxidation and the thioether oxidation with in&#8208;situ generation of hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions, 6.9&#8764;13.6&#8208;times higher than those of the free enzymes in solution and the multi&#8208;enzymatic counterparts. Remarkable interfacial effect of Pickering droplets is found to be responsible for the significantly enhanced cascading efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Highly Oriented Ultrathin Zr&#8208;MOF Membrane from Nanosheets towards Unprecedented Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly oriented ultrathin metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes commonly exhibit superior separation performances compared with their randomly oriented counterparts. Nevertheless, it remains a significant challenge for concurrent manipulation of crystallographic orientation and membrane thickness of 3D MOF (e.g. Zr&#8208;MOF) membranes due to the difficulty in obtaining high&#8208;quality nanosheet (NS) seeds and retarding the growth rate in the vertical direction with no compromise in membrane continuity. In this study, we prepared highly (111)&#8208;oriented sub&#8208;200&#8208;nm&#8208;thick Zr&#8208;MOF (i.e., UiO&#8208;66 and NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) membranes showing unprecedented separation performances through innovating seed preparation and epitaxial growth processes. Uniform triangular&#8208;shaped 40 nm&#8208;thick UiO&#8208;66 NS seeds were prepared by employing an anisotropic etching strategy. Through employing confined contra&#8208;diffusion during epitaxial growth, highly (111)&#8208;oriented 165 nm&#8208;thick UiO&#8208;66 membrane was prepared. A significant reduction in thickness and diffusion barrier in the framework endowed the membrane with unprecedented CO2 permeance as well as high CO2/N2 selectivity, which surpassed the performance limits of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polycrystalline MOF membranes. In addition, highly (111)&#8208;oriented 180 nm&#8208;thick NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 membrane showing superb H2/CO2 separation performance was prepared with the above synthetic procedure, thus revealing its great potential for separation performance improvement of versatile MOF membranes.</dc:description>

It delivers functionalized 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones with excellent optical purity (90&#8208;99% ee), which exhibited anti&#8208;cancer activities against MCF&#8208;7 cell lines, as shown by preliminary biological evaluation. Mechanistic studies and molecular docking results suggest the formation of a phenoxy radical and enantiocontrol facilitated by a suited enzyme chiral pocket. This study is significant in regard to expanding the catalytic repertoire of natural multicopper oxidases as well as enlarging the synthetic toolbox for sustainable asymmetric oxidative coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Bond Formation in Protonated Serine Dimer Following VUV Photon&#8208;Induced Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Possible routes for intra&#8208;cluster bond formation (ICBF) in protonated serine dimers have been studied. We found no evidence of ICBF following low energy collision induced dissociation (in correspondence with previous works), however, we do observe clear evidence for ICBF following photon absorption in the $4.6&#8208;14$ eV range. Moreover, the comparison of photon induced dissociation measurements of the protonated serine dimer to those of a protonated serine dipeptide provides evidence that ICBF, in this case, involves peptide bond formation (PBF). The experimental results are supported by {\it ab initio} molecular dynamics and exploration of several excited state potential energy surfaces, unravelling a pathway for PBF following photon absorption. The combination of experiments and theory provides insight into the PBF mechanisms in clusters of amino acids, and reveals the importance of electronic excited states reached upon UV/VUV light excitation.</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Transformation of Heterometallic Oxo Clusters: A New Approach to Prepare Wide&#8208;Bandgap Cathode Interlayers for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Typical wide&#8208;bandgap cathode interlayer materials are difficulty in reducing interface recombination without limiting charge transport in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a lead&#8208;doped titanium&#8208;oxo cluster protected by S&#8208;containing ligands is introduced at the interface of perovskite and SnO2. By in situ heating, the cluster is transformed into PbSO4&#8208;PbTi3O7 heterostructure. The oxygen atoms from sulfate ion in heterostructure connect with iodine from perovskite to boost interfacial electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. While the yielded metallic interface between PbSO4 and PbTi3O7 promotes the electron transport across the interface. Finally, an efficiency as high as 24.2% for the modified PSC is obtained. The heterostructure well&#8208;stabilize the interface of perovskite and SnO2, to greatly improve the device stability. This work provides a novel strategy to prepare wide&#8208;bandgap cathode interlayer by directional transformation of heterometallic oxo clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous NiFe Oxide&#8208;based Nanoreactors for Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergy engineering is an important way to enhance the kinetic activity of oxygen&#8208;evolution&#8208;reaction (OER) electrocatalysts.&#160;Here, we fabricated NiFe amorphous nanoreactor (NiFe&#8208;ANR) oxide as OER electrocatalysts via a mild self&#8208;catalytic reaction. Firstly, the amorphousness helps transform NiFe&#8208;ANR into highly active hydroxyhydroxides, and its many fine&#8208;grain boundaries increase active sites. More importantly, as proved by experiments and finite element analysis, the nanoreactor structure alters the spatial curvature and the mass transfer over the catalyst, thereby enriching OH&#8208; in the catalyst surface and inner part. Thus, the catalyst with the structure of amorphous nanoreactors gained excellent activity, far superior to the NiFe catalyst with the structure of crystalline nanoreactor or amorphous non&#8208;nanoreactor. This work provides new insights into the applications and mechanisms of amorphousness and nanoreactors, embodying the "1+1&gt;2" synergy of crystalline state and morphology.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Supramolecular A8Bn Miktoarm Star Copolymers by Host&#8208;Guest Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular A8Bn (n=1, 2, 4) miktoarm star copolymers have been fabricated by host&#8211;guest complexation between a resorcinarene&#8208;based coordination capsule possessing eight polystyrene chains and 4,4&#8208;diacetoxy biphenyl guest molecules with one, two, or four polymethyl acrylate chains. The stability of the A8B1, A8B2, and A8B4 miktoarm polymers was influenced by the number of polymethyl acrylate chains in the guest polymers.







Abstract
We report a new synthetic method to construct supramolecular A8Bn (n=1, 2, 4) miktoarm star copolymers by host&#8208;guest complexation between a resorcinarene&#8208;based coordination capsule possessing eight polystyrene chains and 4,4&#8208;diacetoxybiphenyl guest molecules that retain one, two or four polymethyl acrylate chains. The formation of the supramolecular A8Bn (n=1, 2, 4) miktoarm star copolymers was confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC), and diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed that the miktoarm copolymers were phase&#8208;separated in the bulk. The micro&#8208;Brownian motion of the A8B4 structure was markedly enhanced in the bulk due to a weak segregation interaction between the immiscible arms.

         <title>Spiroborate&#8208;Based Host Materials with High Triplet Energies and Ambipolar Charge&#8208;Transport Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient spiroborate&#8208;based host materials are developed for use in blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The C,N&#8208;chelate spiroborate skeleton embedding O and N atoms effectively suppress charge trapping and achieve a maximum EQE of 27.6&#8201;% with narrowband deep blue emission.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) receive considerable attention because of their commercial use in flat panel displays. Herein, highly efficient spiroborate&#8208;based host materials are reported for use in blue OLEDs. Our designed spiroborates (SBOX) were simple to synthesize and exhibited high triplet excitation energies, narrow S&#8208;T gaps, and balanced charge carrier mobilities. A blue OLED containing one of the designed spiroborates, SBON, as a host exhibited a high external quantum efficiency (27.6&#8201;%) and low turn&#8208;on voltage (3.7&#8197;V) compared to those observed using 3,3&#8242;&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (17.6&#8201;% and 4.5&#8197;V, respectively), indicating their potential as host materials in OLEDs.

         <title>Alternative Fast and Slow Charge&#8208;Separation Pathways in&#160;Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosystem&#8208;II (PSII) is a multi&#8208;subunit protein complex that harvests sunlight to perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Initial light&#8208;activated charge separation takes place at a reaction centre consisting of four chlorophylls and two pheophytins. Understanding the processes following light excitation remains elusive due to spectral congestion, the ultrafast nature, and multi&#8208;component behaviour of the charge&#8208;separation process. Here, using advanced computational multiscale approaches which take into account the largescale configurational flexibility of the system, we identify two possible primary pathways to radical&#8208;pair formation that differ by three orders of magnitude in their kinetics. The fast (short&#8208;range) pathway is dominant, but the existence of an alternative slow (long&#8208;range) charge&#8208;separation pathway hints at the evolution of redundancy that may serve other purposes, adaptive or protective, related to formation of the unique oxidative species that drives water oxidation in PSII.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photosystem-II (PSII) is a multi-subunit protein complex that harvests sunlight to perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Initial light-activated charge separation takes place at a reaction centre consisting of four chlorophylls and two pheophytins. Understanding the processes following light excitation remains elusive due to spectral congestion, the ultrafast nature, and multi-component behaviour of the charge-separation process. Here, using advanced computational multiscale approaches which take into account the largescale configurational flexibility of the system, we identify two possible primary pathways to radical-pair formation that differ by three orders of magnitude in their kinetics.

         <title>A simple, transition metal catalyst&#8208;free method for the design of complex organic building blocks used to construct porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) having large pore sizes and volumes often requires the use of complex organic ligands, currently synthesized using costly and time&#8208;consuming palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling chemistry. Thus, in the present work, a new strategy for ligand design is reported, where piperazine and dihydrophenazine units are used as substitutes for benzene rings, which are the basic building block of most MOF ligands. This chemistry, which is based on simple, nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions, is used for the transition metal&#8208;catalyst free construction of 21 new, carboxylate&#8208;based ligands with varying sizes, shapes, and denticity and 15 linear di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;nitriles. Moreover, to demonstrate the utility of the ligands as building blocks, 16 new structurally diverse MOFs having surface areas up to 3100 m2 g&#8208;1 were also synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>A Practical and Robust Zwitterionic Cooperative Lewis Acid/Acetate/Benzimidazolium Catalyst for Direct 1,4&#8208;Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular cooperation of CuII, coordinated acetate and a benzimidazolium unit in the catalyst periphery allows for unprecedented catalyst productivity and high stereocontrol in direct 1,4&#8208;additions to maleimides and a number of other Michael acceptors. Next to the sophisticated activation principle, the catalyst is readily prepared and has robust reactivity. Moreover, it is shown to be reusable multiple times.







Abstract
A catalyst type is disclosed allowing for exceptional efficiency in direct 1,4&#8208;additions. The catalyst is a zwitterionic entity, in which acetate binds to CuII, which is formally negatively charged and serving as counterion for benzimidazolium. All 3 functionalities are involved in the catalytic activation. For maleimides productivity was increased by a factor &gt;300 compared to literature (TONs up to 6700). High stereoselectivity and productivity was attained for a broad range of other Michael acceptors as well. The polyfunctional catalyst is accessible in only 4 steps from N&#8208;Ph&#8208;benzimidazole with an overall yield of 96&#8201;% and robust during catalysis. This allowed to reuse the same catalyst multiple times with nearly constant efficiency. Mechanistic studies, in particular by DFT, give a detailed picture how the catalyst operates. The benzimidazolium unit stabilizes the coordinated enolate nucleophile and prevents that acetate/acetic acid dissociate from the catalyst.

         <dc:description>
This review focuses on recent developments in both fundamental CRISPR biochemistry and CRISPR&#8208;based molecular diagnostic technologies. Four emerging research topics on target preamplification&#8208;free detection, microRNA (miRNA) detection, non&#8208;nucleic&#8208;acid detection, and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection are also covered.







Abstract
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#8208;based nucleic acid testing has played a critical role in disease diagnostics, pathogen surveillance, and many more. However, this method requires a long turnaround time, expensive equipment, and trained personnel, limiting its widespread availability and diagnostic capacity. On the other hand, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has recently demonstrated capability for nucleic acid detection with high sensitivity and specificity. CRISPR&#8208;mediated biosensing holds great promise for revolutionizing nucleic acid testing procedures and developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics. This review focuses on recent developments in both fundamental CRISPR biochemistry and CRISPR&#8208;based nucleic acid detection techniques. Four ongoing research hotspots in molecular diagnostics&#8208;target preamplification&#8208;free detection, microRNA (miRNA) testing, non&#8208;nucleic&#8208;acid detection, and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection&#8208;are also covered.

         <title>Dynamic Reconfigurable DNA Nanostructures, Networks and Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable DNA frameworks provide a plethora of functional materials for constructing DNA nanostructures, operating switchable reactions, controlling optical phenomena, driving dynamic networks and designing materials with switchable properties.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology relies on the structural and functional information encoded in nucleic acids. Specifically, the sequence&#8208;guided reconfiguration of nucleic acids by auxiliary triggers provides a means to develop DNA switches, machines and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. The present Review addresses recent advances in the construction and applications of dynamic reconfigurable DNA nanostructures, networks and materials. Dynamic transformations proceeding within engineered origami frames or between origami tiles, and the triggered dynamic reconfiguration of scaled supramolecular origami structures are addressed. The use of origami frameworks to assemble dynamic chiroplasmonic optical devices and to operate switchable chemical processes are discussed. Also, the dynamic operation of DNA networks is addressed, and the design of &#8220;smart&#8221; stimuli&#8208;responsive all&#8208;DNA materials and their applications are introduced. Future perspectives and applications of dynamic reconfigurable DNA nanostructures are presented.

We report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective allyl&#8208;allyl coupling between branched allyl alcohols and &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters resulting in enantioenriched (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;substituted 1,5&#8208;dienes. All four stereoisomers with two adjacent chiral centers were obtained by chirality pairing. Mechanistic studies were conducted to understand the high levels of selectivity.







Abstract
Here, we report a highly chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective allyl&#8208;allyl coupling between branched allyl alcohols and &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters, catalyzed by a chiral iridium complex. The &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allylboronate esters can be chemoselectively coupled with allyl electrophiles, affording a diverse set of enantioenriched (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;substituted 1,5&#8208;dienes in good yields, with excellent stereoselectivity. By permuting the chiral iridium catalysts and the substrates, we efficiently and selectively obtained all four stereoisomers bearing two consecutive chiral centers. Mechanistic studies via density functional theory calculations revealed the origins of the diastereo&#8208; and chemoselectivities, indicating the pivotal roles of the steric interaction, the &#946;&#8208;silicon effect, and a rapid desilylation process. Additional synthetic modifications for preparing a variety of enantioenriched compounds containing contiguous chiral centers are also included.

         <title>Towards Axially Chiral Pyrazole&#8208;Based Phosphorus Scaffolds by Dipeptide&#8208;Phosphonium Salt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective reaction has been developed for the construction of axially chiral arylpyrazole skeletons with phosphorus unit. The reaction proceeds through a sequential Huisgen&#8208;type cycloaddition/aromatization process with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion using a dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt catalyst. Arylpyrazole&#8208;based atropisomeric phosphorus compounds are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Given the comparatively lower rotational barriers, the catalytic asymmetric construction of axially chiral biaryl structures, especially those containing a five&#8208;membered heterocycle, still remains a challenge. Herein, we described a general and modular protocol to access atropisomeric arylpyrazole scaffolds containing a phosphorus unit by a dipeptide phosphonium salt catalyzed reaction involving an oxidative central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion. This reaction features excellent yields and enantioselectivities, broad substrate scope, and a low catalyst loading, delivering axially chiral phosphine compounds.

         <title>Dynamic Lone Pair Expression as Chemical Bonding Origin of Giant Phonon Anharmonicity in Thermoelectric InTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For thermoelectric InTe, we reveal dynamic lone&#8208;pair expression as the chemical&#8208;bonding origin of giant phonon anharmonicity and intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. Our study provides a first detailed microscopic picture connecting dynamical chemical bonding with giant phonon anharmonicity and ultralow thermal conductivity.







Abstract
Loosely bonded (&#8220;rattling&#8221;) atoms with s2 lone pair electrons are usually associated with strong anharmonicity and unexpectedly low thermal conductivity, yet their detailed correlation remains largely unknown. Here we resolve this correlation in thermoelectric InTe by combining chemical bonding analysis, inelastic X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering, and first principles phonon calculations. We successfully probe soft low&#8208;lying transverse phonons dominated by large In1+ z&#8208;axis motions, and their giant anharmonicity. We show that the highly anharmonic phonons arise from the dynamic lone pair expression with unstable occupied antibonding states induced by the covalency between delocalized In1+ 5s2 lone pair electrons and Te 5p states. This work pinpoints the microscopic origin of strong anharmonicity driven by rattling atoms with stereochemical lone pair activity, important for designing efficient materials for thermoelectric energy conversion.

         <title>Integrating Computation, Experiment, and Machine Learning in the Design of Peptide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Materials and Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides have many potential applications as building blocks in materials science and biomedicine since they organise into supramolecular structures. Advances in computational chemistry enable the mapping, searching and systematic evaluation of large sequence spaces to select viable candidates. Integration of computation and experiment provides understanding of specific interactions, enabling engineering of more versatile functional materials.







Abstract
Interest in peptide&#8208;based supramolecular materials has grown extensively since the 1980s and the application of computational methods has paralleled this. These methods contribute to the understanding of experimental observations based on interactions and inform the design of new supramolecular systems. They are also used to virtually screen and navigate these very large design spaces. Increasingly, the use of artificial intelligence is employed to screen far more candidates than traditional methods. Based on a brief history of computational and experimentally integrated investigations of peptide structures, we explore recent impactful examples of computationally driven investigation into peptide self&#8208;assembly, focusing on recent advances in methodology development. It is clear that the integration between experiment and computation to understand and design new systems is becoming near seamless in this growing field.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopentadiene and Methylcyclopentadiene with Xylose or Extracted Hemicellulose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly integrated two&#8208;step strategy was developed for the selective synthesis of renewable cyclopentadiene (CPD) and methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) with xylose or the hemicelluloses extracted from real biomass. Compared with the conventional fossil route, the new synthetic strategy has evident advantages at the renewability and higher availability of feedstock.







Abstract
Cyclopentadiene (CPD) and methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) are important intermediates that have been widely used in the production of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rocket fuels, polymers and valuable chemicals. Currently, CPD and MCPD are produced from fossil energies at very low yields, which greatly limits their application. As a solution to this problem, we disclose an alternative two&#8208;step bio&#8208;route to access CPD and MCPD using xylose or extracted hemicellulose as the feedstock. In the first step, cyclopentanone (CPO) was directly produced by the selective hydrogenolysis of xylose or extracted hemicellulose over a commercial Ru/C catalyst in an acid&#8208;free toluene/NaCl aqueous solution biphasic system. In the second step, CPO was selectively converted to CPD by a cascade hydrodeoxygenation/dehydrogenation reaction over zinc molybdate catalysts. When methanol was introduced with CPO and hydrogen, MCPD was selectively obtained by a cascade dehydrogenation/aldol condensation/selective hydrodeoxygenation reaction over zinc molybdate catalysts.

         <title>Triggered Functional Dynamics of AsLOV2 by Time&#8208;Resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance at High Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We took advantage of site&#8208;directed spin labeling of Gd&#8208;sTPATCN to track qualitative mechanical movement in the protein AsLOV2. Experiments were done in vitro at room temperature, allowing us to elucidate mutation&#8208;induced inhibited refolding of the J&#945;&#8208;helix.







Abstract
We present time&#8208;resolved Gd&#8722;Gd electron paramagnetic resonance (TiGGER) at 240&#8197;GHz for tracking inter&#8208;residue distances during a protein's mechanical cycle in the solution state. TiGGER makes use of Gd&#8208;sTPATCN spin labels, whose favorable qualities include a spin&#8208;7/2 EPR&#8208;active center, short linker, narrow intrinsic linewidth, and virtually no anisotropy at high fields (8.6&#8197;T) when compared to nitroxide spin labels. Using TiGGER, we determined that upon light activation, the C&#8208;terminus and N&#8208;terminus of AsLOV2 separate in less than 1&#8197;s and relax back to equilibrium with a time constant of approximately 60&#8197;s. TiGGER revealed that the light&#8208;activated long&#8208;range mechanical motion is slowed in the Q513A variant of AsLOV2 and is correlated to the similarly slowed relaxation of the optically excited chromophore as described in recent literature. TiGGER has the potential to valuably complement existing methods for the study of triggered functional dynamics in proteins.

TiGGER makes use of Gd-sTPATCN spin labels, whose favorable qualities include a spin-7/2 EPR-active center, short linker, narrow intrinsic linewidth, and virtually no anisotropy at high fields (8.6&#8197;T) when compared to nitroxide spin labels. Using TiGGER, we determined that upon light activation, the C-terminus and N-terminus of AsLOV2 separate in less than 1&#8197;s and relax back to equilibrium with a time constant of approximately 60&#8197;s. TiGGER revealed that the light-activated long-range mechanical motion is slowed in the Q513A variant of AsLOV2 and is correlated to the similarly slowed relaxation of the optically excited chromophore as described in recent literature. TiGGER has the potential to valuably complement existing methods for the study of triggered functional dynamics in proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrated Eutectic Electrolytes Stabilizing Quasi&#8208;Underpotential Mg Plating/Stripping for High&#8208;Voltage Mg Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous rechargeable Mg batteries (ARMBs) usually fail from severe anode passivation, alternatively, executing quasi&#8208;underpotential Mg plating/stripping chemistry (UPMC) on a proper heterogeneous metal substrate is a crucial remedy. Herein, a stable UPMC on Zn substrate is initially achieved in new hydrated eutectic electrolytes (HEEs), delivering an ultralow UPMC overpotential and high energy/voltage plateau of ARMBs. The unique eutectic property remarkably expands the lower limit of electrochemical stability window (ESW) of HEEs and undermines the competition between hydrogen evolution/corrosion reactions and UPMC, enabling a reversible UPMC. The UPMC is carefully revealed by multiple characterizations, which shows a low overpotential of 50 mVat 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2 over 550 h. With sulfonic acid&#8208;doped polyaniline (SPANI) cathodes, UPMC&#8208;based full cells show high energy/power densities of 168.6 Wh kg&#8208;1/2.1 kWh kg&#8208;1 and voltage plateau of 1.3 V, far overwhelming conventional aqueous systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H/O2 Dual Activation and Macrocyclization: Synthesis and Evaluation of Pyrido[2,1&#8208;a]isoindole Grafted Macrocyclic Inhibitors for Influenza H1N1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of environment&#8208;friendly, step economic couplings to generate structurally diverse macrocyclic compounds is highly desirable but poses a marked challenge. Inspired by the C&#8211;H oxidation mechanism of cytochromes P450, an unprecedented and practical Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed acylmethylation macrocyclization via C&#8211;H/O2 dual activation has been developed by us. The process of macrocyclization is facilitated by a synergic coordination from pyridine and ester group. Interestingly, the reaction mode derives from a three&#8208;component coupling which differs from established olefination and alkylation paths. DFT calculations and control experiments revealed the mechanism of this unique C&#8211;H/O2 dual activation. The newly achieved&#160;acylmethylation macrocyclic products and their derivatives&#160;showed a potent anti&#8208;H1N1 bioactivity, which may provide an opportunity for the discovery of novel anti&#8208;H1N1 macrocyclic leading compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulation of the Buried Interface for Robust Formamidinium&#8208;based Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells with NiOx Hole&#8208;Transport Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low bandgap tin&#8208;lead perovskite solar cells (Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs) are expected to achieve higher efficiencies than Pb&#8208;PSCs and regarded as key components of tandem PSCs. However, the realization of high efficiency is challenged by the instability of Sn2+ and the imperfections at the charge transfer interfaces. Here, we demonstrate an efficient ideal bandgap formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based Sn&#8208;Pb (FAPb0.5Sn0.5I3) PSC, by manipulating the buried NiOx/perovskite interface with 4&#8208;hydroxyphenethyl ammonium halide (OH&#8208;PEAX, X = Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, or I&#8208;) interlayer, which exhibits fascinating functions of reducing the surface defects of the NiOx hole transport layer (HTL), enhancing the perovskite film quality, and improving both the energy level matching and physical contact at the interface. The effects of different halide anions have been elaborated and a 20.53% efficiency is obtained with OH&#8208;PEABr, which is the highest one for FA&#8208;based Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs using NiOx HTLs. Moreover, the device stability is also boosted.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Hole Transport Properties via Pyrrole Derivation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole transport materials (HTMs) with high hole mobility, good band alignment and ease of fabrication are highly desirable for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we designed and synthesized novel organic HTMs, named T3, which can be synthesized in high yields with commercially available materials, featuring a substituted pyrrole core and triphenylamine peripheral arms. The capability of functionalization in the final synthetic step provides an efficient way to obtain a variety of T3&#8208;based HTMs with tunable energy levels and other properties. Among them, fluorine&#8208;substituted T3 (T3&#8208;F) exhibits the best band alignment and hole extraction properties, leading to PSCs with outstanding PCEs of 24.85% and 24.03% (certified 23.46%) for aperture areas of 0.1 and 1 cm2, respectively. The simple structure and tunable performance of T3 can inspire further optimization for efficient PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Operation of Lithium Metal Batteries with Aggressive Cathode Chemistries at 4.9 V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) pose severe challenges for the matching of electrolytes with aggressive electrodes, especially at low temperatures. Here, we report a rational modification of the Li+ solvation structure to extend the voltage and temperature operating ranges of conventional electrolytes. Ion&#8208;ion and ion&#8208;dipole interactions as well as the electrochemical window of solvents were tailored to improve oxidation stability and de&#8208;solvation kinetics of the electrolyte. Meanwhile, robust and elastic B and F&#8208;rich interphases are formed on both electrodes. Such optimization enables Li||LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cells (90.2% retention after 400 cycles) and Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cells (74.0% retention after 200 cycles) to cycle stably at an ultra&#8208;high voltage of 4.9 V. Moreover, NCM622 cells deliver a considerable capacity of 143.5 mAh/g at &#8208;20 &#8451;, showing great potential for practical uses. The proposed strategy sheds light on further optimization for high&#8208;voltage LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Endogenous Enzyme&#8208;Operated Spherical Nucleic Acids for Cell&#8208;Selective Protein Capture and Localization Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise regulation of protein activity and localization in cancer cells is crucial to dissect function of protein&#8208;involved cellular network in tumorigenesis, but lack of methodology. Here we report the design of enzyme&#8208;operated spherical nucleic acids (E&#8208;SNAs) for manipulation of the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of proteins with cancer&#8208;cell selectivity. The E&#8208;SNAs are constructed by programmable engineering of aptamer&#8208;based modules bearing enzyme&#8208;responsive units in pre&#8208;designed sites and further combination with SNA nanotechnology. We demonstrate that E&#8208;SNAs are able to regulate cytoplasmic&#8208;to&#8208;nuclear shuttling of RelA protein efficiently and specifically in tumor cells, while it remained inactive in normal cells due to the insufficient enzyme expression. We further confirmed the generality of this strategy by investigating the enzyme&#8208;modulated inhibition/activation of thrombin activity by varying the aptamer&#8208;based design.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Photoelectroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Ethanol over Graphene/Silicon Carbide Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using sunlight to produce valuable chemicals and fuels from carbon dioxide (CO2), i.e., artificial photosynthesis (AP) is a promising strategy to achieve solar energy storage and a negative carbon cycle. However, selective synthesis of C2 compounds with a high CO2 conversion rate remains challenging for current AP technologies. We performed CO2 photoelectroreduction over a graphene/silicon carbide (SiC) catalyst under simulated solar irradiation with ethanol (C2H5OH) selectivity of &gt; 99% and a CO2 conversion rate of up to 17.1 mmol&#8729;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with sustained performance. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicated an optimal interfacial layer to facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the SiC substrate to the few&#8208;layer graphene overlayer, which also favored an efficient CO2 to C2H5OH conversion pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hydrolysable Supra&#8208;amphiphile as a Marangoni Self&#8208;Propulsion Fuel for Efficient Macroscopic Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm components is important to achieve all&#8208;scale ordering with requirements of extra energy for motion and interaction of components. Marangoni flows caused by surfactants on water provide appropriate energy but have limited lifetime due to inevitable interfacial aggregation and difficult decomposition of aggregated covalent surfactants that inactivate Marangoni effects. Here we synthesize a supra&#8208;amphiphile Marangoni "fuel" named as sodium&#8208;4&#8208;(benzylideneamino) benzenesulfonate (SBBS) that is timely hydrolysable as species without surface activity to extend the motion time by 10&#8208;fold. The motion was optimized at pH=2 by a fine equilibrium of releasing and removing interfacial SBBS, leading to self&#8208;assembly of millimeter&#8208;scaled ordered dimers. The underlying mechanism was interpreted by motion analyses and simulation. This strategy provides an active solution to self&#8208;assembly at the &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm scale, as well as interactive ideas between miniaturized chemical robots.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Metallacycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Photosensitizers for Effective Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizers (PSs) attracted increasing attention in biomedicine, their clinical translation is still hindered by their inherent dark toxicity. Herein, we report what to our knowledge is the first example of a molecular engineering approach to building blocks of metallacycles for constructing a series of supramolecular PSs (RuA&#8211;RuD), with the aim of simultaneously reducing dark toxicity and enhancing phototoxicity, and consequently obtaining high phototoxicity indexes (PI). Detailed in vitro investigations demonstrate that RuA&#8211;RuD displays high cancer cellular uptake and remarkable antitumor activity even under hypoxic conditions. Notably, RuD exhibited no dark toxicity and displayed the highest PI value (~406). Theoretical calculations verified that RuD has the largest steric hindrance and the lowest singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST, 0.61 eV). Further in vivo studies confirmed that RuD allows for safe and effective phototherapy against A549 tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Differentiating between Acidic and Basic Surface Hydroxyls on Metal Oxides by Fluoride Substitution: A Case Study on Blue TiO2 from Laser Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probing surface OH with F&#8722; ions: Surface OH of TiO2 were substituted by F&#8722; ions, which were then quantified by XPS and ion chromatography. The acidic (bridging) and basic (terminal) surface OH can be distinguished at different pH. Using this fluoride substitution, it was demonstrated that laser defect engineering selectively created more acidic OH but not basic OH on TiO2.







Abstract
Both oxygen vacancies and surface hydroxyls play a crucial role in catalysis. Yet, their relationship is not often explored. Herein, we prepare two series of TiO2 (rutile and P25) with increasing oxygen deficiency and Ti3+ concentration by pulsed laser defect engineering in liquid (PUDEL), and selectively quantify the acidic and basic surface OH by fluoride substitution. As indicated by EPR spectroscopy, the laser&#8208;generated Ti3+ exist near the surface of rutile, but appear to be deeper in the bulk for P25. Fluoride substitution shows that extra acidic bridging OH are selectively created on rutile, while the surface OH density remains constant for P25. These observations suggest near&#8208;surface Ti3+ are highly related to surface bridging OH, presumably the former increasing the electron density of the bridging oxygen to form more of the latter. We anticipate that fluoride substitution will enable better characterization of surface OH and its correlation with defects in metal oxides.

         <title>A New Thiolate&#8208;Bound Dimanganese Cluster as a Structural and Functional Model for Class Ib Ribonucleotide Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aim to mimic the reactivity of class&#8197;Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs), a new thiolate&#8208;bound MnII2 compound was studied. Upon superoxide activation it forms a reactive intermediate that exhibits a 16&#8208;line St=1/2 EPR signal at g=2 and oxidizes substituted phenols, thereby resembling the enzymatic behavior and, thus, providing new mechanistic insight into class&#8197;Ib RNR reactivity.







Abstract
In class&#8197;Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) a dimanganese(II) cluster activates superoxide (O2&#8901;&#8722;) rather than dioxygen (O2), to access a high valent MnIII&#8722;O2&#8722;MnIV species, responsible for the oxidation of tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. In a biomimetic approach, we report the synthesis of a thiolate&#8208;bound dimanganese complex [MnII2(BPMT)(OAc)2](ClO)4 (BPMT=(2,6&#8208;bis{[bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl}&#8208;4&#8208;methylthiophenolate) (1) and its reaction with O2&#8901;&#8722; to form a [(BPMT)MnO2Mn]2+ complex 2. Resonance Raman investigation revealed the presence of an O&#8722;O bond in 2, while EPR analysis displayed a 16&#8208;line St=1/2 signal at g=2 typically associated with a MnIIIMnIV core, as detected in class&#8197;Ib RNRs. Unlike all other previously reported Mn&#8722;O2&#8722;Mn complexes, generated by O2&#8901;&#8722; activation at Mn2 centers, 2 proved to be a capable electrophilic oxidant in aldehyde deformylation and phenol oxidation reactions, rendering it one of the best structural and functional models for class&#8197;Ib RNRs.

         <title>Bandgap&#8208;Engineered Germanene Nanosheets as an Efficient Photodynamic Agent for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;terminated germanene nanosheets with a biomedically favorable direct band gap were synthesized by a simple surface chemical modulation and can be applied to cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). The surface chemical modulation strategy addresses the major medical application challenges of Xenes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) science.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monoelemental materials (Xenes) show considerable potential in bioapplications owing to their unique 2D physicochemical features and the favored biosafety resulting from their monoelemental composition. However, the narrow band gaps of Xenes prevent their broad applications in biosensors, bioimaging and phototherapeutics. In this study, it is demonstrated that 2D germanene terminated with &#8722;H via surface chemical engineering, shows a much broadened direct band gap of 1.65&#8197;eV, which enables the material to be used as a novel inorganic photosensitizer for the photodynamic therapy of singlet oxygen. Through theoretical analysis and in vitro studies, H&#8208;germanene nanosheets demonstrate a substantially enlarged band gap and favorable biodegradability, demonstrating a substantial cancer treatment capacity.

     alt="Bandgap-Engineered Germanene Nanosheets as an Efficient Photodynamic Agent for Cancer Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H-terminated germanene nanosheets with a biomedically favorable direct band gap were synthesized by a simple surface chemical modulation and can be applied to cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). The surface chemical modulation strategy addresses the major medical application challenges of Xenes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) science.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) monoelemental materials (Xenes) show considerable potential in bioapplications owing to their unique 2D physicochemical features and the favored biosafety resulting from their monoelemental composition. However, the narrow band gaps of Xenes prevent their broad applications in biosensors, bioimaging and phototherapeutics. In this study, it is demonstrated that 2D germanene terminated with &#8722;H via surface chemical engineering, shows a much broadened direct band gap of 1.65&#8197;eV, which enables the material to be used as a novel inorganic photosensitizer for the photodynamic therapy of singlet oxygen. Through theoretical analysis and in vitro studies, H-germanene nanosheets demonstrate a substantially enlarged band gap and favorable biodegradability, demonstrating a substantial cancer treatment capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of constructing novel therapeutic photodynamic agents by surface covalent engineering for catalytic tumor therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ESIPT&#8208;Inspired Dual&#8208;Mode Photoswitches with Fast Molecular Isomerization in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitchable materials with excellent optical performance have attracted considerable attention from researchers and have been applied in various fields. The development of excellent solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;mode photoswitches is an important but challenging task. Herein, we propose a new strategy to construct an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer&#8208;inspired photoswitches (DiAH&#8208;pht) that possesses aggregation&#8208;induced emission features and displays fast molecular isomerization process characterized by simultaneously solid&#8208;state absorption/fluorescence response. The mechanistic studies indicate that introduction of a bulky group can create a folded molecular conformation that provides adequate volume to facilitate the photoisomerization and the enhanced ESIPT effect can boost the isomerization process from the cis&#8208;keto to trans&#8208;keto forms in the solid state. The feasibility of our strategy was further demonstrated by the activated photoisomerization performance of the Schiff base derivatives. Furthermore, the high&#8208;contrast and fast recovery process make DiAH&#8208;pht a highly promising candidate in the fields of dual&#8208;mode information encryption and high&#8208;density data storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Easy access to diverse multiblock copolymers with on&#8208;demand blocks via thioester&#8208;relayed in&#8208;chain cascade copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiblock copolymers are envisioned as promising materials with enhanced properties and functionality compared with their diblock/triblock counterparts. However, the current approaches can construct multiblock copolymers with a limited number of blocks but tedious&#160;procedures. Here, we report a thioester&#8208;relayed in&#8208;chain cascade copolymerization strategy for the easy preparation of multiblock copolymers with on&#8208;demand blocks, in which thioester groups with on&#8208;demand numbers are built in the polymer backbone by controlled/living polymerizations. These thioester groups further serve as the in&#8208;chain initiating centers to trigger the acyl group transfer ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfides independently and concurrently to extend the polymer backbone into multiblock structures. The compositions, number of blocks, and block degree of polymerization can be easily regulated. This strategy can offer easy access to a library of multiblock copolymers with ~100 blocks in only 2 to 4 steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Mediated Spinel Octahedral Structures for Elevated Performances of Li&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8211;oxygen batteries have attracted much attention due to its ultra&#8208;high theoretical specific capacity, but the discharge product Li2O2 is easy to accumulate, leading to low battery stability. Here, we demonstrate a series of high&#8208;efficiency cathode catalysts of Co3O4 loaded with single&#8208;atomic metals (M = Ru, Pd, Pt, Au, Ir). The singleatomic metal could substitute the central Co atom in the octahedral coordination structure and maintain the structural stability; benefiting from the electron promoter effect, rendering more highly active Co3+ exposed, providing rich nucleation sites for Li2O2 deposition. And the loaded M atoms could separate the active Co3+ centers, thereby regulating the dispersion of Li2O2 to obtained a sheet&#8208;like morphology, which could facilitate its decomposition in the subsequent charge cycle. Our work found that the single atoms could effectively modulate the active metal oxide with which it is coordinated, thus collectively boosting the catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Spiro Phosphamide Catalyzed Enantioselective Proton Transfer of Ylides in a Free Carbene Insertion into N&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Free carbene is easy to cause multiple side reactions due to its high energy, thus its asymmetric transformation is very difficult. We present here our findings of high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts which enable free carbene insertion into N&#8722;H bonds of amines to prepare chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivative with high enantioselectivity. By irradiation of visible light, diazo compounds produce high&#8208;energy free carbenes which are captured by amines to form free ylide intermediates, and then the newly designed high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acids, chiral spiro phosphamides, promote the proton transfer of ylides to afford the products. Computational and kinetic studies uncover the principle for the rational design of proton&#8208;transfer catalysts and explain how the catalysts accelerate this transformation and provide stereocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Induced Singlet&#8208;Triplet Inversions in Non&#8208;Alternant Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules with inversion of the singlet and triplet excited&#8208;state energies are highly promising for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To date, azaphenalenes are the only class of molecules where these inversions have been identified. Here, we screen a curated database of organic crystal structures to identify existing compounds for violations of Hund's rule in the lowest excited states. We identify two further classes with this behavior. The first, a class of zwitterions, has limited relevance to molecular emitters as the singlet&#8208;triplet inversions occur in the third excited singlet state. The second class consists of two D2h&#8208;symmetry non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons, a fused azulene dimer and a bicalicene, whose lowest excited singlet states violate Hund&#8217;s rule. Due to the connectivity of the polycyclic structure, they achieve this symmetry through aromatic stabilization. These hydrocarbons show promise as the next generation of building blocks for OLED emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Cd/Pt Precursor Solution for Solar H2 Production and in&#8208;situ Photochemical Synthesis of Pt Single&#8208;atom Decorated CdS Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite extensive efforts to develop high&#8208;performance H2 evolution catalysts, this remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate the use of Cd/Pt precursor solutions for significant photocatalytic H2 production (154.7 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1), removing the need for a pre&#8208;synthesized photocatalyst. In addition, we also report simultaneous in&#8208;situ synthesis of Pt single&#8208;atoms anchored CdS nanoparticles (PtSA&#8208;CdSIS) during photoirradiation. The highly dispersed in&#8208;situ incorporation of extensive Pt single atoms on CdSIS enables the enhancement of active sites and suppresses charge recombination, which results in exceptionally high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of ~1% and an apparent quantum yield of over 91% (365 nm) for H2 production. Our work not only provides a promising strategy for maximising H2 production efficiency but also provides a green process for H2 production and the synthesis of highly photoactive PtSA&#8208;CdSIS nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Augmenting the Performance of Hydrogenase for Aerobic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution via Solvent Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work showcases the performance of [NiFeSe] hydrogenase from Desulfomicrobium baculatum for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen generation in a variety of organic&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents. Despite its well&#8208;known sensitivity towards air and organic solvents, the hydrogenase shows remarkable performance under an aerobic atmosphere in these solvents when paired with a TiO2 photocatalyst. Tuning the water content further increases hydrogen evolution activity to a TOF of 60&#177;3&#160;s&#8211;1 and quantum yield to 2.3&#177;0.4% under aerobic conditions, compared to a TOF of 4&#160;s&#8211;1 in a purely aqueous solvent. Contrary to common belief, this work therefore demonstrates that placing natural hydrogenases into non&#8208;natural environments can enhance their intrinsic activity beyond their natural performance, paving the way for full water splitting using hydrogenases.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Evolution Of New Catalysts For The Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction by searching chemical space for molecules that lower the estimated barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step using a genetic algorithm (GA) starting from ran&#8208; domly selected tertiary amines. We identify 435 candidates, virtually all of which contain an azetidine N as the catalytically active site, which is discovered by the GA. Two molecules are selected for further study based on their predicted synthetic accessi&#8208; bility and have predicted rate&#8208;determining barriers that are lower than that of a known catalyst. Azetidines have not been used as catalysts for the MBH reaction. One sug&#8208; gested azetidine is successfully synthesized and showed an eightfold increase in activity over a commonly used catalyst. We believe this is the first experimentally verified de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst using a generative model.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct &#960;&#8208;Activation vs. O&#8208;Activation in Halogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen bond donors had an increasing impact on catalysis in recent years, and their development is highly active. In particular, numerous iodine&#8208;based halogen bond donors have been developed and used to promote various reactions through coordinating carbonyl groups, a ubiquitous mode of activation in catalysis. We now report computational data which strongly suggests that an alternative activation mode, through direct &#960;&#8208;complexation, is operative for unsaturated carbonyl substrates. Calculations also suggest that solvent polarity could have a clear impact on the preference of the mode of activation, raising the possibility of a mechanistic manifold switch through solvent variation. These findings could profoundly impact the development of the next generation of such halogen&#8208;bond donor catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Calix[3]pyrrole Derivatives: Synthesis, Racemization Kinetics, and Ring Expansion to Calix[9]&#8208; and Calix[12]pyrrole Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral pyrrolic macrocycles continue to attract interest. However, their molecular design remains challenging. Here, we report a calixpyrrole&#8208;based chiral macrocyclic system, calix[1]furan[1]pyrrole[1]thiophene (1), synthesized from an oligoketone. Macrocycle 1 adopts a partial cone conformation in the solid state, and undergoes racemization via ring inversion. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that inversion of the thiophene is the rate determining step. Pyrrole N&#8208;methylation suppressed racemization and permitted chiral resolution. Enantioselective N&#8208;methylation also occurred in the presence of a chiral ammonium salt, although the stereoselectivity is modest. A unique feature of 1 is that it acts as a useful synthetic precursor to yield several calix[n]furan[n]pyrrole[n]thiophene products (n = 2~4), including a calix[12]pyrrole analogue that to our knowledge constitutes the largest calix[n]pyrrole&#8208;like species to be structurally characterized.</dc:description>
