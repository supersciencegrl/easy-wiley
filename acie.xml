         <title>Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Batteries Operating Stably under &#8208;10 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide&#8208;based flow batteries are well suited for energy storage because of their features of high electrochemical activity, good kinetics and low material cost. However, they suffer from low energy density and poor temperature adaptability. The ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide catholyte exhibits low solubility (~0.4 M at 25 &#176;C) in NaOH&#8208; or KOH&#8208;based supporting electrolyte and can easily form precipitates below room temperature. Here we report a lithium&#8208;based supporting electrolyte that significantly enhances the solubility of ferrocyanide. The use of LiOH intensifies the ion&#8208;dipole interaction between water molecules and solutes and cripples polarization among ferrocyanide ions. Thus, we have achieved a ferrocyanide&#8208;based catholyte of 1.7 M at 25 &#176;C and of 0.8 M at &#8208;10 &#176;C. A zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery based on the lithium&#8208;based supporting electrolyte demonstrates a steady charge energy of ~72 Wh L&#8208;1catholyte at 25 &#176;C for ~4200 cycles (~4200 hours). Furthermore, it remains stable for ~800 cycles (~800 hours) at &#8208;10 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibiting Ion Migration and Stabilizing Crystal&#8208;Phase in Halide Perovskite via Directly Incorporated Fluoride Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoride anion (F&#8722;) with extremely high electronegativity has been under intensive investigation in perovskite solar cells due to its remarkable defect suppression and greatly improvement of device performance. Nevertheless, these researches only focus on surface, grain boundaries or interface modification, the directly insertion of F&#8722; into crystal lattice of regular lead halide perovskite films is still unrevealed. Herein, F&#8722; was successfully incorporated into perovskite lattice by overcoming the insolubility of PbF2 via the introduced pyridinium halide as a novel volatile solubilizing ligand. The strong electronegativity of F&#8722; can strongly increase the binding energy of all the ions in CsPbI2Br and inhibit their defect formations. A trace amount of F&#8722; incorporation not only enhanced the optoelectronic properties but also effectively mitigated the ion migration and phase separation simultaneously. The photovoltaic performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells were significantly improved with a champion efficiency of 17.78% (38.01%) under AM 1.5G (1000 lux indoor light). Moreover, F&#8722; can also be directly inserted into hybrid perovskite lattice and greatly stabilized crystal&#8208;phase, enabling efficient fully MA&#8208;free FAPbI3 devices with 25.10% efficiency. Our strategy sheds light on F&#8208;containing perovskites and provides a promising way to tackle ion migration and stabilize crystal&#8208;phase in halide perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>C60 Fullerene&#8208;Induced Reduction of Metal Ions: Synthesis of C60&#8208;Metal Cluster Heterostructures with High Electrocatalytic&#160;Hydrogen&#8208;Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal clusters, due to their small dimensions, contain a high proportion of surface atoms, thus possessing a significantly improved catalytic activity compared with their bulk counterparts and nanoparticles. Defective and modified carbon supports are effective in stabilizing metal clusters, however, the synthesis of isolated metal clusters still requires multiple steps and harsh conditions. Herein, we develop a C60 fullerene&#8208;driven spontaneous metal deposition process, where C60 serves as both a reductant and an anchor, to achieve uniform metal (Rh, Ir, Pt, Pd, Au and Ru) clusters without the need for any defects or functional groups on C60. Density functional theory calculations reveal that C60 possesses multiple strong metal adsorption sites, which favors stable and uniform deposition of metal atoms. In addition, owing to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of C60, the electronic structures of metal clusters are effectively regulated, not only optimizing the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates but also accelerating the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction. The synthesized Ru/C60&#8208;300 exhibits remarkable performance for hydrogen evolution in an alkaline condition. This study demonstrates a facile and efficient method for synthesizing effective fullerene&#8208;supported metal cluster catalysts without any pretreatment and additional reducing agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Rechargeable LiFePO4/Graphite Batteries from &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C</title>

All&#8208;climate batteries from &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C: A wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte that exhibits high ionic conductivity, fast interfacial kinetics and excellent film&#8208;forming ability is proposed. The proposed electrolyte significantly alleviates the Li plating and interfacial degradation of LiFePO4 (LFP)/graphite cells at ultralow temperatures. The LFP/graphite cells exhibit an ultra&#8208;wide operating&#8208;temperature range of &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C and outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability.







Abstract
Lithium iron phosphate (LFP)/graphite batteries have long dominated the energy storage battery market and are anticipated to become the dominant technology in the global power battery market. However, the poor fast&#8208;charging capability and low&#8208;temperature performance of LFP/graphite batteries seriously hinder their further spread. These limitations are strongly associated with the interfacial lithium (Li)&#8208;ion transport. Here we report a wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range ester&#8208;based electrolyte that exhibits high ionic conductivity, fast interfacial kinetics and excellent film&#8208;forming ability by regulating the anion chemistry of Li salt. The interfacial barrier of the battery is quantitatively unraveled by employing three&#8208;electrode system and distribution of relaxation time technique. The superior role of the proposed electrolyte in preventing Li0 plating and sustaining homogeneous and stable interphases are also systematically investigated. The LFP/graphite cells exhibit rechargeability in an ultrawide temperature range of &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C to 80&#8201;&#176;C and outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability without compromising lifespan. Specially, the practical LFP/graphite pouch cells achieve 80.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 1200&#8197;cycles (2&#8197;C) and 10&#8208;min charge to 89&#8201;% (5&#8197;C) at 25&#8201;&#176;C and provide reliable power even at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Steam&#8208;Assisted Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol over Ru&#8722;In Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru/In2O3&#8208;ZrO2 was found to be active for ethanol production from CO2 hydrogenation, but ethanol productivity decreased substantially after several hours of reaction due to the excessive reduction of In species. With the addition of steam as a mild oxidant and using porous polymer layers to control In mobility, Ru&#8722;In2O3 interface sites were stabilized, and ethanol could be produced with superior overall selectivity (70&#8201;%, rest CO).







Abstract
Multicomponent catalysts can be designed to synergistically combine reaction intermediates at interfacial active sites, but restructuring makes systematic control and understanding of such dynamics challenging. We here unveil how reducibility and mobility of indium oxide species in Ru&#8208;based catalysts crucially control the direct, selective conversion of CO2 to ethanol. When uncontrolled, reduced indium oxide species occupy the Ru surface, leading to deactivation. With the addition of steam as a mild oxidant and using porous polymer layers to control In mobility, Ru&#8722;In2O3 interface sites are stabilized, and ethanol can be produced with superior overall selectivity (70&#8201;%, rest CO). Our work highlights how engineering of bifunctional active ensembles enables cooperativity and synergy at tailored interfaces, which unlocks unprecedented performance in heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Unlocking Reactivity of Fragments for Fast Target&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating photochemistry within kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) techniques, we significantly accelerated the identification of enzyme inhibitors, demonstrating the potential of KTGS for rapid discovery of bioactive ligands in medicinal chemistry. The chiral linkage gives rise to the formation of enantiomers, which were assessed via a highly stereocontrolled synthesis of both templated ligand enantiomers.







Abstract
We showcase the successful combination of photochemistry and kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) for rapidly pinpointing enzyme inhibitors. KTGS is a fragment&#8208;based drug discovery (FBDD) methodology in which the biological target (BT) orchestrates the construction of its own ligand from fragments featuring complementary reactive functionalities. Notably, fragments interacting with the protein binding sites leverage their spatial proximity, facilitating a preferential reaction. Consequently, the resulting bivalent ligand exhibits heightened affinity. Within the realm of KTGS strategies, in situ click chemistry stands out as the most widely used to identify potent protein binders. This approach requires significant protein contributions, such as binding interactions and appropriate orientations of fragments, to overcome high activation barriers. This leads to prolonged incubation times and the potential for generating false negatives, thereby limiting this strategy to proteins that are stable enough in buffer. We herein unveil the possibility to integrate photochemistry into the realm of KTGS, accelerating the ligation reaction between fragments to a time scale of minutes. This approach should significantly expand the narrow reactivity window of traditional KTGS reactions, paving the way for the exploration and development of novel photo&#8208;KTGS reactions.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks Consisting of Tetraborate Nodes and Flexible Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraborate node has been shown to facilitate the formation of 3D ionic covalent organic frameworks with flexible linkers. Irreversible deprotonation acts as a kinetic control to achieve high polymerization, while the dynamic B&#8722;O bond aids error correction. This approach has been investigated with three organic monomers and two metal counterions.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile materials with many applications, such as carbon capture, molecular separation, catalysis, and energy storage. Traditionally, flexible building blocks have been avoided due to their potential to disrupt ordered structures. Recent studies have demonstrated the intriguing properties and enhanced structural diversity achievable with flexible components by judicious selection of building blocks. This study presents a novel series of ionic COFs (ICOFs) consisting of tetraborate nodes and flexible linkers. These ICOFs use borohydrides to irreversibly deprotonate the alcohol monomers to achieve a high degree of polymerization. Structural analysis confirms the dia topologies. Reticulation is explored using various monomers and metal counterions. Also, these frameworks exhibit excellent stability in alcohols and coordinating solvents. The materials have been tested as single&#8208;ion conductive solid&#8208;state electrolytes. ICOF&#8208;203&#8208;Li displays one of the lowest activation energies reported for ion conduction. This tetraborate chemistry is anticipated to facilitate further structural diversity and functionality in crystalline polymers.

         <title>Interception and Synthetic Application of Diradical and Diene Forms of Dual&#8208;Nature Azabicyclic o&#8208;Quinodimethanes Generated by 6&#960;&#8208;Azaelectrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Alkenylarylimines have been shown to undergo 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization thermally to generate azabicyclic o&#8208;quinodimethanes. These o&#8208;quinodimethanes show dual nature as a cyclic diene and a benzylic diradical. The interception of the diradicaloid o&#8208;quinodimethanes by H&#8208;atom transfer enabled the synthesis of five tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids. The cyclic dienes were intercepted by [4+2] cycloaddition to generate bridgehead azabicycles.







Abstract
We demonstrate that 2&#8208;alkenylarylaldimines and ketimines undergo thermal 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization to generate a wide range of azabicyclic o&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs). These o&#8208;QDMs exist as a hybrid of a diene and a benzylic diradical. The diradical nature was confirmed by their ability to undergo dimerization and react with H&#8208;atom donor, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and O2. In addition, the interception of the diradicaloid o&#8208;QDMs by H&#8208;atom transfer was used to synthesize five tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids and related bioactive molecules. The diene form can undergo [4+2] cycloaddition reactions with different dienophiles to generate bridged azabicycles in high endo:exo selectivity. The azabicyclic o&#8208;QDMs can be generated for [4+2] cycloaddition from a wide range of electronically and sterically varied 2&#8208;alkenylarylimines, including mono, di, tri and tetrasubstituted alkenes, and imines derived from arylamine, alkylamine (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;), benzylamine, benzylsulfonamide and Boc&#8208;amine.

         <title>Photocatalytic Multisite Functionalization of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes by Merging Polar Cycloaddition and Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is established by merging dipolar cycloaddition with photoredox promoted radical ring&#8208;opening remote C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. This transformation was triggered by XAT followed by a cascade of 1,5&#8208;HAT and intermolecular fluorine atom transfer. With this method, a broad spectrum of valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;nitrile products are synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes.







Abstract
Although highly appealing for rapid access of molecular complexity, multi&#8208;functionalization of alkenes that allows incorporation of more than two functional groups remains a prominent challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy that merges dipolar cycloaddition with photoredox promoted radical ring&#8208;opening remote C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, thus enabling a smooth 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes. A highly regioselective [3+2] cycloaddition anchors a reaction trigger onto alkene substrates. The subsequent halogen atom transfer (XAT) selectively initiates ring&#8208;opening process, which is followed by a series of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8208;HAT) and intermolecular fluorine atom transfer (FAT) events. With this method, site&#8208;selective introduction of three different functional groups is accomplished and a broad spectrum of valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;nitrile products are synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes.

         <title>Strong Enhancement in Cobalt(II)&#8208;TPMA Aqueous Hydrogen Photosynthesis through Intramolecular Proton Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of proton relays close to the catalytic metal center boosts hydrogen photosynthesis with cobalt(II) TPMA complexes leading to a 4&#8208;fold increase in quantum efficiency and up to a 22&#8208;fold gain in turnover number.







Abstract
Photosynthetic hydrogen generation by cobalt(II) tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) complexes is mainly limited by protonation kinetics and decomposition routes involving demetallation. In the present work we have explored the effects of both proton shuttles and improved rigidity on the catalytic ability of cobalt(II) TPMA complexes. Remarkably, we demonstrate that, while a small enhancement in the catalytic performance is attained in a rigid cage structure, the introduction of ammonium groups as proton transfer relays in close proximity to the cobalt center allows to reach a 4&#8208;fold increase in the quantum efficiency of H2 formation, and a surprising 22&#8208;fold gain in the maximum turnover number, at low catalyst concentration. The beneficial role of the ammonium relays in promoting faster intramolecular proton transfer to the reduced cobalt center is documented by transient absorption spectroscopy, showcasing the great relevance of tuning the catalyst periphery to achieve efficient catalysis of solar fuel formation.

Remarkably, we demonstrate that, while a small enhancement in the catalytic performance is attained in a rigid cage structure, the introduction of ammonium groups as proton transfer relays in close proximity to the cobalt center allows to reach a 4-fold increase in the quantum efficiency of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation, and a surprising 22-fold gain in the maximum turnover number, at low catalyst concentration. The beneficial role of the ammonium relays in promoting faster intramolecular proton transfer to the reduced cobalt center is documented by transient absorption spectroscopy, showcasing the great relevance of tuning the catalyst periphery to achieve efficient catalysis of solar fuel formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing the Microenvironment in Solid Polymer Electrolytes by Anion Vacancy Coupled with Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D flower&#8208;like SnS2 composite with abundant sulfur vacancies is synthesized under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots, and it is employed as filler to optimize the microenvironment in solid polymer electrolytes. As a result, the constructed composite electrolyte not only exhibits high room temperature ionic conductivity and Li+ transference number but also demonstrates significantly improved mechanical properties, providing solid state lithium metal batteries with excellent cycling stability and extended cycle life.







Abstract
The practical application of solid polymer electrolyte is hindered by the small transference number of Li+, low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial stability, which are seriously determined by the microenvironment in polymer electrolyte. The introduction of functional fillers is an effective solution to these problems. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is demonstrated that the anion vacancy of filler can anchor anions of lithium salt, thereby significantly increasing the transference number of Li+ in the electrolyte. Therefore, flower&#8208;like SnS2&#8208;based filler with abundant sulfur vacancies is prepared under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots (CDs). It is worth mentioning that the CDs dotted on the surface of SnS2 have rich organic functional groups, which can serve as the bridging agent to enhance the compatibility of filler and polymer, leading to superior mechanical performance and fast ion transport pathway. Additionally, the in situ formed Li2S/Li3N at the interface of Li metal and electrolyte facilitate the fast Li+ diffusion and uniform Li deposition, effectively mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. As a result, the assembled lithium metal batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability, reflecting the superiority of the carbon dots derived vacancy&#8208;rich inorganic filler modification strategy.

         <title>Enantioselective (3+2) Annulation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Aldehydes and Ketones Catalyzed by Br&#248;nsted Bases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalyzed enantioselective annulation of aldehydes and ketones with donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes generating chiral tetrahydrofurans is presented. For both aldehydes and ketones high yields and excellent stereoselectivities are obtained. Some intriguing mechanistic aspects are discussed, and stereoselective transformations are demonstrated.







Abstract
The substituted tetrahydrofuran core is a structural motif in many biologically active and natural compounds. However, the scarcity of enantioselective methods developed towards its synthesis makes this field challenging and attractive to explore. Herein, the first Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalyzed enantioselective (3+2) annulation of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with aldehydes and ketones affording enantioenriched 2,3,5&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofurans is reported. The reaction concept is based on activation of racemic &#946;&#8208;cyclopropyl ketones by a chiral bifunctional Br&#248;nsted base which catalyzes the (3+2) annulation for a range of aldehydes and ketones. For aldehydes, the annulation furnished tetrahydrofurans in excellent yield, good diastereoselectivity and with excellent enantioselectivity up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Surprisingly, aromatic aldehydes afforded the cis&#8208;2,5&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofurans as the major diastereoisomer, while for aliphatic aldehydes the trans&#8208;cycloadduct was favored. The reaction also proceeds well for ketones affording spiro tetrahydrofurans in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Hammett studies have been conducted to elucidate the influence of the electronic nature of benzaldehydes on the stereoselectivity. Based on the diastereochemical outcome for the aldehydes, two reaction paths for aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes are proposed. Finally, two diastereoselective synthetic transformations have been conducted to demonstrate the synthetic potential of the obtained products.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Cuprous&#8208;Based Metal Halides with Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Crystal Structure for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halide, (DFPD)CuX2 (where DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium and X&#8722;=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;), was synthesized. Its conduction band displays enhanced dispersive characteristics with a small effective mass, facilitating higher electron mobility and more efficient electrical injection in light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications.







Abstract
Ternary cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halides, represented by cesium copper iodide (e.g., CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5), are garnering increasing interest for light&#8208;emitting applications owing to their intrinsically high photoluminescence quantum yield and direct band gap. Toward electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), it is highly desirable for the light emitters to have a high structural dimensionality as it may favor efficient electrical injection. However, unlike lead&#8208;based halide perovskites whose light&#8208;emitting units can be facilely arranged in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ways, to date, nearly all ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides crystallize into 0D or 1D networks of Cu&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) polyhedra, whereas 3D and even 2D structures remain mostly uncharted. Here, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a new kind of ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides, (DFPD)CuX2 (DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium), which exhibits unique 2D layered crystal structure. Theoretical calculations reveal a highly dispersive conduction band of (DFPD)CuBr2, which is beneficial for charge carrier injection. It is also of particular significance to find that the 2D (DFPD)CuBr2 crystals show appealing properties, including improved ambient stability and an efficient warm white&#8208;light emission, making it a promising candidate for single&#8208;component lighting and display applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Chiral Polymers Exhibiting Amplified Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers were synthesized by integrating chiral BN&#8208;moiety into polyfluorene backbone. The chiral polymers showed narrowband emission, high PLQY and large |glum| value. Moreover, the solution&#8208;processed nondoped CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibited EQEmax of 9.8&#8201;%, |gEL| of 0.07, and FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, simultaneously. This is the first case of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers combining high EQE, large gEL value and narrowband emission.







Abstract
Circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is highly promising in realm of 3D display and optical data storage. However, designing a groundbreaking chiral material with high comprehensive CPEL performance remains a formidable challenge. In this work, a pair of chiral polymers with self&#8208;assembled behavior is designed by integrating a chiral BN&#8208;moiety into polyfluorene backbone, named R&#8208;PBN and S&#8208;PBN, respectively. The chiral polymers show narrowband emission centered at 490&#8197;nm with full&#8208;width half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#8197;nm and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 79&#8201;%. After thermal annealing treatment, the chiral polymers undergo self&#8208;assembly, exhibiting amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with asymmetry factor (|glum|) of up to 0.11. Moreover, the solution&#8208;processed nondoped CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the chiral polymers as emitting layers exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.8&#8201;%, intense CPEL activities with |gEL| of up to 0.07, and small FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, simultaneously. This represents the first case of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers that combines high EQE, large gEL value and narrowband emission.

         <title>3D Lead&#8208;Organoselenide&#8208;Halide Perovskites and their Mixed&#8208;Chalcogenide and Mixed&#8208;Halide Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenium is introduced into the halide perovskite framework, for the first time, using the zwitterionic selenocysteamine. The average and local structures of these mixed&#8208;anion perovskites help determine the band structures and potential trap states, respectively. Calculations show dispersive bands and direct gaps, which can be further tuned to straddle the ideal values for tandem solar cells using halide alloying and chalcogenide alloying.







Abstract
We incorporate Se into the 3D halide perovskite framework using the zwitterionic ligand: SeCYS (+NH3(CH2)2Se&#8722;), which occupies both the X&#8722; and A+ sites in the prototypical ABX3 perovskite. The new organoselenide&#8208;halide perovskites: (SeCYS)PbX2 (X=Cl, Br) expand upon the recently discovered organosulfide&#8208;halide perovskites. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function analysis reveal the average structures of the organoselenide&#8208;halide perovskites, whereas the local lead coordination environments and their distributions were probed through solid&#8208;state 77Se and 207Pb NMR, complemented by theoretical simulations. Density functional theory calculations illustrate that the band structures of (SeCYS)PbX2 largely resemble those of their S analogs, with similar band dispersion patterns, yet with a considerable band gap decrease. Optical absorbance measurements indeed show band gaps of 2.07 and 1.86&#8197;eV for (SeCYS)PbX2 with X=Cl and Br, respectively. We further demonstrate routes to alloying the halides (Cl, Br) and chalcogenides (S, Se) continuously tuning the band gap from 1.86 to 2.31&#8197;eV&#8211;straddling the ideal range for tandem solar cells or visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. The comprehensive description of the average and local structures, and how they can fine&#8208;tune the band gap and potential trap states, respectively, establishes the foundation for understanding this new perovskite family, which combines solid&#8208;state and organo&#8208;main&#8208;group chemistry.

         <title>Molecular Recognition in Mechanochemistry: Insights from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemically&#8208;induced molecular recognition processes have been studied by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy using &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA), serine, and alanine as representative substrates. To disentangle different mechanochemical effects, a mixer mill and a resonant acoustic mixer were applied as mixing devices.







Abstract
Molecular&#8208;recognition events are highly relevant in biology and chemistry. In the present study, we investigated such processes in the solid state under mechanochemical conditions using the formation of racemic phases upon reacting enantiopure entities as example. As test systems, &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA) and the amino acids serine and alanine were used. The effects of ball&#8208;milling and resonant acoustic mixing (RAM) on the formation of racemic phases were probed by using solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In a mixer mill, a highly efficient and fast racemic phase formation occurred for both TFLA and the two amino acids. RAM led to the racemic phase for TFLA also, and this process was facilitated upon employing pre&#8208;milled enantiopure entities. In contrast, under comparable conditions RAM did not result in the formation of racemic phases for serine and alanine.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Urea from CO2 and Nitrate by a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Dual Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main challenge for urea electrosynthesis is to operate at both high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density. Here, we report a sustainable method for urea electrosynthesis from CO2 and NO3&#8722; using a novel MOF catalyst, PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O, achieving high efficiency and stability, and demonstrating potential for industrial scale&#8208;up.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of urea from CO2 and NO3&#8722; is a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive industrial processes. The main challenge hindering the progress of this technology lies in the development of advanced electrocatalysts that efficiently utilize abundant, low&#8208;cost CO2 and nitrogen sources to yield urea with both high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density. In this work, we designed and prepared a new two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), namely PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O, constructed by nickel&#8208;phthalocyanine (NiPc) ligands and square&#8208;planar FeO4 nodes, as the electrocatalyst for urea electrosynthesis. PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O exhibits remarkable performance to yield urea at a high current density of 10.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a high FE(urea) of 54.1&#8201;% in a neutral aqueous solution, surpassing those of most reported electrocatalysts. No obvious performance degradation was observed over 20&#8197;hours of continuous operation at the current density of 10.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. By expanding the electrode area to 25&#8197;cm2 and operating for 8&#8197;hours, we obtained 0.164&#8197;g of high&#8208;purity urea, underscoring its potential for industrial applications. Mechanism study unveiled the enhanced performance might be ascribed to the synergistic interaction between NiPc and FeO4 sites. Specifically, NH3 produced at the FeO4 site can efficiently migrate and couple with the *NHCOOH intermediate adsorbed on the urea&#8208;producing site (NiPc). This synergistic effect results in a lower energy barrier for C&#8722;N bond formation than those of the reported catalysts with single active sites.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial enzymes that operate with pnictogen bonds or &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in general are introduced: Transfer hydrogenation of quinolines accelerates with biotinylated pnictogen&#8208;bonding cofactors and their interfacing with streptavidin and mutants, shows saturation behavior with transition&#8208;state recognition three orders of magnitude beyond substrate recognition, and the emergence of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The objective of this study was to create artificial enzymes that capitalize on pnictogen bonding, a &#963;&#8208;hole interaction that is essentially absent in biocatalysis. For this purpose, stibine catalysts were equipped with a biotin derivative and combined with streptavidin mutants to identify an efficient transfer hydrogenation catalyst for the reduction of a fluorogenic quinoline substrate. Increased catalytic activity from wild&#8208;type streptavidin to the best mutants coincides with the depth of the &#963; hole on the Sb(V) center, and the emergence of saturation kinetic behavior. Michaelis&#8211;Menten analysis reveals transition&#8208;state recognition in the low micromolar range, more than three orders of magnitude stronger than the millimolar substrate recognition. Carboxylates preferred by the best mutants contribute to transition&#8208;state recognition by hydrogen&#8208;bonded ion pairing and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions with the emerging pyridinium product. The emergence of challenging stereoselectivity in aqueous systems further emphasizes compatibility of pnictogen bonding with higher order systems catalysis.

         <title>Versatile Dehydration&#8208;Assisted Functionalization of Quantum Dots and Rods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dehydration&#8208;assisted functionalization (DAF) enables rapid ligand exchange and dense surface modification of quantum dots (QDs) and quantum rods (QRs). This study highlights DAF's role in preparing chiral QRs, engineering QD surface charge, utilizing QR aggregates, and conjugating DNA onto cadmium&#8208;free InP/ZnS QDs. DAF provides a versatile solution for diverse QD and QR functionalization applications.







Abstract

         <title>Targeting Mitochondrial Guanine Quadruplexes for Photoactivatable Chemotherapy in Hypoxic Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an oxygen independent photoactivatable chemotherapeutic, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3, that targets mitochondrial guanine quadruplexes. Photoirradiation induces depletion of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial dysfunction causing cell death by triggering apoptosis. Importantly, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 is negligibly toxic under dark conditions but upon irradiation, significant toxicity is observed.







Abstract
A first example of a mitochondrial G&#8208;quadruplex (mitoG4s) targeted Ru(II) photooxidant complex is reported. The complex, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 induces photodamage toward guanine quadruplexes (G4s) located in the mitochondrial genome under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 shows high affinity for mitoG4s and localises within mitochondria of live HeLa cells. Immunolabelling with anti&#8208;G4 antibody, BG4, confirms Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 associates with G4s within the mitochondria of fixed cells. The complex induces depletion of mtDNA in live cells under irradiation at 405&#8197;nm, confirmed by loss of PicoGreen signal from mitochondria. Biochemical studies confirm this process induces apoptosis. The complex shows low dark toxicity and an impressive phototoxicity index (PI) of &gt;89 was determined in Hela under very low intensity irradiation, 5&#8197;J/cm2. The phototoxicity is thought to operate through both Type&#8197;II singlet oxygen and Type&#8197;III pathways depending on normoxic or hypoxic conditions, from live cell assays and plasmid DNA cleavage. Overall, we demonstrate targeting mitoG4s and mtDNA with a photooxidant is a potent route to achieving apoptosis under hypoxic conditions that can be extended to phototherapy.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Triggered H&#8208;Abstraction Photoinitiators for the Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Independent Therapy of Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first red&#8208;light triggered H&#8208;abstraction photoinitiators for hypoxic cancer photodynamic therapy. The photoinitiator can initiate red&#8208;light&#8208;induced H&#8208;abstraction with intracellular biomolecules to induce necroptosis and ferroptosis. Moreover, photoinitiator was degraded following H&#8208;abstraction, avoiding the long&#8208;term phototoxicity. This study provides a crucial molecular strategy for hypoxic tumor therapy.







Abstract
The clinical application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is limited by oxygen&#8208;dependence and side effects caused by photosensitizer residues. Photoinitiators based on the H&#8208;abstraction reaction can address these challenges because they can generate alkyl radical&#8208;killing cells independently of oxygen and undergo rapid bleaching following H&#8208;abstraction. Nonetheless, the development of photoinitiators for PDT has been impeded by the absence of effective design strategies. Herein, we have developed aryl&#8208;ketone substituted cyanine (ACy&#8722;R), the first red&#8208;light triggered H&#8208;abstraction photoinitiators for hypoxic cancer therapy. These ACy&#8722;R molecules inherited the near&#8208;infrared absorption of cyanine dye, and aryl&#8208;ketone modification imparted H&#8208;abstraction capability. Experimental and quantum calculations revealed that modifying the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of the aryl (e.g., ACy&#8208;5F) improved the contribution of the O atom to the photon excitation process promoting intersystem crossing and H&#8208;abstraction ability. Particularly, ACy&#8208;5F rapidly penetrated cells and enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum. Even under severe hypoxia, ACy&#8208;5F initiated red&#8208;light induced H&#8208;abstraction with intracellular biomolecules, inducing necroptosis and ferroptosis. Moreover, ACy&#8208;5F was degraded after H&#8208;abstraction, thus avoiding the side effects of long&#8208;term phototoxicity after therapy. This study not only provides a crucial molecular tool for hypoxic tumors therapy, but also presents a promising strategy for the development of multifunctional photosensitizers and photoinitiators.

         <title>Spirobipyridine Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of spirobipyridine ligands has been developed to achieve remote site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of alkaloids for iridium catalysis. The &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; in ligands facilitates specific C&#8722;H bonds of multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives towards the metal center via non&#8208;covalent interactions, while simultaneously blocking other sites. Notably, this approach is applicable to a broad range of alkaloids with diverse functional groups.







Abstract
The selective borylation of specific C&#8722;H bonds in organic synthesis remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a novel spirobipyridine ligand that features a binaphthyl backbone. This ligand facilitates the iridium&#8208;catalyzed selective C&#8722;H borylation of benzene derivatives. The ligand is designed with &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; substituents that allow vicinal di&#8208; or multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives to approach metal center and effectively block other reactive sites by non&#8208;covalent interactions with substrates. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful selective distal C&#8722;H activation of various alkaloids and its broad compatibility with functional groups.

         <title>Sterically Controlled Lewis Acid&#8722;Base Interaction Toward para&#8208;Selective Borylation of Aromatic Aldimines and Benzylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for para selective C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic aldimines and benzylamines has been developed using iridium catalysis. While aromatic aldimines participate in a sterically controlled Lewis acid&#8722;base interaction where the in situ generated pinacolborane acts as a transient directing group (DG), interestingly the origin of the para selectivity of benzylamines stems from the sterical demand of the N&#8208;substituents.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization of arenes at the para position remains extremely challenging primarily due to its relative inaccessibility from the catalytic site. As a consequence, it is significantly restricted to limited molecular scaffolds. Herein, we report a method for the para&#8208;C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic aldimines and benzylamines using commercially available ligands under iridium catalysis. The established method displays excellent para selectivity for variously substituted aromatic aldimines, benzylamines and bioactive molecules. Based on several control experiments, it is proposed that a Lewis acid&#8722;base interaction between the nitrogen and boron functionality guides the para selectivity via a steric shield for the aromatic aldimines, where Bpin acts as a transient directing group. However, the steric shield of the in situ generated N&#8722;Bpin moiety controlled the overall selectivity for the para borylation of benzylamines.

         <title>Development of a Fluorescent Probe with High Selectivity based on Thiol&#8208;ene Click Nucleophilic Cascade Reactions for Delving into the Action Mechanism of Serotonin in Depression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to achieve rapid and accurate detection of serotonin in organisms is a key question in studying the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders such as depression. To study the action mechanism of serotonin, we have developed a highly selective molecular probe based on thiol&#8208;ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions that enables real&#8208;time imaging of brain tissues in depression.







Abstract
The intrinsic correlation between depression and serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is a highly debated topic, with significant implications for the diagnosis, treatment, and advancement of drugs targeting neurological disorders. To address this important question, it is of utmost priority to understand the action mechanism of serotonin in depression through fluorescence imaging studies. However, the development of efficient molecular probes for serotonin is hindered by the lack of responsive sites with high selectivity for serotonin at the present time. Herein, we developed the first highly selective serotonin responsive site, 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate, utilizing thiol&#8208;ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions. The novel responsive site was then employed to construct the powerful molecular probe SJ&#8208;5&#8208;HT for imaging the serotonin level changes in the depression cells and brain tissues. Importantly, the imaging studies reveal that the level of serotonin in patients with depression may not be the primary factor, while the ability of neurons in patients with depression to release serotonin appears to be more critical. Additionally, this serotonin release capability correlates strongly with the levels of mTOR (intracellular mammalian target of rapamycin). These discoveries could offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning depression and furnish mTOR as a novel direction for the advancement of antidepressant therapies.

&lt;p&gt;How to achieve rapid and accurate detection of serotonin in organisms is a key question in studying the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders such as depression. To study the action mechanism of serotonin, we have developed a highly selective molecular probe based on thiol-ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions that enables real-time imaging of brain tissues in depression.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intrinsic correlation between depression and serotonin (5-HT) is a highly debated topic, with significant implications for the diagnosis, treatment, and advancement of drugs targeting neurological disorders. To address this important question, it is of utmost priority to understand the action mechanism of serotonin in depression through fluorescence imaging studies. However, the development of efficient molecular probes for serotonin is hindered by the lack of responsive sites with high selectivity for serotonin at the present time. Herein, we developed the first highly selective serotonin responsive site, 3-mercaptopropionate, utilizing thiol-ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions. The novel responsive site was then employed to construct the powerful molecular probe &lt;b&gt;SJ-5-HT&lt;/b&gt; for imaging the serotonin level changes in the depression cells and brain tissues. Importantly, the imaging studies reveal that the level of serotonin in patients with depression may not be the primary factor, while the ability of neurons in patients with depression to release serotonin appears to be more critical. Additionally, this serotonin release capability correlates strongly with the levels of mTOR (intracellular mammalian target of rapamycin).

         <title>The Reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 Nanorods for Efficient and pH&#8208;universal Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Te&#8722;Bi NRs were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 NRs under the CO2RR condition. The obtained Te&#8722;Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO2RR towards formate with high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline).







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to generate chemical fuels such as formate presents a promising route to a carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, its practical application is hindered by the competing CO production and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as the lack of pH&#8208;universal catalysts. Here, Te&#8208;modified Bi nanorods (Te&#8722;Bi NRs) were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 NRs under the CO2RR condition. Our study illustrates that the complex reconstruction process of Bi2Te4O11 NRs during CO2RR could be decoupled into three distinct steps, i.e., the destruction of Bi2Te4O11, the formation of Te/Bi phases, and the dissolution of Te. The thus&#8208;obtained Te&#8722;Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO2RR towards formate production, showing high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline). In a flow cell reactor under neutral, alkaline, or acidic conditions, the catalysts achieved HCOOH Faradaic efficiencies of up to 94.3&#8201;%, 96.4&#8201;%, and 91.0&#8201;%, respectively, at a high current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations, along with operando spectral measurements, reveal that Te manipulates the Bi sites to an electron&#8208;deficient state, enhancing the adsorption strength of the *OCHO intermediate, and significantly suppressing the competing HER and CO production. This study highlights the substantial influence of catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions and offers insights into designing highly active and stable electrocatalysts towards CO2RR.

         <title>Customized Photoelectrochemical C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P Bond Formation Enabled by Tailored Deposition on Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With customized designs of the deposition layer on the BiVO4 photoanode, two PEC systems were developed for highly efficient catalytic C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P bond formation. The modified BiVO4@Al2O3 demonstrated substantial performances for important yet challenging coupling between amides and xanthenes under aerobic conditions, whereas BiVO4@Ni1Co7Pi manifested its versatility in C&#8722;P coupling between aryl bromides and diphenylphosphine oxide, facilitated by a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cycle under ultralow potentials.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) is burgeoning as an innovative solution to organic synthesis. However, the current PEC systems suffer from limited reaction types and unsatisfactory performances. Herein, we employ efficient BiVO4 photoanodes with tailored deposition layers for customizing two PEC approaches toward C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P bond formation. Our process proceeds under mild reaction conditions, deploying easily available substrates and ultra&#8208;low potentials. Beyond photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, customized PEC offers high efficiency, good functional group tolerance, and substantial applicability for decorating drug molecules, highlighting its promising potential to enrich the synthetic toolbox for broader organic chemistry of practical applications.

         <title>Subsurface Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Enabled by Mechanochemical Synthesis for Oxidation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical approach has been shown to be an effective method of regulating the position of single atoms. Controlling single atoms at the surface or subsurface results in catalysts with very different adsorption properties, leading to different reaction mechanisms. As a result, the subsurface Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst shifts the conversion profile 80&#8197;K towards the low&#8208;temperature region and NH3 is completely converted at 513&#8197;K.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional atom utilization and unique properties. However, the practical application of these catalysts is often impeded by challenges such as sintering&#8208;induced instability and poisoning of isolated atoms due to strong gas adsorption. In this study, we employed the mechanochemical method to insert single Cu atoms into the subsurface of Fe2O3 support. By manipulating the location of single atoms at the surface or subsurface, catalysts with distinct adsorption properties and reaction mechanisms can be achieved. It was observed that the subsurface Cu single atoms in Fe2O3 remained isolated under both oxidation and reduction environments, whereas surface Cu single atoms on Fe2O3 experienced sintering under reduction conditions. The unique properties of these subsurface single&#8208;atom catalysts call for innovations and new understandings in catalyst design.

         <title>Dual Channel Emissions of Kasha and Anti&#8208;Kasha from a Single Radical Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable mono&#8208;radical counterpart of the chlorine&#8208;substituted Chichibabins's hydrocarbon displays dual&#8208;channel emissions of Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha. This coexistence of two types of luminescence is observed for the first time in the field of luminescent radicals.







Abstract
Stable open&#8208;shell luminescent radicals have recently attracted much attention due to their unique luminescence properties. However, a radical molecule with both Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha doublet emission properties has not been reported. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a stable chlorine&#8208;substituted Chichibabin's hydrocarbon, TTM&#8208;TTM, along with its mono&#8208;radical counterpart, TTM&#8208;HTTM. The emission of TTM&#8208;TTM follows Kasha's rule in the near infrared region. However, TTM&#8208;HTTM shows dual channel doublet emissions of Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha. Remarkably, these two types of emission compete dynamically in both solution and condensed states. Our findings provide valuable insights into the rational design and discovery of stable radicals that possess distinctive luminescent properties, thus broadening the horizons of luminescent materials research.

We have synthesized a long&#8208;chain polyamide (polyethyleneamide) from polyethylene bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketone) by the oxime formation and the following Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) worked as a reactive promoter of Beckmann rearrangement to achieve high conversion to amide functional group at mild condition without significant decrease of molecular weight. The formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding in amide group is further confirmed.







Abstract
Long&#8208;chain polyamides (polyethyleneamides) were prepared from polyethylenes bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketones) by the oxime formation and successive Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) was utilized as a promoter, which allowed mild conversion of the oxime group in spite of low solubility of the polymers. The polyethyleneamide exhibited different tensile property compared to a commercial HDPE.

         <title>Using Porous Liquids to Perform Liquid&#8208;Liquid Separations</title>

A schematic of monoethylene glycol (MEG) adsorption measurements using a permeable membrane and a Type&#8197;3 porous liquid showing selective adsorption due to inclusion into the pores of the dispersed porous solid.







Abstract
Porous liquids (PLs) are a new type of fluid sorbent investigated mainly for the separation of gas mixtures. Here, we explore their application to the separation of miscible liquids, using MEG/water (MEG=monoethylene glycol) and EtOH/water as proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle. Recovery of used MEG is industrially important but its extraction into conventional solvents from water is difficult. PLs ZIF&#8208;8@PDMS (PL1, PDMS=polydimethylsilicone) or ZIF&#8208;8@sesame oil (PL2) each consisting of 25&#8197;wt&#8201;% of the hydrophobic microporous material ZIF&#8208;8 dispersed in PDMS or sesame oil respectively, were formulated and found to be exceedingly physically stable to sedimentation. A 5&#8197;nm PEEK membrane was used to provide a permeable barrier between the PL and the alcohol/water phase. MEG was selectively extracted through the membrane from approximately 50&#8201;:&#8201;50&#8197;wt&#8201;% MEG/water mixtures into the PL phase and this procedure could be applied repeatedly. It was effective for MEG/water mixtures as dilute as 3&#8201;:&#8201;97&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The PL could also be regenerated (80&#8201;&#176;C at 0.01&#8197;bar) and re&#8208;used, suggesting its potential for continuous, cyclic extraction. Furthermore, PL3 (silicalite&#8208;1@PDMS) was effective in selective alcohol extraction from beverages. It shows potential for lowering the alcohol concentration in gin or wine due to its excellent chemical stability and nontoxicity. Overall, we show that the enhanced adsorption properties of PLs due the presence of empty pores,&#160;which provides unusually high gas solubilities, also makes them, in principle, applicable to liquid&#8208;liquid separations.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Realized in a Single Lead Halide Perovskite across the Visible&#8208;Light Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;full &#8208;spectrum emissions are achieved in a single component 2D lead halide perovskites by applying hydrostatic pressure.This work establishes a new pathway to achieve the PL full&#8208;spectrum emission and provide valuable insights into the relationship between the HP&#8208;PL emissions and high&#8208;pressure phase transitions.







Abstract
The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full&#8208;spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620&#8197;nm, in a single&#8208;component two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)2PbBr4 (ETA+=(HO)(CH2)2NH3+), is reported, achieved through high&#8208;pressure treatment. A pressure&#8208;induced phase transition occurs upon compression, transforming the crystal structure from an orthorhombic phase under ambient conditions to a monoclinic structure at high pressure. This phase transition driven by the adaptive and dynamic configuration changes of organic amine cations enables an effective and continuous narrowing of the band gap in this halide crystal. The hydrogen bonding interactions between inorganic layers and organic amine cations (N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds) efficiently modulate the organic amine cations penetration and the octahedral distortion. Consequently, this phenomenon induces a phase transition and results in red&#8208;shifted PL emissions, leading to the near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum emission. This work opens a possibility for achieving wide PL emissions with coverage across the visible light spectrum by employing high pressure in single halide perovskites.

         <title>Dihydropyridopyrazine Functionalized Xanthene: Generating Stable NIR Dyes with Small&#8208;Molecular Weight by Enhanced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared a general method to enhance the absorption and emission wavelengths of traditional fluorophores by simply appending a modular structure, dihydropyridopyrazine. Owing to its great charge separation feature, the dihydropyridopyrazine significantly enhanced the internal charge transfer states of traditional fluorophores, resulting in greatly redshifted wavelengths of the reconstructed dyes together with a small molecular weight increase, retained stability and biocompatibility.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared region (NIR; 650&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) dyes offer many advantages over traditional dyes with absorption and emission in the visible region. However, developing new NIR dyes, especially organic dyes with long wavelengths, small molecular weight, and excellent stability and biocompatibility, is still quite challenging. Herein, we present a general method to enhance the absorption and emission wavelengths of traditional fluorophores by simply appending a charge separation structure, dihydropyridopyrazine. These novel NIR dyes not only exhibited greatly redshifted wavelengths compared to their parent dyes, but also displayed a small molecular weight increase together with retained stability and biocompatibility. Specifically, dye NIR&#8208;OX, a dihydropyridopyra&#8208;zine derivative of oxazine with a molecular mass of 386.2&#8197;Da, exhibited an absorption at 822&#8197;nm and an emission extending to 1200&#8197;nm, making it one of the smallest molecular&#8208;weight NIR&#8208;II emitting dyes. Thanks to its rapid metabolism and long wave&#8208;length, NIR&#8208;OX enabled high&#8208;contrast bioimaging and assessment of cholestatic liver injury in vivo and also facilitated the evalua&#8208;tion of the efficacy of liver protection medicines against cholestatic liver injury.

         <title>Outstanding Superoxide Dismutase Catalytic Activity Of Simple Peptide&#8208;Based Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be positive! A novel Ni superoxide dismutase mimic was engineered, taking advantage of the versatility of the Amino Terminal CuII&#8208; and NiII&#8208;binding (ATCUN) motif to introduce positive charges around the NiII center. This strategy yielded the most potent synthetic NiSOD mimic reported to date, in terms of catalytic efficacy and stability.







Abstract
We present here the most active synthetic Ni superoxide dismutase (NiSOD) mimic reported to date. Reactive oxygen species are aggressive compounds, which concentrations are tightly regulated in vivo. Among them, the superoxide anion, O2&#8901;&#8722;, is controlled by superoxide dismutases. Capitalizing on the versatility of the Amino&#8208;Terminal CuII&#8208; and NiII&#8208;binding (ATCUN) peptide motif, we introduced positive charges around the NiII center to favor the interaction with the superoxide radical anion. At physiological pH, the pentapeptide H&#8722;Cys&#8722;His&#8722;Cys&#8722;Arg&#8722;Arg&#8722;NH2 coordinates NiII after the deprotonation of one thiol, two amides, and either the second thiol or the N&#8208;terminal ammonium, leading to an equilibrium between the two N3S1 and N2S2 coordination modes. Under catalytic conditions, a kcat value of 8.6(4)&#215;106&#8197;L.mol&#8722;1.s&#8722;1 was measured. Within the first second, the catalyst remained undegraded with quantitative consumption of O2&#8901;&#8722; (completed up to 37 catalytic cycles). An extra arginine (Arg) was introduced at the peptide C&#8208;terminus to increase the global charge of the NiII complex from +1 to +2. This had no effect on the catalytic performance, highlighting the critical role of charge distribution in space as a determining factor influencing the reactivity.

Within the first second, the catalyst remained undegraded with quantitative consumption of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (completed up to 37 catalytic cycles). An extra arginine (Arg) was introduced at the peptide C-terminus to increase the global charge of the Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex from +1 to +2. This had no effect on the catalytic performance, highlighting the critical role of charge distribution in space as a determining factor influencing the reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;time in vivo metabolic flux tracking in MIA PaCa&#8208;2 human pancreatic xenografts via MRI is made possible with [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate hyperpolarized through Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei (SABRE&#8208;SHEATH). The use of a perfluorinated iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend allowed efficient separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and resulting in a 22&#8201;% increase in the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate signal. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jessica Ettedgui and co&#8208;workers (e202407349).

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Responsive Formation Cycling Enabling LiF&#8208;Rich Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discover a novel additive&#8208;free strategy to create LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) through low&#8208;temperature formation cycling. Achieving superior battery performance across a wide temperature range, this approach is applicable to various cathode systems, highlighting its versatility and potential for advancing battery technology.







Abstract
Formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase is highly desirable for wide&#8208;temperature battery, but its application is hindered by the unwanted side reactions associated with conventional method of introducing fluorinated additives. Here, we developed an additive&#8208;free strategy to produce LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) by low&#8208;temperature formation cycling. Using LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 as a model cathode, the atomic ratio of LiF in the CEI formed at &#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C is about 17.7&#8201;%, enhanced by ~550&#8201;% compared to CEI formed at 25&#8201;&#176;C (2.7&#8201;%). The underlying mechanism is uncovered by both experiments and theoretic simulation, indicating that the decomposition of LiPF6 to LiF is transformed into spontaneous and exothermic on positively charged cathode surface and lowering the temperature shift chemical equilibrium towards the formation of LiF&#8208;rich CEI. Superior to conventional fluorinated additives, this approach is free from unwanted side reactions, imparting batteries with both high&#8208;temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C) cyclability and low&#8208;temperature rate performance (capacity enhanced by 100&#8201;% at 3&#8197;C at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). This low&#8208;temperature formation cycling to construct LiF&#8208;rich CEI is extended to various cathode systems, such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2, LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, demonstrating the versatility and potential impact of our strategy in advancing the performance and stability of wide&#8208;temperature batteries and beyond.

         <title>Designed Synthesis of an Aluminum Molecular Ring Based Rotaxane and Polyrotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multisite and adaptive Al8 macrocycle demonstrates a groundbreaking capacity to sequentially encapsulate molecules, complexes, and polymers through &#8220;ring&#8208;donor&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;axle&#8208;acceptor&#8221; interactions. This progressive encapsulation culminates in the formation of an endless polyrotaxane structure, &#8220;the Al8 rock sugar gourd&#8221;. These distinct host&#8211;guest interactions bestow the Al8 macrocycles with customizable optical&#8208;limiting functionalities.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules, such as rotaxanes, have drawn significant attention within supramolecular chemistry. Although a variety of macrocycles have been thoroughly explored in rotaxane synthesis, metal&#8208;organic macrocycles remain relatively under&#8208;investigated. Aluminum molecular rings, with their inner cavities and numerous binding sites, present a promising option for constructing rotaxanes. Here, we introduce an innovative &#8220;ring&#8208;donor&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;axle&#8208;acceptor&#8221; motif utilizing Al8 molecular rings, enabling the stepwise assembly of molecules, complexes, and polymers through tailored coordination chemistry. This novel approach can not only be applied to macrocycle&#8208;based systems like catenanes but also enhance specific functionalities progressively.

         <title>Perylene with Split&#8208;Azulene Embedding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with split azulene embedment remain experimentally rare, despite their exceptional properties. Herein, Pery&#8208;57 with split azulene is synthesized and exhibits remarkable characteristics like NIR II absorption, p&#8208;type transport, and outstanding redox features like diradical character, global antiaromaticity, hydrogen capture. This work stimulates new interest in azulene&#8208;like nonalternant PAHs.







Abstract
Splitting the five and seven&#8208;membered rings of azulene and embedding them separately into a conjugated backbone provides azulene&#8208;like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are of great interest in quantum and material chemistry. However, the synthetic accessibility poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present the synthesis of a novel azulene&#8208;like PAH, Pery&#8208;57, which can be viewed as the integration of a perylene framework into the split azulene. The compact structure of Pery&#8208;57 displays several intriguing characteristics, including NIR II absorption at 1200&#8197;nm, a substantial dipole moment of 3.5&#8197;D, and head&#8208;to&#8208;tail alternating columnar packing. Furthermore, Pery&#8208;57 exhibits remarkable redox properties. The cationic radical Pery&#8208;57&#8901;+ readily captures a hydrogen atom. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR (VT&#8197;NMR ) and variable&#8208;temperature EPR (VT&#8208;EPR) studies reveal that the dianion Pery&#8208;572&#8722; possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state and demonstrates significant global anti&#8208;aromaticity. The dication Pery&#8208;572+ is also predicted to exhibit diradical character. Despite bearing three bulky substituents, Pery&#8208;57 displays p&#8208;type transport characteristics with a mobility of 0.03&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, attributed to its unique azulene&#8208;like structure. Overall, this work directs interest in azulene&#8208;like PAHs, a unique member of nonalternant PAHs showcasing exceptional properties and applications.

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency and Durability of Perovskite Solar Cells With Chlorine&#8208;Functionalized Fully Conjugated Porous Aromatic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine&#8208;functionalized fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were constructed through a decarbonylation reaction. The chlorinated PAFs have high specific surface area, stability and long&#8208;range conjugated networks bearing multiple chlorine atoms. The formation of Cl&#8722;Pb bonds between PAF&#8722;Cl and uncoordinated Pb significantly passivate defects and inhibit non&#8208;radiative recombination, largely enabling the conversion efficiency and stability improvement.







Abstract
Non&#8208;radiative recombination, caused by trap states, significantly hampers the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The emerging porous organic polymers (POPs) show promise as a platform for designing novel defect passivation agents due to their rigid and porous structure. However, the POPs reported so far lack either sufficient stability or clear sites of interactions with the defects. Herein, two chlorine&#8208;functionalized, fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were constructed via a decarbonylation reaction. The chlorinated PAFs feature unique long&#8208;range conjugated networks bearing multiple chlorine atoms, significantly improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of doped solar cells. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses confirmed the strong passivation effects of conjugated structure to the defect through Cl sites. Specifically, PAF&#8208;159, bearing a triphenylamine moiety, demonstrated stronger Cl&#8722;Pb bonding and higher passivation efficiency due to the presence of &#960;* anti&#8208;bonding orbitals, which elevate the HOMO energy level and facilitate Cl&#8722;Pb charge transfer. Consequently, we obtained high&#8208;performance PAF&#8208;159&#8208;doped devices with advanced PCE (24.3&#8201;%), good storage stability (retaining 86&#8201;% after 3000&#8197;hours), and good long&#8208;term operational stability (retaining 92&#8201;% after 350&#8197;hours).

         <title>Lithiation Induced Hetero&#8208;Superlattice Zn/ZnLi as Stable Anode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero&#8208;superlattice Zn/ZnLi anode containing periodic arrangements of metallic Zn phase and zincophilic ZnLi phase at the nanoscale, is well designed and fabricated via electrochemical lithiation method. The HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi anode can effectively guide Zn ion stripping/deposition evenly during repeatedly stripping/plating processes. Consequently, the HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi anode with hetero&#8208;superlattice structure can cycle over 2800&#8197;h without a short&#8208;circuit at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Three dimensional (3D) framework structure is one of the most effective ways to achieve uniform zinc deposition and thus inhibit the Zn dendrites growth in working Zn metallic anode. A major challenge facing for the most commonly used 3D zincophilic hosts is that the zincophilic layer tends to peel off during repeatedly cycling, making it less stable. Herein, for the first time, a hetero&#8208;superlattice Zn/ZnLi (HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi) anode containing periodic arrangements of metallic Zn phase and zincophilic ZnLi phase at the nanoscale, is well designed and fabricated via electrochemical lithiation method. Based on binding energy and stripping energy calculation, and the operando optical observation of plating/stripping behaviors, the zincophilic ZnLi sites with a strong Zn adsorption ability in the interior of the 3D ZnLi framework structure can effectively guide uniform Zn nucleation and dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition, which significantly improves the cycling stability of the HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi alloy (over 2800&#8197;h without a short&#8208;circuit at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). More importantly, this strategy can be extended to HS&#8722;Zn/ZnNa and HS&#8722;Zn/ZnK anodes that are similar to the HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi microstructure, also displaying significantly enhanced cycling performances in AZIBs. This study can provide a novel strategy to develop the dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with stable cycling performance.

         <title>Unconventional Electrocatalytic CO Conversion to C2 Products on Single&#8208;Atomic Pd&#8722;Agn Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to the non&#8208;*CO adsorption on Ag surface or over&#8208;strong *CO adsorption on multiple Pd atoms, the single Pd atoms surrounded with multiple Ag sites (denoted as the Pd&#8722;Agn structure) in the Pd1Ag10 catalyst allow to tune the *CO adsorption behavior to promote the *CO surface coverage, and enable efficient C&#8722;C coupling between a Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and a Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) adsorption sites.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO or CO2 into C2+ products has mostly been focused on Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Although Ag has also been predicted as a possible catalyst for the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion from the thermodynamic point of view, however, due to its weak CO binding strength, CO rapidly desorbs from the Ag surface rather than participates in deep reduction. In this work, we demonstrate that single&#8208;atomic Pd sites doped in Ag lattice can tune the CO adsorption behavior and promote the deep reduction of CO toward C2 products. The monodispersed Pd&#8722;Agn sites enable the CO adsorption with both Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) configurations, which can increase the CO coverage and reduce the C&#8722;C coupling energy barrier. Under room temperature and ambient pressure, the Pd1Ag10 alloy catalyst exhibited a total CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Faradaic efficiency of ~37&#8201;% at &#8722;0.83&#8197;V, with appreciable current densities and electrochemical stability, thus featuring unconventional non&#8208;Cu electrocatalytic CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion capability.

With the aid of hexafluoroisopropanol as a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, this zwitterion acts as a trifunctional photocatalyst to achieve efficient functionalization of inert aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds with electron&#8208;deficient olefins under blue&#8208;light irradiation by sequentially engaging in the hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer, single&#8208;electron reduction, and proton transfer.

         <title>Lantern&#8208;Shaped Structure Induced by Racemic Ligands in Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Metal Halide with Near 100% Quantum Yield and Multiple&#8208;Stimulus Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) have become a research hotspot in recent years due to their excellent luminescent properties and tunable emission wavelengths. However, the development of efficient red&#8208;light&#8208;emitting OIMHs remains a significant challenge. This work reports three Mn&#8208;based OIMHs derived from 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinoline hydrobromide: racemic one (Rac&#8208;TBM) and chiral ones (R&#8208;TBM and S&#8208;TBM). As a result of the synergism of chiral organic ligands inducing a unique lantern&#8208;shaped hybrid structure containing both tetrahedra and octahedra, Rac&#8208;TBM exhibits red&#8208;light emission with near&#8208;unity luminescence quantum yield. In comparison, the chiral counterparts R/S&#8208;TBM display strong green emission and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a glum value up to &#177; 2.5 &#215; 10&#8208;2. Interestingly, a mixture of R&#8208; and S&#8208;TBM can transform into Rac&#8208;TBM, successfully achieving a sensitive and reversible switch between red light of octahedra and green light of tetrahedra under external stimuli. The outstanding luminescent properties allow Rac&#8208;TBM to be utilized not only for X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with a detection limit down to 46.29 nGys&#8208;1, but also for advanced information encryption systems to achieve leak&#8208;proof decryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomeric&#160;Dimer Acceptors for Stable Organic Solar Cells with over 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strategy of isomerization is known for its simple yet effective role in optimizing molecular configuration and enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the impact of isomerization on the design of dimer acceptors has been rarely investigated, and the relationship between the chemical structure and optoelectronic property remains unclear. In this study, we designed and synthesized two dimer acceptor isomers named D&#8208;TPh and D&#8208;TN, which differ in the positional arrangement of their end capping groups. Compared to D&#8208;TN, D&#8208;TPh exhibited enhanced backbone planarity, elevated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level, and more ordered molecular stacking. Consequently, the OSC device based on PM6:D&#8208;TPh achieved a PCE of 19.05%, higher than that (PCE = 18.42%) of the device based on PM6:D&#8208;TN. Large&#8208;area PM6:D&#8208;TPh devices (1 cm&#178;) yielded a PCE of 18.0%. More importantly, the extrapolated T80 lifetime of the PM6:D&#8208;TPh device is over 2800 h with MPP tracking under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. These results suggest that isomerization strategy is an effective way to optimize the molecular configuration of dimer acceptors for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency and stable OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Migratory Hydroamidocarbonylation of Amide&#8208;Linked Alkenes to Access Chiral &#945;&#8208;Alkyl Succinimides</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes to access chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides was developed. The key to success was adopting P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand featured with bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes was developed, affording a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides in moderate to good yields with high enantioselectivities. The key to success was introducing bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group into the rigid P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket. By this approach, regio&#8208; or stereo&#8208;convergent synthesis of enantiomeric succinimides from the mixture of olefin isomers was achieved.

         <title>Photoinduced Cu(II)&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative Thianthrenation ofAryl and Heteroaryl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective decarboxylative thianthrenation of a broad range of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids forming high value&#8208;added (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salt reagents has been achieved under mild conditions, creating an attractive two&#8208;step pathway for the divergent functionalization of these abundant starting materials, as exemplified here by modifications a series of pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Given that (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids are inexpensive materials available in a great variety from commercial and natural resources or synthesis, the strategies enabling their use as starting materials for preparing fine chemicals are highly sought after. Here we report a photoinduced Cu(II)&#8208;mediated protocol converting (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salts, high value&#8208;added building blocks that can undergo various subsequent transformations, creating an attractive two&#8208;step pathway for the divergent functionalization of these ubiquitous starting materials. The excellent compatibility of the method is shown by preparing a broad range of sterically and electronically varied (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salts, including derivatives of pharmaceuticals, such as ataluren, celecoxib, flavoxate, probenecid, repaglinide, and tamibarotene. The syntheses of 13&#8197;C&#8208;labeled probenecid and bioisosteres of ataluren as well as the unconventional modifications of celecoxib and flavoxate, illustrate the synthetic potential of the strategy. Mechanistic studies are in line with a reaction occurring through a photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) of Cu(II)&#8208;arylcarboxylates, enabling radical decarboxylative carbometallation to form arylcopper(II) intermediates that in turn react with thianthrene to form the product. Noteworthy, the susceptibility of aryl thianthrenium salts to photodegradation is overcome by a Cu(I)&#8208;driven salvage loop, which continuously intercepts the transiently formed radicals and regenerates the products.

         <title>Green Solvent &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) Facilitates Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel green solvent, &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL), efficiently facilitates the photocatalytic activation of C&#8722;H bonds in benzylic compounds. Mechanistic studies reveal that GVL&#8242;s high dielectric constant (&#1013;) increases the driving force (&#8722;&#916;G), and its large refractive index (n) reduces reorganization energy (&#955;), collectively reducing the reaction barrier (&#916;G&#8800;). This research advances the overlooked solvent effects in semiconductor photocatalysis.







Abstract
Solvents can significantly influence chemical reactions in condensed phases. Their critical properties are increasingly recognized in various research domains such as organic synthesis and biomass valorization. However, in semiconductor photocatalysis, solvents are primarily viewed as mediums for dissolving and diffusing substances, with their potential beneficial effects on photocatalytic conversions often overlooked. Additionally, common photocatalysis solvents like acetonitrile (ACN) pose serious safety and environmental concerns. In this study, we demonstrate that novel and safe green solvents, such as &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL), can significantly enhance the performance of semiconductor photocatalysis for C&#8722;H bond activation. Non&#8208;specific solvent&#8208;solute interactions are the primary contributors to increased photocatalytic activity in the self&#8208;coupling of benzylic compounds. Specifically, GVL&#8242;s large dielectric constant and high refractive index lower the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining C&#8722;H bond activation step, facilitating a faster coupling reaction. The versatility of GVL is further demonstrated in reactions with multiple reagents and in various oxidation and reduction photocatalytic systems beyond classic C&#8722;H bond activation. This work not only pioneers the use of green solvents but also provides comprehensive insights for proper solvent selection in semiconductor photocatalysis.

Mechanistic studies reveal that GVL&#8242;s high dielectric constant (&lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;) increases the driving force (&#8722;&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;), and its large refractive index (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) reduces reorganization energy (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;), collectively reducing the reaction barrier (&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;). This research advances the overlooked solvent effects in semiconductor photocatalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solvents can significantly influence chemical reactions in condensed phases. Their critical properties are increasingly recognized in various research domains such as organic synthesis and biomass valorization. However, in semiconductor photocatalysis, solvents are primarily viewed as mediums for dissolving and diffusing substances, with their potential beneficial effects on photocatalytic conversions often overlooked. Additionally, common photocatalysis solvents like acetonitrile (ACN) pose serious safety and environmental concerns. In this study, we demonstrate that novel and safe green solvents, such as &#947;-valerolactone (GVL), can significantly enhance the performance of semiconductor photocatalysis for C&#8722;H bond activation. Non-specific solvent-solute interactions are the primary contributors to increased photocatalytic activity in the self-coupling of benzylic compounds. Specifically, GVL&#8242;s large dielectric constant and high refractive index lower the energy barrier for the rate-determining C&#8722;H bond activation step, facilitating a faster coupling reaction. The versatility of GVL is further demonstrated in reactions with multiple reagents and in various oxidation and reduction photocatalytic systems beyond classic C&#8722;H bond activation. This work not only pioneers the use of green solvents but also provides comprehensive insights for proper solvent selection in semiconductor photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring the Whole Deposition Process from Hydrated Zn2+ to Zn0 for Stable and Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;Methylmethanesulfonamide (NMS) additive is introduced to alter the primary solvent shell of Zn2+, chemically adsorb on the metallic Zn surface, and in situ form an N&#8208;rich organic and inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI. These effects suppress the water&#8208;induced side reactions and ensure the fast transport kinetic and uniform Zn deposition.







Abstract
The practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) indeed faces challenges primarily attributed to the inherent side reactions and dendrite growth associated with the Zn anode. In the present work, N&#8208;Methylmethanesulfonamide (NMS) is introduced to optimize the transfer, desolvation, and reduction of Zn2+, achieving highly stable and reversible Zn plating/stripping. The NMS molecule can substitute one H2O molecule in the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+ and be preferentially chemisorbed on the Zn surface to protect Zn anode against corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thereby suppressing byproducts formation. Additionally, a robust N&#8208;rich organic and inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid solid electrolyte interphase is in situ generated on Zn anode due to the decomposition of NMS, resulting in enhanced Zn2+ transport kinetics and uniform Zn2+ deposition. Consequently, aqueous cells with the NMS achieve a long lifespan of 2300&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high cumulative plated capacity of 3.25&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and excellent reversibility with an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.7&#8201;% over 800 cycles.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Modular Synthesis of Oxetane&#8208;Based Amide Bioisosteres: Concise, Robust and Scalable Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;step, modular and scalable construction of amino&#8208;oxetanes for the purpose of bioisosteric incorporation has been developed using Katritzky's benzotriazole chemistry. This simple and user&#8208;friendly protocol provides easy access to a range of amino&#8208;oxetanes, even those previously considered challenging. This method is expected to further lower the barrier to adoption of amino&#8208;oxetanes in drug development.







Abstract
Amide bioisoterism is a widely used strategy in drug development to fine&#8208;tune physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and metabolic properties, eliminate toxicity and gain intellectual property rights in uncharted chemical space. Of these, oxetane&#8208;amines offer particularly exciting possibilities as bioisosteres, although they are less frequently investigated than warranted due to the lack of simple and widely applicable synthetic methods. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step, practical, modular, robust, and scalable method for the construction of oxetane&#8208;containing amide bioisosteres that relies on the readily available oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one. This operationally simple procedure exploits the enhanced reactivity of the keto group of the commercially available oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one to form amine&#8208;benzotriazole intermediates, which springloaded adducts are then reacted with various aliphatic and aromatic organometallic reagents under mild conditions to afford various amino&#8208;oxetanes in good to high yields. The simplicity and broad applicability of the method greatly facilitates the synthesis of derivatives that were previously difficult or impossible to produce. The usefulness of this method in the field medicinal chemistry was also demonstrated by eliminating the well&#8208;known metabolic problem of ketoconazole.

         <title>&#8220;Anions&#8208;in&#8208;Colloid&#8221; Hydrated Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colloidal hydrated deep eutectic electrolyte was designed, where the anions are trapped in the colloid and the H2O molecules are restricted by the eutectic network, thus enabling high reversible zinc anodes over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Zn metal as a promising anode for aqueous batteries suffers from severe zinc dendrites, anion&#8208;related side reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and narrow electrochemical stable window (ESW). Herein, an &#8220;anions&#8208;in&#8208;colloid&#8221; hydrated deep eutectic electrolyte consisting of Zn(ClO4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD), and H2O with mass ratio of 7&#8201;:&#8201;4.5&#8201;:&#8201;3 (ACDE&#8208;3) is designed to improve the stability of zinc anode. The ACDE&#8208;3 reconfigures the hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network and regulates the solvation shell. More importantly, the hydroxyl&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#946;&#8208;CDs) in ACDE&#8208;3 self&#8208;assemble into micelles, in which the steric effect between adjacent &#946;&#8208;CDs in micelles restricts the movement of anions. This unique &#8220;anions&#8208;in&#8208;colloid&#8221; structure enables the eutectic system with a high Zn2+ transference number (tZn2+) of 0.84. Thus, ACDE&#8208;3 inhibits the formation of dendrite, prevents the anion&#8208;involved side reactions, suppresses the HER, and enlarges the ESW to 2.32&#8197;V. The Zn//Zn symmetric cell delivers a long lifespan of 900&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Zn//Cu half cells have a high average columbic efficiency (ACE) of 97.9&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 from cycle 15 to 200 with a uniform and compact zinc deposition. When matched with a poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine) (poly(1, 5&#8208;NAPD)) cathode, the full battery with a low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratio of 2 can still cycle steadily for 200 cycles at a current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, this electrolyte has been proven to be operative over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>First Main&#8208;Group Element Lewis Acid Thionyl Chloride Adduct and its Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of adducts of tris(pentafluoroethyl)gallium and &#8208;indium, M(C2F5)3 (M=Ga, In) with weak donor molecules, particularly of the first structurally characterized thionyl chloride adduct of a main group element Lewis acid. [Ga(C2F5)3(SOCl2)] is accessible by dehydration of [Ga(C2F5)3(OH2)2] with thionyl chloride.







Abstract
Although the adduct of aluminum trichloride with thionyl chloride has been reported, no thionyl chloride adduct of a main group element Lewis acid or organometallic compound has been structurally characterized. In this communication we present the synthesis and reactivity of the structurally ascertained adduct of thionyl chloride with tris(pentafluoroethyl)gallane as a representative of a main group element Lewis acid. Gallium and indium compounds with electron withdrawing groups, e.g. the pentafluoroethyl ligand, display versatile properties. While gallates and indates, [MR4]&#8722;, behave as weakly coordinating anions, neutral gallanes and indanes, MR3, are strong Lewis acids. Salts with the tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate and &#8208;indate, [M(C2F5)4]&#8722; (M=Ga, In), have recently been studied in detail. In contrast to this, work on the syntheses of the free Lewis superacids M(C2F5)3 (M=Ga, In) is scarce and underdeveloped. The hydrates [M(C2F5)3(OH2)2] proved to be suitable starting materials, particularly due to their thermal stability. Herein we report on synthesis and characterization of reactive adducts, [M(C2F5)3D], with the weak donor molecules (D) SOCl2 and Me3SiF. The effective Lewis acidities of Ga(C2F5)3 and In(C2F5)3 were experimentally determined by the (modified) Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and their catalytic potential is showcased.

&lt;p&gt;We report on the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of adducts of tris(pentafluoroethyl)gallium and -indium, M(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Ga, In) with weak donor molecules, particularly of the first structurally characterized thionyl chloride adduct of a main group element Lewis acid. [Ga(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] is accessible by dehydration of [Ga(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] with thionyl chloride.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the adduct of aluminum trichloride with thionyl chloride has been reported, no thionyl chloride adduct of a main group element Lewis acid or organometallic compound has been structurally characterized. In this communication we present the synthesis and reactivity of the structurally ascertained adduct of thionyl chloride with tris(pentafluoroethyl)gallane as a representative of a main group element Lewis acid. Gallium and indium compounds with electron withdrawing groups, e.g. the pentafluoroethyl ligand, display versatile properties. While gallates and indates, [MR&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, behave as weakly coordinating anions, neutral gallanes and indanes, MR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, are strong Lewis acids. Salts with the tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate and -indate, [M(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (M=Ga, In), have recently been studied in detail. In contrast to this, work on the syntheses of the free Lewis superacids M(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Ga, In) is scarce and underdeveloped. The hydrates [M(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] proved to be suitable starting materials, particularly due to their thermal stability. Herein we report on synthesis and characterization of reactive adducts, [M(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;D], with the weak donor molecules (D) SOCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiF. The effective Lewis acidities of Ga(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and In(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were experimentally determined by the (modified) Gutmann-Beckett method and their catalytic potential is showcased.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transforming Red Phosphorus Photocatalysis: Dual Roles of Pre&#8208;Anchored Ru Single Atoms in Defect and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores a unique co&#8208;functionalization approach using ruthenium single atoms (Ru1) and nanoparticles (RuNP) to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency of crystalline red phosphorus. Employing &#8220;Tai Chi&#8221;&#8208;inspired tactics, the pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 combats defect&#8208;induced charge deep trapping and fosters RuNP growth, forming effective charge transfer interfaces. This research illustrates the transformative impact of metal atom pre&#8208;anchoring in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Crystalline red phosphorus (CRP), known for its promising photocatalytic properties, faces challenges in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) due to undesired inherent charge deep trapping and recombination effects induced by defects. This study overcomes these limitations through an innovative strategy in integrating ruthenium single atoms (Ru1) within CRP to simultaneously repair the intrinsic undesired vacancy defects and serve as the uniformly distributed anchoring sites for a controllable growth into ruthenium nanoparticles (RuNP). Hence, a highly functionalized CRP with Ru1 and RuNP (Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP) with concerted effects in regulating electronic structures and promoting interfacial charge transfer has been achieved. Advanced characterizations unveil the pioneering dual role of pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 (analogous to the &#8220;Tai Chi&#8221; principle) in transforming CRP photocatalysis. The regulations of vacancy defects on the surface of CRP minimize the detrimental deep charge trapping, resulting in the prolonged lifetime of active charges. With the well&#8208;distributed in situ growth of RuNP on Ru1 sites, the constructed robust &#8220;bridge&#8221; that connects CRP and RuNP facilitates constructive interfacial charge transfer. Ultimately, the synergistic effect induced by the pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 endows Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP with an exceptional PHE rate of 3175&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, positioning it as one of the most efficient elemental&#8208;based photocatalysts available. This breakthrough underscores the crucial role of pre&#8208;anchoring metal single atoms at defect sites of catalysts in enhancing sustainable hydrogen production.

         <title>Rationalizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over IrO2: Essential Role of Hydronium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydronium cation (H3O+) was found to be critical to regulating the observed behaviors of IrO2 during acidic oxygen evolution reaction. The H3O+ cation induced an internal electric field at the interface, enabling selective bond&#8208;tuning to the reaction intermediates. As a result, 0.5&#8197;monolayer of *OH species was stabilized under OER operational condition, and the overall conversion was revealed to be hindered by *OH&#8594;*O.







Abstract
The development of active, stable, and more affordable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great importance for the practical application of electrolyzers and the advancement of renewable energy conversion technologies. Currently, IrO2 is the only catalyst with high stability and activity, but a high cost. Further optimization of the catalyst is limited by the lack of understanding of catalytic behaviors at the acid&#8208;IrO2 interface. Here, in strong interaction with the experiment, we develop an explicit model based on grand&#8208;canonical density function theory (GC&#8208;DFT) calculations to describe acidic OER over IrO2. Compared to the explicit models reported previously, hydronium cations (H3O+) are introduced at the electrochemical interface in the current model. As a result, a variation in stable IrO2 surface configuration under the OER operating condition from previously proposed complete *O&#8208;coverage to a mixture coverage of *OH and *O is revealed, which is well supported by in situ Raman measurements. In addition, the accuracy of predicted overpotential is increased in comparison with the experimentally measured. More importantly, an alteration of the potential limiting step from previously identified *O&#8594;*OOH to *OH&#8594;*O is observed, which opens new opportunities to advance the IrO2&#8208;based catalysts for acidic OER.

         <title>Metabolic Response to Small Molecule Therapy in Colorectal Cancer Tracked with Raman Spectroscopy and Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite advances in cancer therapies, effective screening tools that a priori predict treatment efficacy remain underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy to evaluate metabolic changes at the single cell level in response to cytostatic inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells. Classical machine learning approaches applied to Raman data allowed for the differentiation of responders and nonresponders of treatment and a scoring model that could be generalized to new treatment combinations.







Abstract
Despite numerous screening tools for colorectal cancer (CRC), 25&#8201;% of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease. Novel diagnostic technologies that are early, accurate, and rapid are imperative to assess the therapeutic efficacy of clinical drugs and identify new biomarkers of treatment response. Here Raman spectroscopy (RS) was used to track metabolic reprogramming in KRAS&#8208;mutant HCT116 and SW837 cells, and KRAS wild&#8208;type CC cells. RS combined with multivariate analysis methods distinguished nonresponsive, partially responsive, and responsive cells treated with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody for EGFR inhibition, sotorasib, a clinically approved KRAS inhibitor, and various doses of trametinib, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. Cells treated with a combination of subtoxic doses of trametinib and BKM120, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, showed a synergistic response between the two pathways. Using a supervised machine learning regression model, we established a scoring methodology trained to a priori predict therapeutic response to new treatment combinations. RS metabolites were verified with mass spectrometry, and enrichment pathways were identified, including amino acid, purine, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism that differentiated monotherapy from combination therapy. Our approach may ultimately be applicable to patient&#8208;derived primary cells and cultures of patient tumors to predict effective drugs for individualized care.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Tethered (cAAC)&#8212;Copper Complexes: Reactivity for Hydride Transfer and Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acidic borane was introduced into the secondary coordination sphere of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) copper complexes, including a cuprous hydride. In contrast to non&#8208;tethered borane capped copper hydrides, the borane&#8208;tethered variant exhibits strong hydricity, attributed to relief of ring&#8208;strain, and improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
We present a series of borane&#8208;tethered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC)&#8208;copper complexes, including a borane&#8208;capped Cu(I) hydride. This hydride is unusually hydridic and reacts rapidly with both CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenol at room temperature. Its reactivity is distinct from variants without a tethered borane, and the underlying principles governing the enhanced hydricity were evaluated experimentally and theoretically. These stoichiometric results were extended to catalytic CO2 hydrogenation, and the borane&#8208;tethered (intramolecular) system exhibits ~3&#8208;fold enhancement relative to an intermolecular system.

These stoichiometric results were extended to catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation, and the borane-tethered (intramolecular) system exhibits ~3-fold enhancement relative to an intermolecular system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Aza&#8208;superbenzene and aza&#8208;supernaphthalene are prepared by Chunyan Chi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202407990). Both compounds can be oxidized into higher oxidation states. The dication and tetracation of aza&#8208;superbenzene exhibit global anti&#8208;aromaticity and aromaticity, respectively, with a dominant 32&#960; and 30&#960; conjugation pathway. For aza&#8208;supernaphthalene, its dication, tetracation and hexacation display global aromaticity, antiaromaticity, and aromaticity, respectively, with a 54&#960;, 52&#960;, and 50&#960; conjugation pathway.

         <title>Butadiene Sulfone Based Binary Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonflammable binary DEE electrolyte comprising of LiTFSI and solid BdS is reported, which demonstrates enhanced Li metal compatibility while exhibiting high Li+ ion migration number, ionic conductivity, and wide electrochemical window for Li metal battery applications.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) have attracted significant interest due to the unique physiochemical properties, yet challenges persist in achieving satisfactory Li anode compatibility through a binary DEE formula. In this study, we introduce a nonflammable binary DEE electrolyte comprising of lithium bis(trifluoro&#8208;methane&#8208;sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and solid butadiene sulfone (BdS), which demonstrates enhanced Li metal compatibility while exhibiting high Li+ ion migration number (0.52), ionic conductivity (1.48&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1), wide electrochemical window (~4.5&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) at room temperature. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the Li compatibility derives from the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich SEI, attributed to the undesirable adsorption and deformation of BdS on Li surface that facilitates the preferential reactions between LiTFSI and Li metal. This stable SEI effectively suppresses dendrites growth and gas evolution reactions, ensuring a long lifespan and high coulombic efficiency in both the Li||Li symmetric cells, Li||LiCoO2 and Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells. Moreover, the BdS eutectic strategy exhibit universal applicability to other metal such as Na and Zn by pairing with the corresponding TFSI&#8208;based salts.

         <title>Oxidation of Ammonia Catalyzed by a Molecular Iron Complex: Translating Chemical Catalysis to Mediated Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of using a molecular mediator in the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to N2 is reported. An iron electrocatalyst bearing a macrocyclic ligand with four N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors functions at low temperatures (&#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C) and retains high reactivity even at extremely low loadings (approximately 0.043&#8197;mM; 0.004&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of the Fe catalyst.







Abstract
Ammonia is a promising candidate in the quest for sustainable, clean energy. With its capacity to serve as an energy carrier, the oxidation of ammonia opens avenues for carbon&#8208;neutral approaches to address worldwide growing energy needs. We report the catalytic chemical oxidation of ammonia by an Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal complex, trans&#8208;[LFeII(MeCN)2][PF6]2, where L is a macrocyclic ligand bearing four N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors. Using triarylaminium radical cations in MeCN, up to 182 turnovers of N2 per Fe were obtained from chemical catalysis with an extremely low loading of the Fe catalyst (0.043&#8197;mM, 0.004&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst). This chemical catalysis was successfully transitioned to mediated electrocatalysis for the oxidation of ammonia. Molecular electrocatalysis by the Fe catalyst and the mediator (p&#8208;MeOC6H4)3N exhibited a catalytic half&#8208;wave potential (Ecat/2) of 0.18&#8197;V vs [Cp2Fe]+/0 in MeCN, and achieved 9.3 turnovers of N2 at an applied potential of 0.20&#8197;V vs [Cp2Fe]+/0 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C in controlled&#8208;potential electrolysis, with a Faradaic efficiency of 75&#8201;%. Based on computational results, the catalyst undergoes sequential oxidation and deprotonation steps to form [LFeIV(NH2)2]2+, and thereafter bimetallic coupling to form an N&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Mutualistic Synthesis from Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a mutualistic synthesis concept via orthogonal chemical reactions: disulfide and hydrazone exchange. A tetrameric macrocycle from the active disulfide exchange catalyzed the otherwise inert hydrazone exchange, amplifying a linear hydrazone and forming &#8220;handcuffs&#8221; catenanes through noncovalent binding. The co&#8208;amplification of both species resembles mutualism in ecosystems, as they were minor species when the reactions occurred independently.







Abstract
Mutualisms are interactions that benefit all species involved. It has been widely investigated in neighbouring subjects, such as biology, ecology, sociology, and economics. However, such a reciprocal relationship in synthetic chemical systems has rarely been studied. Here, we demonstrate a mutualistic synthesis where byproducts from two orthogonal chemical reactions aid each other&#8242;s production. Disulfide exchange and hydrazone exchange were chosen to generate two dynamic combinatorial libraries. A minor tetrameric macrocycle from the active disulfide library was quantitatively amplified in the presence of the hydrazone library. This incorporation also turned on the previously inert hydrazone reaction, producing a linear species that formed a &#8220;handcuffs&#8221; catenane with the disulfide tetramer. These findings not only lend robust support to the hypothesis of &#8220;RNA&#8208;peptide coevolution&#8221; for the origin of life but also broaden the scope of synthetic chemistry, highlighting the untapped potential of minor products from different reactions. Additionally, the co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly of these mutualistic entities to form supramolecular structures opens new avenues for future development of composite nanosystems with synergistic properties.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Highly Chiral 1T Molybdenum Disulfide Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 1T&#8722;MoS2 nanosheets were produced via hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of tartaric acid as a chiral ligand to control mirror symmetry breaking. This novel chiral inorganic nanomaterial exhibits a chiral morphology as well as remarkably high chiroptical activity, with a g&#8208;factor of up to 0.01. The optimization of the synthetic conditions and the material's formation mechanism revealed critical details on the transfer of chirality.







Abstract
Chirality in inorganic nanostructures has recently stimulated the attention of many researchers, both to unravel fundamental questions on the origin of chirality in inorganic and hybrid materials, as well as to introduce novel promising properties that are originated by the symmetry breaking. MoS2 is one of the most investigated among the large family of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. In particular, the metastable metallic 1T&#8722;MoS2 phase is of large interest for potential applications. However, due to thermodynamic reasons, the synthesis of 1T&#8722;MoS2 phase is quite challenging. Herein, we present the first synthesis of chiral 1T&#8722;MoS2 phase which shows remarkably high chiroptical activity with a g&#8208;factor up to 0.01. Chiral 1T&#8722;MoS2 was produced using tartaric acid as a chiral ligand to induce symmetry breaking during the material's growth under hydrothermal conditions, leading to the formation of distorted hierarchical nanosheet assemblies exhibiting chiral morphology. Thorough optimization of the synthetic conditions was carried out to maximize chiroptical activity, which is strongly related to the nanostructures&#8217; morphology. Finally, the formation mechanism of the chiral 1T&#8722;MoS2 nanosheet assemblies was investigated, focusing on the role of molecular intermediates in the growth of the nanosheets and the transfer of chirality.

This novel chiral inorganic nanomaterial exhibits a chiral morphology as well as remarkably high chiroptical activity, with a g-factor of up to 0.01. The optimization of the synthetic conditions and the material's formation mechanism revealed critical details on the transfer of chirality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality in inorganic nanostructures has recently stimulated the attention of many researchers, both to unravel fundamental questions on the origin of chirality in inorganic and hybrid materials, as well as to introduce novel promising properties that are originated by the symmetry breaking. MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is one of the most investigated among the large family of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. In particular, the metastable metallic 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase is of large interest for potential applications. However, due to thermodynamic reasons, the synthesis of 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase is quite challenging. Herein, we present the first synthesis of chiral 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase which shows remarkably high chiroptical activity with a g-factor up to 0.01. Chiral 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was produced using tartaric acid as a chiral ligand to induce symmetry breaking during the material's growth under hydrothermal conditions, leading to the formation of distorted hierarchical nanosheet assemblies exhibiting chiral morphology. Thorough optimization of the synthetic conditions was carried out to maximize chiroptical activity, which is strongly related to the nanostructures&#8217; morphology. Finally, the formation mechanism of the chiral 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet assemblies was investigated, focusing on the role of molecular intermediates in the growth of the nanosheets and the transfer of chirality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A [2.2]Isoindolinophanyl&#8208;Based Carbene (iPC) Ligand: Synthesis, Electronic and Photophysical Properties, and Application in Photocatalysis
</title>

         <dc:description>
A sterically demanding, electrophilic [2.2]isoindolinophanyl&#8208;based carbene (iPC) acts as a potent &#960;&#8208;chromophore and participates in metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (CT) transitions in [RhCl(CO)2(iPC)] and intra&#8208;ligand&#8208;&#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221;&#8208;CT transitions in [Au(iPC)2]OTf (5). The steric demand of the iPC leads to ultralong&#8208;lived green phosphorescence (&#964;=185&#8197;&#956;s) of 5 in solution, which in combination with the large accessible &#960; surface area has been exploited for energy transfer (EnT) photocatalysis.







Abstract
Cyclic amino(alkyl) and cyclic amino(aryl) carbenes (cAACs/cAArCs) have been established as very useful ligands for catalytic and photonic applications of transition metal complexes. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a structurally related sterically demanding, electrophilic [2.2]isoindolinophanyl&#8208;based carbene (iPC) that bears a [2.2]paracyclophane moiety. The latter leads to more delocalized frontier orbitals and intense green fluorescence of (HiPC)OTf (2) from an intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1ILCT) state in the solid state. Base&#8208;promoted synthesis of the free carbene led to an unusual ring expansion and subsequent dimerization reaction, but the beneficial ligand properties can be exploited by trapping in situ at a metal center. The iPC ligand is a very potent &#960;&#8208;chromophore, which participates in low energy metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand (ML)CT transitions in [RhCl(CO)2(iPC)] (4) and IL&#8208;&#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221;&#8208;CT transitions in [Au(iPC)2]OTf (5). The steric demand of the iPC leads to high stability of 5 against air, moisture, or solvent attack, and ultralong&#8208;lived green phosphorescence with a lifetime of 185&#8197;&#956;s is observed in solution. The beneficial photophysical and electronic properties of the iPC ligand, including a large accessible &#960; surface area, were exploited by employing highly efficient energy transfer (EnT) photocatalysis in a [2+2] styrene cycloaddition reaction using 5, which outperformed other established photocatalysts in comparison.

         <title>Bismuth as a Z&#8208;Type Ligand: an Unsupported Pt&#8722;Bi Donor&#8208;Acceptor Interaction and its Umpolung by Reaction with H2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bismuth cation [BiMe2(SbF6)] reacts with [Pt(PCy3)2] to give heterobimetallic [(PCy3)2Pt&#8594;BiMe2(SbF6)] (1). Compound 1 and related species show the first unsupported M&#8594;Bi donor&#8211;acceptor interactions (M=transition metal), establishing [BiMe2]+ as an effective and robust Z&#8208;type ligand, and experience pronounced spin&#8208;orbit coupling. 1 activates H2, triggering a sequence of reactions that furnish the umpolung of Pt&#8594;Bi to Bi&#8594;Pt dative bonding.







Abstract
Establishing unprecedented types of bonding interactions is one of the fundamental challenges in synthetic chemistry, paving the way to new (electronic) structures, physicochemical properties, and reactivity. In this context, unsupported element&#8208;element interactions are particularly noteworthy since they offer pristine scientific information about the newly identified structural motif. Here we report the synthesis, isolation, and full characterization of the heterobimetallic Bi/Pt compound [Pt(PCy3)2(BiMe2)(SbF6)] (1), bearing the first unsupported transition metal&#8594;bismuth donor/acceptor interaction as its key structural motif. 1 is surprisingly robust, its electronic spectra are interpreted in a fully relativistic approach, and it reveals an unprecedented reactivity towards H2.

         <title>Revisiting the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy of Porous Electrodes in Li&#8208;ion Batteries by Employing Reference Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy interpretation is essential for comprehending the electrochemical processes in porous electrodes. This work demonstrates that the high&#8208;frequency impedance arc is attributed to the ion transport resistance in pore channels and solid electrolyte interphase, while the mid&#8208;frequency capacitive behavior results from a series connection of electrical double layer capacitance and pseudo&#8208;capacitance.







Abstract
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), characterized by its non&#8208;destructive and in situ nature, plays a crucial role in comprehending the thermodynamic and kinetic processes occurring within Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, there is a lack of consistent and coherent physical interpretations for the EIS of porous electrodes. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct thorough investigations into the underlying physical mechanisms of EIS. Herein, by employing reference electrode in batteries, we revisit the associated physical interpretation of EIS at different frequencies. Combining different battery configurations, temperature&#8208;dependent experiments, and elaborated distribution of relaxation time analysis, we find that the ion transport in porous electrode channels and pseudo&#8208;capacitance behavior dominate the high&#8208;frequency and mid&#8208;frequency impedance arcs, respectively. This work offers a perspective for the physical interpretation of EIS and also sheds light on the understanding of EIS characteristics in other advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Specific Interactions Engender Dynamic and Tailorable Properties in Biomimetic Cationic Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural biomaterials such as spider silk and mussel byssi are fabricated by the chemoresponsive phase separation of biomacromolecules. Inspired by these biofabrication schemes, this work demonstrates that ion&#8208;specific interactions between cationic polyelectrolytes and ionic cosolutes offers new opportunities to control the assembly, structure, and dynamic physical properties of soft matter.







Abstract
Biomaterials such as spider silk and mussel byssi are fabricated by the dynamic manipulation of intra&#8208; and intermolecular biopolymer interactions. Organisms modulate solution parameters, such as pH and ion co&#8208;solute concentration, to effect these processes. These biofabrication schemes provide a conceptual framework to develop new dynamic and responsive abiotic soft material systems. Towards these ends, the chemical diversity of readily available ionic compounds offers a broad palette to manipulate the physicochemical properties of polyelectrolytes via ion&#8208;specific interactions. In this study, we show for the first time that the ion&#8208;specific interactions of biomimetic polyelectrolytes engenders a variety of phase separation behaviors, creating dynamic thermal&#8208; and ion&#8208;responsive soft matter that exhibits a spectrum of physical properties, spanning viscous fluids to viscoelastic and viscoplastic solids. These ion&#8208;dependent characteristics are further rendered general by the merger of lysine and phenylalanine into a single, amphiphilic vinyl monomer. The unprecedented breadth, precision, and dynamicity in the reported ion&#8208;dependent phase behaviors thus introduce a broad array of opportunities for the future development of responsive soft matter; properties that are poised to drive developments in critical areas such as chemical sensing, soft robotics, and additive manufacturing.

         <title>Cleavage of the Robust Silicon&#8211;Fluorine&#160;&#963;&#8211;Bond Allows Silicon&#8211;Carbon Bond Formation: Synthetic Strategies Toward Ortho&#8208;Silyl Aryl Phosphonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward, mild, and transition metal&#8208;free three&#8208;component coupling reaction involving arynes, phosphites, and silyl fluorides was developed through Si&#8211;F bond activation.&#160;&#160;Although the Si&#8211;F bond is one of the strongest bonds, Si&#8211;C bond formation via Si&#8211;F bond cleavage with the assistance of bidentate silicon and phosphonium Lewis acids has been successfully achieved.&#160;&#160;This unprecedented strategy provides a facile approach for synthesizing&#160;ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates.&#160;&#160;Notably, this method allows the use of not only dialkylarylsilyl fluorides and diarylalkylsilyl fluorides but also triarylsilyl fluorides as coupling partners, which is uncommon in the field of arylsilane synthesis.&#160;&#160;Furthermore, a variety of&#160;ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates were produced in moderate to good yields with broad functional group tolerance.&#160;&#160;Additionally, the versatility of&#160;ortho&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted aryl phosphonates was demonstrated by the elaboration of the products into a range of silicon&#8208;containing compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Quasi&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Solid Polymer Electrolytes Enabling an Ultra&#8208;Stable Interface with Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are crucial in the development of lithium metal batteries. Recently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites (OMSs) have shown promise as solid fillers to improve the performance of SPEs. However, the number of OMS&#8208;containing MOFs is quite limited, comprising less than 5% of the total MOFs. When considering yield, cost, and processability, the commonly used OMS&#8208;containing MOFs are no more than 10 types, causing great limitations. Herein, we reported a simple and universal methodology that converted OMS&#8208;free MOFs to OMS&#8208;rich quasi&#8208;MOFs for developing high&#8208;performance SPEs, and explored the underlying mechanism. The &#8220;OMS&#8208;polymer&#8221; and &#8220;OMS&#8208;ion&#8221; interactions were investigated in detail to elucidate the role of quasi&#8208;MOFs on battery performance. It was found that quasi&#8208;MOFs, functioning as ion sieves, can effectively regulate ion migration, thus promoting uniform Li deposition and enabling an ultra&#8208;stable interface. As a result, the Li symmetric cell stably ran over 3000 h at 0.3 mA cm&#8208;2, while the full cell retained 85% of its initial capacity after 1500 cycles at 1.0 C. Finally, universal testing was performed using other MOFs, confirming the generalizability and effectiveness of our design concept.</dc:description>

         <title>Gapped and Rotated Grain Boundary Revealed in Ultra&#8208;small Au Nanoparticles for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, and their crucial roles in some physical and chemical processes have been confirmed, their acquisition at ultrasmall nanoscale presents a significant challenge. To date, they had not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. Herein, we have successfully developed a synthesis method for producing a novel chiral nanocluster Au78(TBBT)40 (TBBT = 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenylthiol) with a 26&#8208;atom gapped and rotated GB. This nanocluster was precisely characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, an offset atomic defect linked to the peripheral Au(TBBT)2 staple was found in the structure. Comparing it to similarly face&#8208;centered cubic&#8208;structured Au36(TBBT)24, Au44(TBBT)28, Au52(TBBT)32, Au92(TBBT)44, and ~5 nm nanocrystals, the bridging Au78(TBBT)40 nanocluster exhibits higher catalytic activity in the reduction of CO2 to CO. This enhanced activity is well interpreted using density functional theory calculations and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, highlighting the influence of GBs and point defects on the properties of metal nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Helmholtz Plane Regulation Empowers PF6&#8722; Permselectivity towards High Coulombic Efficiency Dual Ion Battery of 5.5 V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;voltage dual ion battery (DIB) is promising for stationary energy storage applications owing to its cost&#8208;effectiveness, which has been a hot topic of research in rechargeable battery fields. However, it still suffers from rapid battery failure caused by the severe solvent co&#8208;intercalation and electrolyte oxidation. To address these bottlenecks, herein a functional electrolyte additive hexafluoroglutaric anhydride (HFGA) is presented based on a Helmholtz plane regulation strategy. It is demonstrated that the HFGA can precisely enter into the Helmholtz plane and positively regulate anion solvation behaviors near the graphite electrode surface owing to its considerable H&#8208;F affinity with ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), thus alleviating EMC&#8208;related co&#8208;intercalation and oxidation decomposition during DIB charging. Meanwhile, HFGA can copolymerize with the presence of PF5 at the Helmholtz plane to participate in forming a CF2&#8208;rich CEI layer with excellent PF6&#8722; permselectivity, conducive to achieving PF6&#8722; de&#8208;solvation and simultaneously suppressing electrolyte oxidation decomposition. By virtue of such beneficial effects, the graphite cathode enables a 5.5 V DIB with a prominent capacity retention of 92% and a high average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99% within 2000 cycles, demonstrating significantly enhanced electrochemical reversibility. The Helmholtz plane regulation strategy marks a milestone in advancing DIB technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Full&#8208;Spectrum Light&#8208;Harvesting Solar Thermal Electrocatalyst Boosts Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enabling high&#8208;efficiency solar thermal conversion (STC) at catalytic active site is critical but challenging for harnessing solar energy to boost catalytic reactions. Herein, we report the direct integration of full&#8208;spectrum STC and high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity by fabricating a hierarchical nanocage architecture composed of graphene&#8208;encapsulated CoNi nanoparticle. This catalyst exhibits a near&#8208;complete 98% absorptivity of solar spectrum and a high STC efficiency of 97%, which is superior than previous solar thermal catalytic materials. It delivers a remarkable potential decrease of over 240 mV at various current densities for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution under solar illumination, which is practically unachievable via traditionally heating the system. The high&#8208;efficiency STC is enabled by a synergy between the regulated electronic structure of graphene via CoNi&#8208;carbon interaction and the multiple absorption of lights by the light&#8208;trapping nanocage. Theoretical calculations suggest that high temperature&#8208;induced vibrational free energy gain promotes the potential&#8208;limiting O* to OOH* step, which decreases the overpotential for oxygen evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Outstanding Circularly Polarized TADF in Chiral Cu(I) Emitters: From Design to Application in CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;cost molecular emitters that merge circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties are attractive for many high&#8208;tech applications. However, the design of such emitters remains a difficult task. To address this challenge, here, we propose a simple and efficient strategy, demonstrated by the design of pseudochiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes [Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 bearing a (+)/(&#8211;)&#8208;menthol&#8208;derived 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand (L*). These complexes exhibit a yellow CP&#8208;TADF with a record&#8208;high quantum yield (close to 100%) and high dissymmetry factor (|glum| ~ 1&#215;10&#8211;2). Remarkably, the above compounds also show a negative thermal&#8208;quenching (NTQ) of luminescence in the 300&#8211;77 K range. Exploiting the designed Cu(I) emitters, we fabricated efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs displaying mirror&#8208;imaged CPL bands with high |gEL| factors of 1.5&#215;10&#8211;2&#160; and the maximum EQE of 6.15%. Equally important, using the (+)&#8208;[Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 complex, we have discovered that an external magnetic field noticeably suppresses CP&#8208;TADF of Cu(I) emitters. These findings are an important contribution to the CPL phenomenon and provide access to highly efficient, low&#8208;cost and robust CP&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Photomodulation of Charge Transfer through Excited&#8208;State Processes: Directing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Binding Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating charge transfer (CT) interactions between donor and acceptor molecules may give rise to unique dynamic changes in physicochemical properties, exhibiting great importance in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work, we demonstrate the first instance of reversible photomodulation of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) CT interaction in the solid state.Pyridinium&#8208;based chromophore featuring &#960;&#8208;conjugated D&#8208;A structures can not only function as a good electron acceptor to undergo photoinduced electron transfer (ET) or engage in intermolecular CT interaction, but also exhibit unique dual emission depending on the excitation wavelengths. The rotatable C&#8208;C single bonds within D&#8208;A pairs enhance the tunability of molecular structure.&#160;Through the synergy of a photoinduced ET and an excited&#8208;state conformational change, the intermolecular CT interaction can be switched on and off by alternate light irradiation to enables reversibly modulation of the affinity between donor and acceptor molecules, accompanied by visual color switching and fluorescence on&#8208;off as feedback signals.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Stable Palladium Hydride Nanoclusters Anchored on Tungsten Carbides Mediate Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis holds great promise for green hydrogen production, but suffering from high loading of platinum&#8208;group metals (PGM) for large&#8208;scale deployment. Anchoring PGM&#8208;based materials on supports can not only improve the atomic utilization of active sites but also enhance the intrinsic activity. However, in practical PEM electrolysis, it is still challenging to mediate hydrogen adsorption/desorption pathways with high coverage of hydrogen intermediates over catalyst surface. Here, operando generated stable palladium (Pd) hydride nanoclusters anchored on tungsten carbide (WCx) supports were constructed for hydrogen evolution in PEM electrolysis. Under PEM operando conditions, hydrogen intercalation induces formation of Pd hydrides (PdHx) featuring weakened hydrogen binding energy (HBE), thus triggering reverse hydrogen spillover from WCx (strong HBE) supports to PdHx sites, which have been evidenced by operando characterizations, electrochemical results and theoretical studies. This PdHx&#8208;WCx material can be directly utilized as cathode electrocatalysts in PEM electrolysis with ultralow Pd loading of 0.022 mg cm&#8208;2, delivering the current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2 at the cell voltage of ~1.66 V and continuously running for 200 hours without obvious degradation. This innovative strategy via tuning the operando characteristics to mediate reverse hydrogen spillover provide new insights for designing high&#8208;performance supported PGM&#8208;based electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Liposome&#8208;Based Extracellular Artificial Organelles on Individual Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integration of living cells with extrinsic functional entities gives rise to bioaugmented nanobiohybrids, which hold tremendous potential across diverse fields such as cell therapy, biocatalysis, and cell robotics. This study presents a biocompatible method for incorporating multilayered functional liposomes onto the cell surface, creating extracellular artificial organelles. The introduction of various extrinsic functionalities to cells is achieved without comprising their viabilities. The integration of extrinsic enzymatic reactions is exemplified through the cascade reaction involving glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase. Furthermore, our protocol offers the design flexibility to customize liposome compositions, thereby providing effective cell modification. The versatility of the liposome&#8208;based exorganelle approach establishes an advanced chemical tool, empowering cells with novel functionalities that surpass or are complementary to their innate capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the Synergistic Interplay between Atomic&#8208;scale Vacancies and Ligand Effect to Optimize the Oxygen Reduction Activity and Tolerance Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defect engineering is an effective strategy for regulating the electrocatalysis of nanomaterials, yet it is seldom considered for modulating Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we designed Ni&#8208;doped vacancy&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (Vac&#8208;NiPt NPs/NG) with a low Pt loading of 3.5 wt.% and a Ni/Pt ratio of 0.038:1. Physical characterizations confirmed the presence of abundant atomic&#8208;scale vacancies in the Pt NPs induces long&#8208;range lattice distortions, and the Ni dopant generates a ligand effect resulting in electronic transfer from Ni to Pt. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicated that atomic&#8208;scale vacancies mainly contributed the tolerance performances towards CO and CH3OH, the ligand effect derived from a tiny of Ni dopant accelerated the transformation from *O to *OH species, thereby improved the ORR activity without compromising the tolerance capabilities. Benefiting from the synergistic interplay between atomic&#8208;scale vacancies and ligand effect, as&#8208;prepared Vac&#8208;NiPt NPs/NG exhibited improved ORR activity, sufficient tolerance capabilities, and excellent durability. This study offers a new avenue for modulating the electrocatalytic activity of metal&#8208;based nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Reviving Multivalent&#8208;metal Anodes in Simple Salt Electrolytes via Component Modifier Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using combinatory electrolyte blends represents an imperative avenue to achieve good magnesium (Mg)&#8208;metal anode compatibility and commercial feasibility in fields of promising rechargeable Mg batteries. However, fundamental challenges of how to manipulate component modifier reactivity on molecule level still remain to be solved. Here, molecular structure design concepts towards seeking bromophenyl complex&#8208;based component modifiers has been proposed according to implications of electron&#8208;donating and/or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on Br&#8208;C bond dissociation reactivity.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using combinatory electrolyte blends represents an imperative avenue to achieve good magnesium (Mg)-metal anode compatibility and commercial feasibility in fields of promising rechargeable Mg batteries. However, fundamental challenges of how to manipulate component modifier reactivity on molecule level still remain to be solved. Here, molecular structure design concepts towards seeking bromophenyl complex-based component modifiers has been proposed according to implications of electron-donating and/or electron-withdrawing substituents on Br-C bond dissociation reactivity. Exceptional Mg electro-plating/stripping properties (a stable cycle life of 250 days in Mg//Cu asymmetric cells) have been firstly achieved in a simple salt electrolyte with 1-(3-bromophenyl)-N,N-dimethylmethanamine (BPDMA) as optimal component modifier. Comprehensive analyses disclose the unique electrochemically-active Br-containing ion-pairs formation, such as [(Mg2+)2(TFSI&#8722;)Br&#8722;]2+ and [(Mg2+)2(TFSI&#8722;)(Br&#8722;)(G2)2]2+, which results in the much thinner Br&#8722; containing and organic-inorganic mixed interphases on Mg-metal anodes. Furthermore, conventional MgSO4-based electrolytes and even calcium (Ca)-ion electrolytes can also be revived by similar strategy, demonstrating its generality and superiority.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Long&#8208;Range Disordering RuO2 Catalyst for Highly Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;iridium acid&#8208;stabilized electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial to reducing the cost of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Here, we report a strategy to modulate the stability of RuO2 by doping boron (B) atoms, leading to the preparation of a RuO2 catalyst with long&#8208;range disorder (LD&#8208;B/RuO2). The structure of long&#8208;range disorder endowed LD&#8208;B/RuO2 with a low overpotential of 175 mV and an ultra&#8208;long stability, which can maintain OER for about 1.6 months at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 with almost invariable performance. More importantly, a PEM electrolyzer using LD&#8208;B/RuO2 as the anode demonstrated excellent performance, reaching 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.63 V with durability exceeding 300 h at 250 mA cm&#8722;2 current density. The introduction of B atoms induced the formation of a long&#8208;range disordered structure and symmetry&#8208;breaking B&#8208;Ru&#8208;O motifs, which enabled the catalyst structure to a certain toughness while simultaneously inducing the redistribution of electrons on the active center Ru, which jointly promoted and guaranteed the activity and long&#8208;term stability of LD&#8208;B/RuO2. This study provides a strategy to prepare long&#8208;range disordered RuO2 acidic OER catalysts with high stability using B&#8208;doping to perturb crystallinity, which opens potential possibilities for non&#8208;iridium&#8208;based PEMWE applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic C&#8208;H oxidation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine in DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective C&#8208;H activation on complex biological macromolecules is a key goal in the field of organic chemistry. It requires thermodynamically challenging chemical transformations to be delivered in mild, aqueous conditions. 5&#8208;Methylcytosine (5mC) is a fundamentally important epigenetic modification in DNA that has major implications for biology and has emerged as a vital biomarker. Selective functionalisation of 5mC would enable new chemical approaches to tag, detect and map DNA methylation to enhance the study and exploitation of this epigenetic feature. We demonstrate the first example of direct and selective chemical oxidation of 5mC to 5&#8208;formylcytosine (5fC) in DNA, employing a photocatalytic system. This transformation was used to selectively tag 5mC. We also provide proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for deploying this chemistry for single&#8208;base resolution sequencing of 5mC and genetic bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T) in DNA on a next&#8208;generation sequencing system. This work exemplifies how photocatalysis has the potential to transform the analysis of DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the anion effect on steerable production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homogeneous metal salt catalysts play a pivotal role in industrial production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Herein, we first proposed the anion effect on steerable production of HMF using metal salts with different anions as catalyst in a biphasic system of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/NaCl aqueous solution (NaCl aq). Notably, the anions affected the catalytic activity of the metal salts, leading to an order of magnitude difference in the HMF yields, i.e., AlBr3&#65288;74.0 mol%&#65289;&gt; AlCl3 (60.8 mol%) &gt; Al2(SO4)3 (35.2 mol%) &gt; Al(NO3)3 (14.9 mol%). The anion effect on steerable production of HMF could be attributed to the proximity effect and electron tension. Anions form close&#8208;range interactions with glucose molecules by proximity effect to promote electron transfer, facilitating the isomerization of glucose to fructose. Besides, anions induce a reduction of the electron cloud density of glucose carbon atoms, generating electron tension that rapidly transforms glucose from the ground state to the transition state, thereby increasing the HMF yield. Based on the revelation of anions effect and evaluation of techno&#8208;economic process, we expect to provides theoretical guidance for high&#8208;throughput screening of metal salt catalysts in industrial biorefinery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have prepared a series of bis(semiquinone) compounds with dithiophene bridges of different length that evolve from closed&#8208;shell to full diradical character on the basis of the narrow singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps which allows the triplet population at 298 K for the longer compound.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Induces Halogen/Hydrogen Atom Transfer (XAT/HAT) for Allylic C&#8208;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic C&#8211;H amination has emerged as a powerful tool to construct allylamines, common motifs in molecular therapeutics. Such reaction implies an oxidative path for C&#8208;H activation but furnishes reductive amines, inferring mild oxidants&#8217; inactivity for C&#8208;H oxidation but strong oxidants&#8217; detriment to products. Herein we report a heterogeneous catalytic approach that manipulates halogen&#8208;vacancies of perovskite photocatalyst and exploits halogenated&#8208;solvents (i.e. CH2Cl2, CH2Br2) as mild oxidants for selective C&#8208;H allyl amination with 19,376 turnover. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals induce cooperative hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT, C&#8208;H oxidation, and halogen&#8208;vacancy CsPbBr3&#8208;x formation) and halogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (XAT, CsPbBr3&#8208;x&#8208;induced solvent reduction) under a radical chain mechanism. Terminal/internal olefins are amenable to forge aromatic/aliphatic, cyclic/acyclic, secondary/tertiary allylamines (70 examples), including drugs or their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Abiotic foldamer quaternary structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abiotic aromatic foldamer sequences have been previously shown to fold in helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motifs in organic solvents. Using simple computational tools, a new helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motif was designed that bears additional hydrogen bond donor OH groups to promote its aggregation into a genuine, trimeric, abiotic quaternary structure. This sequence was synthesized and its self&#8208;assembly in solution was investigated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Circular Dichroism (CD) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The existence of two stable discrete aggregates was evidenced, one assigned to the initially designed trimer, the other to a dimer including multiple water molecules. The two species may be quantitatively interconverted upon changing the water content of the solution or the temperature. These results represent important steps in the design of protein&#8208;like abiotic architectures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Catalytic regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes and aldehydes through regio&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative cyclization followed by regio&#8208; and diastereoselective protonation promoted by a chiral phosphine&#8211;cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable selective transformation of the more substituted alkene in 1,3&#8208;dienes, affording a broad scope of bishomoallylic alcohols without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of sensitive organometallic reagents in up to 98% yield, &gt;98:2 regioselectivity, &gt;98:2 dr and 98:2 er. Application of this method to construction of axial stereogenicity and deuterated stereogenic center provided a wide range of multifunctional chiral building blocks that are otherwise difficult to access. DFT calculations revealed the origin of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity as well as a unique oxidative cyclization mechanism for cobalt catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Polymer Membrane with High Stability and Enhanced Ion&#8208;Sieving Effect for Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabrication of ion&#8208;conducting membranes with continuous sub&#8208;nanometer channels holds fundamental importance for flow batteries in achieving safe integration of renewable energy into grids. Self&#8208;standing covalent organic polymer (COP) membranes provide feasibility due to their rapid and selective ion transport. However, the development of a scale&#8208;up possible, mechanically robust and chemically stable membranes remains a significant challenge. Herein, using irreversible strong secondary amine linkage, we propose a self&#8208;standing COP membrane with sub&#8208;nanometer pores ranging from 4.5 to 6.4 &#197;, by a simple and efficient in&#8208;situ polymerization approach. This membrane exhibits enhanced selectivity for proton and vanadium ions, especially excellent electrochemical stability, delivering an energy efficiency of over 80% at the current density of 200 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1000 cycles for an all&#8208;vanadium redox flow battery (VFB). This study provides novel insights for COP&#8208;based ion&#8208;sieving membranes in sustainable energy fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Ionized Interfacial Water&#8208;Induced Localized H* Enrichment for Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a process that requires the participation of eight electrons and nine protons. The regulation of active hydrogen (H*) supply and a deep understanding of related processes are necessary for improving the ammonia yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, we synthesized a series of atomically precise copper&#8208;halide clusters Cu2X2(BINAP)2 (X = Cl, Br, I), among which the Cu2Cl2(BINAP)2 cluster shows the optimal ammonia FE of 94.0% and an ammonia yield rate of 373 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2. In situ experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that halogen atoms, especially Cl in Cu2Cl2(BIANP)2, can significantly affect the distance of alkali metal&#8208;ionized water on the catalyst surface, which can promote the water dissociation to enhance the localized H* enrichment for the continues hydrogenation of nitrate to ammonia. This work explains the role of H* in the hydrogenation process of NO3RR and the importance of localized H* enrichment strategy for improving the FEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotides for Exploration of Cellular Protein ADP&#8208;Ribosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) greatly enhance the functional diversity of proteins, surpassing the number of gene&#8208;encoded variations. One intriguing PTM is ADP&#8208;ribosylation, which utilizes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a substrate and is essential in cell signaling pathways regulating cellular responses. Here, we report the first cell&#8208;permeable NAD+ analogs and demonstrate their utility for investigating cellular ADP&#8208;ribosylation. Using a desthiobiotin&#8208;labelled analog for affinity enrichment of proteins that are ADP&#8208;ribosylated in living cells under oxidative stress, we identified protein targets associated with host&#8208;virus interactions, DNA damage and repair, protein biosynthesis, and ribosome biogenesis. Most of these targets have been noted in various literature sources, highlighting the potential of our probes for cellular ADP&#8208;ribosylome studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Gallium Intermetallic Compounds with Tailored Active Site Configurations for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gallium (Ga) with a low melting point can serve as a unique metallic solvent in the synthesis of intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The negative formation enthalpy of transition metal&#8208;Ga IMCs endows them with high catalytic stability. Meanwhile, their tunable crystal structures offer the possibility to tailor the configurations of active sites to meet the requirements for specific catalytic applications. Herein, we present a general method for preparing a range of transition metal&#8208;Ga IMCs, including Co&#8208;Ga, Ni&#8208;Ga, Pt&#8208;Ga, Pd&#8208;Ga, and Rh&#8208;Ga IMCs. The structurally ordered CoGa IMCs with body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure are uniformly dispersed on the nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide substrate (O&#8208;CoGa/NG) and deliver outstanding nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) performance, making them excellent catalysts to construct highly efficient rechargeable Zn&#8208;NO3&#8208; battery. Operando studies and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;rich environments around the Co atoms enhance the adsorption strength of *NO3 intermediate and simultaneously suppress the formation of hydrogen, thus improving the NO3RR activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

The experimental results confirmed that the existence of Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 crystal phase, and the Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Se bonds could obviously enhance ORR and OER catalytic performance of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC. Density functional theoretical calculations (DFT) confirmed that the Fe2O(SeO3)2 in Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC had a higher d&#8208;band center of Fe atom and a lower p&#8208;orbital coupling degree with its own lattice O atom than Fe2O3, which leads to Fe site of Fe2O(SeO3)2 being more likely to adsorb external oxygen intermediates. The Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 results in the modification of coordination environment of Fe atoms and optimizes the adsorption energy of Fe site for oxygen intermediates. Compared with Fe2O3/Fe3C@NC, the Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC showed obvious enhancements of ORR/OER catalytic activities with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91 V for ORR in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte and a low overpotential of 345 mV for OER at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The peak power density and specific capacity of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC&#8208;based ZABs are higher than those of Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;ZABs. The above results demonstrate that the asymmetrical Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 plays a key role in improving the bifunctional catalytic activities of ORR/OER for ZABs.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen reduction reaction coupled electro&#8208;oxidation for highly&#8208;efficient and sustainable water treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electro&#8208;oxidation (EO) technology demonstrates significant potential in wastewater treatment. However, the high energy consumption has become a pivotal constraint hindering its large&#8208;scale implementation. Herein, we design an EO and 4&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction coupled system (EO&#8208;4eORR) to replace the traditional EO and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) coupled system (EO&#8208;HER). The theoretical cathodic potential of the electrolytic reactor is tuned from 0 V (vs. RHE) in HER to 1.23 V (vs. RHE) in 4eORR, which greatly decreases the required operation voltage of the reactor. Moreover, we demonstrate that convection can improve the mass transfer of oxygen and organic pollutants in the reaction system, leading to low cathodic polarization and high pollutant removal rate. Compared with traditional EO&#8208;HER system, the energy consumption of the EO&#8208;4eORR system under air aeration for 95% total organic carbon (TOC) removal is greatly decreased to 2.61 kWh/kgTOC (only consider the electrolyzer energy consumption), which is superior to previously reported EO&#8208;based water treatment systems. The reported results in this study offer a new technical mode for development of highly efficient and sustainable EO&#8208;based treatment systems to remove organic pollutants in waste water.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Twist&#8208;induced Endocytotic Membrane Fission using Anisotropic Gold Homodimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane fission involves a crucial step of lipid remodeling, in which the dynamin collar constricts and severs the tubulated lipid membrane at the neck of budding vesicles. Nevertheless, the difficulty in accurately determining the rotational dynamics of live endocytotic vesicles poses a limit on the elucidation of dynamin&#8208;induced membrane remodeling for endocytotic vesicle scission. Herein, we designed a DNA&#8208;modified gold homodimer (AuHD)&#8208;based anisotropic plasmonic probe with uniform surface chemistry, minimizing orientational fluctuation within vesicle encapsulation. Using AuHDs as cargos to image the dynamics of cargo&#8208;containing vesicles during endocytosis, we showed that, prior to detachment from plasma membrane, the cargo&#8208;containing vesicles underwent multiple intermittent twists of ~4&#176; angular orientation relative to plasma membrane with a ~0.2 s dwell time. These findings suggest that the membrane torques resulting from dynamin actions in vivo constitute the pathway to membrane fission, potentially shedding light on how dynamin&#8208;mediated lipid remodeling orchestrates membrane fission.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Spin of Atomic Manganese Center for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom catalysts (SACs) are promising non&#8208;precious catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Unfortunately, the ORR SACs usually suffer from unsatisfactory activity and in particular poor stability. Herein, we report atomically dispersed manganese (Mn) embedded on nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped graphene as an efficient and robust electrocatalyst for ORR in alkaline electrolyte, realizing a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.883 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with negligible activity degradation after 40,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles in 0.1 M KOH. Introducing sulfur (S) to form Mn&#8208;S coordination changes the spin state of single Mn atom from high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin, which effectively optimizes the oxygen intermediates adsorption over the single Mn atomic sites and thus greatly improves the ORR activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Metal Recovery from Sea Water by a Flexible and Scalable Membrane with Lithium&#8208;Ion Exclusive Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sea water is abundant in lithium reserves, and extracting lithium metal from it holds the potential to not only mitigate the shortage of lithium in light of the fast&#8208;growing electric vehicle industry, but also serve as an anode electrode to provide electricity. The task, however, is challenging due to the harsh reactions and low lithium concentration in sea water. Here, we present a single&#8208;channel strategy based on a flexible and scalable lithium ion&#8208;sieve membrane for efficient lithium extraction. Our composite membrane exhibits high separation factor &#946;Li/Na of more than 2.87 &#215; 107 with an ionic conductivity of 6.2&#215;10&#8208;5 S cm&#8208;1. Lithium metal was electrolytically extracted from sea water through a hybrid&#8208;electrolyte system, which yielded a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.04% and a low energy consumption of 17.4 kWh kgLi&#8208;1 at an optimized extracting current of 200 &#956;A cm&#8208;2. The extracted lithium metal can be directly integrated into a lithium&#8208;sulfur battery, delivering an energy output of 395 Wh kg&#8208;1. To demonstrate its industrial viability, we also fabricate a pouch cell with Li metal anode extracted by an amplified extraction prototype. This study has the potential to dispel concerns of lithium depletion and facilitate the sustainable development of lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phosphonate&#8208;Organic Network as Ion Enrichment Layer for Sustainable Zinc Metal Electrode with High Rate Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc (Zn) metal batteries could be the technology of choice for sustainable battery chemistries owing to its better safety and cost advantage. However, their cycle life and Coulombic efficiency (CE) are strongly limited by the dendritic growth and side reactions of Zn anodes. Herein, we proposed an in situ construction of a metal&#8722;phosphonate&#8722;organic network (MPON) with three&#8722;dimensional interconnected networks on Zn metal, which can act as an ion enrichment layer for Zn anodes in Zn&#8208;metal batteries. This MPON with abundant porous structure and phosphate sites possesses ion enriching properties and high Zn2+ transference number (0.83), which is beneficial for enhancing Zn2+ migration and self&#8722;concentrating kinetics. Meanwhile, MPON offers hydrophobicity to effectively inhibit the water&#8722;induced Zn anode corrosion. As a result, the Zn electrode exhibits superior Zn/Zn2+ reversibility of over 4 months at 3 mA cm&#8722;2 and a high CE of 99.6%. Moreover, the Zn/NaV3O8 &#183;1.5H2O and Zn/MnO2 full cells using ultrathin Zn anodes (10 &#956;m) exhibit high&#8722;capacity retention of 81% and 78% after 1400 and 1000 cycles, respectively. This work provides a unique promise to design high&#8722;performance anode for practical Zn&#8722;metal&#8722;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The asymmetric rearrangement of allylic sulfilimines is an effective route to synthetic attractive targets such as allylic sulfenamides and others. The current methods are limited to chirality transfer from chiral allylic sulfilimine precursors. Herein, we report a general and fundamentally new rearrangement route accessing optically enriched allylic sulfenamides and their derivatives. The process involves a S&#8208;alkylation and an unusual S&#8208;to&#8208;N rearrangement step. The chiral nickel complex enables the transformation of a broad scope of sulfenamides and vinyl &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides under mild conditions. Various allylic sulfenamides have been synthesized with excellent &#947;&#8208;regioselectivity and enantioselectivity, which can be efficiently converted to sulfinamide and 4&#8208;aminobutenoic acid derivatives. In addition, DFT calculations demonstrate the connection between the spin state and conformation of nickel vinyl carbenoid, as well as an unknown rearrangement process.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Stable Helical Structures with Enhanced Molecular Conductance by Strengthening Through&#8208;Space Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing long&#8208;chain molecules with stable helical structures is of significant importance for understanding and modulating the properties and functions of helical biological macromolecules, but challenging. In this work, an effective and facile approach to stabilize folded helical structures by strengthening through&#8208;space conjugation is proposed, using new ortho&#8208;hexaphenylene (o&#8208;HP) derivatives as models. The structure&#8208;activity relationship between the through&#8208;space conjugation and charge transport behavior of the prepared folded helical o&#8208;HP derivatives is experimentally and theoretically investigated. It is demonstrated that the through&#8208;space conjugation within o&#8208;HP derivatives can be strengthened by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridine and pyrazine, which can effectively stabilize the helical structures of o&#8208;HP derivatives. Moreover, scanning tunneling microscopy&#8208;break junction measurements reveal that the stable regular helical structures of o&#8208;HP derivatives open up dominant through&#8208;space charge transport pathways, and the single&#8208;molecule conductance is enhanced by more than 70% by strengthening through&#8208;space conjugation with pyridine and pyrazine. But the through&#8208;bond charge transport pathways contribute much less to the conductance of o&#8208;HP derivatives. These results not only provide a new method for exploring stable helical molecules, but also pave a stepping stone for deciphering and modulating the charge transport behavior of helical systems at the single&#8208;molecule level.</dc:description>

         <title>Sublimation Transformation Synthesis of Dual&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have garnered significant interest due to their remarkable catalytic reactivity. However, achieving atomically precise control in the fabrication of DACs remains a major challenge. Herein, we developed a straightforward and direct sublimation transformation synthesis strategy for dual&#8208;atom Fe catalysts (Fe2/NC) by utilizing in situ generated Fe2Cl6(g) dimers from FeCl3(s). The structure of Fe2/NC was investigated by aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. As&#8208;obtained Fe2/NC, with a Fe&#8211;Fe distance of 0.3 nm inherited from Fe2Cl6, displayed superior oxygen reduction performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90 V (vs. RHE), surpassing commercial Pt/C catalysts, Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe1/NC), and its counterpart with a common and shorter Fe&#8211;Fe distance of ~0.25 nm (Fe2/NC&#8208;S). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic analysis revealed the extended Fe&#8211;Fe distance in Fe2/NC is crucial for the O2 adsorption on catalytic sites and facilitating the subsequent protonation process, thereby boosting catalytic performance. This work not only introduces a new approach for fabricating atomically precise DACs, but also offers a deeper understanding of the intermetallic distance effect on dual&#8208;site catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Tumor Permeating DNA Nanoplatform for Efficient Remodeling of Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and limited intratumoral permeation have largely constrained the outcome of tumor therapy. Herein, we report a tailored DNA structure&#8208;based nanoplatform with striking tumor&#8208;penetrating capability for targeted remodeling of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in vivo. In our design, chemo&#8208;immunomodulator (gemcitabine) can be precisely grafted in DNA sequences via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive linker. After self&#8208;assembly, the gemcitabine&#8208;grafted DNA structure can site&#8208;specifically organize legumain&#8208;activatable melittin pro&#8208;peptide (promelittin) on each vertex for intratumoral delivery and further function as the template to load photosensitizers (methylene blue) for ROS production. The tailored DNA nanoplatform can achieve targeted accumulation, highly improved intratumoral permeation, and efficient immunogenic cell death of tumor cells by laser irradiation. Finally, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment can be successfully remodeled by reducing multi&#8208;type immunosuppressive cells and enhancing the infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes in the tumor. This rationally developed multifunctional DNA nanoplatform provides a new avenue for the development of tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA) process, chiral functional monomers undergo spontaneous supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and asymmetric stacking during living polymerization, leading to the in&#8208;situ generation of chiroptical polymer assemblies characterized by diverse morphologies. The PICSA strategy facilitates precise control and manipulation of both non&#8208;covalent supramolecular helices and covalent macromolecular helices within aggregated cores, thereby driving significant advancements in fields such as chiral recognition materials, asymmetric catalysts, nonlinear optical materials, and ferroelectric liquid crystals (LC). This minireview summarizes recent developments in the in&#8208;situ chiroptical construction and modulation associated with the PICSA methodology. Furthermore, it seeks to elucidate emerging PICSA systems founded on various living polymerization mechanisms, exploring hierarchical chirality transfer processes and the pathway complexities in both equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

         <title>Mo Migration&#8208;Induced Crystalline to Amorphous Conversion and Formation of RuMo/NiMoO4 Heterogeneous Nanoarray for Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Water Splitting at Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating the atomic structure of the catalyst and tailoring the dissociative water&#8208;hydrogen bonding network at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface is essential for propelling alkaline hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), but remains a great challenge. Herein, we constructed an advanced a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF heterogeneous electrocatalysts with amorphous RuMo alloy nanoclusters anchored to amorphous NiMoO4 skeletons on Ni foam by a heteroatom implantation strategy. Theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ Raman tests show that the amorphous and alloying structure of a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF not only induces the directional evolution of interfacial H2O, but also lowers the d&#8208;band center (from &#8208;0.43 to &#8208;2.22 eV) of a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH*, from &#8208;1.29 to &#8208;0.06 eV), and the energy barrier of HzOR (&#916;GN2(g) = 1.50 eV to &#916;GN2* = 0.47 eV). Profiting from these favorable factors, the a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances, especially at large current densities, with an overpotential of 13 and 129 mV to reach 10 and 1000 mA cm&#8208;2 for HER. While for HzOR, it needs only &#8208;91 and 276 mV to deliver 10 and 500 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. Further, the constructed a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF||a&#8208;RuMo/NiMoO4/NF electrolyzer demands only 7 and 420 mV to afford 10 and 500 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting K+&#8208;ionic Conductivity of Layered Oxides via Regulating P2/P3 Heterogeneity and Reciprocity for Room&#8208;temperature Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries are promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, high energy density and inherent safety. However, solid state K&#8208;ion conductors struggle with poor ionic conductivity due to the large ionic radius of K+&#8208;ions. Herein, we report precise regulation of phase heterogeneity and reciprocity of the P2/P3&#8208;symbiosis K0.62Mg0.54Sb0.46O2 solid electrolyte (SE) for boosting a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C. The bulk ionic conducting mechanism is explored by elucidating the effect of atomic stacking mode within the layered framework on K+&#8208;ion migration barriers. For ion diffusion at grain boundaries, the P2/P3 biphasic symbiosis property assists in tunning the SE microstructure, which crystallizes in rod&#8208;like particles with lengths of tens of micrometers facilitating long&#8208;distance ion transport and significantly decreasing grain boundary resistance. Potassium metal symmetric cells using the modified SE deliver excellent cycling life over 300&#8201;h at 0.1&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high critical current density of 0.68 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries (QSSKBs) coupled with two kinds of layered oxide cathodes demonstrate remarkable stability over 300 cycles, outperforming the liquid electrolyte counterparts. The QSSKB system provides a promising strategy for high&#8208;efficiency, safe, and durable large&#8208;scale energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Control of Helicene CPL Emitters in Molecular Solids and Bright Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from chrial molecules is attracting much attention due to its potential in optical materials. However, formulation of CPL emitters as molecular solids typically deteriorates photophysical properties in the aggregated state leading to quenching and unpredictable changes in CPL behavior impeding materials development. To circumvent these shortcomings, a supramolecular approach can be used to isolate cationic dyes in a lattice of cyanostar&#8208;anion complexes that suppress aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and which we hypothesize can preserve chiroptical properties. Herein, we verify for the first time that supramolecular assembly of small&#8208;molecule, ionic isolation lattices (SMILES), allows translation of molecular ECD and CPL properties to solids. A series of cationic helicenes that display increasing chiroptical response, is investigated. Crystal structures of three different packing motifs all show spatial isolation of dyes by the anion complexes. We observe the photophysical and chiroptical properties of all helicenes are seamlessly translated to water soluble nanoparticles by the SMILES method. Also, a DMQA helicene is used as FRET acceptor in SMILES nanoparticles of intensely absorbing rhodamine antennae to generate an 18&#8208;fold boost in CPL brightness. These features offer promise for reliably accessing bright materials with programmable CPL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Pulse EPR Methods in the Angstrom to Nanometre Scale Shed Light on the Conformational Flexibility of a Fluoride Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Riboswitches control gene regulation upon external stimuli such as environmental factors or ligand binding. The fluoride sensing riboswitch from Thermotoga petrophila is a complex regulatory RNA proposed to be involved in resistance to F&#8208; cytotoxicity. The details of structure and dynamics underpinning the regulatory mechanism are currently debated. Here we demonstrate that a combination of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR/EPR) spectroscopies, detecting distances in the angstrom to nanometre range, can probe distinct regions of conformational flexibility in this riboswitch. PELDOR (pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance) revealed a similar preorganisation of the sensing domain in three forms, i.e. the free aptamer, the Mg2+&#8208;bound apo, and the F&#8208;&#8208;bound holo form. 19F ENDOR (electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance) was used to investigate the active site structure of the F&#8208;&#8208;bound holo form. Distance distributions without a priori structural information were compared with in silico modelling of spin label conformations based on the crystal structure. While PELDOR, probing the periphery of the RNA fold, revealed conformational flexibility of the RNA backbone, ENDOR indicated low structural heterogeneity at the ligand binding site. Overall, the combination of PELDOR and ENDOR with sub&#8208;angstrom precision gave insight into structural organisation and flexibility of a riboswitch, not easily attainable by other biophysical techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Controlled Hybridization, Chiral Induction and Handedness of Helical Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical foldamers have attracted much attention over the last decades given their resemblance to certain biomacromolecules and their potential in domains as different as pharmaceutics, catalysis and photonics. Various research groups have successfully controlled the right&#8208; or left&#8208; handedness of these oligomers by introducing stereogenic centers through covalent or non&#8208;covalent chemistry. However, developing helical structures whose handedness can be reversibly switched remains a major challenge for chemists. To date, such an achievement has been reported with light&#8208;responsive single&#8208;stranded foldamers only. Herein, we demonstrate that grafting a unidirectional motor onto foldamer strands constitutes a relevant strategy to i) control the single or double helical state of a foldamer, ii) switch on the chiral induction process from the motor to the helical strands and iii) select the handedness of double helical structures through photochemical and thermal stimulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Catalytic Combustion of Hydrogen under Aerobic Conditions on Na2WO4/SiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na2WO4/SiO2, a material known to catalyze oxidative coupling of methane, is demonstrated to catalyze selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) with &gt;97% selectivity in mixtures with several hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H&#173;6, C2H4, C3H6, C6H6) in the presence of gas&#8208;phase dioxygen at 883&#8208;983 K. Hydrogen combustion rates exhibit a near&#8208;first&#8208;order dependence on H2 partial pressure and are zero&#8208;order in H2O and O2 partial pressures. Mechanistic studies&#160;using isotopically&#8208;labeled reagents demonstrate the kinetic relevance of H&#8208;H dissociation and absence of O&#8208;atom recombination. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and W LIII&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy&#160;studies demonstrate, respectively, a loss of Na2WO4 crystallinity and lack of second&#8208;shell coordination with respect to W6+ cations below 923 K; benchmark experiments show that alkali cations must be present for the material to be selective for hydrogen combustion, but that materials containing Na alone have much lower combustion rates (per gram Na) than those containing Na and W. These data suggest a synergy between Na and W in a disordered phase&#160;during SHC catalysis. The Na2WO4/SiO2 SHC catalyst maintains stable combustion rates at temperatures ca. 100 K higher than redox&#8208;active SHC catalysts and could potentially enable enhanced olefin yields in tandem operation of reactors combining alkane dehydrogenation with SHC processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Photo&#8208;Assisted Phase Switching of Antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;Ferroelectric Orders in an I3&#8208;&#8208;Intercalated 2D Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiferroelectric (AFE) has emerged as a promising branch of electroactive materials, due to their intriguing physical attributes stemming from the electric field&#8208;induced antipolar&#8208;to&#8208;polar phase transformation. However, the requirement of an extremely high electric field strength to switch adjacent sublattice polarization poses great challenges for exploiting molecular AFE system. Although photoirradiation is striking as a noncontact and nondestructive manipulation tool to optimize physical properties, the optical control of antiferroelectricity is still unexplored. Here, by adopting light&#8208;sensitive triiodide I3&#8208; anion into the 2D perovskite family, we have designed the first I3&#8208;&#8208;intercalated molecular AFE of (t&#8208;ACH)2EA2Pb3I10(I3)0.5&#183;((H3O)(H2O))0.5 (1, t&#8208;ACH = trans&#8208;4&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclohexanecarboxylate, EA = ethylammonium). The I3&#8208;&#8208;intercalating gives an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap of 1.65 eV with strong absorption. In terms of AFE structure, the&#160;anti&#8208;parallel alignment of electric dipoles results in a spontaneous polarization of 4.3 &#181;C/cm2. Strikingly,&#160;1&#160;merely shows AFE behaviour in the dark even under ultrahigh voltage, while the field&#8208;induced ferroelectric state can be facilely obtained upon visible illumination. Such&#160;unprecedented photo&#8208;assisted phase switching ascribes to the incorporation of photoactive I3&#8208; anions, which reduce the AFE&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric switching barrier for 1. This pioneering work on the photo&#8208;assisting transformation of ferroic orders paves a new way to develop future photoactive materials with significant potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A High Capacity p&#8208;Type Organic Cathode Material for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;type organic cathode materials typically exhibit high redox potentials and fast redox kinetics, presenting broad application prospects in aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs). However, most of the reported P&#8208;type organic cathode materials exhibit limited capacity (&lt; 100 mAh g&#8208;1), which is attributable to the low mass content ratio of oxidation&#8208;reduction active functional groups in these materials. Herein, we report a high&#8208;capacity p&#8208;type organic material, 5,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraazatetracene (DHTAT), for aqueous zinc batteries. Both experiments and calculation indicate the charge storage of DHTAT involves the adsorption/ desorption of ClO4&#8208; on the &#8211;NH&#8211; group. Benefitting from the high mass content ratio of the &#8211;NH&#8211; group in DHATA molecule, the DHATA electrode demonstrates a remarkable capacity of 224 mAh g&#8208;1 at a current density of 50 mA g&#8208;1 with a stable voltage of 1.2 V. Notably, after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g&#8208;1, DHTAT retains 73% of its initial capacity, showing a promising cycling stability. In addition, DHTAT also has good low&#8208;temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8208;40 &#176;C for 4000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low&#8208;temperature batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extension of Multiple Resonance Core: Double Helical and Heptagon Embedded Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) boron&#8211;nitrogen doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) showed compelling thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), surpassing those of their hydrocarbon analogs. However, the structural variety of &#960;&#8208;extended BN&#8208;PAHs remains narrow. In this study, we synthesized three double helical BN&#8208;doped nanographenes (BN&#8208;NGs), 2a&#8211;2c, via the &#960;&#8208;extension of the MR core. During the formation of 2a, a nanographene with one heptagon (1a) was obtained, whereas subsequent dehydrocyclization of the [6]helicene units within 2b&#8211;2c led to heptagon structures, yielding other two BN&#8208;NGs containing double heptagons (1b&#8211;1c). These BN&#8208;NGs (2a&#8211;2c and 1a&#8211;1c) showed pronounced redshifts of 100&#8211;190 nm compared to the parent MR core while preserving the TADF characteristics and prolonging the delayed fluorescence lifetime to the millisecond level. Furthermore, the integration of heptagon ring into 1a&#8211;1c expanded the conjugation, reduced the oxidation potentials, and yielded a more flexible framework compared to those of 2a&#8211;2c. The enantiomers of 2a&#8211;2c, 1a, and 1c were resolved and their chiroptical properties were studied. Notably, 1a and 1c exhibited the increased chiroptical dissymmetry factors.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Anisotropic Memristive Behavior of Borophene Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neuromorphic computing, marked by its parallel computational abilities and low power usage, has become pivotal in advancing artificial intelligence. However, the advancement of neuromorphic computing has faced significant obstacles due to the performance limitations of traditional memory devices struggling with high power consumption and limited reliability. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively investigated as high&#8208;performance memristive materials, but they are often restricted by fixed memristive properties, which complicate circuit design and limit flexibility. Here, we report that multilayer borophene nanosheets represent a breakthrough material, displaying anisotropic variable memristive properties. The nanosheets, comprising semiconductor &#945;&#8217;&#8208;4H&#8208;borophene sheets and metal &#946;12&#8208;borophene sheets, have been synthesized on aluminum foil surface through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The multilayer borophene nanosheets exhibit volatile memory behavior in the vertical direction and non&#8208;volatile memory behavior in the planar direction. This innovative class of 2D nanosheets not only overcomes the limitations of conventional memory devices but also expands the potential applications of borophene&#8208;based memories in information storage and in&#8208;memory computing.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Disialyllacto&#8208;N&#8208;Tetraose (DSLNT) and Related Human Milk Oligosaccharides Reveals Broad Siglec Recognition to the Atypical Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sialic acids (Sias) are ubiquitously expressed on all types of glycans, typically as terminating residues. They usually link to galactose, N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine, or other Sia residues, forming ligands of many glycan&#8208;binding proteins. An atypical linkage to the C6 of N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) has been identified in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs, e.g., DSLNT) and tumor&#8208;associated glycoconjugates. Herein, we achieved the systematic synthesis of these HMOs in an enzymatic modular manner. The synthetic strategy relies on a novel activity of ST6GalNAc6 for efficient construction of the Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc linkage, and another 12 specific enzyme modules for sequential HMO assembly. The structures enabled comprehensive exploration into their structure&#8208;function relationships using glycan microarray, revealing broad yet distinct recognitions by Siglecs to the atypical Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc motif. The work provides tools and new insights for functional study and potential applications of Siglecs and HMOs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Anchoring Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide Allows Bioorthogonal Coupling of Type&#8208;I AIEgens for Pyroptosis&#8208;Induced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enrichment of photosensitizers (PSs) on cancer cell membranes via bioorthogonal reactions is considered to be a very promising therapeutic modality. However, azide&#8208;modified sugars&#8208;based metabolic labeling processes usually lack targeting and the labeling speed is relatively slow. Moreover, it has been rarely reported that membrane&#8208;anchoring pure type&#8208;I PSs can induce cancer cell pyroptosis. Here, we report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholecystokinin&#8208;2 receptor (CCK2R) dual&#8208;targeting peptide named DBCO&#8208;pYCCK6, which can selectively and rapidly self&#8208;assemble on cancer cell membrane, and then bioorthogonal enrich type&#8208;I aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgen) PSs (SAIE&#8208;N3) on the cell membrane. Upon light irradiation, the membrane&#8208;anchoring SAIE&#8208;N3 could effectively generate type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the bioorthogonal combination strategy of peptide and AIEgen PSs could significantly inhibit tumor growth, which is accompanied by CD8+ cytotoxic T cell infiltration.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Enrichment of photosensitizers (PSs) on cancer cell membranes via bioorthogonal reactions is considered to be a very promising therapeutic modality. However, azide-modified sugars-based metabolic labeling processes usually lack targeting and the labeling speed is relatively slow. Moreover, it has been rarely reported that membrane-anchoring pure type-I PSs can induce cancer cell pyroptosis. Here, we report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK2R) dual-targeting peptide named DBCO-pYCCK6, which can selectively and rapidly self-assemble on cancer cell membrane, and then bioorthogonal enrich type-I aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgen) PSs (SAIE-N3) on the cell membrane. Upon light irradiation, the membrane-anchoring SAIE-N3 could effectively generate type-I reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the bioorthogonal combination strategy of peptide and AIEgen PSs could significantly inhibit tumor growth, which is accompanied by CD8+ cytotoxic T cell infiltration. This work provides a novel self-assembly peptide-mediated bioorthogonal reaction strategy to bridge the supramolecular self-assembly and AIE field through strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and elucidates that pure type-I membrane-anchoring PSs can be used for cancer therapy via GSDME-mediated pyroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hemilabile and Redox&#8208;Active Quinone Ligands Unlock sp3&#8208;Rich Couplings in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Carbosulfenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component coupling approach toward structurally complex dialkylsulfides is described via the nickel&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation of unactivated alkenes with organoboron nucleophiles and alkylsulfenamide (N&#8211;S) electrophiles. Efficient catalytic turnover is facilitated using a tailored N&#8211;S electrophile containing an N&#8208;methyl methanesulfonamide leaving group, allowing catalyst loadings as low as 1 mol%. Regioselectivity is controlled by a collection of monodentate, weakly coordinating native directing groups, including sulfonamides, amides, sulfinamides, phosphoramides, and carbamates. Key to the development of this transformation is the identification of quinones as a family of hemilabile and redox&#8208;active ligands that tune the steric and electron properties of the metal throughout the catalytic cycle. DFT calculations show that the duroquinone (DQ) ligand adopts different coordination modes in different stages of the Ni&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation&#8212;binding as an &#951;6 capping ligand to stabilize the precatalyst/resting state and prevent catalyst decomposition, binding as an X&#8208;type redox&#8208;active durosemiquinone radical anion to promote alkene migratory insertion with a less distorted square planar Ni(II) center, while binding as an &#951;1 L&#8208;type ligand to promote N&#8211;S oxidative addition at a relatively more electron&#8208;rich and sterically less crowded Ni(I) center.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitigating the Kinetic Hysteresis of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich Cathodes via Gradient Penetration of Nonmagnetic Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are considered a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high capacity. However, they still suffer from the practical challenges of low discharge capacity and poor rate capability due to the hysteresis of Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics. Herein, based on the regulation of the lattice magnetic frustration, the Li/Ni intermixing defects as the primary origin of kinetic hysteresis are radically addressed via the doping of the nonmagnetic Si element. Meanwhile, by adopting gradient penetration doping, a robust Si&#8208;O surface structure with reversible lattice oxygen evolution and low lattice strain is constructed on Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathodes to suppress the formation of&#160;surface dense&#160; barrier layer. With the remarkably enhanced Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics in atomic and electrode particle scales, the as&#8208;obtained cathodes (LiNixMn1&#8208;xSi0.01O2, 0.6 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.9) achieve superior performance in discharge capacity, rate capability, and durability. This work highlights the coupling effect of magnetic structure and interfacial chemicals on Li&#8208;ion transport properties, and the concept will inspire more researchers to conduct an intensive study.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Synthesis of Acetic Acid from Hydroxyl&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of Methane at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct methane conversion and, in particular, the aerobic oxidation to acetic acid, remain an eminent challenge. Here, we reported&#160;a&#160;zeolite&#8208;supported Au&#8208;Fe catalyst (Au&#8208;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5)&#160;that converted&#160;methane to acetic acid with molecular oxygen as an oxidant in the presence of CO. Specifically, Au nanoparticles catalyzed&#160;the formation of hydroxyl species from the reaction&#160;of&#160;CO, O2, and H2O, meanwhile ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;supported atomically dispersed Fe species were responsible for the hydroxyl&#8208;mediated coupling of CH4&#160;and CO to generate&#160;acetic acid.&#160;The reaction over 50&#160;mg of Au&#8208;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#160;under 62 bar (CH4:&#160;CO:&#160;O2&#160;= 14:&#160;14:&#160;3)&#160;at 120 &#176;C for 3.0 h&#160;yielded 5.7&#160;millimoles of acetic acid per gram of the catalyst (mmol&#160;gcat&#8208;1) with the selectivity of 92%, outperformed most of reported catalysts. Significantly, the catalyst remained active even at 60 &#176;C. We anticipate that this hydroxyl&#8208;mediated route may guide the design of optimized catalysts for the direct methane functionalization&#160;at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Based Enantioconvergent Reductive Couplings of Racemic Allenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;based enantioconvergent reactions have become a powerful strategy to synthesize enantiopure compounds from racemic starting materials. However, existing methods primarily address precursors with central chirality, neglecting those with axial chirality. Herein, we describe the enantioconvergent reductive coupling of racemic allenes with aldehydes, facilitated by a photoredox, chromium, and cobalt triple catalysis system. This method selectively affords one product from sixteen possible regio&#8208; and stereoisomers. The protocol leverages CoIII&#8208;H mediated hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and Cr&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;polar crossover for efficient stereoablation of axial chirality and asymmetric addition, respectively. Supported by mechanistic insights from control experiments, deuterium labeling, and DFT calculations, our approach offers synthetic chemists a valuable tool for creating enantioenriched chiral homoallylic alcohols, promising to advance radical&#8208;based strategies for synthesizing complex chiral molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Helicates as Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) Substrates with High Tailorability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of novel functionalized supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) can enable new applications in domains that include purification and sensing. In this study, employing a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy, we designed and prepared a series of benzochalcogenodiazole&#8208;based metallohelicates as high&#8208;efficiency charge transfer surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates, expanding the range of applications for these metallohelicates. Through structural modifications, including the substitution of single heteroatoms on ligands, replacement of coordinating metals, and alteration of ligand framework linkages, the Raman performance of these metallohelicates as substrates were systematically optimized. Notably, the SERS enhancement factors (EFs) of the metallohelicate&#8208;based SERS substrates were significantly enhanced to levels as high as 1.03 &#215; 107, which rivals the EFs of noble metals devoid of "hot spots". Additionally, the underlying Raman enhancement mechanisms of these metallohelicates have been investigated through a combination of control experiments and theoretical calculations. This study not only demonstrates the utility of metallohelicates as SERS substrates but also offers insights and materials for the development of high&#8208;efficiency new charge transfer SERS substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesostructure&#8208;Specific Configuration of *CO Adsorption for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Machine Learning Algorithm Guides Catalyst Choices for Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carefully curated dataset of reactions catalyzed by magnesium&#8208;based catalysts underlies a Machine&#8208;Learning model guiding the choices of catalysts &#8220;optimal&#8221; for reactions unseen during training. When this model is tested by experiment, it suggests catalysts that yield higher ee values, replace rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal catalysts, or improve the efficiency of stereoselective transformations relevant to drug discovery.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;chemical literature encompasses large numbers of catalysts and reactions they can effect. Many of these examples are published merely to document the catalysts&#8217; scope but do not necessarily guarantee that a given catalyst is &#8220;optimal&#8221;&#8212;in terms of yield or enantiomeric excess&#8212;for a particular reaction. This paper describes a Machine Learning model that aims to improve such catalyst&#8208;reaction assignments based on the carefully curated literature data. As we show here for the case of asymmetric magnesium catalysis, this model achieves relatively high accuracy and offers out of&#8208;the&#8208;box predictions successfully validated by experiment, e.g., in synthetically demanding asymmetric reductions or Michael additions.

         <title>CdS Quantum Dot Gels as a Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalyst for C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdS quantum dot gels are potent direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalysts for C&#8722;H bond activation, in which photoexcited CdS directly attracts a hydrogen atom from a C&#8722;H substrate to generate a neutral radical.







Abstract
Here, we report CdS quantum dot (QD) gels, a three&#8208;dimensional network of interconnected CdS QDs, as a new type of direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalyst for C&#8722;H activation. We discovered that the photoexcited CdS QD gel could generate various neutral radicals, including &#945;&#8208;amido, heterocyclic, acyl, and benzylic radicals, from their corresponding stable molecular substrates, including amides, thio/ethers, aldehydes, and benzylic compounds. Its C&#8722;H activation ability imparts a broad substrate and reaction scope. The mechanistic study reveals that this reactivity is intrinsic to CdS materials, and the neutral radical generation did not proceed via the conventional sequential electron transfer and proton transfer pathway. Instead, the C&#8722;H bonds are activated by the photoexcited CdS QD gel via a d&#8208;HAT mechanism. This d&#8208;HAT mechanism is supported by the linear correlation between the logarithm of the C&#8722;H bond activation rate constant and the C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy (BDE) with a Br&#248;nsted slope &#945;=0.5. Our findings expand the currently limited direct hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis toolbox and provide new possibilities for photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Inducing Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death through Oxygen&#8208;Economized Photodynamic Therapy with Nitric Oxide&#8208;Releasing Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two NO&#8208;releasing phthalocyanine&#8208;based photosensitizers have been prepared which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration through the NO released upon the interaction with the intracellular glutathione, sparing more oxygen for the photodynamic action. This oxygen&#8208;economized photodynamic therapy can also elicit the release of various damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, effectively triggering immunogenic cell death.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) for eradication of cancer cells. Its effectiveness is governed by the oxygen content, which is scarce in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We report herein two zinc(II) phthalocyanines substituted with two or four nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing moieties, namely ZnPc&#8208;2NO and ZnPc&#8208;4NO, which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration, thereby sparing more intracellular oxygen for PDT. Using HT29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and A549 human lung carcinoma cells, we have demonstrated that both conjugates release NO upon interaction with the intracellular glutathione, which can reduce the cellular oxygen consumption rate and adenosine triphosphate generation and alter the mitochondrial membrane potential. They can also relieve the hypoxic status of cancer cells and decrease the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor protein HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Upon light irradiation, both conjugates can generate ROS and induce cytotoxicity even under a hypoxic condition, overcoming the oxygen&#8208;dependent nature of PDT. Interestingly, the photodynamic action of ZnPc&#8208;2NO elicits the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, inducing the maturation of dendritic cells and triggering an antitumor immune response. The immunogenic cell death caused by this oxygen&#8208;economized PDT has been demonstrated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.

A D&#8211;A type selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide derivative (SePDI3) is developed as CIM for OSCs. SePDI3 shows simultaneous superior charge transport and extraction capacity. Finally, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displayed a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs.

Abstract
The cathode interlayer is crucial for the development of organic solar cells (OSCs), but the research on simple and efficient interlayer materials is lagging behind. Here, a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) typed selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide (PDI) derivative (SePDI3) is developed as cathode interlayer material (CIM) for OSCs, and a non&#8208;fused PDI derivative (PDI3) is used as the control CIM for comparison. Compared to PDI3, SePDI3 shows a stronger self&#8208;doping effect and better crystallinity, resulting in better charge transport ability. Furthermore, the interaction between SePDI3 and L8&#8208;BO can form an efficient extraction channel, leading to superior charge extraction behavior. Finally, benefitting from significantly enhanced charge transport and extraction capacity, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displays a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO active layer, which is one of the top efficiencies reported to date in binary OSCs based novel CIMs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy to develop high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.

         <title>Manipulating the Spin State of Spinel Octahedral Sites via a &#960;&#8211;&#960; Type Orbital Coupling to Boost Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in Co3O4 can be fine&#8208;regulated by a &#960;&#8211;&#960; type orbital coupling involving the CoOh t2g, O 2p, and Ce t2u orbital. Mechanism investigations reveal that&#160;a &#960;&#8208;donation interaction between the bridging O 2p and Ce fyz2 orbital effectively bolsters the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. The obtained electrocatalyst with the eg occupancy optimized to 1.094 presents an excellent water oxidation performance.







Abstract
Spin state is often regarded as the crucial valve to release the reactivity of energy&#8208;related catalysts, yet it is also challenging to precisely manipulate, especially for the active center ions occupied at the specific geometric sites. Herein, a &#960;&#8211;&#960; type orbital coupling of 3d (Co)&#8208;2p (O)&#8208;4f (Ce) was employed to regulate the spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in the composite of Co3O4/CeO2. More specifically, the equivalent high&#8208;spin ratio of CoOh can reach to 54.7&#8201;% via tuning the CeO2 content, thereby triggering the average eg filling (1.094) close to the theoretical optimum value. The corresponding catalyst exhibits a superior water oxidation performance with an overpotential of 251&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, rivaling most cobalt&#8208;based oxides state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The &#960;&#8211;&#960; type coupling corroborated by the matched energy levels between Ce t1u/t2u&#8208;O and CoOh t2g&#8208;O &#960; type bond in the calculated crystal orbital Hamilton population and partial density of states profiles, stimulates a &#960;&#8208;donation between O 2p and &#960;&#8208;symmetric Ce 4fyz2 orbital, consequently facilitating the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. This work offers an in&#8208;depth insight into understanding the 4f and 3d orbital coupling for spin state optimization in composite oxides.

         <title>A Fragment&#8208;Based Competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR Platform For Hotspot&#8208;Directed Ligand Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fragment screening identified three ligand binding hotspots across the active site of 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase from Mycobacterium abscessus. Fragment sized fluorinated reporters were developed for each hotspot and used in competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR experiments to quantify hotspot&#8208;specific ligand binding affinities across three orders of magnitude, from low mM to low &#956;M.







Abstract
Ligand binding hotspots are regions of protein surfaces that form particularly favourable interactions with small molecule pharmacophores. Targeting interactions with these hotspots maximises the efficiency of ligand binding. Existing methods are capable of identifying hotspots but often lack assays to quantify ligand binding and direct elaboration at these sites. Herein, we describe a fragment&#8208;based competitive 19F Ligand Based&#8197;NMR (LB&#8208;NMR) screening platform that enables routine, quantitative ligand profiling focused at ligand&#8208;binding hotspots. As a proof of concept, the method was applied to 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) from Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs). X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterisation of the hits from a 960&#8208;member fragment screen identified three ligand&#8208;binding hotspots across the PPAT active site. From the fragment hits a collection of 19F reporter candidates were designed and synthesised. By rigorous prioritisation and use of optimisation workflows, a single 19F reporter molecule was generated for each hotspot. Profiling the binding of a set of structurally characterised ligands by competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR with this suite of 19F reporters recapitulated the binding affinity and site ID assignments made by ITC and X&#8208;ray crystallography. This quantitative mapping of ligand binding events at hotspot level resolution establishes the utility of the fragment&#8208;based competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR screening platform for hotspot&#8208;directed ligand profiling

         <title>The Dependence of Solid Electrolyte Interphase on the Crystal Facet of Current Collector in Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of Cu facets on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and Li deposition behavior are demonstrated using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The strong adsorption of Cu(100) facet to anions guides more anions to participate in the inner Helmholtz plane and promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foil with a single [100] orientation display outstanding performance.







Abstract
The continuous electrolyte decomposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have largely hindered the development of Li metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate that tuning the facet of current collector can regulate the composition of SEI and the subsequent Li deposition behavior using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the (100) facet of Cu possesses strong adsorption to anions, guiding more anions to participate preferentially in the inner Helmholtz plane and further promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foils with a single [100] orientation (s&#8208;Cu(100)) achieve the dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition with enhanced Li plating/stripping reversibility. Moreover, the Li anode deposited on s&#8208;Cu(100) can stabilize the operation of an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (350&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with a low negative/positive capacity ratio (~2) and lean electrolyte (2.4&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1) for 150&#8197;cycles. Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of electrolytes employed different anions. This work provides new insights into the correlation between the SEI and current collector, opening a universal avenue towards high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. We describe the development of a diagnostic assay based on the detection of tumor&#8208;associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) in the sera using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes.

Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic approaches to identify the disease as early as possible. We have developed a diagnostic assay for pancreatic cancer based on the detection of naturally occurring tumor associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. We used a structure&#8208;guided approach to develop unnatural glycopeptides as model antigens for tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. We designed a collection of 13 glycopeptides to bind either SM3 or 5E5, two monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitopes known to recognize tumor associated MUC1. Glycopeptide binding to SM3 or 5E5 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These model antigens were conjugated to gold nanoparticles and used in a dot&#8208;blot assay to detect autoantibodies in serum samples from pancreatic cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Nanoparticle probes with glycopeptides displaying the SM3 epitope did not have diagnostic potential. Instead, nanoparticle probes displaying glycopeptides with high affinity for 5E5 could discriminate between cancer patients and healthy controls. Remarkably, the best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers CA19&#8208;9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

Remarkably, the best-discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Transfer Enhanced by a Minimal Energetic Driving Force at the Organic&#8208;Semiconductor Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron transfer from the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state to the first triplet excited state (T1) are investigated in upconversion organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with 45 different material combinations. According to our analysis based on the semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory, CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1&#8197;eV) and is expressed by a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1&#8197;eV.







Abstract
The energetic driving force for electron transfer must be minimized to realize efficient optoelectronic devices including organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Exploring the dynamics of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state at an interface leads to a comprehension of the relationship between energetics, electron&#8208;transfer efficiency, and device performance. Here, we investigate the electron transfer from the CT state to the triplet excited state (T1) in upconversion OLEDs with 45 material combinations. By analyzing the CT emission and the singlet excited&#8208;state emission from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation via the dark T1, their energetics and electron&#8208;transfer efficiencies are extracted. We demonstrate that the CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by the stronger CT interaction and a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1&#8197;eV), which is explained using the Marcus theory with a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1&#8197;eV. Through our analysis, a novel donor&#8211;acceptor combination for the OLED is developed and shows an efficient blue emission with an extremely low turn&#8208;on voltage of 1.57&#8197;V. This work provides a solution to control interfacial CT states for efficient optoelectronic devices without energy loss.

         <title>Highly Fluorinated Nanospace in Porous Organic Salts with High Water Stability/Capability and Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work successfully constructed uniform highly fluorinated nanospaces without impurities such as metals. This highly hydrophobic nanospace exhibits high water stability, and is the first all&#8208;organic hydrophobic nanospace where water molecules can enter. Furthermore, this nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity of 1.34&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S/cm at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;%&#8201;RH.







Abstract
Water in hydrophobic nanospaces shows specific dynamic properties different from bulk water. The investigation of these properties is important in various research fields, including materials science, chemistry, and biology. The elucidation of the correlation between properties of water and hydrophobic nanospaces requires nanospaces covered only with simple hydrophobic group (e.g., fluorine) without impurities such as metals. This work successfully fabricated all&#8208;organic diamondoid porous organic salts (d&#8208;POSs) with highly fluorinated nanospaces, wherein hydrophobic fluorine atoms are densely exposed on the void surfaces, by combining fluorine substituted triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) derivatives with tetrahedral tetrasulfonic acid. This d&#8208;POSs with a highly fluorinated nanospace significantly improved their water stability, retaining their crystal structure even when immersed in water over one week. Moreover, this highly hydrophobic and fluorinated nanospace adsorbs 160&#8197;mL(STP)/g of water vapor at Pe/P0=0.90; this is the first hydrophobic nanospace, which water molecules can enter, in an all&#8208;organic porous material. Furthermore, this highly fluorinated nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity (1.34&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S/cm) at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;%&#8201;RH. POSs with tailorable nanospaces may significantly advance the elucidation of the properties of specific &#8220;water&#8221; in pure hydrophobic environments.

         <title>Fabrication of Azacrown Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cathode Performance in Aqueous Ni&#8722;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical linker derived from azacrown ether, utilized in COF synthesis via reticular synthesis. The embedded crown ether moieties and imine linkages faciltate Ni2+ ions immobilization via post&#8208;modification. The resulting composite COF materials exhibit high nickel loading capacity, maintaining porosity and crystallinity, demonstrate promise as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries, offering high discharge capacity and exceptional cycling stability.







Abstract
Crown ethers (CEs), known for their exceptional host&#8211;guest complexation, offer potential as linkers in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for enhanced performance in catalysis and host&#8211;guest binding. However, their highly flexible conformation and low symmetry limit the diversity of CE&#8208;derived COFs. Here, we introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical azacrown ether (ACE) building block, tris(pyrido)[18]crown&#8208;6 (TPy18C6), for COF fabrication (ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) via reticular synthesis. This approach enables precise integration of CEs into COFs, enhancing Ni2+ ion immobilization while maintaining crystallinity. The resulting Ni2+&#8208;doped COFs (Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) exhibit high discharge capacity (up to 1.27&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 8&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and exceptional cycling stability (&gt;1000&#8197;cycles) as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries. This study serves as an exemplar of the seamless integration of macrocyclic chemistry and reticular chemistry, laying the groundwork for extending the macrocyclic&#8208;synthon driven strategy to a diverse array of COF building blocks, ultimately yielding advanced materials tailored for specific applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Local Electric Field Induced by Dual Heteroatoms on Copper Boosts Efficient CO2 Reduction Over Ultrawide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver and tin heteroatoms are injected into the nano&#8208;porous copper to construct an asymmetric local electric field, thereby realizing excellent selectivity up to a nearly 100&#8201;% Faraday efficiency for CO over ultrawide potential window, a superior CO local current density of 340&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and high energy efficiency of 90&#8201;% for CO production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 powered by renewable electricity provides an elegant route for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and feedstocks, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. Herein, Ag and Sn heteroatoms were simultaneously introduced into nanoporous Cu (np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu) mainly in the form of an asymmetric local electric field for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. The designed np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu catalyst realizes a recorded 90&#8201;% energy efficiency and a 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency over ultrawide potential window (&#916;E=1.4&#8197;V), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Au and Ag&#8208;based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that Ag and Sn heteroatoms incorporated into Cu matrix could generate strong and asymmetric local electric field, which promotes the activation of CO2 molecules, enhances the stabilization of the *COOH intermediate, and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR.

The designed np-Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu catalyst realizes a recorded 90&#8201;% energy efficiency and a 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency over ultrawide potential window (&#916;E=1.4&#8197;V), outperforming state-of-the-art Au and Ag-based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that Ag and Sn heteroatoms incorporated into Cu matrix could generate strong and asymmetric local electric field, which promotes the activation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, enhances the stabilization of the *COOH intermediate, and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus favoring the production of CO during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pendant Proton&#8208;Relays Systematically Tune the Rate and Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Ammonia Generation in a Fe&#8208;Porphyrin Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>

Installation of secondary sphere proton relaying functionalities within an iron&#8208;porphyrin based MOF, enables systematic adjustment of heterogeneous electrocatalytic nitrite reduction performance in aqueous solution. Thus, high rates of NH3 production at more than 90&#8201;% faradaic efficiency were obtained.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction (eNO2RR) is a promising alternative route to produce ammonia (NH3). Until now, several molecular catalysts have shown capability to homogeneously reduce nitrite to NH3, while taking advantage of added secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities to direct catalytic performance. Yet, realizing such control over heterogeneous electrocatalytic surfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that heterogenization of a Fe&#8208;porphyrin molecular catalyst within a 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF), allows efficient eNO2RR to NH3. On top of that, installation of pendant proton relaying moieties proximal to the catalytic site, resulted in significant improvement in catalytic activity and selectivity. Notably, systematic manipulation of NH3 faradaic efficiency (up to 90&#8201;%) and partial current (5&#8208;fold increase) was achieved by varying the proton relay&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst molar ratio. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis show that the proton relays simultaneously aid in generating and stabilizing of reactive Fe&#8208;bound NO intermediate. Thus, this concept offers new molecular tools to tune heterogeneous electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Selective Cleavage of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 Bond for Lignin Depolymerization via Paired&#8208;Electrolysis in an Undivided Cell</title>

For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the lignin (models) depolymerization and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in a selective and energy&#8208;effective manner.







Abstract
The cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds is one of the most promising strategies for lignin&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, current catalytic system capable of selectively breaking C&#8722;O bonds in lignin often requires a precious metal catalyst and/or harsh conditions such as high&#8208;pressure H2 and elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a novel protocol of paired electrolysis to effectively cleave the C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 bond of lignin model compounds and real lignin at room temperature and ambient pressure. For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in an energy&#8208;effective manner. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, remarkable yield with excellent chemoselectivity, and feasibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that indirect H* (chemical absorbed hydrogen) reduction instead of direct electron transfer might be the pathway for the cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage.

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Stability of Mg Metal Anodes: High&#8208;Exposure (002) Facets and Nanosheet Arrays for Superior Mg Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mg foil, featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and nanosheet arrays architecture, is fabricated via a selective etching strategy. The facet property encourages smooth nucleation and dense deposition, while the distinctive morphology ensures uniform electric field and Mg ion flux distributions. As a result, an improved Mg plating/stripping reversibility and extended cycle stability is achieved.







Abstract
Magnesium metal batteries (MMBs), recognized as promising contenders for post&#8208;lithium battery technologies, face challenges such as uneven magnesium (Mg) plating and stripping behaviors, leading to uncontrollable dendrite growth and irreversible structural damage. Herein, we have developed a Mg foil featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and an architecture of nanosheet arrays (termed (002)&#8208;Mg), created through a one&#8208;step acid etching method. Specifically, the prominent exposure of Mg (002) facets, known for their inherently low surface and adsorption energies with Mg atoms, not only facilitates smooth nucleation and dense deposition but also significantly mitigates side reactions on the Mg anode. Moreover, the nanosheet arrays on the surface evenly distribute the electric field and Mg ion flux, enhancing Mg ion transfer kinetics. As a result, the fabricated (002)&#8208;Mg electrodes exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;cycle performance, lasting over 6000&#8197;h (&gt;8 months) at a current density of 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for a capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the corresponding pouch cells equipped with various electrolytes and cathodes demonstrate remarkable capacity and cycling stability, highlighting the superior electrochemical compatibility of the (002)&#8208;Mg electrode. This study provides new insights into the advancement of durable MMBs by modifying the crystal structure and morphology of Mg.

         <title>Modularization of Immobilized Multienzyme Cascades for Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;enzyme cascade has been developed for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective C&#8722;H amination of aromatic alkanes by constructing two immobilized bienzymatic modules and integrating them in tandem packed&#8208;bed reactors. The resulting flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Multienzyme cascades (MECs) have gained much attention in synthetic chemistry but remain far from being a reliable synthetic tool. Here we report a four&#8208;enzyme cascade comprising a cofactor&#8208;independent and a cofactor self&#8208;sustaining bienzymatic modules for the enantioselective benzylic C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes, a challenging transformation from bulk chemicals to high value&#8208;added chiral amines. The two modules were subsequently optimized by enzyme co&#8208;immobilization with microenvironmental tuning, and finally integrated in a gas&#8208;liquid segmented flow system, resulting in simultaneous improvements in enzyme performance, mass transfer, system compatibility, and productivity. The flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is a 90&#8208;fold increase over the highest value previously reported.

The flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &amp;gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space-time yield (STY) of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a 90-fold increase over the highest value previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Iron&#8208;Based Single Atom Materials for General and Efficient Synthesis of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;based single atoms (Fe&#8208;SACs) as reductive amination catalysts have been prepared by the pyrolysis of Fe&#8208;nitrogen complexes on SiO2 and subsequent removal of silica. Applying these Fe&#8208;SACs, all kinds of amines including N&#8208;methylated products, amino acid esters, amino acid amides and selected drug molecules are synthesized starting from inexpensive and easily accessible carbonyl compounds and ammonia or amines in presence of molecular hydrogen.







Abstract
Earth abundant metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with highly active and at the same time stable isolated metal sites constitute a key factor for the advancement of sustainable and cost&#8208;effective chemical synthesis. In particular, the development of more practical, and durable iron&#8208;based materials is of central interest for organic synthesis, especially for the preparation of chemical products related to life science applications. Here, we report the preparation of Fe&#8208;single atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SACs) entrapped in N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon support with unprecedented potential in the preparation of different kinds of amines, which represent privileged class of organic compounds and find increasing application in daily life. The optimal Fe&#8208;SACs allow for the reductive amination of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones with ammonia and amines to produce diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary amines including N&#8208;methylated products as well as drugs, agrochemicals, and other biomolecules (amino acid esters and amides) utilizing green hydrogen.

         <title>A Cost&#8208;Effective Sulfide Solid Electrolyte Li7P3S7.5O3.5 with Low Density and Excellent Anode Compatibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid electrolyte showing the combination of strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density, and anode compatibility is indispensable for the commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries, but none of the previously reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets this requirement. Here, a solid electrolyte, Li7P3S7.5O3.5, is discovered, and it displays all these three characteristics simultaneously.







Abstract
The commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSLBs) demands solid electrolytes with strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density (for enabling satisfactory energy densities), and decent anode compatibility (the need for cathode compatibility can be circumvented by the cathode coating techniques that are widely applied in sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs). However, none of the reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets these requirements simultaneously. Here, we design a Li7P3S7.5O3.5 (LPSO) solid electrolyte, which shows a combination of all the aforementioned characteristics. The synthesis of this material does not need the expensive Li2S, so the raw materials cost is only $14.42/kg, which, unlike most solid electrolytes, lies below the $50/kg threshold for commercialization. The density of LPSO is 1.70&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3, considerably lower than those of the oxide (typically above 5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and chloride (around 2.5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) solid electrolytes. Besides, LPSO also shows excellent anode compatibility. The Li|LPSO|Li cell cycles stably with a potential of ~50&#8197;mV under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 4200&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell with the Si anode shows a capacity retention of 89.29&#8201;% after 200 cycles under 88.6&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C.

A tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as high voltage, high energy density, and stable catholyte for nonaqueous redox flow battery.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with high energy densities are essential for efficient and sustainable long&#8208;term energy storage on a grid scale. To advance the development of nonaqueous RFBs with high energy densities, a new organic RFB system employing a molecularly engineered tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as a high energy density catholyte was developed. A synergistic approach to the molecular design of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) was applied, with the incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, which enhance its solubility in organic carbonate electrolytes, and a perfluoro (PerF) group to increase its redox potential. When paired with a lithium metal anode, the two&#8208;electron&#8208;active (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF catholyte produced a cell voltage of 3.56&#8197;V for the first redox process and 3.92&#8197;V for the second redox process. In cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests, the redox chemistry exhibited excellent cycling stability. The Li|(PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF batteries, with concentrations of 0.1&#8197;M and 0.5&#8197;M, demonstrated capacity retention rates of ~94&#8201;% (99.87&#8201;% per cycle, 97.52&#8201;% per day) and 90&#8201;% (99.93&#8201;% per cycle, 99.16&#8201;% per day), and the average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.38&#8201;% and 98.35&#8201;%, respectively. The flow cell achieved a high power density of 129&#8197;mW/cm2. Furthermore, owing to the high redox potential and solubility of (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF, the flow cell attained a high operational energy density of 72&#8197;Wh/L (100&#8197;Wh/L theoretical). A 0.75&#8197;M flow cell exhibited an even higher operational energy density of 96&#8197;Wh/L (150&#8197;Wh/L theoretical).

         <title>Photocatalytic Asymmetric Acyl Radical Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;Aryl Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a &#8220;Radical Amino Ester&#8221; chiral auxiliary, we achieve asymmetric acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangements. This approach efficiently constructs &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides via a HAT strategy.







Abstract
The radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a straightforward strategy for incorporating aryl groups into organic molecules for which asymmetric processes remains rare. By employing a readily available and non&#8208;expensive chiral auxiliary, we developed a highly efficient asymmetric photocatalytic acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom&#8211;transfer photocatalyst, along with aldehydes or C&#8722;H containing precursors. The rearranged products exhibited excellent diastereoselectivities (7&#8201;:&#8201;1 to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;d.r.) and chiral auxiliary was easily removed. Mechanistic studies allowed understanding the transformation in which density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Chromium&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Reductant&#8208;Free Asymmetric Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) Reaction Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A variety of chiral allylic alcohols can be synthesized through a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction between alkenyl (pseudo)halides and aldehydes. This innovative technique facilitates both oxidative addition and insertion solely using nickel, representing a significant departure from the traditional NHK reaction pathway that requires both nickel and chromium salts.







Abstract
Chiral allylic alcohols are highly prized in synthetic chemistry due to their versatile reactivity stemming from both alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. While the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of allylic alcohols, it suffers from drawbacks such as the use of toxic chromium salts, high amounts of metal reductants, and poor enantiocontrol. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach involving a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric NHK reaction for the production of chiral allylic alcohols. This method marries alkenyl (pseudo)halides with aldehydes, leveraging a synergistic blend of a chiral nickel catalyst and a photocatalyst. This innovative technique enables both oxidative addition and insertion just using nickel, diverging significantly from the conventional NHK reaction pathway mediated by nickel and chromium salts. The adoption of this methodology holds immense promise for crafting a spectrum of intricate compounds, particularly those of significance in pharmaceuticals. Detailed experimental investigations have shed light on the metallaphotoredox process, further enhancing our understanding and enabling further advancements.

         <title>Chemically&#8208;Driven Autonomous Janus Electromagnets as Magnetotactic Swimmers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;polarization of solenoidal Janus devices into magnetic dipoles is made possible by the efficient coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous and kinetically favored redox reactions taking place at each extremity of the object. This is a straightforward strategy for the design of non&#8208;ferromagnetic, chemically&#8208;driven electromagnets.







Abstract
An electromagnet is a particular device that takes advantage of electrical currents to produce concentrated magnetic fields. The most well&#8208;known example is a conventional solenoid, having the form of an elongated coil and creating a strong magnetic field through its center when it is connected to a current source. Spontaneous redox reactions located at opposite ends of an anisotropic Janus swimmer can effectively mimic a standard power source, due to their ability to wirelessly generate a local electric current. Herein, we propose the coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous redox reactions occurring at the extremities of a hybrid Mg/Pt Janus swimmer with a solenoidal geometry to generate significant magnetic fields. These chemically driven electromagnets spontaneously transform the redox&#8208;induced electric current into a magnetic field with a strength in the range of &#956;T upon contact with an acidic medium. Such on&#8208;board magnetization allows them to perform compass&#8208;like rotational motion and magnetotactic displacement in the presence of external magnetic field gradients, without the need of using ferromagnetic materials for the swimmer design. The torque force experienced by the swimmer is proportional to the internal redox current, and by varying the composition of the solution, it is possible to fine&#8208;tune its angular velocity.

         <title>Inducing and Switching the Handedness of Polyacetylenes with Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane Pendants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing stimuli&#8208;responsive topologically chiral [2]catenanes as pendants, the precise regulations of chirality induction from the pendants to poly(phenylacetylenes) main chains lead to the successful construction of novel poly[2]catenanes with multistate switchable handedness, providing not only a new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.







Abstract
To explore the chirality induction and switching of topological chirality, poly[2]catenanes composed of helical poly(phenylacetylenes) (PPAs) main chain and topologically chiral [2]catenane pendants are described for the first time. These poly[2]catenanes with optically active [2]catenanes on side chains were synthesized by polymerization of enantiomerically pure topologically chiral [2]catenanes with ethynyl polymerization site and/or point chiral moiety. The chirality information of [2]catenane pendants was successfully transferred to the main chain of polyene backbones, leading to preferred&#8208;handed helical conformations, while the introduction of point chiral units has negligible effect on the overall helices. More interestingly, attributed to unique dynamic feature of the [2]catenane pendants, these polymers revealed dynamic response behaviors to solvents, temperature, and sodium ions, resulting in the fully reversible switching on/off of the chirality induction. This work provides not only new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Anion Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Alkanethiolate&#8208;Protected PtAu12 Superatoms: Charging Energy in Vacuum vs Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charging energy of PtAu24(SCnH2n+1)18 in vacuum was evaluated by gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy. Permittivity of the ligand layer, estimated based on the concentric&#8208;capacitor model, decreased with n. The n&#8208;dependent charging behavior is explained by inhomogeneous monolayers due to the formation of bundles of the longer alkyl chains.







Abstract
The charging behavior of molecular Au clusters protected by alkanethiolate (SCnH2n+1=SCn) is, under electrochemical conditions, significantly affected by the penetration of solvents and electrolytes into the SCn layer. In this study, we estimated the charging energy EC(n) associated with [PtAu24(SCn)18]&#8722;+e&#8722;&#8594;[PtAu24(SCn)18]2&#8722; (n=4, 8, 12, and 16) in vacuum using mass&#8208;selected gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy of [PtAu24(SCn)18]z (z=&#8722;1 and &#8722;2). The EC(n) values of PtAu24(SCn)18 in vacuum are significantly larger than those in solution and decrease with n in contrast to the behavior reported for Au25(SCn)18 in solution. The effective relative permittivity (&#1013;m*) of the SCn layer in vacuum is estimated to be 2.3&#8211;2.0 based on the double&#8208;concentric&#8208;capacitor model. Much smaller &#1013;m* values in vacuum than those in solution are explained by the absence of solvent/electrolyte penetration into the monolayer. The gradual decrease of &#1013;m* with n is ascribed to the appearance of an exposed surface region due to the bundle formation of long alkyl chains.

         <title>Understanding Ligand Effects on Bielectronic Transitions: Chemo&#8208; and Electroreduction of Rhodium Bis(Diphosphine) Complexes to Low Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;electron reduction to low&#8208;valent rhodium &#8722;I is underpinned by structural rearrangements that defines whether the redox transitions are stepwise or in a bielectronic fashion. Study of a parametrized series of Rh bis(diphosphine) complexes identifies how ligand parameters influence this behaviour, whereas an expedient computed electronic parameter allows correlating electronics and geometrics with redox potentials.







Abstract
Rhodium complexes in the &#8722;I and 0 oxidation states are of great potential interest in catalytic applications. In contrast to their rhodium +I congeners, however, the structural and electronic parameters governing their access and stability are far less understood. Herein, we investigate the two&#8208;electron reduction of a parameterized series of bis(diphosphine) Rh complexes [Rh(dxpy)2]NTf2 (x=P&#8208;substituent, y=alkanediyl bridging P atoms). Through (electro)reductions from the RhI parents, Rh&#8722;I d10&#8208;complexes were obtained and characterized spectroscopically, including 103Rh NMR data. The reductive steps convolute with structural rearrangements from square planar to tetrahedral coordination. We found that the extent of these reorganisations defines whether the first E0(RhI/0) and second E0(Rh0/&#8722;I) reduction potentials are normally ordered, leading to monoelectronic stepwise transitions, or inverted, giving bielectronic events. Reductionist approaches based on Hammett parameters or the P&#8722;Rh&#8208;P bite angles provide only partial correlations with the redox potentials. However, we identified the C&#8722;O stretch of analogue diphosphine complexes as an expedient computational parameter that enables these correlations through both electronic and geometric features, even in a predictive manner. Gaining control over two&#8208;electron reduction behaviors through rationalized ligand effects has potential impact beyond Rh complexes, for molecular and enzymatic metal sites commonly exhibiting bielectronic transitions.

         <title>Value&#8208;Added Upcycling of PET to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexanedimethanol by a Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistage relay process has been developed that directly transforms PET into high&#8208;value&#8208;added 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimetha&#8208;nol (CHDM). The process utilizes polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD) as a crucial intermediate, enabling the efficient and trans&#8208;selective production of CHDM. By implementing a temperature&#8208;programmed, three&#8208;stage relay approach, we successfully achieved an isolated CHDM yield of up to 87&#8201;%, with a significantly enhanced trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1.







Abstract
We present an innovative process for directly transforming poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a polymer extensively used in food and beverage packaging, into trans&#8208;isomer&#8208;enriched 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM), a key ingredient in advanced specialty polymers. Our approach leverages a dual&#8208;catalyst system featuring palladium on reduced graphene oxide (Pd/r&#8208;GO) and oxalate&#8208;gel&#8208;derived copper&#8208;zinc oxide (og&#8208;CuZn), utilizing hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis relay catalysis. This method efficiently transforms PET into polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD), which is then converted into CHDM with an impressive overall yield of 95&#8201;% in a two&#8208;stage process. Our process effectively handles various post&#8208;consumer PET plastics, converting them into CHDM with yields between 78&#8201;% and 89&#8201;% across different substrates. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability and scalability of this approach through a temperature&#8208;programmed three&#8208;stage relay process on a 10&#8208;gram scale, which results in purified CHDM with an isolated yield of 87&#8201;% and a notably higher trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1, far exceeding that of commercially available CHDM. This research not only provides a viable route for repurposing PET waste but also enhances the control of selectivity patterns in multistage relay catalysis.

         <title>Direct Microenvironment Modulation of CO2 Electroreduction: Negatively Charged Ag Sites Going beyond Catalytic Surface Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported &#8220;nc&#8208;Ag&#8221; active sites featuring both the high intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. The sites could exert long&#8208;range electrostatic forces to regulate interfacial H2O and CO2 in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This work opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating the intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active sites may also boost catalytic performance. Here we designed &#8220;negatively charged Ag (nc&#8208;Ag)&#8221; active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only mediate the surface processes by bonding with the intermediates), the nc&#8208;Ag sites could also manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO2, but also regulate interfacial H2O and CO2, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with a CO faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Tailored F/N Hybrid Polymers by Using Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;controlled radical copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and N&#8208;vinylamides has been developed with fluorinated thiocarbamate and organocatalyst under mild conditions. This work enables on&#8208;demand synthesis of F/N hybrid polymers as versatile and functional structures that could be readily transformed via chain&#8208;extensions and post&#8208;modifications, facilitating the in situ formation of polymeric interphase layers on Li metal anodes.







Abstract
Controlled radical copolymerizations present attractive avenues to obtain polymers with complicated compositions and sequences. In this work, we report the development of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed controlled copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and acyclic N&#8208;vinylamides for the first time. The approach enables the on&#8208;demand synthesis of a broad scope of amide&#8208;functionalized main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers via novel fluorinated thiocarbamates, facilitating regulations over chemical compositions and alternating fractions by rationally selecting comonomer pairs and ratios. This method allows temporally controlled chain&#8208;growth by external light, and maintains high chain&#8208;end fidelity that promotes facile preparation of block sequences. Notably, the obtained F/N hybrid polymers, upon hydrolysis, afford free amino&#8208;substituted fluoropolymers versatile for post modifications toward various functionalities (e.g., amide, sulfonamide, carbamide, thiocarbamide). We further demonstrate the in situ formation of polymer networks with desirable properties as protective layers on lithium metal anodes, presenting a promising avenue for advancing lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Common Biosynthesis of Non&#8208;Canonical C16 Terpenes through a Fragmentation&#8208;Recombination Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of six bacterial non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers was investigated through a combination of isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results showed that five of these compounds are formed by an unusual fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism. In addition, for anaximandrene a dancing mechanism was discovered, explaining the distribution of labeling over several carbon positions.







Abstract
The biosynthesis of six recently reported non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers, archimedene, aristotelene, eratosthenene, pythagorene, &#945;&#8208;democritene and anaximandrene, was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and isotopic labeling experiments. The results revealed for all compounds except archimedene a unique fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism as previously demonstrated for sodorifen biosynthesis, in addition to a remarkable &#8220;dancing&#8221; mechanism for anaximandrene biosynthesis.

         <title>Molecule Design for Non&#8208;Aqueous Wide&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes via the Intelligentized Screening Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte design is presented. Based on an explainable method, the halogenoid property of the cyanide group is demonstrated similar to fluorine in molecular properties. 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the LiCoO2/Li cell operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Operating a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) in a wide temperature range is essential for ensuring a stable electricity supply amidst fluctuating temperatures caused by climate or terrain changes. Electrolyte plays a pivotal role in determining the temperature durability of batteries. However, specialized electrolytes designed for either low or high temperatures typically possess distinct features. Therefore, wide&#8208;temperature electrolytes (WTEs) are necessary as they encompass a combination of diverse properties, which complicates the clear instruction of WTE design. Here we represent an artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of WTE design through stepwise parameterizations and calculations. Linear mono&#8208;nitriles are identified as ideal wide&#8208;liquidus&#8208;range solvents that can &#8220;softly&#8221; solvate lithium ions by weak interactions. In addition, the explainable modules revealed the halogenoid similarity of cyanide as fluorine on the electrolyte properties (e.g. boiling point and dielectric constant). With the further introduction of an ether bond, 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been eventually determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the battery operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#8201;&#176;C. Particularly, a LiCoO2/Li cell using the proposed WTE can realize stable cycling with capacity retention reaching 72.3&#8201;% after 50 cycles under a high temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Membrane Enthalpy and Entropy Barriers towards Superior Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous TpPa COF interlayer is introduced to regulate the architecture and charge properties of the CAPEI selective layer, culminating in a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. Consequently, M&#8208;TpPaCAPEI exhibits superior separation performance to that of M&#8208;CAPEI and other advanced monovalent ion selective membranes for Li+/Mg2+ separation.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoporous membranes with ion selective transport functions are important for energy utilization, environmental remediation, and fundamental bioinspired engineering. Although mono/multivalent ions can be separated by monovalent ion selective membranes (MISMs), the current theory fails to inspire rapid advances in MISMs. Here, we apply transition state theory (TST) by regulating the enthalpy barrier (&#916;H) and entropy barrier (&#916;S) for designing next&#8208;generation monovalent cation exchange membranes (MCEMs) with great improvement in ion selective separation. Using a molecule&#8208;absorbed porous material as an interlayer to construct a denser selective layer can achieve a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. This recorded performance with a Li+/Mg2+ perm&#8208;selectivity of 25.50 and a Li+ flux of 1.86&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 surpasses the contemporary &#8220;upper bound&#8221; plot for Li+/Mg2+ separations. Most importantly, our synthesized MCEM also demonstrates excellent operational stability during the selective electrodialysis (S&#8208;ED) processes for realizing scalability in practical applications.

         <title>Two RNA Folds from One Sequence: A Ribozyme with Versatile Substrate Processing Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme can adopt a hammerhead fold, allowing them to process various substrates by utilizing their inherent activity and comprehensive conformational flexibility to support RNA cleavage and ligation.







Abstract
We report the design of a single RNA sequence capable of adopting one of two ribozyme folds and catalyzing the cleavage and/or ligation of the respective substrates. The RNA is able to change its conformation in response to its environment, hence it is called chameleon ribozyme (CHR). Efficient RNA cleavage of two different substrates as well as RNA ligation by CHR is demonstrated in separate experiments and in a one pot reaction. Our study shows that sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme intersect with the hammerhead ribozyme and that rather short RNA molecules can have comprehensive conformational flexibility, which is an important feature for the emergence of new functional folds in early evolution.

         <title>Unraveling the Intertwining Factors Underlying the Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two closely related yet distinctly different heterometallic 3d&#8211;4f clusters, featuring respectively a 96&#8208;metal (Dy52Ni44) and a 188&#8208;metal (Dy112Ni76) core built of multi&#8208;shells of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained by the controlled co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+. Comparative experiments under systematically altered conditions were performed to unravel the intertwining factors, including the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base, the reaction temperature, and the reaction duration.







Abstract
Two closely related yet distinctly different cationic clusters, [Dy52Ni44(HEIDA)36(OH)138(OAc)24(H2O)30]10+ (1) and [Dy112Ni76(HEIDA)44(EIDA)24(IDA)4(OH)268(OAc)48(H2O)44]4+ (2) (HEIDA=N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetate), each featuring a multi&#8208;shell core of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained. Depending on the specific conditions used for the co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+, the product can be crystallized out as one particular type of cluster or as a mixture of 1 and 2. How the reaction process was affected by the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base and/or by the reaction temperature and duration was investigated. It has been found that a reaction at a high temperature and/or for an extended period favors the formation of the compact and thermodynamically more stable 1, while a brief reaction with a large amount of the base is good for the kinetic product 2. By tuning these intertwining conditions, the reaction can be regulated toward a particular product.

&lt;p&gt;Two closely related yet distinctly different cationic clusters, [Dy&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;(HEIDA)&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;138&lt;/sub&gt;(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;10+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [Dy&lt;sub&gt;112&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;76&lt;/sub&gt;(HEIDA)&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;(EIDA)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(IDA)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;268&lt;/sub&gt;(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) (HEIDA=&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(2-&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;ydroxyethyl)iminodiacetate), each featuring a multi-shell core of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained. Depending on the specific conditions used for the co-hydrolysis of Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the product can be crystallized out as one particular type of cluster or as a mixture of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. How the reaction process was affected by the amount of hydrolysis-facilitating base and/or by the reaction temperature and duration was investigated. It has been found that a reaction at a high temperature and/or for an extended period favors the formation of the compact and thermodynamically more stable &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, while a brief reaction with a large amount of the base is good for the kinetic product &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. By tuning these intertwining conditions, the reaction can be regulated toward a particular product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Tetra&#8208;substituted Morpholinone and Benzoxazinone Lactols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. DFT studies identify an N&#8208;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction as key to producing products in highly enantioenriched form.







Abstract
The development of methods to allow the selective acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of tetra&#8208;substituted lactols is a recognised synthetic challenge. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields (up to 89&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er) observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating substitution at N(4) and C(2), di&#8208; and spirocyclic substitution at C(5) and C(6), as well as benzannulation (&gt;35&#8197;examples in total). The DKR process is amenable to scale&#8208;up on a 1&#8197;g laboratory scale. The factors leading to high selectivity in this DKR process have been probed through computation, with an N&#8722;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction identified as key to producing ester products in highly enantioenriched form.

The enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative dynamic kinetic resolution of tetra&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide derivatives using (2S,3R)&#8208;HyperBTM (5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the catalyst (&gt;40&#8197;examples in total) is reported.

Abstract
A general and highly enantioselective method for the preparation of tetra&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide esters via isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is reported. Using (2S,3R)&#8208;HyperBTM (5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the catalyst, the scope and limitations of this methodology have been extensively probed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields observed (&gt;40&#8197;examples, up to 99&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er). Substitution of the aromatic core within the 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide skeleton, as well as aliphatic and aromatic substitution at C(3), is readily tolerated. A diverse range of anhydrides, including those from bioactive and pharmaceutically relevant acids, can also be used. The high enantioselectivity observed in this DKR process has been probed computationally, with a key substrate heteroatom donor O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;acyl&#8208;isothiouronium interaction identified through DFT analysis as necessary for enantiodiscrimination.

         <title>Trilayer Polymer Electrolytes Enable Carbon&#8208;Efficient CO2 to Multicarbon Product Conversion in Alkaline Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trilayer polymer electrolyte was devised to enable the coexistence of high local pH at the cathode surface and acidic interfaces within the membrane, thus concurrently favoring C2H4 formation and addressing the CO2 loss issue. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of ~46&#8201;% and a single&#8208;pass conversion of ~32&#8201;% were achieved for C2H4 at industrially relevant current densities.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an appealing method for carbon utilization. Alkaline CO2 electrolyzers exhibit high CO2RR activity, low full&#8208;cell voltages, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the issue of CO2 loss caused by (bi)carbonate formation leads to excessive energy consumption, rendering the process economically impractical. In this study, we propose a trilayer polymer electrolyte (TPE) comprising a perforated anion exchange membrane (PAEM) and a bipolar membrane (BPM) to facilitate alkaline CO2RR. This TPE enables the coexistence of high alkalinity near the catalyst surface and the H+ flux at the interface between the PAEM and the cation exchange layer (CEL) of the BPM, conditions favoring both CO2 reduction to multicarbon products and (bi)carbonate removal in KOH&#8208;fed membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors. As a result, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 46&#8201;% for C2H4, corresponding to a C2+ FE of 64&#8201;% at 260&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 single&#8208;pass conversion (SPC) of approximately 32&#8201;% at 140&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8212;nearly 1.3&#8197;times the limiting SPC in conventional AEM&#8208;MEA electrolyzers. Furthermore, coupling CO2 reduction with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) in the TPE&#8208;MEA electrolyzer reduces the full&#8208;cell voltage to 2.3&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without compromising the C2H4 FE.

         <title>A NIR&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated and Lysosomal&#8208;Targeted Pt(II) Metallacycle for Highly Potent Evoking of Immunogenic Cell Death that Potentiates Cancer Immunotherapy of Deep&#8208;Seated Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>

A platinum (Pt) metallacycle (1) is designed as the first example of a supramolecular near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer. 1 generates boosted reactive oxygen species excited by NIR light and induces lysosomal dysfunction thus synergistically augments immunomodulatory response with the effective dose of about a sixtieth compared with oxaliplatin and efficiently reduces adverse effects.







Abstract
Though platinum (Pt)&#8208;based complexes have been recently exploited as immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers for activating immunotherapy, the effective activation of sufficient immune responses with minimal side effects in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose the first example of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated and lysosomal targeted Pt(II) metallacycle (1) as a supramolecular ICD inducer. 1 synergistically potentiates immunomodulatory response in deep&#8208;seated tumors via multiple&#8208;regulated approaches, involving NIR light excitation, boosted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good selectivity between normal and tumor cells, and enhanced tumor penetration/retention capabilities. Specifically, 1 has excellent depth&#8208;activated ROS production (~7&#8197;mm), accompanied by strong anti&#8208;diffusion and anti&#8208;ROS quenching ability. In vitro experiments demonstrate that 1 exhibits significant cellular uptake and ROS generation in tumor cells as well as respective multicellular tumor spheroids. Based on these advantages, 1 induces a more efficient ICD in an ultralow dose (i.e., 5&#8197;&#956;M) compared with the clinical ICD inducer&#8208;oxaliplatin (300&#8197;&#956;M). In vivo, vaccination experiments further demonstrate that 1 serves as a potent ICD inducer through eliciting CD8+/CD4+ T&#8197;cell response and Foxp3+ T&#8197;cell depletion with negligible adverse effects. This study pioneers a promising avenue for safe and effective metal&#8208;based ICD agents in immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;A platinum (Pt) metallacycle (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is designed as the first example of a supramolecular near-infrared (NIR) light-activated immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; generates boosted reactive oxygen species excited by NIR light and induces lysosomal dysfunction thus synergistically augments immunomodulatory response with the effective dose of about a sixtieth compared with oxaliplatin and efficiently reduces adverse effects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though platinum (Pt)-based complexes have been recently exploited as immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers for activating immunotherapy, the effective activation of sufficient immune responses with minimal side effects in deep-seated tumors remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose the first example of a near-infrared (NIR) light-activated and lysosomal targeted Pt(II) metallacycle (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) as a supramolecular ICD inducer. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; synergistically potentiates immunomodulatory response in deep-seated tumors via multiple-regulated approaches, involving NIR light excitation, boosted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good selectivity between normal and tumor cells, and enhanced tumor penetration/retention capabilities. Specifically, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; has excellent depth-activated ROS production (~7&#8197;mm), accompanied by strong anti-diffusion and anti-ROS quenching ability. In &lt;i&gt;vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments demonstrate that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits significant cellular uptake and ROS generation in tumor cells as well as respective multicellular tumor spheroids. Based on these advantages, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; induces a more efficient ICD in an ultralow dose (i.e., 5&#8197;&#956;M) compared with the clinical ICD inducer-oxaliplatin (300&#8197;&#956;M). In &lt;i&gt;vivo&lt;/i&gt;, vaccination experiments further demonstrate that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; serves as a potent ICD inducer through eliciting CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&#8197;cell response and Foxp3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&#8197;cell depletion with negligible adverse effects. This study pioneers a promising avenue for safe and effective metal-based ICD agents in immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Methylated Sulfone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Back&#8208;Reaction Inhibited Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise methylation of O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen&#8208;intermediate desorption, which obstructs the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics and inhibits the backward reaction of O2 reduction reaction in photocatalytic overall water splitting. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution, which cooperatively contributes to efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) conversion via photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) holds great promise for a sustainable fuel economy, but has been challenged by the backward O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with favored proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dynamics. Here, we report that molecular engineering by methylation inhibits the backward ORR of molecular photocatalysts and enables efficient OWS process. As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution. The resultant DS&#8208;COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70&#8201;% of the backward reaction and a three&#8208;fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H2 evolution rate of 124.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, ranking among the highest reported for organic&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work provides insights for engineering photocatalysts at the molecular level for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

Droplets dancing to non&#8208;classical tunes. Nishant Singh and co&#8208;workers (e202406220) show in their Communication how phase&#8208;separated amino acid droplets can non&#8208;classically evolve into poly&#8208;crystals and fibrous hydrogels. Several complex and direct pathways are explored to achieve transient or stable soft materials, single&#8208; or poly&#8208;crystals by provoking disordered droplets.

Radiofrequency amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. In their Research Article (e202406551) Eduard Y. Chekmenev et&#8197;al. show the utility of an active&#8208;feedback wireless NMR masing detector with the quality factor enhancement up to 1,000,000 to create a RASER at 300 MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional passive NMR detectors. This active&#8208;feedback&#8208;circuit approach potentially enables RASER sensing in a wide range of in vivo applications.

Two structurally intricate heterometallic clusters with cores featuring multiple Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra were synthesized by ligand&#8208;controlled co&#8208;hydrolysis of Ni2+ and Dy3+ ions, as reported by Zhiping Zheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409109). Adjusting the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;promoting base and the reaction temperature and duration afforded selectively the kinetic and thermodynamic species, respectively with a Dy112Ni76 and a Dy52Ni44 core.

         <title>Photorefinery of Biomass and Plastics to Renewable Chemicals using Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysts harness sunlight to convert biomass and plastic waste into value&#8208;added chemicals. These feedstocks utilize photogenerated electrons and/or holes to undergo reduction and/or oxidation transformations, enabling catalytic upgrading in a low&#8208;carbon, renewable energy&#8208;driven, and environmentally friendly manner.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of biomass and plastic waste provides opportunities for sustainable fuel and chemical production. Heterogeneous photocatalysts, typically composed of semiconductors with distinctive redox properties in their conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), facilitate both the oxidative and reductive valorization of organic feedstocks. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the photorefinery of biomass and plastics from the perspective of the redox properties of photocatalysts. We explore the roles of the VB and CB in enhancing the value&#8208;added conversion of biomass and plastics via various pathways. Our aim is to bridge the gap between photocatalytic mechanisms and renewable carbon feedstock valorization, inspiring further development in photocatalytic refinery of biomass and plastics.

         <title>Evolution of Surface Chemistry in Two&#8208;Dimensional MXenes: From Mixed to Tunable Uniform Terminations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>

Covalently modifiable surface terminations distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials and define their intrinsic properties. This minireview highlights recent advances in MXenes with uniform inorganic or organic surface terminations and provides perspectives on future opportunities and challenges in this field.







Abstract
Surface chemistry of MXenes is of great interest as the terminations can define the intrinsic properties of this family of materials. The diverse and tunable terminations also distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials. Conventional fluoride&#8208;containing reagents etching approaches resulted in MXenes with mixed fluoro&#8208;, oxo&#8208;, and hydroxyl surface groups. The relatively strong chemical bonding of MXenes&#8217; surface metal atoms with oxygen and fluorine makes post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications of such MXenes unfavorable. In this minireview, we focus on the recent advances in MXenes with uniform surface terminations. Unconventional methods, including Lewis acidic molten salt etching (LAMS) and bottom&#8208;up direct synthesis, have been proven successful in producing halide&#8208;terminated MXenes. These synthetic strategies have opened new possibilities for MXenes because weaker surface chemical bonds in halide&#8208;terminated MXenes facilitate post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications. Both computational and experimental results on surface termination&#8208;dependent properties are summarized and discussed. Finally, we offer our perspective on the opportunities and challenges in this exciting research field.

         <title>Platelet&#8208;Drug Conjugates Engineered via One&#8208;step Fusion Approach for Metastatic and Postoperative Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>

Platelet&#8208;drug conjugates could be prepared via one&#8208;step fusion with multiple&#8208;drug loaded liposomes. Platelets loaded with chemotherapy agent doxorubicin and cytokine IL&#8208;15 triggered anti&#8208;tumor immune response and inhibited melanoma recurrence in metastatic and postoperative tumor models.







Abstract
The exploration of cell&#8208;based drug delivery systems for cancer therapy has gained growing attention. Approaches to engineering therapeutic cells with multidrug loading in an effective, safe, and precise manner while preserving their inherent biological properties remain of great interest. Here, we report a strategy to simultaneously load multiple drugs in platelets in a one&#8208;step fusion process. We demonstrate doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated liposomes conjugated with interleukin&#8208;15 (IL&#8208;15) could fuse with platelets to achieve both cytoplasmic drug loading and surface cytokine modification with a loading efficiency of over 70&#8201;% within minutes. Due to their inherent targeting ability to metastatic cancers and postoperative bleeding sites, the engineered platelets demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect to suppress lung metastasis and postoperative recurrence in mouse B16F10 melanoma tumor models.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Network of Multicatalytic Reactions using a Single Palladium/Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a metabolism&#8208;inspired artificial system designed to respond to multiple stimuli, operating within an integrated network of mechanistically distinct reactions. Our approach enables the efficient performance of multi&#8208;stage processes using three simple starting materials, controlled by specific triggers, and catalysed by a multifunctional PdII/PtII complex, leading to the preferential synthesis of ten products.







Abstract
Given her unrivalled proficiency in the synthesis of all molecules of life, nature has been an endless source of inspiration for developing new strategies in organic chemistry and catalysis. However, one feature that remains thus far beyond chemists&#8217; grasp is her unique ability to adapt the productivity of metabolic processes in response to triggers that indicate the temporary need for specific metabolites. To demonstrate the remarkable potential of such stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, we present a metabolism&#8208;inspired network of multicatalytic processes capable of selectively synthesising a range of products from simple starting materials. Specifically, the network is built of four classes of distinct catalytic reactions&#8212;cross&#8208;couplings, substitutions, additions, and reductions, involving three organic starting materials&#8212;terminal alkyne, aryl iodide, and hydrosilane. All starting materials are either introduced sequentially or added to the system at the same time, with no continuous influx of reagents or efflux of products. All processes in the system are catalysed by a multifunctional heteronuclear PdII/PtII complex, whose performance can be controlled by specific additives and external stimuli. The reaction network exhibits a substantial degree of orthogonality between different pathways, enabling the controllable synthesis of ten distinct products with high efficiency and selectivity through simultaneous triggering and suppression mechanisms.

         <title>Hirocidins, Cytotoxic Metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis, Induce Mitochondrion&#8208;Mediated Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report hirocidins A&#8722;C, secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with novel architectures and promising inhibitory activity against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. The total synthesis of hirocidin A and mechanistic investigations, which reveal mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis via caspase&#8208;9, provide opportunities to better understand and chemically enhance hirocidin's antiproliferative activity.







Abstract
Recent advances in whole genome sequencing have revealed an immense microbial potential for the production of therapeutic small molecules, even from well&#8208;known producers. To access this potential, we subjected prominent antimicrobial producers to alternative antiproliferative assays using persistent cancer cell lines. Described herein is our discovery of hirocidins, novel secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with antiproliferative activities against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. Hirocidin A is an unusual nine&#8208;membered carbocyclic maleimide and hirocidins B and C are relatives with an unprecedented, bridged azamacrocyclic backbone. Mode of action studies show that hirocidins trigger mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis by inducing expression of the key apoptotic effector caspase&#8208;9. The discovery of new cytotoxins contributes to scaffold diversification in anticancer drug discovery and the reported modes of action and concise total synthetic route for variant A set the stage for unraveling specific targets and biochemical interactions of the hirocidins.

         <title>Stellated cuboctahedron of FeIII</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stellated cuboctahedron of FeIII ions can be constructed using p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene (H4TBC[4]) under solvothermal reaction conditions. The topological arrangement of the metal ions leads to significant spin frustration arising from the high symmetry. A crossover between inverse and direct magnetocaloric effects is observed at 10&#8197;K for applied&#8208;field changes lower than 3 T.







Abstract
The solvothermal reaction of FeCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O and H4TBC[4] in a basic dmf/EtOH solution affords an [FeIII18] Keplerate conforming to a stellated cuboctahedron. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements reveal spin frustration effects arising from the high symmetry. A crossover between inverse and direct magnetocaloric effects is observed at ~10&#8197;K for applied&#8208;field changes lower than 3&#8197;T.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Weakly Coordinating Anions: Molecular Design, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a systematic, computational evaluation of the potential of differently substituted methanide and propenide anions to serve as as weakly coordinating anion, the mixed 3,5&#8208;bistrifluoromethylphenyl (ArF) and triflyl (Tf) substituted propenide was prepared in gram&#8208;scale and shown to balance proton affinity and coordination ability. The applicability of this weakly coordinating carbanion was demonstrated by the stabilization of p&#8208;block cations.







Abstract
Although carbanions, which are usually regarded as reactive species and powerful metalation reagents, can be stabilized through choice of the substitution pattern, they have rarely been considered for the design of weakly coordinating anions (WCA). Here, we report on an evaluation of the potential of a series of differently substituted carbanions to serve as WCA by computational methods. This led us to the synthesis of the water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable allyl anion 1 with triflyl and 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (ArF) moieties, which can be isolated in high yields even on a gram&#8208;scale. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR studies confirmed the weak coordination ability of the anion by showing negligible or only weak interactions with different cations. This property enabled the application of 1 in the stabilization of reactive group&#8197;14 and 15 cations. In addition to the crystallization of a phosphenium cation, the first all&#8208;carbon salt with a non&#8208;aromatic carbanion is reported, which revealed to be a convenient reagent for hydride abstraction such as from silanes. Overall, this work demonstrates the so far untapped potential of carbanions as WCA, that are accessible with a variety of different cations for various applications.

         <title>Complex Pathways Drive Pluripotent Fmoc&#8208;Leucine Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of hierarchical assemblies of Fmoc&#8208;Leu are accessed using non&#8208;classical and classical nucleation following complex pathways. Chemical and thermal inputs lead to phase separated sub&#8208;micron liquid and solid droplets which can transform to fibrous stable hydrogel, transient metastable hydrogels, and milli&#8208;metric polycrystal spherulites or single crystals.







Abstract
Nature uses complex self&#8208;assembly pathways to access distinct functional non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assemblies. This remarkable ability to steer same set of biomolecules into different self&#8208;assembly states is done by avoiding thermodynamic pit. In synthetic systems, on demand control over &#8216;Pathway Complexity&#8217; to access self&#8208;assemblies different from equilibrium structures remains challenging. Here we show versatile non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies of the same monomer via alternate assembly pathways. The assemblies nucleate using non&#8208;classical or classical nucleation routes into distinct metastable (transient hydrogels), kinetic (stable hydrogels) and thermodynamic structures [(poly)&#8208;crystals and 2D sheets]. Initial chemical and thermal inputs force the monomers to follow different assembly pathways and form soft&#8208;materials with distinct molecular arrangements than at equilibrium. In many cases, equilibrium structures act as thermodynamic sink which consume monomers from metastable structures giving transiently formed materials. This dynamics can be tuned chemically or thermally to slow down the dissolution of transient hydrogel, or skip the intermediate hydrogel altogether to reach final equilibrium assemblies. If required this metastable state can be kinetically trapped to give strong hydrogel stable over days. This method to control different self&#8208;assembly states can find potential use in similar biomimetic systems to access new materials for various applications.

         <title>Function Switch of a Fungal Sesterterpene Synthase through Molecular Dynamics Simulation Assisted Alteration of an Aromatic Residue Cluster in the Active Pocket of PfNS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined strategy involving molecular dynamics simulations and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to manipulate the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of PfNS protein resulted in the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions, such as the conversion between bicyclic and tricyclic structures and the transition from Type&#8197;B to Type&#8197;A function, thus resulting in the production of new sesterterpenes.







Abstract
Terpene synthases (TPSs) play pivotal roles in generating diverse terpenoids through complex cyclization pathways. Protein engineering of TPSs offers a crucial approach to expanding terpene diversity. However, significant potential remains untapped due to limited understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationships of TPSs. In this investigation, using a joint approach of molecular dynamics simulations&#8208;assisted engineering and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we manipulated the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of a bifunctional terpene synthase (BFTPS), Pestalotiopsis fici nigtetraene synthase (PfNS). This led to the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions yielding different cyclization patterns of sesterterpenes. Specifically, a quadruple variant (F89A/Y113F/W193L/T194W) completely altered PfNS&#8242;s function, converting it from producing the bicyclic sesterterpene nigtetraene to the tricyclic ophiobolin F. Additionally, analysis of catalytic profiles by double, triple, and quadruple variants demonstrated that the ARC functions as a switch, unprecedently redirecting the production of 5/11 bicyclic (Type&#8197;B) sesterterpenes to 5/15 bicyclic (Type&#8197;A) ones. Molecular dynamics simulations and theozyme calculations further elucidated that, in addition to cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions also play a key role in the cyclization patterns. This study offers a feasible strategy in protein engineering of TPSs for various industrial applications.

MnBr&#8208;253 particles were synthesized as three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on MOF&#8208;253 and MnBr(CO)3(bpy) complexes, designed as off&#8208;grid colloidal systems aimed at decoupling light harvesting and high&#8208;energy electron storage. Achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion/storage quantum yield and charging rate, the framework was applied for temporally decoupled dark H2 evolution.







Abstract
Designing multifunctional materials that mimic the light&#8208;dark decoupling of natural photosynthesis is a key challenge in the field of energy conversion. Herein, we introduce MnBr&#8208;253, a precious metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) built on Al nodes, bipyridine linkers and MnBr(CO)3(bipyridine) complexes. Upon irradiation, MnBr&#8208;253 colloids demonstrate an electron photocharging capacity of ~42&#8197;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1MOF, with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocharging rate (1.28&#8197;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1MOF) and incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion efficiency of ~9.4&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm. Spectroscopic and computational studies support effective electron accumulation at the Mn complex while high porosity and Mn loading account for the notable electron storage performance. The charged MnBr&#8208;253 powders were successfully applied for hydrogen evolution under dark conditions thus emulating the light&#8208;decoupled reactivity of photosynthesis.

Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. RASER is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive NMR detectors. We show wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced from 75 up to 1,000,000 via parametric pumping via active&#8208;feedback technique for RASER applications at 300&#8197;MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional MR detector.







Abstract
It has recently been shown that a bolus of hyperpolarized nuclear spins can yield stimulated emission signals similar in nature to maser signals, potentially enabling new ways of sensing hyperpolarized contrast media, including most notably [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate that is under evaluation in over 50&#8197;clinical trials for metabolic imaging of cancer. The stimulated NMR signal emissions lasting for minutes do not require radio&#8208;frequency excitation, offering unprecedented advantages compared to conventional MR sensing. However, creating nuclear spin maser emission is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive MR detectors. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced 22&#8208;fold (to 1,670) via parametric pumping. This active&#8208;feedback technique breaks the intrinsic fundamental limit of NMR detector circuit quality factor. We show the use of parametric pumping to reduce the threshold requirement for inducing nuclear spin masing at 300&#8197;MHz resonance frequency in a preclinical MRI scanner. Indeed, stimulated emission from hyperpolarized protons was obtained under highly unfavorable conditions of low magnetic field homogeneity (T2* of 3&#8197;ms). Greater gains of the quality factor of the MR detector (up to 1&#8197;million) were also demonstrated.

         <title>Accelerating the Discovery of Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts: High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Element Combinations in Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an innovative method for accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in Pt&#8208;based quinary high&#8208;entropy alloys, utilizing large&#8208;scale language model, microscale printing, pulsed high&#8208;temperature synthesis, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy, and density functional theory calculations. This offers a new avenue for the discovery of multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.







Abstract
The vast number of element combinations and the explosive growth of composition space pose significant challenges to the development of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Here, we propose a procedural research method aimed at accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) based on Pt&#8208;based quinary HEAs. The method begins with an element library provided by a large language model (LLM), combined with microscale precursor printing and pulse high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques to prepare multi&#8208;element combination HEA array in one step. Through high&#8208;throughput measurement using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), precise identification of highly active HEA element combinations and exploration of composition space for a specific combination are achieved. Advantageous element combinations are further validated in practical electrocatalytic evaluations. The contributions of individual element sites and the synergistic effects among elements of such HEAs in enhancing reaction activity are elucidated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This method integrates high&#8208;throughput experiments, practical catalyst validation, and DFT calculations, providing a new pathway for accelerating the discovery of efficient multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.

         <title>Constructing Microporous Ion Exchange Membranes via Simple Hypercrosslinking for pH&#8208;Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An economically feasible strategy, simple hypercrosslinking, is proposed to construct ion exchange membranes with microporosity. The presented membranes balance well with high ion conductivity and high ion selectivity and show superiority in process simplicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and anti&#8208;swelling, thus enabling high&#8208;efficiency and stable cycling of pH&#8208;neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries.







Abstract
Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) play a critical role in aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). Traditional IEMs that feature microphase&#8208;separated microstructures are well&#8208;developed and easily available but suffer from the conductivity/selectivity tradeoff. The emerging charged microporous polymer membranes show the potential to overcome this tradeoff, yet their commercialization is still hindered by tedious syntheses and demanding conditions. We herein combine the advantages of these two types of membrane materials via simple in situ hypercrosslinking of conventional IEMs into microporous ones. Such a concept is exemplified by the very cheap commercial quaternized polyphenylene oxide membrane. The hypercrosslinking treatment turns poor&#8208;performance membranes into high&#8208;performance ones, as demonstrated by the above 10&#8208;fold selectivity enhancement and much&#8208;improved conductivities that more than doubled. This turn is also confirmed by the effective and stable pH&#8208;neutral AORFB with decreased membrane resistance and at least an order of magnitude lower capacity loss rate. This battery shows advantages over other reported AORFBs in terms of a low capacity loss rate (0.0017&#8201;% per cycle) at high current density. This work provides an economically feasible method for designing AORFB&#8208;oriented membranes with microporosity.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Glutathione Assembly Supported on ZIF&#8208;8 as Robust and Efficient Catalyst for Mild CO2 Conversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu(I)&#8208;glutathione polymer supported on ZIF&#8208;8 is a robust catalyst for the efficient carboxylation of terminal alkynes and the cyclization of propargylamine with CO2 under atmospheric pressure and mild conditions with a wide range of substrates, converting them into high value&#8208;added chemicals, with strong positive synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst is reused at least 10&#8197;times without significant reduction in catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
The Cu&#8208;glutathione (GSH) redox system, essential in biology, is designed here as a supramacromolecular assembly in which the tetrahedral 18e Cu(I) center loses a thiol ligand upon adsorption onto ZIF&#8208;8, as shown by EXAFS and DFT calculation, to generate a very robust 16e planar trigonal single&#8208;atom Cu(I) catalyst. Synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8, revealed by catalytic experiments and DFT calculation, affords CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals with a wide scope of substrates by reaction with terminal alkynes or propargyl amines in excellent yields under mild conditions and reuse at least 10&#8197;times without significant decrease in catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Thioesters from Aryl Halides and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical method for synthesizing thioesters from readily available aryl halides and carboxylic acids is here disclosed. This thiol&#8208;free protocol hinges on the direct excitation of 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylthiourea and its multifaceted ability to act as the sulfur source, generate aryl radicals upon SET activation of halides, and trap them to in situ produce reactive isothiouronium ions.







Abstract
Thioesters are important in synthesis, materials science, and biology, and their preparation traditionally relies on the use of disagreeable thiols. Here, we report a thiol&#8208;free protocol that stitches together widespread carboxylic acids and aryl halides, producing a diverse array of thioesters. Crucial to this strategy is the discovery that tetramethylthiourea can serve as both a sulfur source and, upon direct excitation by purple light, as a strong reductant, suitable for activating aryl halides via single&#8208;electron transfer. Coupling of the resulting aryl radicals provides an isothiouronium ion intermediate, which can be attacked by carboxylic acids via a polar pathway, affording the thioester products under mild conditions.

         <title>Utilizing &#8220;Latent&#8221; Carbon: Repositioning Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Synthons and Assemblies via Halogen Bonding to &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonding to &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon sites&#8212;unsubstituted carbon sites that are traditionally seen as dead&#8208;ends in hydrogen&#8208;bonded crystal engineering&#8212;has been used to direct the solid&#8208;state arrangement of discrete and extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded substructures based on acid&#8208;, amide&#8208;, and phenol&#8208;based homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;synthons, thereby generating higher&#8208;order molecular solids.







Abstract
Molecules bearing carboxylic acid, amide, and hydroxyl groups are ubiquitous in crystal engineering, where robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded synthons centred on these functionalities enable reliable crystal structure design. We now show that halogen bonding to the carbon &#960;&#8208;system of such molecules, traditionally ignored in crystal engineering, permits the recognition and directional assembly of the resulting hydrogen&#8208;bonded structural subunits, leaving the archetypal hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring, ladder, and chain homosynthons intact, but repositioned in space. When applied to heteromolecular synthons, this enables rearranging more complex hydrogen&#8208;bonded motifs and the evolution of binary cocrystals into ternary ones through &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon&#8208;based recognition sites, demonstrating a rational approach to build higher&#8208;order solid&#8208;state supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Wittig Reaction by Phosphorus PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the atroposelective Wittig reaction enabled by PIII/PV=O redox catalysis. An endogenous base release compatible with Lewis acid co&#8208;catalysis thereby generates the ylide intermediates. The mild, chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction allows the synthesis of a broad range of atropisomers with enantioselectivities of up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is renowned as exceptionally versatile method for converting a diversity of aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. Recently, strategies for chiral phosphine catalysis under PIII/PV=O redox cycling emerged to render this venerable transformation stereoselective. Herein, we describe that phosphine redox catalysis enables the enantioselective synthesis of pertinent biaryl atropisomers by means of a stereocontrolled arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction. Key to the process is the release of an endogenous base from readily accessible tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonylated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts triggered by catalyst intramolecularization, permitting mild phosphine redox catalysis for atroposelective Wittig reactions. By this strategy, a broad diversity of biaryl atropisomers is obtained with up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 enantioselectivity.

         <title>exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;Substituted Pentabenzocorannulene: Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene, a new buckybowl bearing an internal sp3 carbon atom in the backbone, unexpectedly exhibits wide absorption and emission bands. The methyl group is exclusively located at the convex surface, bolstering the bowl geometry. All molecules form unidirectional bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking to generate polar crystals.







Abstract
exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene (exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me) was synthesized by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,2,3&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene. Its bowl&#8208;shaped geometry with an sp3 carbon atom in the backbone and a methyl group located at the convex (exo) face was verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. According to DFT calculations, the observed conformer is energetically more favorable than the endo one by 39.9&#8197;kcal/mol. Compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped analogs with intact &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones (see the main text), exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me displayed a deeper bowl depth (avg. 1.93&#8197;&#197;), redshifted and broader absorption (250&#8211;620&#8197;nm) and emission (from 585 to more than 850&#8197;nm) bands and a smaller optical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (2.01&#8197;eV). exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me formed polar crystals where all bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking with close &#960;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; contacts is arranged unidirectionally, providing the potential for applications as organic semiconductors and pyroelectric materials. This unusual structural feature, molecular packing, and properties are most likely associated with the assistance of the methyl group and the sp3 carbon atom in the backbone.

         <title>Synthesis of Secondary Boronates via Deaminative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Nitroso Carbamates and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the coupling of N&#8208;nitroso carbamates with organo boronic acids is presented. The method allows for the formal deaminative coupling of widely available amines. In particular, the coupling of lysine is presented, which allows for the synthesis of non&#8208;canonical amino acids.







Abstract
A strategy for transition metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl nitroso&#8208;carbamates and boronic acids is reported. The N&#8208;nitroso carbamates are easily prepared from the corresponding amine in two simple steps. This method allows for the synthesis of a wide variety of secondary boronates, benzylic boronates and formal Csp3&#8722;Csp2 cross&#8208;coupling products under operationally simple conditions. Functional group tolerance is also demonstrated and applied in the modification of lysine to make non&#8208;canonical amino acids.

In this communication, we report two novel intrinsically liquid crystalline metal halide perovskite&#8208;like materials by utilizing fluorinated ionic liquid crystalline (FILC) mesogens based on polyfluorinated alkylimidazolium cations. Manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions were found to be essential for the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of the perovskite&#8208;like structures.

Abstract
Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskites (HOIHPs) represent an emerging class of semiconducting materials, widely employed in a variety of optoelectronic applications. Despite their skyrocket growth in the last decade, a detailed understanding on their structure&#8211;property relationships is still missing. In this communication, we report two unprecedented perovskite&#8208;like materials based on polyfluorinated imidazolium cations. The two materials show thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior resulting in the emergence of stable mesophases. The manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions are shown to be meaningful for the stabilization of both the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of these perovskite&#8208;like materials. Moreover, the structure of the incorporated imidazolium cation was found to tune the properties of the liquid crystalline phase. Collectively, these results may pave the way for the design of a new class of halide perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Halide Perovskites (HOIHPs) represent an emerging class of semiconducting materials, widely employed in a variety of optoelectronic applications. Despite their skyrocket growth in the last decade, a detailed understanding on their structure&#8211;property relationships is still missing. In this communication, we report two unprecedented perovskite-like materials based on polyfluorinated imidazolium cations. The two materials show thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior resulting in the emergence of stable mesophases. The manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions are shown to be meaningful for the stabilization of both the solid- and liquid-crystalline orders of these perovskite-like materials. Moreover, the structure of the incorporated imidazolium cation was found to tune the properties of the liquid crystalline phase. Collectively, these results may pave the way for the design of a new class of halide perovskite-based soft materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adaptive Helical Chirality in Supramolecular Microcrystals for Circularly Polarized Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral supramolecular interaction strategy is proposed to synthesize organic microcrystals with adaptive helical chirality for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission.







Abstract
Chiral organic molecules offer a promising platform for exploring circularly polarized lasing, which, however, faces a great challenge that the spatial separation of molecular chiral and luminescent centers limits chiroptical activity. Here we develop a helically chiral supramolecular system with completely overlapped chiral and luminescent units for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing. Adaptive helical chirality is obtained by incorporating chiral agents into organic microcrystals. Benefiting from the efficient coupling of stimulated emission with the adaptive helical chirality, the supramolecular microcrystals enable high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission with dissymmetry factors up to ~0.7. This work opens up the way to rational design of chiral organic materials for circularly polarized lasing.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Approach to Promoting Photocatalysis Based on Consecutive Photo&#8208;Induced Electron&#8208;Transfer Processes via Efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the host&#8211;guest approach to promoting photoactivation of aryl halides based on the conPET process via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from host to encapsulated rhodamine 6G (Rh&#8208;6G). Highly efficient FRET makes the supramolecular system an efficient catalyst for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides under mild conditions within a short time (1&#8211;4&#8197;h), even in an air atmosphere.







Abstract
Supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with highly efficient host&#8211;guest energy transfer pathway provides an ideal platform for optimizing the photochemistry process. The consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) process overcomes the energy limitation of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, but is often compromised by mismatching between the absorption of ground state dye and its radical, weakening the efficiency of photoredox reaction. By encapsulating a conPET photocatalyst rhodamine 6G into metal&#8208;organic cage, the supramolecular approach was undertaken to tackle the intrinsic difficulty of matching the light absorption of photoexcitation between rhodamine 6G and its radical. The highly efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the photoexcited cage to rhodamine 6G forced by host&#8211;guest encapsulation facilitates the conPET process for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides by stabilizing and accelerating the production and accumulation of the rhodamine 6G radical intermediate. The tunable and flexible nature of the supramolecular host&#8211;guest complex renders the cage&#8208;based encapsulation strategy promising for the development of ideal photocatalysts toward the better utilization of solar energy.

         <title>Enhancement of Low Temperature Superionic Conductivity by Suppression of Li Site Ordering in Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isovalent substitution of Ge4+ for Si4+ in Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I is observed for x&#8804;1.2. Control of unit cell volume via this substitution enhances Li+ site disorder beyond Li7Si2S7I. This extensive disorder is stabilised to 30&#8197;K with very low activation energies observed by 7Li NMR, yielding low temperature Li+ transport in highly substituted (x=1 &amp; 1.2) materials that is comparable to best&#8208;in&#8208;class solid&#8208;state electrolytes.







Abstract
Ge4+ substitution into the recently discovered superionic conductor Li7Si2S7I is demonstrated by synthesis of Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I, where x&#8804;1.2. The anion packing and tetrahedral silicon location of Li7Si2S7I are retained upon substitution. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that substitution of larger Ge4+ for Si4+ expands the unit cell volume and further increases Li+ site disorder, such that Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I has one Li+ site more (sixteen in total) than Li7Si2S7I. The ionic conductivity of Li7Si0.8Ge1.2S7I (x=1.2) at 303&#8197;K is 1.02(3)&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with low activation energies for Li+ transport demonstrated over a wide temperature range by AC impedance and 7Li NMR spectroscopy. All sixteen Li+ sites remain occupied to temperatures as low as 30&#8197;K in Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I as a result of the structural expansion. This differs from Li7Si2S7I, where the partial Li+ site ordering observed below room temperature reduces the ionic conductivity. The suppression of Li+ site depopulation by Ge4+ substitution retains the high mobility to temperatures as low as 200&#8197;K, yielding low temperature performance comparable with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li+ ion conducting materials.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of C&#8722;N Axially Chiral Aminophosphines via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral P,N ligands were synthesized through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ATH of in situ generated iminophosphines. The transient interaction between iminium and phosphine groups as a Lewis acid&#8208;base pair causes the labilization of the stereogenic axis, enabling the scenario for a DKR. The reaction proceeds with good to high yields and reaching up to 99&#8201;% ee across a range of substrates, including both dicyclohexyl&#8208; and diphenylphosphino derivatives.







Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination via asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) has been used to perform an efficient dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of N&#8208;aryl 2&#8208;formyl pyrroles decorated with a phosphine moiety positioned at the ortho&#8217; position. The strategy relies on the labilization of the stereogenic axis in the substrate facilitated by a transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction (LABI) between the carbonyl carbon and the phosphorus center. The reaction features broad substrate scope of aliphatic amines and N&#8208;aryl pyrrole scaffolds, and proceeds under very mild conditions to afford P,N atropisomers in good to high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) for both diphenyl and dicyclohexylphosphino derivatives.

The reaction features broad substrate scope of aliphatic amines and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl pyrrole scaffolds, and proceeds under very mild conditions to afford &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; atropisomers in good to high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) for both diphenyl and dicyclohexylphosphino derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Sulfilimines Enabled by Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8211;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl diazonium salt to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters was developed. This strategy offers a general, modular and divergent platform for rapid synthesis of chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise difficult to access.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups have garnered considerable attention due to their common occurrence in ligands, pharmaceuticals, and insecticides. Nevertheless, enantioselective synthesis of sulfilimines, particularly diaryl sulfilimines remains a challenging and persistent goal. Herein we report a highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8211;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl diazonium salt to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters by Pd catalysis. Bisphosphine ligands bearing sulfinamide groups play a crucial role in achieving high reactivity and selectivity. This approach provides a general, modular and divergent framework for quickly synthesizing chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise challenging to access. In addition, the origins of the high chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity were extensively investigated using density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen in Photocatalytic Gas&#8211;Solid Reactions: Participator vs. Dominator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a dual&#8208;pathway reaction mechanism of lattice oxygen (OL) participation and molecular oxygen oxidation, Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst exhibits efficient complete oxidation of ppm&#8208;level methane and OL plays a dominant role in this reaction. Single&#8208;atom Ru accelerates the O2 activation to &#8901;O2&#8722; and the regeneration of consumed OL during reaction.







Abstract
Lattice&#8208;oxygen activation has emerged as a popular strategy for optimizing the performance and selectivity of oxide&#8208;based thermocatalysis and electrolysis. However, the significance of lattice oxygen in oxide photocatalysts has been ignored, particularly in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Here, using methane oxidation over a Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst as the prototypical reaction and via 18O isotope labelling techniques, we found that lattice oxygen can directly participate in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Lattice oxygen played a dominant role in the photocatalytic reaction, as determined by estimating the kinetic constants in the initial stage. Furthermore, we discovered that dynamic diffusion between O2 and lattice oxygen proceeded even in the absence of targeted reactants. Finally, single&#8208;atom Ru can facilitate the activation of adsorbed O2 and the subsequent regeneration of consumed lattice oxygen, thus ensuring high catalyst activity and stability. The results provide guidance for next&#8208;generation oxide photocatalysts with improved activities and selectivities.

         <title>Nanoscale Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Reprograms Cellular Metabolism to Enhance Photodynamic Therapy and Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitizing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer was anchored with the metabolic reprogramming agent 3&#8208;bromopyruvate to enhance photodynamic therapy and antitumor immunity by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to oxygenate tumors and reduce lactate production. This metabolic reprogramming enhanced reactive oxygen species generation and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME to elicit antitumor immunity, reject tumor re&#8208;challenge, and prevent lung metastasis.







Abstract
Abnormal cancer metabolism causes hypoxic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which limits the antitumor efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, we report a photosensitizing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) with anchored 3&#8208;bromopyruvate (BrP), BrP@MOL, as a metabolic reprogramming agent to enhance PDT and antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL inhibited mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to oxygenate tumors and reduce lactate production. This metabolic reprogramming enhanced reactive oxygen species generation during PDT and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME to enhance antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL&#8208;mediated PDT inhibited tumor growth by &gt;90&#8201;% with 40&#8201;% of mice being tumor&#8208;free, rejected tumor re&#8208;challenge, and prevented lung metastasis. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade potently regressed the tumors with &gt;98&#8201;% tumor inhibition and 80&#8201;% of mice being tumor&#8208;free.

         <title>Depolymerization of Native Lignin over Thiol Capped Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Microbelts Mediated by Photogenerated Thiyl Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depolymerization of native lignin for the production of functionalized aromatics was realized over irradiated colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 microbelts. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible colloidization&#8208;aggregation for both efficient reaction and facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for the generation of RS&#8901; for selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin.







Abstract
The valorization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic compounds under visible light is appealing yet challenging. In this communication, colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) microbelts was successfully fabricated, which was used as a superior catalyst for depolymerization of native lignin in birch woodmeal under visible light, with an optimum yield of 28.8&#8197;wt&#8201;% to functionalized aromatic monomers achieved in 8&#8197;h. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible interchange of ZIS between the colloidal state for efficient reaction and the aggregated state for facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for light initiated generation of reactive thiyl radical for highly selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bond in native lignin. This work provides a green and efficient strategy for the depolymerization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic monomers under mild conditions, which involves a new mechanism for the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin. The capability of cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin by photogenerated thiyl radicals also demonstrates the great potential of using photogenerated thiyl radicals in organics transformations.

         <title>Structural Modulation of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have adeptly optimized the ORR process through strategic engineering of COFs, effectively transitioning the reaction from a four&#8208;electron pathway to a two&#8208;electron pathway. Significantly, when implemented within a flow cell apparatus, the COF augmented with ionic salt (JUC&#8208;660) demonstrated consistent productivity, maintaining a H2O2 yield rate in excess of 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an extended operational period more than 85&#8197;hours.

The electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using metal&#8208;free catalysts has emerged as a viable and sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, the precise architectural design of these electrocatalysts poses a significant challenge, requiring intricate structural engineering to optimize electron transfer during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we introduce a novel design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that effectively shift the ORR from a four&#8208;electron to a more advantageous two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, the JUC&#8208;660 COF, with strategically charge&#8208;modified benzyl moieties, achieved a continuous high H2O2 yield of over 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an impressive duration of over 85&#8197;hours in a flow cell setting, marking it as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed H2O2 electrocatalysts reported to date. Theoretical computations alongside in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that JUC&#8208;660 markedly diminishes the adsorption of the OOH* intermediate, thereby steering the ORR towards the desired pathway. Furthermore, the versatility of JUC&#8208;660 was demonstrated through its application in the electro&#8208;Fenton reaction, where it efficiently and rapidly removed aqueous contaminants. This work delineates a pioneering approach to altering the ORR pathway, ultimately paving the way for the development of highly effective metal&#8208;free H2O2 electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;We have adeptly optimized the ORR process through strategic engineering of COFs, effectively transitioning the reaction from a four-electron pathway to a two-electron pathway. Significantly, when implemented within a flow cell apparatus, the COF augmented with ionic salt (JUC-660) demonstrated consistent productivity, maintaining a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate in excess of 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for an extended operational period more than 85&#8197;hours. This performance solidifies its status as one of the most efficient metal-free and non-pyrolyzed catalysts reported to date.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis of Vinyl Copolymer Carrying Boron Directly Connected to Backbone: Catalytic Esterification through Cooperation of Boron with Neighboring Carboxylic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester and maleic anhydride was found to work as a catalyst for direct esterification of alcohol and carboxylic acid. The key to the unprecedented catalytic activity was the activation of carboxylic anhydride by adjacent boron, and the catalytic function through the cooperation of side chains would collect attention as the simple mimic of enzyme.







Abstract
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester (VBpin) and maleic anhydride (MAH) was found to catalyze direct dehydrative esterification of carboxylic acid and alcohol. The key to the catalytic function is the activation of the MAH unit by the neighboring Lewis acidic boron directly connected to the backbone through the formation of five&#8208;membered ring. The effects of the side&#8208;chain cooperation were clarified through comparisons with the polymers having similar structures and a conventional titanium catalyst as well as the analyses of reactions with carboxylic acid or alcohol. The catalytic activity was enhanced as the molecular weight was higher, which is owing to the structural feature that boron is directly attached to the backbone. The cooperative catalysis is of interest because of its conceptual similarity with enzyme.

         <title>Chirality Interplay between the Interior and Exterior of Metal&#8211;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple stereogenic elements have been embedded into M2L4 metal&#8211;organic cages to control the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages, i.e. within and beyond the first coordination sphere.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8211;organic cages featuring two stereogenic elements, in terms of the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges, were exploited. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages. The chirality information induced by a chiral guest inside the cage cavity can pass through the cage framework and influence the orientation of the diazaanthracene segments on the periphery of the cage. In turn, the chirality of a stereogenic center within the diazaanthracene segments can transfer back into the cavity, enabling discrimination of enantiomeric guests.

         <title>Bilateral Unsymmetrical Disulfurating Reagent Design for Polysulfide Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stable and odorless bilateral disulfurating reagents with two divergent mask groups has been established. Diverse arylboronic acids and carbon/nitrogen/sulfur nucleophiles can be sequentially assembled on both sides of a S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Polysulfides are significant compounds in life science, pharmaceutical science, and materials science. Therefore, polysulfide construction is in great demand. The controllable sequential installation of groups on both ends of a S&#8722;S motif faces an enormous challenge owing to the reversible nature of the covalent S&#8722;S bond. A library was established with two divergent mask groups for bilateral unsymmetrical disulfurating reagents (R1O&#8722;SS&#8722;SO2R2). Sequential coupling with preferential activation of the S&#8722;SO2 bond (37.6&#8197;kcal/mol) and controllable activation of the S&#8722;O bond (54.8&#8197;kcal/mol) in the presence of the S&#8722;S bond (62.0&#8197;kcal/mol) enabled successive reactions at each end of the S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides and trisulfides, even for the cross&#8208;linkage of natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides, and a protein (bovine serum albumin).
