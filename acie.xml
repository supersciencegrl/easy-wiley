         <title>Threefold Collaborative Stabilization of Ag14&#8208;Nanorods by Hydrophobic Ti16&#8208;Oxo Clusters and Alkynes: Designable Assembly and Solid&#8208;State Optical&#8208;Limiting Application</title>

An Ag cluster is protected by a combination of hydrophobic organic fluorinated ligands, an inorganic Ti&#8208;O shell, and terminal alkyne caps, which results in a novel Ag14&#8208;nanorod@Ti16&#8208;oxo&#8208;nanoring core&#8211;shell nanocluster. This well protected cluster exhibits superhydrophobicity, excellent ambient stability, and unprecedented solid&#8208;state optical limiting characteristic.







Abstract
Ag nanoclusters have received increasing attention due to their atomically precise and diverse structures and intriguing optical properties. Nevertheless, the inherent instability of Ag nanoclusters has seriously hindered their practical application. In this work, for the first time, Ag clusters are collaboratively protected by hydrophobic Ti&#8208;oxo clusters and alkyne ligands. Initially, a pyramidal Ag5 cluster terminated with tBuC&#8801;C&#8722; and CH3CN was inserted into the cavity of a Ti8&#8208;oxo nanoring to form Ag5@Ti8. To overcome the instability of acetonitrile&#8208;terminated silver site, such two Ag5@Ti8 clusters could sandwich an Ag4 unit to form Ag14&#8208;nanorod@Ti16&#8208;oxo&#8208;nanoring (Ag14@Ti16), which is peripherally protected by fluorophenyl groups and alkyne caps. This threefold protected (hydrophobic fluorinated organic layer, Ti&#8208;O shell, and terminal alkyne ligands) Ag14@Ti16 exhibits superhydrophobicity and excellent ambient stability, endowing it with solid&#8208;state optical limiting characteristics.

         <title>Chemiluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency and Donor&#8211;Acceptor Distance: from Qualitative to Quantitative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13029-13034, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than 50&#8197;years after the birth of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET), the first experimental evidence of the quantitative relationship between CRET efficiency and donor&#8211;acceptor distance was achieved using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active micelles.







Abstract
Since its birth in 1967, the utilization of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) has made substantial progress in a variety of fields for its unique features. However, the quantitative relationship between CRET efficiency and donor&#8211;acceptor distance has not yet been determined owing to the difficulty in designing the variable lengths between chemiluminescent donors and acceptors. Herein, we synthesized three kinds of tetraphenylethene (TPE)&#8208;anchored cationic surfactants with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. For the first time, it is quantitatively demonstrated that the CRET efficiency is inversely proportional to the sixth power of distance between luminol donors and TPE acceptors. The details disclosed in this contribute have provided the solid evidence that CRET follows F&#246;rster resonance theory. Our strategy would build a promising platform to control donor&#8211;acceptor distance, allowing to the interdisciplinary applications of CRET.

         <title>The Boundary of Lithium Plating in Graphite Electrode for Safe Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13007-13012, June 1, 2021. </description>

The boundary of Li plating in a graphite electrode for safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries is defined. The cell with regulated Li plating exhibits highly reversible Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.5&#8201;% with superior safety performance, offering a strategy to achieve safe high&#8208;energy fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Uncontrolled Li plating in graphite electrodes endangers battery life and safety, driving tremendous efforts aiming to eliminate Li plating. Herein we systematically investigate the boundary of Li plating in graphite electrode for safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The cell exhibits superior safety performance than that with Li dendrites by defining the endurable amount of uniform Li plating in graphite anode. The presence of &#8220;dead Li&#8221; can be eliminated owing to the uniform distribution of Li plating, and the average Coulombic efficiency for deposited Li during reversible plating/stripping process is decoupled as high as about 99.5&#8201;%. Attributing to the limited Li plating with superior Coulombic efficiency, the LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite cell achieves a high capacity retention of 80.2&#8201;% over 500&#8197;cycles. This work sheds a different light on further improving the fast&#8208;charging capability, low&#8208;temperature performance, and energy density of practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Enhanced Surface Ligands Reactivity of Metal Clusters by Bulky Ligands for Controlling Optical and Chiral Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12897-12903, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky surface ligands greatly enhance the surface ligands reactivity of metal clusters, allowing easy modulation of their optical properties by reversible surface ligation. When chiral amines are introduced into the solution of racemic clusters, they are readily converted in full to optically pure homochiral clusters.







Abstract
Surface ligands play critical roles in determining the surface properties of metal clusters. However, modulating the properties and controlling the surface structure of clusters through surface&#8208;capping&#8208;agent displacement is challenging. Herein, [Ag14(SPh(CF3)2)12(PPh3)4(DMF)4] (Ag14&#8208;DMF; DMF=N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide), with weakly coordinated DMF ligands on surface silver sites, was synthesized by a mixed&#8208;ligands strategy. Owing to the high surface reactivity of Ag14&#8208;DMF, the surface ligands are labile, easily dissociated or exchanged by other ligands. Based on the enhanced surface reactivity, easy modulation of the optical properties of Ag14 by reversible &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; DMF ligation was realized. When chiral amines were introduced to as&#8208;prepared products, all eight surface ligands were replaced by amines and the racemic Ag14 clusters were converted to optically pure homochiral Ag14 clusters as evidenced by circular dichroism (CD) activity and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). This work provides a new insight into modulation of the optical properties of metal clusters and atomically precise homochiral clusters for specific applications are obtained.

Porous ionic liquids based on the ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8211;organic framework and on phosphonium acetate or levulinate salts were prepared. These show an increased capacity to absorb carbon dioxide at low pressures. Porous suspensions based on phosphonium levulinate ionic liquid absorb reversibly 103&#8201;% more carbon dioxide per mass than pure ZIF&#8208;8 at 1&#8197;bar and 303&#8197;K.







Abstract
Porous ionic liquids are non&#8208;volatile, versatile materials that associate porosity and fluidity. New porous ionic liquids, based on the ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8211;organic framework and on phosphonium acetate or levulinate salts, were prepared and show an increased capacity to absorb carbon dioxide at low pressures. Porous suspensions based on phosphonium levulinate ionic liquid absorb reversibly 103&#8201;% more carbon dioxide per mass than pure ZIF&#8208;8 at 1&#8197;bar and 303&#8197;K. We show how the rational combination of MOFs with ionic liquids can greatly enhance low pressure CO2 absorption, paving the way towards a new generation of high&#8208;performance, readily available liquid materials for effective low pressure carbon capture.

         <title>In Vivo Subcellular Mass Spectrometry Enables Proteo&#8208;Metabolomic Single&#8208;Cell Systems Biology in a Chordate Embryo Developing to a Normally Behaving Tadpole (X. laevis)**
</title>

Single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry was advanced to enable dual characterization of proteins and metabolites in identified cells in Xenopus laevis embryos. The analyzed embryos developed to normally behaving tadpoles with anatomy and visual function indistinguishable from that of their control siblings in a background color preference assay. In vivo single&#8208;cell mass spectrometry expands the analytical toolbox of molecular systems, cell, and developmental biology.







Abstract
We report the development of in vivo subcellular high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for proteo&#8208;metabolomic molecular systems biology in complex tissues. With light microscopy, we identified the left&#8208;dorsal and left&#8208;ventral animal cells in cleavage&#8208;stage non&#8208;sentient Xenopus laevis embryos. Using precision&#8208;translated fabricated microcapillaries, the subcellular content of each cell was double&#8208;probed, each time swiftly (&lt;5&#8197;s/event) aspirating &lt;5&#8201;% of cell volume (&#8776;10&#8197;nL). The proteins and metabolites were analyzed by home&#8208;built ultrasensitive capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization employing orbitrap or time&#8208;of&#8208;flight HRMS. Label&#8208;free detection of &#8776;150 metabolites (57 identified) and 738 proteins found proteo&#8208;metabolomic networks with differential quantitative activities between the cell types. With spatially and temporally scalable sampling, the technology preserved the integrity of the analyzed cells, the neighboring cells, and the embryo. 95&#8201;% of the analyzed embryos developed into sentient tadpoles that were indistinguishable from their wild&#8208;type siblings based on anatomy and visual function in a background color preference assay.

         <title>Defect Engineering in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Towards Advanced Mixed Matrix Membranes for Efficient Propylene/Propane Separation</title>

We first demonstrate the deliberate introduction of defects in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be an additional degree of freedom towards highly permselective MOF/polymer mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs). The developed MMM materials based on our concept exhibit promising potential for industrial propylene/propane separation processes as well as universal applicability in other fields.







Abstract
Highly permselective and durable membrane materials have been sought for energy&#8208;efficient C3H6/C3H8 separation. Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) comprising a polymer matrix and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for this application; however, rational matching of filler&#8208;matrix is challenging and their separation performances need to be further improved. Here, we propose a novel strategy of &#8220;defect engineering&#8221; in MOFs as an additional degree of freedom to design advanced MMMs. MMMs incorporated with defect&#8208;engineered MOFs exhibit exceptionally high C3H6 permeability and maintained C3H6/C3H8 selectivity, especially with enhanced stability under industrial mixed&#8208;gas conditions. The gas transport, sorption, and material characterizations reveal that the defect sites in MOFs provide the resulting MMMs with not only ultrafast diffusion pathways but also favorable C3H6 sorption by forming complexation with unsaturated open metal sites, confirmed by in situ FT&#8208;IR studies. Most importantly, the concept is also valid for different polymer matrices and gas pairs, demonstrating its versatile potential in other fields.

Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) can produce lyotropic phases of block copolymer nano&#8208;objects. Time&#8208;resolved SAXS studies confirm that reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate in n&#8208;dodecane initially produces spheres exhibiting long&#8208;range order that subsequently evolve to form hexagonally packed worms. Serial dilution leads to disordered worms.







Abstract
We report that polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) can be used to prepare lyotropic phases comprising diblock copolymer nano&#8208;objects in non&#8208;polar media. RAFT dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate (BzMA) at 90&#8201;&#176;C using a trithiocarbonate&#8208;capped hydrogenated polybutadiene (PhBD) steric stabilizer block in n&#8208;dodecane produces either spheres or worms that exhibit long&#8208;range order at 40&#8201;% w/w solids. NMR studies enable calculation of instantaneous copolymer compositions for each phase during the BzMA polymerization. As the PBzMA chains grow longer when targeting PhBD80&#8211;PBzMA40, time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals intermediate body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) and hexagonally close&#8208;packed (HCP) sphere phases prior to formation of a final hexagonal cylinder phase (HEX). The HEX phase is lost on serial dilution and the aligned cylinders eventually form disordered flexible worms. The HEX phase undergoes an order&#8211;disorder transition on heating to 150&#8201;&#176;C and a pure HCP phase forms on cooling to 20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Reorganization of Self&#8208;Assembled DNA&#8208;Based Polymers using Orthogonally Addressable Building Blocks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12911-12917, June 1, 2021. </description>

We report the rational design of orthogonal DNA&#8208;based addressable tiles that can re&#8208;organize in a dynamic and reversible way to display well&#8208;defined distributions: homopolymers made of a single tile, random polymers in which different tiles are distributed randomly and block structures in which the tiles are organized in segments.







Abstract
Nature uses non&#8208;covalent interactions to achieve structural dynamic reconfiguration of biopolymers. Taking advantage of the programmability of DNA/DNA interactions we report here the rational design of orthogonal DNA&#8208;based addressable tiles that self&#8208;assemble into polymer&#8208;like structures that can be reconfigured by external inputs.

     alt="Reorganization of Self-Assembled DNA-Based Polymers using Orthogonally Addressable Building Blocks**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the rational design of orthogonal DNA-based addressable tiles that can re-organize in a dynamic and reversible way to display well-defined distributions: homopolymers made of a single tile, random polymers in which different tiles are distributed randomly and block structures in which the tiles are organized in segments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature uses non-covalent interactions to achieve structural dynamic reconfiguration of biopolymers. Taking advantage of the programmability of DNA/DNA interactions we report here the rational design of orthogonal DNA-based addressable tiles that self-assemble into polymer-like structures that can be reconfigured by external inputs. The different tiles share the same sticky ends responsible for self-assembly but are rationally designed to contain a specific regulator-binding domain that can be orthogonally targeted by different DNA regulator strands. We show that by sequentially adding specific inputs it is possible to re-organize the formed structures to display well-defined distributions: homopolymers, random and block structures. The versatility of the systems presented in this study shows the ease with which DNA-based addressable monomers can be designed to create reconfigurable micron-scale DNA structures offering a new approach to the growing field of supramolecular polymers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Towards the Highly Efficient Synthesis and Selective Methylation of C(sp3)&#8208;Bridged [6]Cycloparaphenylenes from Fluoren[3]arenes</title>

Starting from fluoren[3]arenes, a new kind of easily available macrocyclic arenes, a powerful approach to the highly efficient synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylenes (C[6]CPPs) with aesthetic conjugated belt structures was developed. Moreover, the bridged methylene of C[6]CPPs could be selectively methylated to produce their fully outer&#8208;methyl&#8208;substituted derivatives in &#8805;96&#8201;% yields.







Abstract
An approach to the highly efficient synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylenes (C[6]CPPs) from fluoren[3]arenes (F[3]As) was developed. Consequently, F[3]As as a new kind of macrocyclic arenes were synthesized. Followed by the demethylation, triflation and intramolecular aryl&#8211;aryl coupling reactions, C[6]CPPs were then conveniently obtained. Interestingly, C[6]CPPs could be selectively methylated to produce their fully outer&#8208;methyl&#8208;substituted derivatives. The crystal structures showed the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted F[3]As had bowl&#8208;shaped conformations, and the C[6]CPPs exhibited rigid belt&#8208;shaped structures with deep cavities. Moreover, C[6]CPPs exhibited high HOMO energies and narrow energy gaps. An unclosed belt was further obtained, and it not only showed a similar narrow energy gap to those of the aromatic belts, but also displayed strong fluorescence property, which can play a vital role in the design and synthesis of new aromatic belts.

         <title>Designing Polymer&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolyte and Fully Infiltrated 3D Electrode for Integrated Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>

A PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;based polymer&#8208;in&#8208;salt solid electrolyte (PISSE) with high ionic conductivity at room temperature and a solid&#8208;state lithium battery (SSLB) with 3D fully infiltration of PISSE is developed. The integrated device achieves maximized interfacial contact and electrochemical and mechanical stability, presenting high performance close to that with liquid electrolyte.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs) are promising owing to enhanced safety and high energy density but plagued by the relatively low ionic conductivity of solid&#8208;state electrolytes and large electrolyte&#8211;electrode interfacial resistance. Herein, we design a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;in&#8208;salt solid electrolyte (PISSE) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity (1.24&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and construct a model integrated TiO2/Li SSLB with 3D fully infiltration of solid electrolyte. With forming aggregated ion clusters, unique ionic channels are generated in the PISSE, providing much faster Li+ transport than common polymer electrolytes. The integrated device achieves maximized interfacial contact and electrochemical and mechanical stability, with performance close to liquid electrolyte. A pouch cell made of 2 SSLB units in series shows high voltage plateau (3.7&#8197;V) and volumetric energy density comparable to many commercial thin&#8208;film batteries.

Here, we synthesized 4&#177;0.5&#8197;nm copper (I) sulfide (Cu2S) nanoparticles (NPs) with 46 mdeg chiroptical property at 530&#8197;nm to selectively cleave HBV core antigen (HBcAg) and effectively block HBV assembly and prevent HBV infection both in vitro and in vivo under light at 808&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Hepatitis&#8197;B virus (HBV) poses a severe threat to public health and social development. Here, we synthesized 4&#177;0.5&#8197;nm copper (I) sulfide (Cu2S) nanoparticles (NPs) with 46 mdeg chiroptical property at 530&#8197;nm to selectively cleavage HBV core antigen (HBcAg) and effectively blocked HBV assembly and prevented HBV infection both in vitro and in vivo under light at 808&#8197;nm. Experimental analysis showed that the chiral Cu2S NPs specific bound with the functional domain from phenylalanine23 (F23) to leucine30 (L30) from HBcAg primary sequence and the cutting site was between amino acid residues F24 and proline25 (P25). Under excitation at 808&#8197;nm, the intracellular HBcAg concentration was reduced by 95&#8201;%, and in HBV transgenic mice, the levels of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA were decreased by 93&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%, respectively. Together, these results reveal the potential nanomedicine for HBV control and provide fresh tools for viral infection.

         <title>Deconstructive Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Morphine&#8208;Family Alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;Thebainone&#8197;A</title>

         <dc:description>
A deconstructive strategy involving the cleavage of relatively inert C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds to build more complex scaffolds enabled the total synthesis of morphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A in 13 (and 14) steps from commercially available starting materials (see scheme). The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carboacylation reaction was applied successfully to the construction of various polycyclic skeletons.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the development of a deconstructive strategy for the first asymmetric synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A, capitalizing on an enantioselective C&#8722;C bond activation and a C&#8722;O bond cleavage reaction. The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#8220;cut&#8208;and&#8208;sew&#8221; transformation between sterically hindered trisubstituted alkenes and benzocyclobutenones allowed efficient construction of the fused A/B/C rings and the quaternary center of the natural product. The newly optimized conditions show broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99.5:0.5 er). Taking advantage of boron&#8208;mediated ether bond cleavage, we completed the synthesis of the morphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A by two complementary routes.

A low&#8208;strain potassium&#8208;rich K1.84Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.88&#8901;0.49&#8201;H2O (KNiHCF) was prepared by a facile co&#8208;precipitation method. The KNiHCF//graphite full cell exhibits high rate performance, superior cycling stability, and high power density. This work would offer an insight into design of the low&#8208;strain cathode materials for PIBs.







Abstract
Most of the cathode materials for potassium ion batteries (PIBs) suffer from poor structural stability due to the large ionic radius of K+, resulting in poor cycling stability. Here we report a low&#8208;strain potassium&#8208;rich K1.84Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.88&#8901;0.49&#8201;H2O (KNiHCF) as a cathode material for PIBs. The as&#8208;prepared KNiHCF cathode can deliver reversible discharge capacity of 62.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a high discharge voltage of 3.82&#8197;V. It can also achieve a superior rate performance of 45.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a capacity retention of 88.6&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles. The superior performance of KNiHCF cathode results from low&#8208;strain de&#8208;/intercalation mechanism, intrinsic semiconductor property and low potassium diffusion energy barrier. The high power density and long&#8208;term stability of KNiHCF//graphite full cell confirmed the feasibility of K&#8208;rich KNiHCF cathode in PIBs. This work provides guidance to develop Prussian blue analogues as cathode materials for PIBs.

         <title>In Vivo X&#8208;ray Triggered Catalysis of H2 Generation for Cancer Synergistic Gas Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12868-12875, June 1, 2021. </description>

A sustainable in situ H2 production platform, Au NRs&#8208;TiO2@ZnS:Cu,Co&#8208;A (Au&#8208;TiO2@ZnS) was developed for cancer synergistic H2&#8208;radiotherapy triggered by X&#8208;rays. The mechanism of hydrogen production under X&#8208;ray excitation is quite different from that under visible light because of the heterojunction structure of Au NRs&#8208;amorphous TiO2.







Abstract
To date, hydrogen (H2) therapy has received widespread attention. However, X&#8208;ray triggered sustainable H2&#8208;producing materials with controlled release for cancer treatment have not been reported. Herein, an X&#8208;ray triggered sustainable in situ H2 producing platform, Au NR&#8208;TiO2@ZnS:Cu,Co&#8208;A(Au&#8208;TiO2@ZnS), composed of Au&#8208;amorphous TiO2 nano&#8208;dumbbell&#8208;shaped heterostructure coated with long afterglow particles, was developed for cancer synergistic H2&#8208;radiotherapy. The mechanism of H2 production was verified by theoretical calculations and in vitro experiments. Changes in the apoptosis pathway caused by the synergistic effect of H2 and radiotherapy were reported. Guided by its excellent photoacoustic imaging capabilities, mice with orthotopic liver cancer achieved excellent therapeutic effects and low inflammatory side effects, suggesting that Au&#8208;TiO2@ZnS has promising application potential for cancer treatment and prognosis.

         <title>Exciton&#8208;Mediated Energy Transfer in Heterojunction Enables Infrared Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12891-12896, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under infrared&#8208;light irradiation, black phosphorus (BP) is directly excited, and energy could be nonradiatively transferred to CN by exciton interactions. The indirectly generated excitons in CN would be dissociated into free electrons and holes at the interface of BP/CN heterojunction, followed by the injection of holes to BP and the accumulation of electrons in CN.







Abstract
Although a few semiconductors can directly absorb infrared light, their intrinsic properties like improper band&#8208;edge position and strong electron&#8211;hole interaction restrict further photocatalytic applications. Herein, we propose an exciton&#8208;mediated energy transfer strategy for realizing efficient infrared light response in heterostructures. Using black phosphorous/polymeric carbon nitride (BP/CN) heterojunction, CN could be indirectly excited by infrared light with the aid of nonradiatively exciton&#8208;based energy transfer from BP. At the same time, excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers at the interface of BP/CN heterojunction, followed by hole injection to BP and electron retainment in CN. As a result of these unique photoexcitation processes, BP/CN heterojunction exhibits promoted conversion rate and selectivity in amine&#8211;amine oxidative coupling reaction even under infrared light irradiation. This study opens a new way for the design of efficient infrared light activating photocatalysts.

         <title>Design of a Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>

Benefiting from a sacrificial Zn5(OH)8(NO3)2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O insulating layer, a Zn&#8208;ion conductive and waterproof fluorine solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is formed in situ for highly reversible Zn plating/stripping in low&#8208;concentration aqueous electrolytes. The in situ formed SEI enables a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% for 200&#8197;h in Ti&#8741;Zn cells, and a high energy density (168&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with 96.5&#8201;% retention for 700&#8197;cycles in Zn&#8741;MnO2 cells.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries are challenged by water decomposition and dendrite growth due to the absence of a dense Zn&#8208;ion conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we design a low&#8208;concentration aqueous Zn(OTF)2&#8208;Zn(NO3)2 electrolyte to in situ form a robust inorganic ZnF2&#8208;Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6&#8208;organic bilayer SEI, where the inorganic inner layer promotes Zn&#8208;ion diffusion while the organic outer layer suppresses water penetration. We found that the insulating Zn5(OH)8(NO3)2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O layer is first formed on the Zn anode surface by the self&#8208;terminated chemical reaction of NO3&#8722; with Zn2+ and OH&#8722; generated via HER, and then it transforms into Zn&#8208;ion conducting Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6, which in turn promotes the formation of ZnF2 as the inner layer. The organic&#8208;dominated outer layer is formed by the reduction of OTF&#8722;. The in situ formed SEI enables a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.8&#8201;% for 200&#8197;h in Ti&#8741;Zn cells, and a high energy density (168&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with 96.5&#8201;% retention for 700 cycles in Zn&#8741;MnO2 cells with a low Zn/MnO2 capacity ratio of 2:1.

The in situ formed SEI enables a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.8&#8201;% for 200&#8197;h in Ti&#8741;Zn cells, and a high energy density (168&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with 96.5&#8201;% retention for 700 cycles in Zn&#8741;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells with a low Zn/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capacity ratio of 2:1.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Control of Triplet Blinking Using Cyclooctatetraene to Access the Dynamics of Biomolecules at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12941-12948, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potent method is offered for accessing the dynamics of biomolecules and detecting miRNA at the single&#8208;molecule level in the time range from &#956;s to ms, tracing the triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (TTET) kinetics between a fluorescent molecule and cyclooctatetraene (COT) by monitoring the fluorescence blinking.







Abstract
To explore the dynamics of biomolecules, tracing the kinetics of photo&#8208;induced chemical reactions via the triplet excited state (T1) of probe molecules offers a timescale that is about 106 times wider than via the singlet excited state (S1). Using cyclooctatetraene (COT) as a triplet energy acceptor and at the same time as a photostabilizer, the triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (TTET) kinetics governed by oligonucleotide (oligo) dynamics were studied at the single&#8208;molecule level by measuring fluorescence blinking. TTET kinetics measurement allowed us to access the length&#8208; and sequence&#8208;dependent dynamics of oligos and realize the single&#8208;molecule detection of a model microRNA biomarker. In sharp contrast to the singlet&#8211;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that occurs in the 1&#8211;10&#8197;nm range, TTET requires a Van der Waals contact. The present method is thus a complementary method to FRET and provides direct information on biomolecular dynamics on the &#956;s to ms timescale.

         <title>Ultrafast and Stable Proton Conduction in Polybenzimidazole Covalent Organic Frameworks via Confinement and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12918-12923, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Condensing benzimidazole units via topology&#8208;directed polymerization allows the construction of stable covalent organic frameworks with ordered one&#8208;dimensional channels. The walls trigger multiple hierarchical interactions so that the proton networks are locked in the pores via spatial confinement and activated via deprotonation. Ultrafast and stable anhydrous proton conduction is achieved over a wide range of temperatures.







Abstract
Polybenzimidazoles are engineering plastics with superb thermal stability and this specificity has sparked a wide&#8208;ranging research to explore proton&#8208;conducting materials. Nevertheless, such materials encounter challenging issues owing to phosphoric acid proton carrier leakage and slow proton transport. We report a strategy for designing porous polybenzimidazole frameworks to address these key fundamental issues. The built&#8208;in channels are designed to be one&#8208;dimensionally extended, unidirectionally aligned, and fully occupied by neat phosphoric acid, while the benzimidazole walls trigger multipoint, multichain, and multitype interactions to spatially confine a phosphoric acid network in pores and facilitate proton conduction via deprotonation. The materials exhibit ultrafast and stable proton conduction for low proton carrier content and activation energy&#8212;a set of features highly desired for proton transport. Our results offer a design strategy for the fabrication of porous polybenzimidazoles for use in energy conversion applications.

         <title>Crystal Packing&#8208;Guided Construction of Hetero&#8208;Oligomeric Peptidic Ensembles as Synthetic 3&#8208;in&#8208;1 Transporters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12924-12930, June 1, 2021. </description>

We present a broadly applicable social self&#8208;sorting strategy, enabling cation&#8208;binding crown ether groups and anion&#8208;binding fluorobenzene groups to be alternatively packed. This generates a 3&#8208;in&#8208;1 transporter system, promoting transmembrane transport of cations, anions, and zwitterionic species such as amino acids.







Abstract
Strategies to generate heteromeric peptidic ensembles via a social self&#8208;sorting process are limited. Herein, we report a crystal packing&#8208;inspired social self&#8208;sorting strategy broadly applicable to diverse types of H&#8208;bonded peptidic frameworks. Specifically, a crystal structure of H&#8208;bonded alkyl chain&#8208;appended monopeptides reveals an inter&#8208;chain separation distance of 4.8&#8197;&#197; dictated by the H&#8208;bonded amide groups, which is larger than 4.1&#8197;&#197; separation distance desired by the tightly packed straight alkyl chains. This incompatibility results in loosely packed alkyl chains, prompting us to investigate and validate the feasibility of applying bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups, modified with an anion&#8208;binding group, to alternatively interpenetrate the straight alkyl chains, modified with a crown ether group. Structurally, this social self&#8208;sorting approach generates highly stable hetero&#8208;oligomeric ensembles, having alternated anion&#8208; and cation&#8208;binding units vertically aligned to the same side. Functionally, these hetero&#8208;oligomeric ensembles promote transmembrane transport of cations, anions and more interestingly zwitterionic species such as amino acids.

Two key bridged skeleton&#8208;forming reactions, namely tandem sequential oxidative cyclopropanol ring&#8208;opening cyclization and ketone &#945;&#8208;allenylation, assembled the cage&#8208;shaped sarpagine scaffold. By late&#8208;stage diversifications of the ketone and allene groups, a concise, collective, and asymmetric total synthesis of two classes of indole alkaloids including five sarpagine alkaloids and three koumine alkaloids has been accomplished.







Abstract
We report here a concise, collective, and asymmetric total synthesis of sarpagine alkaloids and biogenetically related koumine alkaloids, which structurally feature a rigid cage scaffold, with L&#8208;tryptophan as the starting material. Two key bridged skeleton&#8208;forming reactions, namely tandem sequential oxidative cyclopropanol ring&#8208;opening cyclization and ketone &#945;&#8208;allenylation, ensure concurrent assembly of the caged sarpagine scaffold and installation of requisite derivative handles. With a common caged intermediate as the branch point, by taking advantage of ketone and allene groups therein, total synthesis of five sarpagine alkaloids (affinisine, normacusine&#8197;B, trinervine, Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine, and vellosimine) with various substituents and three koumine alkaloids (koumine, koumimine, and N&#8208;demethylkoumine) with more complex cage scaffolds has been accomplished.

         <title>Stabilization of the Elusive 9&#8208;Carbene&#8208;9&#8208;Borafluorene Monoanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13065-13072, June 1, 2021. </description>

The first examples of 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanions are isolated. In addition to complete characterization via X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, the nucleophilic character of the boryl anions is supported by DFT calculations and probed experimentally via reactions with metal halides and diketones.







Abstract
Two&#8208;electron reduction of carbene&#8208;supported 9&#8208;bromo&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorenes with excess KC8, Na, or Li&#8208;naphthalenide affords six N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208; or cyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized borafluorene anions (3&#8211;8)&#8208;the first isolated and structurally authenticated examples of the elusive 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanion. The electronic structure, bonding, and aromaticity of the boracyclic anions were comprehensively investigated via computational studies. Compounds 5 and 8 react with metal halides via salt elimination to give new B&#8208;E (E=Au, Se, Ge)&#8208;containing materials (9&#8211;12). Upon reaction with diketones, the carbene ligand cleanly dissociates from 5 or 8 to yield new B&#8208;O containing spirocycles (13&#8211;14) that cannot be easily obtained using &#8220;normal&#8221; valent borafluorene compounds. Collectively, these results support the notion that carbene&#8208;stabilized monoanionic borafluorenes may serve as a new platform for the one&#8208;step construction of higher&#8208;value boracyclic materials.

     alt="Stabilization of the Elusive 9-Carbene-9-Borafluorene Monoanion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first examples of 9-carbene-9-borafluorene monoanions are isolated. In addition to complete characterization via X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, the nucleophilic character of the boryl anions is supported by DFT calculations and probed experimentally via reactions with metal halides and diketones.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Pd Nanozyme for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pd single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme) with dual peroxidase (POD) and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx) mimicking activities induces ferroptosis featuring the up&#8208;regulation of lipid peroxides (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of LPO and ROS provides a powerful approach for cleaving heat shock proteins (HSPs). In this way Pd SAzyme&#8208;mediated mild&#8208;temperature PTT can be used against malignant tumors.







Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an extremely promising tumor therapeutic modality. However, excessive heat inevitably injures normal tissues near tumors, and the damage to cancer cells caused by mild hyperthermia is easily repaired by stress&#8208;induced heat shock proteins (HSPs). Thus, maximizing the PTT efficiency and minimizing the damage to healthy tissues simultaneously by adopting appropriate therapeutic temperatures is imperative. Herein, an innovative strategy is reported: ferroptosis&#8208;boosted mild PTT based on a single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme). The Pd SAzyme with atom&#8208;economical utilization of catalytic centers exhibits peroxidase (POD) and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx) mimicking activities, and photothermal conversion performance, which can result in ferroptosis featuring the up&#8208;regulation of lipid peroxides (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of LPO and ROS provides a powerful approach for cleaving HSPs, which enables Pd SAzyme&#8208;mediated mild&#8208;temperature PTT.

         <title>Freezing&#8208;Assisted Conjugation of Unmodified Diblock DNA to Hydrogel Nanoparticles and Monoliths for DNA and Hg2+ Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12985-12991, June 1, 2021. </description>

Upon freezing, unmodified diblock DNAs containing an A5 block react with acrylic monomers in a freezing radical polymerization condition. This allows covalent conjugation to hydrogel nanoparticles and monoliths with an efficiency comparable to acrydite&#8208;modified DNA.







Abstract
Acrydite&#8208;modified DNA is the most frequently used reagent to prepare DNA&#8208;functionalized hydrogels. Herein, we show that unmodified penta&#8208;adenine (A5) can reach up to 75&#8201;% conjugation efficiency in 8&#8197;h under a freezing polymerization condition in polyacrylamide hydrogels. DNA incorporation efficiency was reduced by forming duplex or other folded structures and by removing the freezing condition. By designing diblock DNA containing an A5 block, various functional DNA sequences were attached. Such hydrogels were designed for ultrasensitive DNA hybridization and Hg2+ detection, with detection limits of 50&#8197;pM and 10&#8197;nM, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of using unmodified DNA to replace acrydite&#8208;DNA. The same method worked for both gel nanoparticles and monoliths. This work revealed interesting reaction products by exploiting freezing and has provided a cost&#8208;effective way to attach DNA to hydrogels.

Based on &#946;&#8208;Lapachone&#8208;triggered ROS amplification specific in cancer cells/tissues, a wide range of cancer cells/tissues, including surgical tissue specimens harvested from patients, were distinguished from normal ones by using a combination of &#946;&#8208;Lap and a Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based NIR fluorescent ROS probe with average tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) ratios up to 15 in cell level and 24 in tissue level, far exceeding the clinically acceptable threshold of 2.0.







Abstract
Discrimination of cancer cells/tissues from normal ones is of critical importance for early diagnosis and treatment of cancers. Herein, we present a new strategy for high&#8208;contrast fluorescence diagnosis of cancer cells/tissues based on &#946;&#8208;Lapachone (&#946;&#8208;Lap, an anticancer agent) triggered ROS (reactive oxygen species) amplification specific in cancer cells/tissues. With the strategy, a wide range of cancer cells/tissues, including surgical tissue specimens harvested from patients, were distinguished from normal ones by using a combination of &#946;&#8208;Lap and a Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based NIR fluorescent ROS probe PSiR3 developed in this work with average tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) ratios up to 15 in cell level and 24 in tissue level, far exceeding the clinically acceptable threshold of 2.0. What's more, the strategy allowed the fluorescence discrimination of tumor tissues from inflammatory ones based on whether a marked fluorescence enhancement could be induced when treated with PSiR3 and &#946;&#8208;Lap/PSiR3 combination, respectively.

         <title>Organic Electrochemistry: Expanding the Scope of Paired Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Many paired electrochemical reactions use perfectly matched reactions at the anode and cathode, but this matching is not necessary. In constant current electrolysis, the potential at both electrodes adjusts to the substrates in solution. Oxidation reactions were paired with H2 generation, showing the generality of the anodic process. This effort was followed by pairing multiple cathodic reactions with a pair of established oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Paired electrochemical reactions allow the optimization of both atom and energy economy of oxidation and reduction reactions. While many paired electrochemical reactions take advantage of perfectly matched reactions at the anode and cathode, this matching of substrates is not necessary. In constant current electrolysis, the potential at both electrodes adjusts to the substrates in solution. In principle, any oxidation reaction can be paired with any reduction reaction. Various oxidation reactions conducted on the anodic side of the electrolysis were paired with the generation and use of hydrogen gas at the cathode, showing the generality of the anodic process in a paired electrolysis and how the auxiliary reaction required for the oxidation could be used to generate a substrate for a non&#8208;electrolysis reaction. This is combined with variations on the cathodic side of the electrolysis to complete the picture and illustrate how oxidation and reduction reactions can be combined.

         <title>Synthetic Homogeneous Glycoforms of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain Reveals Different Binding Profiles of Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12904-12910, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chemical synthesis of homogeneous glycoforms of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) has been accomplished via the combination of protein and carbohydrate chemistry. This strategy provides a versatile synthetic platform for homogeneous glycosylated RBDs of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein and other related virus proteins and a powerful tool for investigating the functions of RBD glycans.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 attaches to its host receptor, angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), via the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The RBD glycoprotein is a critical target for the development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However, the high heterogeneity of RBD glycoforms may lead to an incomplete neutralization effect and impact the immunogenic integrity of RBD&#8208;based vaccines. Investigating the role of different carbohydrate domains is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, there is no viable method for preparing RBD glycoproteins with structurally defined glycans. Herein we describe a highly efficient and scalable strategy for the preparation of six glycosylated RBDs bearing defined structure glycoforms at T323, N331, and N343. A combination of modern oligosaccharide, peptide synthesis and recombinant protein engineering provides a robust route to decipher carbohydrate structure&#8208;function relationships.

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescent Lateral Flow Immunoassay for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing of Acute Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13042-13049, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ratiometric fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay is achieved by inner filter effect&#8208;mediated double&#8208;signal&#8208;reverse change, which not only enables highly sensitive quantitative analysis by combing with the smartphone platform, but also allows the visual readout of H&#8208;FABP concentration by the naked eye. The developed strip can be used for rapid and accurate point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of acute myocardial infarction.







Abstract
We report the development of a highly sensitive ratiometric fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (RFLFIA) strip for rapid and accurate detection of acute myocardial infarction biomarker, namely heart&#8208;type fatty acid binding protein (H&#8208;FABP). The RFLFIA strip works in terms of ratiometric change of fluorescence signal, arising from blending of fluorescence emitted by two composite nanostructures conjugated to capture and probe antibodies and inner filter effect of gold nanoparticles. In conjunction with using custom smartphone&#8208;based analytical device and tonality analysis, quantitative detection of H&#8208;FABP was achieved with a low limit of detection at 0.21&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1. The RFLFIA strip can generate a visually distinguishable green&#8208;to&#8208;red color change around the threshold concentration of H&#8208;FABP (6.2&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1), thus allowing the semi&#8208;quantitative diagnosis by the naked eye.

         <title>Nitrone and Alkyne Cascade Reactions for Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective 1&#8208;Pyrroline Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13089-13097, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal [4+1] cascade reaction of N&#8208;alkenylnitrones and alkynes has been developed for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of densely substituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines. This transformation provides a distinct disconnection strategy to access these heterocycles in comparison to traditional approaches. The scope, tolerance, and utility of the method are discussed, and mechanistic studies are examined to better understand reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
The synthesis of 1&#8208;pyrrolines from N&#8208;alkenylnitrones and alkynes has been explored as a retrosynthetic alternative to traditional approaches. These cascade reactions are formal [4+1] cycloadditions that proceed through a proposed dipolar cycloaddition and N&#8208;alkenylisoxazoline [3,3&#8242;]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. A variety of cyclic alkynes and terminal alkynes have been shown to undergo the transformation with N&#8208;alkenylnitrones under mild conditions to provide the corresponding spirocyclic and densely substituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the balance of steric and electronic effects that promote the cascade process and control the diastereo&#8208; and regioisomeric preferences of the 1&#8208;pyrroline products. Diastereoselective derivatization of the 1&#8208;pyrrolines prepared by the cascade reaction demonstrate the divergent synthetic utility of the new method.

         <title>Advanced Low&#8208;Flammable Electrolytes for Stable Operation of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12999-13006, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced low&#8208;flammable electrolytes are developed for high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With fluoroethylene carbonate as a proper electrolyte additive, the trimethyl phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte achieves greatly extended cycle life over the conventional LiPF6&#8208;organocarbonates electrolyte, due to the formation of enhanced surface protection layers, making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.







Abstract
Despite being an effective flame retardant, trimethyl phosphate (TMPa) is generally considered as an unqualified solvent for fabricating electrolytes used in graphite (Gr)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries as it readily leads to Gr exfoliation and cell failure. In this work, by adopting the unique solvation structure of localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to TMPa and tuning the composition of the solvation sheaths via electrolyte additives, excellent electrochemical performance can be achieved with TMPa&#8208;based electrolytes in Gr&#8741;LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells. After 500 charge/discharge cycles within the voltage range of 2.5&#8211;4.4&#8197;V, the batteries containing the TMPa&#8208;based LHCE with a proper additive can achieve a capacity retention of 85.4&#8201;%, being significantly higher than cells using a LiPF6&#8208;organocarbonates baseline electrolyte (75.2&#8201;%). Meanwhile, due to the flame retarding effect of TMPa, TMPa&#8208;based LHCEs exhibit significantly reduced flammability compared with the conventional LiPF6&#8208;organocarbonates electrolyte.

         <title>The Electrolysis of Anti&#8208;Perovskite Li2OHCl for Prelithiation of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13013-13020, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;perovskite type Li2OHCl was demonstrated could be electrolyzed at 3.3&#8197;V or 4.0&#8197;V via two oxidizing routes, with the creation of O2/HCl gases and release of 2&#8197;equiv. Li+ that obtain electrons to deposit or intercalate in anode, with which as cathode Li&#8208;reservoir for pre&#8208;lithiation, the capacities of NMC811&#8741;Si@C full cells were increased proportionally with the varying dosage of pre&#8208;lithiation.







Abstract
Anti&#8208;perovskite type Li2OHCl was previously studied as a solid&#8208;state Li+ conductor. Here, we report that the Li2OHCl can be electrolyzed at 3.3&#8197;V or 4.0&#8197;V, with the creation of O2/HCl gases and the release of 2&#8197;equiv. Li+ via two different decomposition routes, depending on the acidity of electrolyte. In the electrolyte with trace acid, the Li2OHCl is oxidized at a constant voltage of 3.3&#8197;V. In neutral electrolyte, the oxidization of Li2OHCl starts at 4.0&#8197;V, but the produced HCl will increase the acidity of electrolyte and lead to a voltage drop to 3.3&#8197;V for the electrolysis of Li2OHCl. The electrolysis of Li2OHCl delivers a lithium releasing capacity as high as 810&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an equivalent Li&#8208;deposition or Li&#8208;intercalation on anode, making it a promising candidate as a Li reservoir for prelithiation of anode. Using Li2OHCl as the lithium source, silicon&#8208;carbon (Si@C) composite anode can be effectively prelithiated. The full cells composed of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathode and prelithiated Si@C anode exhibited increased capacities with the increment of prelithiation dosages.

&lt;p&gt;Anti-perovskite type Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OHCl was demonstrated could be electrolyzed at 3.3&#8197;V or 4.0&#8197;V via two oxidizing routes, with the creation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/HCl gases and release of 2&#8197;equiv. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; that obtain electrons to deposit or intercalate in anode, with which as cathode Li-reservoir for pre-lithiation, the capacities of NMC811&#8741;Si@C full cells were increased proportionally with the varying dosage of pre-lithiation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-perovskite type Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OHCl was previously studied as a solid-state Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductor. Here, we report that the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OHCl can be electrolyzed at 3.3&#8197;V or 4.0&#8197;V, with the creation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/HCl gases and the release of 2&#8197;equiv. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; via two different decomposition routes, depending on the acidity of electrolyte. In the electrolyte with trace acid, the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OHCl is oxidized at a constant voltage of 3.3&#8197;V. In neutral electrolyte, the oxidization of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OHCl starts at 4.0&#8197;V, but the produced HCl will increase the acidity of electrolyte and lead to a voltage drop to 3.3&#8197;V for the electrolysis of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OHCl. The electrolysis of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OHCl delivers a lithium releasing capacity as high as 810&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with an equivalent Li-deposition or Li-intercalation on anode, making it a promising candidate as a Li reservoir for prelithiation of anode.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Alkylation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes: Switching Regioselectivity via Simple Hydrazones</title>

A highly effective Pd&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative alkylation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane with branched selectivity was achieved by using a cooperative strategy that integrated the unique trifunctional character of hydrazones with Pd/NHC catalysis.







Abstract
Conventional approaches for Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;couplings of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with nucleophiles predominantly deliver the &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkene scaffolds (linear selectivity). Herein, we report a cooperative strategy that can completely switch the reaction selectivity to give the alkylated &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkene skeletons (branched selectivity). The unique reactivity of hydrazones that enables analogous inner&#8208;sphere 3,3&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination driven by denitrogenation, as well as the assistance of steric&#8208;embedded N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, are the key to switch the regioselectivity. A wide range of hydrazones derived from naturally abundant aryl and alkyl aldehydes are well applicable, and various gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes, including modified pharmaceutical and biological molecules, can be efficiently functionalized with high value alkylated &#945;&#8208;fluorinated alkene motifs under mild conditions.

         <title>Swelling&#8208;Induced Symmetry Breaking: A Versatile Approach to the Scalable Production of Colloidal Particles with a Janus Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12980-12984, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking of spherical symmetry is achieved when a polystyrene (PS) bead encapsulated in a shell made of silica or polydopamine is exposed to a good solvent for PS. The swelling&#8208;increased pressure will poke a hole in the shell and then extrude the swollen PS out, leading to the generation of a Janus particle comprised of two distinct components.







Abstract
Janus particles are widely sought for applications related to colloidal assembly, stabilization of emulsions, and development of active colloids, among others. Here we report a versatile route to the fabrication of well&#8208;controlled Janus particles by simply breaking the symmetry of spherical particles with swelling. When a polystyrene (PS) sphere covered by a rigid shell made of silica or polydopamine is exposed to a good solvent for PS, a gradually increased pressure will be created inside the shell. If the pressure becomes high enough to poke a hole in the shell, the spherical symmetry will break while pushing out the swollen PS through the opening to generate a Janus particle comprised of two distinct components. One of the components is made of PS and its size is controlled by the extent of swelling. The other component is comprised of the rigid shell and remaining PS, with its overall diameter determined by the original PS sphere and the rigid shell. This solution&#8208;based route holds promises for the scalable production of complex Janus particles with a variety of compositions and in large quantities.

         <title>Simple Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptors Leading to Efficient Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12964-12970, June 1, 2021. </description>

Two new non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring acceptors (NFRAs), denoted as PTB4F and PTB4Cl, are developed via a two&#8208;step synthesis from simple phenyl and thiophene units. The corresponding organic photovoltaics based on PTB4Cl:PBDB&#8208;TF have impressively achieved a power conversion efficiency of 12.76&#8201;%, representing the highest value among the fully non&#8208;fused NFRAs reported so far.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable progress achieved in recent years, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) still need work to approach the delicate balance between efficiency, stability, and cost. Herein, two fully non&#8208;fused electron acceptors, PTB4F and PTB4Cl, are developed via a two&#8208;step synthesis from single aromatic units. The introduction of a two&#8208;dimensional chain and halogenated terminals for these non&#8208;fused acceptors plays a synergistic role in optimizing their solid stacking and orientation, thus promoting an elongated exciton lifetime and fast charge&#8208;transfer rate in bulk heterojunction blends. As a result, PTB4Cl, upon blending with PBDB&#8208;TF polymer, has enabled single&#8208;junction OPVs with power conversion efficiencies of 12.76&#8201;%, representing the highest values among the reported fully unfused electron acceptors so far.

Reported herein is the isolation, structure determination of (&#8722;)&#8208;isoscopariusin&#8197;A by spectroscopic analysis and concise chemical synthesis. The unprecedented meroditerpenoid bears a 6/6/4 tricyclic carbon skeleton with seven continuous stereocenters, and exhibits selective inhibition of T&#8208;cell proliferation. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved in 12 steps from (+)&#8208;sclareolide.







Abstract
(&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A was isolated from the aerial parts of Isodon scoparius. Chemical synthesis and spectroscopic analysis established its structure as an unsymmetrical meroditerpenoid bearing a sterically congested 6/6/4 tricyclic carbon skeleton with seven continuous stereocenters. A gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved in 12 steps from commercially available (+)&#8208;sclareolide. A cobalt catalyzed, hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;based olefin isomerization was used to prepare a trisubstituted alkene, which underwent stereoselective [2+2] cycloaddition with a substituted keteniminium ion generated in situ from the corresponding amide. The cyclobutanone product was further elaborated into the fully substituted cyclobutane core through face&#8208;selective homologation, and the two side chains were installed by using nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and carbodiimide&#8208;mediated esterification, respectively. (&#8722;)&#8208;Isoscopariusin&#8197;A displayed selective inhibition of T&#8208;cell proliferation.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: A Two&#8208;Electron Silver Superatom Isolated from Thermally Induced Internal Redox Reaction of A Silver(I) Hydride (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 23/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 13113-13113, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology was developed for the preparation of superatomic nanoclusters in a controllable fashion, with an internal redox reaction of Ag7(H)L6 leading to the formation of a highly emissive two&#8208;electron Ag nanocluster, Ag10L8. Jean&#8208;Yves Saillard, Chen&#8208;Wei Liu, and co&#8208;workers explain in their Communication on page&#8197;12712 that the metal framework of Ag7 is highly correlated to that of Ag10, suggesting that Ag7(H)L6 acts as both reducing agent and template in the cluster build&#8208;up.

Control of the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction through tuning of molecular steric effects is demonstrated by Ran Long, Rui Cao, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;12742. Selective two&#8208; or four&#8208;electron oxygen reductions can be achieved by using Co porphyrin atropisomers with similar electronic structures but dissimilar steric effects. This work represents an unparalleled example of improving the oxygen reduction selectivity by tuning only steric effects of the catalysts without changing molecular and electronic structures.

In conjunction with appropriate nanomaterials, electromagnetic energy sources including alternating magnetic fields, ultrasound, near&#8208;infrared light, and X&#8208;rays can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of cancer cells, and thus potentiate cancer immunotherapy. This review discusses the recent development of electromagnetic nanomedicines in combination with various immunotherapies for cancer treatment.







Abstract
Immunotherapy that harnesses the power of the immune system to eliminate malignant cells has offered an effective approach for cancer treatment. However, limited patient response rates and potential immune&#8208;related adverse events exist as two major issues for cancer immunotherapy. In parallel, a variety of electromagnetic nanomaterials that generate heat and/or reactive oxygen species triggered by electromagnetic energy have been applied for magnetic hyperthermia therapy, sonodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and radiotherapy, which have the ability to induce immunogenic cell death. This review summarizes the recent development of electromagnetic nanomedicines in combinational cancer immunotherapy. The mechanisms of electromagnetic nanomedicines in reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and sensitizing tumors for cancer immunotherapy are highlighted. Furthermore, potential challenges and perspectives of electromagnetic nanomedicines for combinational cancer immunotherapy are discussed.

The recent discoveries of both dicationic and monoanionic ferrocene derivatives throw light on the effect of the substituents on the C5 ring as well as the choice of redox agents and solvent system in the preparation of previously believed to be difficult synthetic targets. These oxidized and reduced forms of ferrocene are of interest to spectroscopists, magnetochemists, and theoreticians.

         <title>Evolution of the Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction Mechanism since the 1930s: Woodward, Houk with Woodward, and the Influence of Computational Chemistry on Understanding Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12660-12681, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution of understanding of the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction mechanism is described, from R.&#8197;B. Woodward's boyhood visions, to Ken Houk's experiences as a graduate student in Woodward's laboratory, to today's dynamical view of Diels&#8211;Alder and higher&#8208;order cycloadditions. Roald Hoffmann's Coda gives his view of Woodward and the zig&#8208;zag processes of scientific discovery.







Abstract
This review article describes the evolution of Woodward's mechanistic thinking, beginning in the late 1930s and early 1940s with his proposal of a charge&#8208;transfer mechanism for the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, eventually leading to the Woodward&#8211;Katz two&#8208;stage concerted mechanism in 1959, and then to its mechanistic solution in terms of orbital symmetry control. Houk&#8242;s research in the Woodward labs, testing the predictions of this theory, is described. Subsequent modern calculations with quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations have shown that Woodward indeed had perfectly described not only the cyclopentadiene dimerization mechanism, but a new class of transition states now known as ambimodal or bis&#8208;pericyclic transition states. In recent years, the Houk group has found that ambimodal reactions are operative in the [6+4] cycloaddition. Molecular dynamics simulations of many Diels&#8211;Alder and ambimodal cycloadditions provide a time&#8208;resolved picture of how these reactions occur. Lastly, Roald Hoffmann provides a Coda in which he describes his joy in &#8220;being taken along the journey&#8221; of the cycloaddition story from Woodward's youth to today's trajectory simulations.

         <title>The Transient Covalent Bond in Abiotic Nonequilibrium Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12648-12658, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient covalent bonds generated by chemical fuels are a fundamental tool for generating nonequilibrium reaction networks. In this Minireview, different approaches to transient bond formation are discussed, illustrating how similar fuel chemistry can be applied to a wide range of abiotic systems ranging from self&#8208;assembly to molecular machines.







Abstract
Biochemical systems accomplish many critical functions with by operating out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium using the energy of chemical fuels. The formation of a transient covalent bond is a simple but very effective tool in designing analogous reaction networks. This Minireview focuses on the fuel chemistries that have been used to generate transient bonds in recent demonstrations of abiotic nonequilibrium systems (i.e., systems that do not make use of biological components). Fuel reactions are divided into two fundamental classifications depending on whether the fuel contributes structural elements to the activated state, a distinction that dictates how they can be used. Reported systems are further categorized by overall fuel reaction (e.g., hydrolysis of alkylating agents, carbodiimide hydration) and illustrate how similar chemistry can be used to effect a wide range of nonequilibrium behavior, ranging from self&#8208;assembly to the operation of molecular machines.

         <title>Iodine Redox Chemistry in Rechargeable Batteries</title>

The reversible redox reactions of iodine coupled with various anodes enable the fabrication of advanced rechargeable batteries. This Minireview summarizes the current understanding of the fundamental redox chemistry of iodine, with a special emphasis on the strategies for enhancing battery performance.







Abstract
Halogens have been coupled with metal anodes in a single cell to develop novel rechargeable batteries based on extrinsic redox reactions. Since the commercial introduction of lithium&#8208;iodine batteries in 1972, they have shown great potential to match the high&#8208;rate performance, large energy density, and good safety of advanced batteries. With the development of metal anodes (e.g. Li, Zn), one of the actual challenges lies in the preparation of electrochemically active and reliable iodine&#8208;based cathodes to prevent self&#8208;discharge and capacity decay of the rechargeable batteries. Understanding the fundamental reactions of iodine/polyiodide and their underlying mechanisms is still highly desirable to promote the rational design of advanced cathodes for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. In this Minireview, recent advances in the development of iodine&#8208;based cathodes to fabricate rechargeable batteries are summarized, with a special focus on the basic principles of iodine redox chemistry to correlate with structure&#8208;function relationships.

         <title>Na&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B Bond in NaBH3&#8722;: Solving the Conundrum</title>

A multifaceted bond: High level Valence Bond calculations show that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster is stabilized neither by a dative bond nor by a standard polar&#8208;covalent bond, but rather by a unique combination of three distinct components that are accurately quantified.







Abstract
Bonding in the recently synthesized NaBH3&#8722; cluster is investigated using the high level Valence Bond BOVB method. Contrary to earlier conclusions, the Na&#8722;B bond is found to be neither a genuine dative bond, nor a standard polar&#8208;covalent bond at equilibrium. It is rather revealed as a split and polarized weakly coupled electron&#8208;pair, which allows this cluster to be more effectively stabilized by a combination of (major) dipole&#8208;dipole electrostatic interaction and (secondary) resonant one&#8208;electron bonding mechanism. Our analysis of this unprecedented bonding situation extends to similar clusters, and the VB model unifies and articulates the previously published variegated views on this exotic &#8220;bond&#8221;.

         <title>Triptycene&#8208;based Chiral Porous Polyimides for Enantioselective Membrane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12781-12785, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral porous polyimides (FTPI) were synthesized using monomers of chiral 2,6&#8208;diaminotriptycene. The absolute configurations were identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The obtained R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with high permeation rates.







Abstract
Enantiomers of 2, 6&#8208;diaminotriptycene (R, R&#8208;1 and S, S&#8208;1) are split by chiral&#8208;phase HPLC and their absolute configurations are identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technology. Using the enantiomers as monomers, a couple of chiral porous polyimides (R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI) are prepared by polycondensation reactions and display good heat stability, high BET surface area and good solubility in organic solvents. Moreover, both of R&#8208;FTPI and S&#8208;FTPI can be cast into robust, free&#8208;standing films suitable for enantioselective separation with symmetrical chiral selectivity.

Light&#8208;induced tuning of the optical response of silicon nanoparticles covered by polyelectrolyte shell occurs due to light&#8208;induced heating and concomitant swelling of the shell reversibly up to 120&#8197;C.







Abstract
We suggest a new strategy for creating stimuli&#8208;responsive bio&#8208;integrated optical nanostructures based on Mie&#8208;resonant silicon nanoparticles covered by an ensemble of similarity negatively charged polyelectrolytes (heparin and sodium polystyrene sulfonate). The dynamic tuning of the nanostructures&#8217; optical response is due to light&#8208;induced heating of the nanoparticles and swelling of the polyelectrolyte shell. The resulting hydrophilic/hydrophobic transitions significantly change the shell thickness and reversible shift of the scattering spectra for individual nanoparticles up to 60&#8197;nm. Our findings bring novel opportunities for the application of smart nanomaterials in nanomedicine and bio&#8208;integrated nanophotonics.

         <title>Syntheses and Physical Properties of Cationic BN&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>

Cationic BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAH+) were synthesized via pyridine&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. Anion exchange gave a brickwork&#8208;type p&#8208;electronic ion pair with 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentacyanocyclopentadienyl anion ([PCCp&#8211;]).







Abstract
Cationic BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAH+s) were synthesized from a nitrogen&#8208;containing macrocycle via pyridine&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. Incorporating BN into PAH+ resulted in a remarkable hypsochromic shift due to an increase in the LUMO energy and the symmetry changes of the HOMO and LUMO. Electrophilic substitution or anion exchange of BN&#8208;PAH+ possessing tetrabromoborate as a counter anion (BN+[BBr4&#8722;]) afforded air&#8208;stable BN&#8208;PAH/PAH+s. Of these, BN+[TfO&#8722;] allowed reversible two&#8208;electron reduction and the formation of two&#8208;dimensional brickwork&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;electronic ion pair with 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentacyanocyclopentadienyl anion, demonstrating the potential application of BN&#8208;PAH+ as electronic materials.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Electron Silver Superatom Isolated from Thermally Induced Internal Redox Reaction of A Silver(I) Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12712-12716, June 1, 2021. </description>

A self&#8208;redox reaction of Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 leads to the formation of a highly emissive, two&#8208;electron Ag nanocluster, Ag10{S2P(OiPr)2}8, without adding extra reducing agents. The metal framework of Ag7, a bicapped trigonal bipyramid, is highly correlated to that of Ag10, suggesting Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 acts as both reducing agent and template in cluster growth.







Abstract
Rational syntheses under controllable reducing conditions in the preparation of superatoms with cluster electron number not exceeding two are challenging. Herein a dithiolate&#8208;stabilized two&#8208;electron silver nanocluster, Ag10{S2P(OiPr)2}8 (1), is isolated via a self&#8208;redox reaction of Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 without adding extra reducing agents. The metal framework of Ag7, a bicapped trigonal bipyramid, is highly correlated to that of Ag10, suggesting Ag7(H){S2P(OiPr)2}6 acts as both reducing agent and template in cluster growth. 1 is highly fluorescent at ambient temperature and TD&#8208;DFT calculations indicate that the emission is of 1Px&#8594;1S nature.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational syntheses under controllable reducing conditions in the preparation of superatoms with cluster electron number not exceeding two are challenging. Herein a dithiolate-stabilized two-electron silver nanocluster, Ag&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;{S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), is isolated via a self-redox reaction of Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(H){S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; without adding extra reducing agents. The metal framework of Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, a bicapped trigonal bipyramid, is highly correlated to that of Ag&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, suggesting Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(H){S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; acts as both reducing agent and template in cluster growth. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is highly fluorescent at ambient temperature and TD-DFT calculations indicate that the emission is of 1P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;1S nature.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
A multisaccharide&#8208;coated aromatic micelle forms in water through quantitative assembly of bent polyaromatic amphiphiles bearing three mannose groups. The emission intensity and color of the saccharide cluster can be altered from blue to strong red, orange, and green (&#934;F up to 67&#8201;%) upon encapsulation of hydrophobic fluorescent dyes. Moreover, the present fluorescent clusters display selective interactions with mannose&#8208;binding proteins in vitro.







Abstract
To develop a new type of synthetic saccharide clusters with changeable fluorescent colors, we herein designed a multisaccharide&#8208;coated aromatic micelle. The new cluster forms in water through the quantitative assembly of bent polyaromatic amphiphiles bearing three mannose groups. The spherical assembly, with a 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized polyaromatic core and ca. 18 saccharide pendants, is stable even under high dilution conditions (up to 0.02&#8197;mM). The emission intensity and color of the saccharide cluster can be altered from moderate blue (&#934;F=19&#8201;%) to strong red, orange, and green (&#934;F up to 67&#8201;%) upon encapsulation of hydrophobic fluorescent dyes in water. Moreover, the present fluorescent clusters, both with and without the dyes, display selective interactions with mannose&#8208;binding proteins in vitro.

         <title>Mechanochemical Prebiotic Peptide Bond Formation**

         <dc:description>
Mechanical and thermal activation enable the solvent&#8208;free oligomerization of inactivated amino acids in the presence of TiO2 to form peptides. Our observations validate the usefulness of mechanochemistry to simulate and study prebiotic chemistry in an impact scenario where dry land and mineral surfaces are critical for the concentration and formation of organic building blocks.







Abstract
The presence of amino acids on the prebiotic Earth, either stemming from endogenous chemical routes or delivered by meteorites, is consensually accepted. Prebiotically plausible pathways to peptides from inactivated amino acids are still unclear as most oligomerization approaches rely on thermodynamically disfavored reactions in solution. Now, a combination of prebiotically plausible minerals and mechanochemical activation enables the oligomerization of glycine at ambient temperature in the absence of water. Raising the reaction temperature increases the degree of oligomerization concomitantly with the formation of a commonly unwanted cyclic glycine dimer (DKP). However, DKP is a productive intermediate in the mechanochemical oligomerization of glycine. The findings of this research show that mechanochemical peptide bond formation is a dynamic process that provides alternative routes towards oligopeptides and establishes new synthetic approaches for prebiotic chemistry.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Halogen Bonded Ternary Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12841-12846, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonded ternary cocrystals were synthesized by employing three different approaches. The possible reasons for the formation of these cocrystals have been proposed based on a detailed crystal packing analysis and computational results.







Abstract
Higher cocrystal synthesis depends acutely on a knowledge of supramolecular synthons. We report three synthetic approaches towards ternary halogen bonded cocrystals that illustrate specificity and generality. Electrophilicity/nucleophilicity differences are needed among alternative sites of halogen bond formation. The two halogen bonds A&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B and B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C in a halogen bonded ternary cocrystal ABC need to be of different strength. Interaction mimicry of hydrogen bonds by halogen bonds is a viable approach towards ternaries as illustrated with the pyrene structure. Finally, the crystal engineer should well be able to anticipate halogen bonds that are stronger than hydrogen bonds.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Enables Heterogeneous Asymmetric Insertion of Carbenoids into Amines Catalyzed by Rhodium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12786-12790, June 1, 2021. </description>

Rh nanoparticle catalysts supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon were developed for asymmetric insertions of carbenoids derived from diazoesters into N&#8722;H bonds cocatalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid. The nitrogen dopants are essential to promote the reactions. The catalyst could be reused several times and was applicable for a continuous&#8208;flow reaction system that produced the desired chiral amine for over 90&#8197;h through reactivation of the catalyst.







Abstract
Development of stable heterogeneous catalyst systems is a crucial subject to achieve sustainable society. Though metal nanoparticles are robust species, the study of asymmetric catalysis by them has been restricted because methods to activate metal nanoparticles without causing metal leaching were limited. We developed Rh nanoparticle catalysts (NCI&#8208;Rh) supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon as a solid ligand to interact with metals for asymmetric insertion of carbenoids into N&#8722;H bonds cocatalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid. Nitrogen dopants played a crucial role in both catalytic activity and enantioselectivity while almost no catalysis was observed with Rh nanoparticles immobilized on supports without nitrogen dopants. Various types of chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives were synthesized in high yields with high enantioselectivities and NCI&#8208;Rh could be reused in seven runs. Furthermore, we demonstrated the corresponding continuous&#8208;flow reaction using a column packed with NCI&#8208;Rh. The desired product was obtained efficiently for over 90&#8197;h through the reactivation of NCI&#8208;Rh and the chiral source could be recovered.

         <title>An Aromatic Oligomer Micelle: Large Enthalpic Stabilization and Selective Oligothiophene Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12754-12758, June 1, 2021. </description>

An aromatic oligomer micelle was formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers. The well&#8208;defined nanostructure remains intact even under dilution and at high temperature. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes; the resultant host&#8211;guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers.







Abstract
An aromatic oligomer micelle, featuring both high stability and high uptake ability, was quantitatively formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers, composed of three bent polyaromatic amphiphiles connected alternately by two hydrophilic chains. The well&#8208;defined micelle, with a diameter of ca. 2&#8197;nm, remains intact even under highly diluted conditions (ca. 3&#8197;&#956;M) and at elevated temperature (&gt;130&#8201;&#176;C), due to the polyaromatic chelate effect. The thermodynamic studies reveal that large enthalpic gain (&#916;H=&#8722;110&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) is the key for the micelle formation. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes (&#8805;4&#8208;mer) to a high degree and the resultant, aqueous host&#8208;guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers. Furthermore, facile uptake and release of unsubstituted polythiophenes can be achieved using the oligomer micelle.

     alt="An Aromatic Oligomer Micelle: Large Enthalpic Stabilization and Selective Oligothiophene Uptake"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aromatic oligomer micelle was formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers. The well-defined nanostructure remains intact even under dilution and at high temperature. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes; the resultant host&#8211;guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aromatic oligomer micelle, featuring both high stability and high uptake ability, was quantitatively formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers, composed of three bent polyaromatic amphiphiles connected alternately by two hydrophilic chains. The well-defined micelle, with a diameter of ca. 2&#8197;nm, remains intact even under highly diluted conditions (ca. 3&#8197;&#956;M) and at elevated temperature (&amp;gt;130&#8201;&#176;C), due to the polyaromatic chelate effect. The thermodynamic studies reveal that large enthalpic gain (&#916;H=&#8722;110&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is the key for the micelle formation. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes (&#8805;4-mer) to a high degree and the resultant, aqueous host-guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers. Furthermore, facile uptake and release of unsubstituted polythiophenes can be achieved using the oligomer micelle.&lt;/p&gt;

We report herein a gold and palladium sequential catalysis to convert enynamides and vinyl ethylene carbonates to furan&#8208;fused nine&#8208;membered heterocycles via azadiene generation followed by [5+4] cycloaddition. Conformation&#8208;controlled diastereoselective derivatizations of these medium&#8208;sized rings and oxidative furan cleavage enabled access to diverse polyfunctionalized nine&#8208;membered lactams.







Abstract
We report herein a gold and palladium sequential catalysis system to access furan&#8208;fused nine&#8208;membered heterocycles in high efficiency and enantioselectivity. In this one&#8208;pot procedure, easily accessible enynamides undergo cyclization to generate azadienes in situ that participate in enantioselective formal [5+4] cycloaddition with vinyl ethylene carbonates. Conformation&#8208;controlled highly diastereoselective derivatizations of these medium&#8208;sized rings, coupled with oxidative furan cleavage, have enabled the access to diverse densely&#8208;functionalized nine&#8208;membered lactams.

Protein&#8211;antibody conjugates (PACs) have the potential to judiciously combine the merits of two prolific therapeutic approaches&#8212;biologics and antibody&#8211;drug conjugates&#8212;for antibody&#8208;directed delivery of protein therapeutics to specific cells.







Abstract
We report here on protein&#8211;antibody conjugates (PACs) that are used for antibody&#8208;directed delivery of protein therapeutics to specific cells. PACs have the potential to judiciously combine the merits of two prolific therapeutic approaches&#8212;biologics and antibody&#8211;drug conjugates. We utilize spherical polymer brushes to construct PACs using the combination of two simple and efficient functionally orthogonal click chemistries. In addition to the synthesis and characterization of these nanoparticles, we demonstrate that PACs are indeed capable of specifically targeting cells based on the presence of target antigen on the cell surface to deliver proteins. The potentially broad adaptability of PACs opens up new opportunities for targeted biologics in therapeutics and sensing.

         <title>Neither too Classic nor too Exotic: One&#8208;Electron Na&#8901;B Bond in NaBH3&#8722; Cluster</title>

A two&#8208;centre one&#8208;electron bond (2c&#8211;1e): Chemical bonding analysis using electron localization function (ELF), at correlated level, shows that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster exhibits a Na&#8901;B 2c&#8211;1e bond.







Abstract
It is here reported that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster exhibits a Na&#8901;B one&#8208;electron bond, a well&#8208;established type of electron&#8208;deficient bonding in the literature. The topological analysis of the electron localization function, at the correlated level, reveals that Na&#8722;, when approaching the bonding distance, fairly distributes its valence electron pair between two lobes. One of these electrons is used to bond with BH3, which participates through its boron empty p&#8208;orbital. Furthermore, the bonding situation of LiBH3&#8722;, KBH3&#8722;, MgBH3, and CaBH3 global minima structures are similar to that of NaBH3&#8722;, extending the family of these new one&#8208;electron bond systems with biradicaloid character.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Benzyl Alcohols via Palladium/Chiral Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12824-12828, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective kinetic resolution of tertiary benzyl alcohols via palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis is developed. Simple aryl iodides are used as the resolution reagent. Both enantioenriched tertiary benzyl alcohols and benzo[c]chromene products are obtained in good to excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic applications are demonstrated by the facile synthesis of diversified biorelevant heterocycles.







Abstract
Herein we report a highly enantioselective kinetic resolution of tertiary benzyl alcohols via palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis. With simple aryl iodides as the resolution reagent, a wide range of readily available racemic tertiary benzyl alcohols are applicable to this method. Both chiral tertiary benzyl alcohols and benzo[c]chromene products are obtained in good to excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity factor up to 544). The appealing synthetic utility of the obtained enantioenriched tertiary alcohols is demonstrated by the facile preparation of several valuable chiral heterocycles. Preliminary mechanism studies include DFT calculations to explain the origin of enantiodiscrimination and control experiments to uncover the formation of a transient axial chirality during the kinetic resolution step.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Arborisidine</title>

         <dc:description>
A serendipitous regiodivergent parallel kinetic resolution via dearomative asymmetric allylic alkylation, together with a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization, realized a novel approach to (&#8722;)&#8208;arborisidine. 







Abstract
An asymmetric total synthesis of cage&#8208;like indole alkaloid arborisidine is presented. The new synthetic strategy features a catalytic parallel kinetic resolution based on ambident nucleophilicity (C3/N) of indole to set the absolute configurations of the two quaternary chiral centers, and a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig radical cyclization to form the bridged nitrogen&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered ring.

A novel onion&#8208;like carbon&#8208;nanosphere&#8208;coated Co, N&#8208;doped carbon (OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C) material was reported for bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C exhibits excellent ORR/OER activity and Zn&#8208;air battery performance than Co&#8208;N&#8208;C without OLC structure. Highly curved OLC is beneficial for adsorption of intermediates during ORR/OER process comparing with their analogues in un&#8208;curved graphene.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene could catalyze the electrochemical reduction and evolution of oxygen, but unfortunately suffers from sluggish catalytic kinetics. Herein, for the first time, we report an onion&#8208;like carbon coated Co, N&#8208;doped carbon (OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C) material, which possesses multilayers of highly curved nanostructures that form mesoporous architectures. These unique nanospheres are produced when surfactant micelles are introduced to synthesis precursors. Owing to the combined electronic effect and nanostructuring effect, our OLC/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C materials exhibit high bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) activity, showing a promising application in rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. Experimental results are rationalized by theoretical calculations, showing that the curvature of graphitic carbon plays a vital role in promoting activities of meta&#8208;carbon atoms near graphitic N and ortho/meta carbon atoms close to pyridinic N.

         <title>Structural Analysis of an Antigen Chemically Coupled on Virus&#8208;Like Particles in Vaccine Formulation</title>

         <dc:description>
The sensitivity boost provided by dynamic nuclear polarization and proton detection with fast magic&#8208;angle spinning renders solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy capable of structural analysis in heterogeneous vaccine formulations with dilute adjuvant&#8208;coupled antigens. This methodology is demonstrated on the influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk long alpha helix antigen after coupling to virus&#8208;like particles.







Abstract
Structure determination of adjuvant&#8208;coupled antigens is essential for rational vaccine development but has so far been hampered by the relatively low antigen content in vaccine formulations and by their heterogeneous composition. Here we show that magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR can be used to assess the structure of the influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk long alpha helix antigen, both in its free, unformulated form and once chemically coupled to the surface of large virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs). The sensitivity boost provided by high&#8208;field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and proton detection at fast MAS rates allows to overcome the penalty associated with the antigen dilution. Comparison of the MAS NMR fingerprints between the free and VLP&#8208;coupled forms of the antigen provides structural evidence of the conservation of its native fold upon bioconjugation. This work demonstrates that high&#8208;sensitivity MAS NMR is ripe to play a major role in vaccine design, formulation studies, and manufacturing process development.

         <title>Chirogenesis and Amplification of Molecular Chirality Using Optical Vortices</title>

Chiral green vortices generated using a spiral phase plate (SPP) with a 532&#8197;nm CW&#8208;laser were used to irradiate a supersaturated solution of a racemic isoindolinone, leading to crystal nucleation. The handedness of the crystal nucleus and the growth of the crystals were controlled by the winding direction of the chiral optical vortices. The molecular chirality of the isoindolinone was then amplified by dynamic crystallization.







Abstract
The study of chirogenesis of organic molecules is important to elucidate the origin of the homochirality of biomolecules on Earth. Here, we have accomplished chiral symmetry breaking from a racemate using optical vortices with orbital angular momentum and a helical wavefront. We propose a new methodology of asymmetric transformation by the combination of enantioselective crystal nucleation by irradiation with optical vortices and crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic optical resolution of conglomerate crystals. Chiral green vortices generated using a spiral phase plate (SPP) with a 532&#8197;nm CW&#8208;laser were used to irradiate a supersaturated solution of a racemic isoindolinone, leading to crystal nucleation. The handedness of the crystals were controlled by the winding direction of the chiral optical vortices. The molecular chirality of the isoindolinone was then amplified by dynamic crystallization.

         <title>Ferroelectric and Spin Crossover Behavior in a Cobalt(II) Compound Induced by Polar&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Substituent Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12717-12722, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by molecular ferroelectrics induced by molecular rotors, multifunctional compound exhibiting both ferroelectricity and spin crossover behavior was constructed. The flip&#8211;flop motion of polarization unit results in the expression of ferroelectricity and spin crossover behavior.







Abstract
Ferroelectric spin crossover (SCO) behavior is demonstrated to occur in the cobalt(II) complex, [Co(FPh&#8208;terpy)2](BPh4)2&#8901;3ac (1&#8901;3&#8201;ac; FPh&#8208;terpy=4&#8242;&#8208;((3&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethynyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine) and is dependent on the degree of 180&#176; flip&#8211;flop motion of the ligand's polar fluorophenyl ring. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures at several temperatures confirmed the flip&#8211;flop motion of fluorobenzene ring and also gave evidence for the SCO behavior with the latter behavior also confirmed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. The molecular motion of the fluorobenzene ring was also revealed using solid&#8208;state 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Thus the SCO behavior is accompanied by the flip&#8211;flop motion of the fluorobenzene ring, leading to destabilization of the low spin cobalt(II) state; with the magnitude of rotation able to be controlled by an electric field. This first example of spin&#8208;state conversion being dependent on the molecular motion of a ligand&#8208;appended fluorobenzene ring in a SCO cobalt(II) compound provides new insight for the design of a new category of molecule&#8208;based magnetoelectric materials.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Norzoanthamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12807-12812, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein an asymmetric total synthesis of norzoanthamine, a complex marine zoanthamine alkaloid, via radical and bio&#8208;inspired cyclizations comprising the following key steps: 1)&#8197;the Ueno&#8211;Stork radical cyclization; 2)&#8197;a unique Co&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction; 3)&#8197;a Mn&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction; and 4)&#8197;a one&#8208;pot bio&#8208;inspired bis&#8208;aminoacetalization.







Abstract
We report herein the asymmetric total synthesis of norzoanthamine using radical reactions as key steps for rapid access to the congested carbocyclic core, which is the major synthetic challenge for most zoanthamine alkaloids. (1)&#8197;The Ueno&#8211;Stork radical cyclization was applied to construct the adjacent quaternary centers at the C&#8208;9 and C&#8208;22 positions; (2)&#8197;a Co&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction was successfully applied to construct the quaternary center at C&#8208;12 via Csp3&#8208;Csp2 bond formation; (3)&#8197;a Mn&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction was used to stereospecifically reduce the tetra&#8208;substituted olefin (C13=C18) and install the contiguous stereocenters in proximity to the quaternary center. A one&#8208;pot bio&#8208;inspired cyclization step was finally applied to forge the unstable bis&#8208;amino acetal skeleton. Our approach can precisely control the stereochemistry of seven vicinal stereocenters and effectively construct the highly congested heptacyclic skeleton.

&lt;p&gt;We report herein an asymmetric total synthesis of norzoanthamine, a complex marine zoanthamine alkaloid, via radical and bio-inspired cyclizations comprising the following key steps: 1)&#8197;the Ueno&#8211;Stork radical cyclization; 2)&#8197;a unique Co-catalyzed HAT radical reaction; 3)&#8197;a Mn-catalyzed HAT radical reaction; and 4)&#8197;a one-pot bio-inspired bis-aminoacetalization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein the asymmetric total synthesis of norzoanthamine using radical reactions as key steps for rapid access to the congested carbocyclic core, which is the major synthetic challenge for most zoanthamine alkaloids. (1)&#8197;The Ueno&#8211;Stork radical cyclization was applied to construct the adjacent quaternary centers at the C-9 and C-22 positions; (2)&#8197;a Co-catalyzed HAT radical reaction was successfully applied to construct the quaternary center at C-12 via Csp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-Csp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bond formation; (3)&#8197;a Mn-catalyzed HAT radical reaction was used to stereospecifically reduce the tetra-substituted olefin (C13=C18) and install the contiguous stereocenters in proximity to the quaternary center. A one-pot bio-inspired cyclization step was finally applied to forge the unstable bis-amino acetal skeleton. Our approach can precisely control the stereochemistry of seven vicinal stereocenters and effectively construct the highly congested heptacyclic skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Controlling Oxygen Reduction Selectivity through Steric Effects: Electrocatalytic Two&#8208;Electron and Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction with Cobalt Porphyrin Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12742-12746, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt porphyrin atropisomers with similar electronic structures but dissimilar steric effects were synthesized. One isomer is selective for the 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR, one is selective for the 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR, while the other two show poor selectivity for either 2&#8201;e&#8722; or 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR.







Abstract
Achieving a selective 2&#8201;e&#8722; or 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical but challenging. Herein, we report controlling ORR selectivity of Co porphyrins by tuning only steric effects. We designed Co porphyrin 1 with meso&#8208;phenyls each bearing a bulky ortho&#8208;amido group. Due to the resulted steric hinderance, 1 has four atropisomers with similar electronic structures but dissimilar steric effects. Isomers &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946; and &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; catalyze ORR with n=2.10 and 3.75 (n is the electron number transferred per O2), respectively, but &#945;&#945;&#946;&#946; and &#945;&#945;&#945;&#946; show poor selectivity with n=2.89&#8211;3.10. Isomer &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946; catalyzes 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR by preventing a bimolecular O2 activation path, while &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; improves 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR selectivity by improving O2 binding at its pocket, a feature confirmed by spectroscopy methods, including O K&#8208;edge near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. This work represents an unparalleled example to improve 2&#8201;e&#8722; and 4&#8201;e&#8722; ORR by tuning only steric effects without changing molecular and electronic structures.

         <title>Enzymatic Assemblies of Thiophosphopeptides Instantly Target Golgi Apparatus and Selectively Kill Cancer Cells**
</title>

The rapid dephosphorylation of a thiophosphopeptide via the enzymatic reaction generates a self&#8208;assembling thiopeptide that can target and accumulate at the Golgi apparatus for imaging Golgi and inhibiting cancer cells. This result illustrates a novel molecular platform for modulating functions resulted from enzymatic noncovalent synthesis.







Abstract
Changing an oxygen atom of the phosphoester bond in phosphopeptides by a sulfur atom enables instantly targeting Golgi apparatus (GA) and selectively killing cancer cells by enzymatic self&#8208;assembly. Specifically, conjugating cysteamine S&#8208;phosphate to the C&#8208;terminal of a self&#8208;assembling peptide generates a thiophosphopeptide. Being a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the thiophosphopeptide undergoes rapid ALP&#8208;catalyzed dephosphorylation to form a thiopeptide that self&#8208;assembles. The thiophosphopeptide enters cells via caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and instantly accumulates in GA because of dephosphorylation and formation of disulfide bonds in Golgi by themselves and with Golgi proteins. Moreover, the thiophosphopeptide potently and selectively inhibits cancer cells (HeLa) with the IC50 (about 3&#8197;&#956;M), which is an order of magnitude more potent than that of the parent phosphopeptide.

         <title>A Terminal Imido Complex of an Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster</title>

         <dc:description>
The first terminal imido complex of an iron&#8211;sulfur cluster has been synthesized and fully characterized. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational analysis suggest an [Fe4S4]2+=[NAr]2&#8722; formulation with a localized high&#8208;spin Fe3+ valence at the imido&#8208;bound site, and reactivity studies demonstrate competence for C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of the first terminal imido complex of an Fe&#8211;S cluster, (IMes)3Fe4S4=NDipp (2; IMes=1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), which is generated by oxidative group transfer from DippN3 to the all&#8208;ferrous cluster (IMes)3Fe4S4(PPh3). This two&#8208;electron process is achieved by formal one&#8208;electron oxidation of the imido&#8208;bound Fe site and one&#8208;electron oxidation of two IMes&#8208;bound Fe sites. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies establish that the Fe&#8211;imido site is best described as a high&#8208;spin Fe3+ center, which is manifested in its long Fe&#8722;N(imido) distance of 1.763(2)&#8197;&#197;. Cluster 2 abstracts hydrogen atoms from 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene to yield the corresponding anilido complex, demonstrating competency for C&#8722;H activation.

2D MOFs on nickel foam (NF) were assembled. NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF exhibits superior OER performance (overpotential of 195&#8197;mV at 10 and 241&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under alkaline conditions. The ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52&#8197;eV (lower than NiFe double hydroxides: 0.81&#8197;eV).







Abstract
We report the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on nickel foam (NF) by assembling nickel chloride hexahydrate and 1,1&#8242;&#8208;ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF). The NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 195&#8197;mV and 241&#8197;mV at 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively under alkaline conditions. Electrochemical results demonstrate that the superb OER performance originates from the ferrocene units that serve as efficient electron transfer intermediates. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52&#8197;eV, which is lower than that (0.81&#8197;eV) of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NiFe double hydroxides.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12706-12711, June 1, 2021. </description>

Suitably decorated small aromatic systems can organize one&#8208;dimensionally stacked structures. We found that nanographenes carrying long alkyl chains behaved similarly. The experiments demonstrated that the nanographenes underwent aggregation and disaggregation regulated by concentration, solvent polarity, temperature, and sonication.







Abstract
Suitably decorated small aromatic systems can organize stacked structures that display interesting properties arising from their unique morphologies. Although nanographenes produced by top&#8208;down methods have graphitic domains and can in principle be applied for such supramolecular systems, to our knowledge, no such example has been reported thus far. This is partly because of their limited solubility in organic solvents and partly because of their wide lateral size distribution. To realize nanographene&#8208;based supramolecular aggregates, nanographenes carrying alkyl chains with narrow lateral size distributions are employed. We find that the nanographenes undergo self&#8208;assembly and that self&#8208;assembly is regulated by concentration, solvent polarity, temperature, and sonication. Optical measurements and AFM images indicate that stacked structures are possible candidates for aggregates. A molecular mechanics calculation models the interactions in the aggregates. The nanographenes showed concentration&#8208;dependent morphologies on mica, stacked structures at low concentrations and polymer&#8208;like network structures on mica at higher concentrations.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Hydrolysis En Route to Corroles with Increased Druglikeness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 23, Page 12829-12834, June 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corroles substituted with only two or three carboxylic acid groups were obtained from readily available starting materials through a novel pathway (see scheme). These macrocycles and the corresponding metal chelates fulfill all the criteria of druglikeness and have potential for both bioimaging and therapy.







Abstract
Heme&#8208;like metal&#8208;chelating macrocycles, including expanded and contracted porphyrins, are of everlasting interest as drug candidates for numerous diseases. Still, all reported corrole derivatives (and most other heme analogues) do not fulfill the most basic standards expected for oral drug administration: a combination of low molecular weight and reasonable water solubility. We now disclose a very straightforward synthetic method that relies on surprisingly facile trifluoromethyl hydrolysis for gaining access to a new class of corroles that do satisfy all druglikeness criteria. The relevance is briefly exemplified for the iron corroles by demonstrating the ability to affect their association with plasma proteins and their performance for catalase&#8208;like decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Insertion of Furyl Carbene into the N&#8208;H Bond of 2&#8208;Pyridones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric carbene insertion reactions represent one of the most important protocols to construct carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The use of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds bearing an ester group is however a prerequisite for achieving high enantioselectivity. Herein, we report a chemo&#8208; and enantioselective formal N&#8208;H insertion of 2&#8208;pyridones that has been accomplished for the first time with enynones as the donor&#8208;donor carbene precursors. DFT calculations indicate an unprecedented enantioselective 1,4&#8208;proton transfer from O to C. The rhodium catalyst provides a chiral pocket in which the steric repulsion and the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction of the propeller ligand play a critical role in determining the selectivities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we present a mild and efficient method for synthesizing enantioenriched tetrahydroquinoline&#8208;fused cyclobutenes through a cascade reaction between 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines and alkynones with catalysis by chiral spiro&#8208;bicyclic bisboranes. The bisboranes served two functions: first they catalyzed a hydride transfer to convert the 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline substrate to a 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline, and then they activated the alkynone substrate for an enantioselective [2+2] cycloaddition reaction with the 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinoline generated in situ.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The 1:2 reaction of [&#956;&#8208;(dmpm)Pt(nbe)]  2  (dmpm = bis(dimethylphosphino)methane, nbe = norbornene) with Cl  2  BNR(SiMe  3  ) (R =  t  Bu, SiMe  3  ) yields unsymmetrical (  N  &#8208;aminoboryl)aminoboryl Pt  I  2  complexes by B&#8208;N coupling via ClSiMe  3  elimination. A subsequent intramolecular ClSiMe  3  elimination from the  t  Bu&#8208;derivative leads to cyclization of the BNBN unit, forming a unique 1,3,2,4&#8208;diazadiboretidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl ligand. In contrast, the analogous reaction with Br  2  BN(SiMe  3  )  2  leads, via a twofold BrSiMe  3  elimination, to a Pt  II  2  A&#8208;frame complex bridged by a linear BNBN isostere of butatriene.

         <title>One&#8208;pot and Shape&#8208;controlled Synthesis of Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cages are fascinating synthetic goals because of their well&#8208;defined three&#8208;dimensional cavities, excellent stability and accessible post&#8208;modification. However, the synthesis is normally realized by fragment coupling approach in low yields. Herein, we report one&#8208;pot, gram&#8208;scale and shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of two covalent organic cages (box&#8208;shaped [4]cage and triangular prism&#8208;shaped [2]cage) in yields of 46% and 52%, involving direct condensation of triangular 1,3,5&#8208;tris(2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)benzene monomer with paraformaldehyde and isobutyraldehyde, respectively. The resulted cage can convert into high&#8208;yielding per&#8208;hydroxylated analogue which exhibits great potential for further modification. Moreover, [2]cage can be utilized as gas chromatographic stationary phase for high&#8208;resolution separation of benzene/cyclohexane and toluene/methylcyclohexane. By changing the central moiety of the triangular monomer and/or aldehyde, this synthetic method would have the potential to be a general strategy to access diverse cages with tunable shape, size, and electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Regulation on Solvation Shell and Electrode Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Ion Batteries: Achieved by a Low&#8208;Cost Glucose Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dendrite growth and by&#8208;products in Zn metal aqueous batteries have impeded their fast development as promising energy storage devices. We hereby utilize a low&#8208;cost additive, glucose, to modulate the typical ZnSO4  electrolyte system for improving reversible plating/stripping on Zn anode for high&#8208;performance Zn ion batteries (ZIBs). Combing experimental characterizations and theoretical calculation in scales ranging from atom&#8208;level (sub&#8208;nanometer) quantum chemistry calculation, molecule&#8208;level (nanometer) ab&#8208;initio calculation and molecular dynamics simulations to macro&#8208;level (micrometer) finite element analysis, we prove that the glucose in ZnSO4  aqueous environment can simultanously modulate solvation structure of Zn2+  and Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The electrolyte engineering is capable of alternating one H2O molecule from the primary Zn2+&#8208;6H2O solvation shell and restraining side reactions due to the decomposition of active water. Concomitantly, glucose molecules are inclined to absorb on the surface of Zn anode, suppressing the random growth of Zn dendrite. As a proof of concept, symmetric cell and Zn&#8208;MnO2  full cell with glucose electrolyte achieve boosted stability than that with pure ZnSO4  electrolyte. These results pave a way to excavate cheap and high&#8208;efficient electrolyte engineering strategy for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;based devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Induced Heterogenization of Nickel and Palladium Catalysts for Copolymerization of Ethylene with Polar Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical synthesis of polar&#8208;functionalized polyolefins via the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed copolymerization of olefins with polar monomers presents a great challenge. Despite the extensive academic research on homogeneous catalysts, the use of heterogeneous catalysts for this purpose remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of heterogeneous naphthoquinone&#8208;based nickel (Ni/SiO  2  ) and palladium (Pd/SiO  2  ) catalysts through hydrogen bonding interactions of the ligands with the silica surface. Ni/SiO  2  exhibits high activities (up to 2.65 &#215; 10  6  g&#183;mol  &#8722;1  &#183;h  &#8722;1  ) during the copolymerization of ethylene with 5&#8208;hexene&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;acetate,  affording high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (M  n  up to 630,000) polar&#8208;functionalized semicrystalline polyethylene (comonomer incorporation up to 2.8 mol%)  , along with great morphology control. The resulting copolymers possess improved surface properties and great mechanical properties. Pd/SiO  2  can mediate ethylene copolymerization with polar monomers such as methyl acrylate and norbornene derivatives with moderate activity (10  4  &#8211; 10  5  g&#183;mol  &#8722;1  &#183;h  &#8722;1  )  to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight copolymers (M  n  up to 98,000) with tunable comonomer incorporation (0.5&#8208;0.7% for methyl acrylate and 63.1&#8208;72.3% for 5&#8208;norbornen&#8208;2&#8208;yl acetate).</dc:description>

         <title>The Enantioselective Synthesis of Eburnamonine, Eucophylline, and 16&#8217;&#8208;epi&#8208;Leucophyllidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;A synthetic approach to the heterodimeric bisindole alkaloid leucophyllidine is disclosed herein. An enantioenriched lactam building block, synthesized through Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation, serves as the precursor to both hemispheres. The eburnamonine&#8208;derived fragment is synthesized through a Bischler&#8211;Napieralski/hydrogenation approach while the eucophylline&#8208;derived fragment is synthesized by a Friedl&#228;nder quinoline synthesis and two sequential C&#8208;H functionalization steps. A convergent Stille coupling and phenol&#8208;directed hydrogenation unite the two monomeric fragments affording 16&#8217;&#8208;epi leucophyllidine in 21 steps from commercial material.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction of Ketimines and Unactivated Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction represents one of the most efficient method for constructing chiral tetrahydropyridines. Nevertheless, the catalytic asymmetric aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of ketimines with unactivated dienes is still a challenging topic. Herein, guided by computational screening, a highly enantioselective aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3  H  &#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones with unactivated dienes was realized by using a B(C  6  F  5  )  3  /chiral phosphoric acid catalyst system under mild conditions. The reaction has a broad scope with respect to both aza&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction partners and hence offers rapid access to an array of tetrahydropyridine derivatives with pretty outcomes (up to 99% yield, &gt;20:1 dr and 98:2 er). Notely, the reaction is very efficient, in which the catalyst loadings for the model reaction can be reduced to 0.1 mol% and the enantioselectivity is still maintained. Besides, the synthetic utility of the protocol was proved by transformations of the products. Moreover, DFT calculations provide convincing evidence for the interpretation of stereoselection.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric  Alkenyl  Catellani Reaction for the Construction of C&#8211;N Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report an asymmetric two&#8208;component vinylogous Catellani reaction for the construction of C&#8211;N axial chirality through a palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis and an axial&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer process. Various partially aromatic iodinated 2&#8208;pyridones, quinolones, coumarin and uracil substrates  react with 2,6&#8208;disubstituted aryl bromides with a tethered amide group, to  afford a wide variety of polycyclic C&#8211;N atropisomers (39 examples, up to 97%  ee  ).  The obtained C&#8211;N axial chirality is originated from the preformed transient C&#8211;C axial chirality with high fidelity. The synthetic utility of this chemistry is demonstrated by facile preparation of  complex quinoline and pyridine based C&#8211;N atropisomers through a  N  &#8208;deprotection and aromatization sequence. In addition, a remote axial&#8208;to&#8208;central diastereoinduction process dictated by C&#8211;N axial chirality is observed with excellent diastereocontrol. This research opens a new avenue for asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Conductive Two&#8208;Dimensional Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic conversion of CO  2  into value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity is a promising approach to reduce atmospheric CO  2  concentration and realize carbon&#8208;energy balance. However, the low current density still limits CO  2  electroreduction reaction (CO  2  RR) for commercial application. Crystalline porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one class of promising alternatives for CO  2  RR due to their high CO  2  adsorption uptakes and periodically arranged isolated metal active sites. However, the poor conductivity and slow electron&#8208;transfer capability of the traditional MOFs usually result in low current density in CO  2  RR. Herein, conductive two&#8208;dimensional (2D) phthalocyanine&#8208;based MOF (NiPc&#8208;NiO  4  ) nanosheets were prepared by the construction of nickel phthalocyanin&#8208;2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octaol (NiPc&#8208;OH) and nickel(II) ions,   which can be   employed as highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO  2  RR towards production of CO. The obtained NiPc&#8208;NiO  4  has a good conductivity with a high value of   4.8   &#180;   10  &#8208;    5    S m  &#8208;1  due to the in&#8208;plane full &#960;&#8208;d conjugation. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared NiPc&#8208;NiO  4  nanosheets exhibited a very high selectivity of 98.4% towards production of CO and a large CO partial current density of 34.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  , outperform   ing   the reported MOF catalysts. This work offers an opportunity to design conductive crystalline frameworks for improving energy efficiency in electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Modified&#160;Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Films for Polarity&#8208;Selective Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D  c  &#8208;MOFs) are emerging as new&#8208;generation electroactive materials for chemiresistive sensors. However, selective sensing with fast response/recovery remains a challenge. Here, we report for the first time phthalocyanine&#8208;based Ni  2  [MPc(NH)  8  ] 2D  c  &#8208;MOF films as active layers for polarity&#8208;selective chemiresisitors toward water and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We demonstrate that surface&#8208;hydrophobic&#8208;modification&#160;by grafting aliphatic alkyl chains on 2D  c  &#8208;MOF films reduces the amount of diffused analytes into the MOF backbone, thus resulting in a considerably accelerated recovery progress (from ~ 50 to ~ 10 s) during humidity sensing. Toward VOCs, the sensors deliver a polarity&#8208;selective response among alcohols while no signal is recorded for the low&#8208;polar aprotic hydrocarbons. Typically, the octadecyltrimethoxysilane&#8208;modified&#160;Ni  2  [MPc(NH)  8  ] based sensor displays high&#8208;performance methanol sensing with fast response (36 s)/recovery (13 s) and a detection limit as low as 10 ppm, which surpass the reported chemiresistors based on MOFs, conducting polymers, metal disulfides, and black phosphorus at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradable Polymersomes with Structure Inherent Fluorescence and Targeting Capacity for Enhanced Photo&#8208;Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biodegradable nanostructures displaying aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) are desirable from a biomedical point of view, due to the advantageous features of loading capacity, emission brightness, and fluorescence stability. Herein, biodegradable polymers comprising poly (ethylene glycol)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(caprolactone&#8208;gradient&#8208;trimethylene carbonate) (PEG&#8208;P(CLgTMC)), with tetraphenylethylene pyridinium&#8208;TMC (PAIE) side chains have been developed, which self&#8208;assembled into well&#8208;defined polymersomes. The resultant AIEgenic polymersomes are intrinsically fluorescent delivery vehicles. The presence of the pyridinium moiety endows the polymersomes with mitochondrial targeting ability, which improves the efficiency of co&#8208;encapsulated photosensitizers and improves therapeutic index against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. This contribution showcases the ability to engineer AIEgenic polymersomes with structure inherent fluorescence and targeting capacity for enhanced photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Separation of Hexachloroplatinate(IV) Dianions Based on Exo&#8208;Binding with Cucurbit[6]uril</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since anions are vital for many chemical, biological and environmental processes, their recognition and separation continue to attract attention from chemists, materials scientists and engineers. Employing exo&#8208;binding of artificial macrocycles to recognize selectively anions remains a challenge in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we report the instantaneous co&#8208;crystallization and concomitant co&#8208;precipitation between hexachloroplatinate dianions and cucurbit[6]uril, a phenomenon&#160;which relies on the selective recognition of these dianions through the noncovalent bonding interactions on the outer surface of cucurbit[6]uril. The selective hexachloroplatinate&#160;dianion recognition is driven by the weak [Pt&#8208;Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C] hydrogen bonding and [Pt&#8208;Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O] ion&#8208;dipole interactions. The synthetic protocol is highly selective. It is not observed in combinations between cucurbit[6]uril and other Pt&#8208; and Pd&#8208; or Rh&#8208;based chloride anions. We have also demonstrated that cucurbit[6]uril is able to separate selectively hexachloroplatinate dianions from mixtures of hexachloroplatinate, tetrachloropalladate, and hexachlororhodate anions. This highly selective and fast co&#8208;crystallization process, in principle, could be exploited to recover platinum from the spent vehicular three&#8208;way catalytic converters and other platinum&#8208;bearing metal waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Efficacy of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors through Fluorine Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine atom(s) and/or fluoroalkyl group(s) insertion can lead to many beneficial effects in biologically active molecules, such as enhanced metabolic stability, bioavailability, lipophilicity, and membrane permeability, as well as a strengthening of protein ligand binding interactions. However, this &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of fluorine atom(s) insertion can sometimes be meaningless in most cases. Taking the opportunity of a wide range of data coming from the quest of carbonic anhydrase (CA) fluorinated inhibitors, this review attempts to give &#8220;general guidelines&#8221; how wisely insert fluorine atom(s) within an inhibitor moiety, in order to precisely enhance or disrupt ligand protein interactions, depending on the location the fluorine substitution is targeted on the ligand. Multiple approaches such as ITC, Kinetic and inhibition studies, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR are useful in dissecting single binding contribution to the overall observed effect. The exploitation of innovative directions made in the field of protein and ligand&#8208;based fluorine NMR screening is also discussed to avoid misconduct and finely tune the exploitation of the selective fluorine atom insertion in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralight Electrolyte for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high weight fraction of the electrolyte in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) full cell is the primary reason its specific energy is much below expectations. Thus far, it is still a challenge to reduce the electrolyte volume of Li&#8208;S batteries owing to their high cathode porosity and electrolyte depletion from the Li metal anode. Herein, we propose an ultralight electrolyte (0.83 g mL&#8722;1) by introducing a weakly&#8208;coordinating and Li&#8208;compatible monoether, which greatly reduces the weight fraction of electrolyte within the whole cell and also enables Li&#8208;S pouch cell functionality under lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions. Compared to Li&#8208;S batteries using conventional counterparts (~1.2 g mL&#8722;1), the Li&#8208;S pouch cells equipped with our ultralight electrolyte could achieve an ultralow electrolyte weight/capacity ratio (E/C) of 2.2 g Ah&#8722;1 and realize a 19.2% improvement in specific energy (from 329.9 to 393.4 Wh kg&#8722;1) under E/S =3.0 &#956;L mg&#8722;1. Moreover, more than 20% improvement in specific energy could be achieved using our ultralight electrolyte at various E/S ratios.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of SEI Formation by Anion Receptors to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite high specific capacity (3860 mAh g  &#8722;1  ), the utilization of Li&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable batteries are still hampered due to their insufficient cyclability. Herein, we report an anion&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated carbonate electrolyte with improved performance and can ameliorate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition comparing to the blank electrolyte. It demonstrates a high average Coulombic efficiency (97.94%) over 500 cycles in the Li/Cu cell at a capacity of 1 mAh cm  &#8722;2  . Raman spectrum and molecular modelling further clarify the screening effects of the anion receptor on the Li  +  &#8208;PF  6  &#8208;  ion coupling that results in the enhanced ion dynamics. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) distinguishes the disparities in the SEI components of the developed electrolyte and the blank one, which is rationalized by the molecular insights of the Li&#8208;metal/electrolyte interface. Thus, we prepare a 2.5 Ah prototype pouch cell, exhibiting a high energy density (357 Wh kg  &#8722;1  ) with 90.90% capacity retention over 50 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Allene&#8208;Containing Molecules via Enantioselective Reactions of Azolium Cumulenolate Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first carbene&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective addition involving cumulenolates is disclosed. Both allene and spirooxindole products could be accessed with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities by varying the amount of the base.







Abstract
Azolium cumulenolates are a special type of intermediates in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. They contain elongated linear structures with three contiguous C=C bonds and sterically unhindered &#945;&#8208;carbon atoms. These structural features make it difficult to develop enantioselective reactions for these intermediates. Here we disclose the first carbene&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective addition reactions of azolium cumulenolates. The reaction starts with alkynals as the precursors for azolium cumulenolate intermediates that undergo enantioselective addition to activated ketones. From the same set of substrates, both allene and spirooxindole products can be obtained with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The allene moieties in our optically enriched products carry rich reactivities and can be transformed to diverse molecules. The spirooxindole scaffolds in our products are important structural motifs in natural products and medicines.

         <title>Poly&#8208;Adenine&#8208;Based Spherical Nucleic Acids for Efficient Live&#8208;Cell MicroRNA Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PolyA&#8208;SNAs (poly&#8208;adenine&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids) exhibit high cell entry efficiency and programmable lateral spacing of anti&#8208;microRNA (miRNA) units, enabling efficient miRNA capture in living cells and mice. The in vivo inhibition of oncogenic miRNA results in potent suppression of tumor growth.







Abstract
Direct delivery of exogenous non&#8208;coding nucleic acids into living cells has attracted intense interest in biological applications. However, the cell entry efficiency and target capture ability remain to be improved. Herein, we report a method for compartmenting the nucleic acids on the surface of poly&#8208;adenine&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (polyA&#8208;SNAs) for efficient capture of oncogenic microRNAs (miRNAs) in living cells. We find that polyA&#8208;SNAs exhibit high cell entry efficiency, which is insensitive to the configuration of the anti&#8208;miRNA sequences. By programming the length of polyAs, we precisely engineered the spatial configuration of the anti&#8208;miRNA sequences in polyA&#8208;SNAs. Compartmentalized polyA&#8208;SNAs bind to miRNAs with improved capture ability as compared to densely compacted SNAs. We further demonstrate that polyA&#8208;SNAs serve as high&#8208;efficacy miRNA sponges for capturing oncogenic miRNAs both in living cells and in mice. The efficient inhibition of miRNAs results in significant suppression of tumor growth.

         <title>Directed Evolution of an Improved Aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetase for Incorporation of L&#8208;3,4&#8208;Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechols are capable of diverse interactions with metals, radical chemistry, the ability to form redox&#8208;mediated crosslinks, and play an important role in many biological polymers. Genetic tools are presented that enable site&#8208;specific incorporation of the catechol amino acid 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA) into proteins in bacteria, and a new DOPA&#8208;specific fluorescent biosensor for monitoring incorporation in living cells.







Abstract
The catechol group of 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA) derived from L&#8208;tyrosine oxidation is a key post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) in many protein biomaterials and has potential as a bioorthogonal handle for precision protein conjugation applications such as antibody&#8211;drug conjugates. Despite this potential, indiscriminate enzymatic modification of exposed tyrosine residues or complete replacement of tyrosine using auxotrophic hosts remains the preferred method of introducing the catechol moiety into proteins, which precludes many protein engineering applications. We have developed new orthogonal translation machinery to site&#8208;specifically incorporate L&#8208;DOPA into recombinant proteins and a new fluorescent biosensor to selectively monitor L&#8208;DOPA incorporation in vivo. We show simultaneous biosynthesis and incorporation of L&#8208;DOPA and apply this translation machinery to engineer a novel metalloprotein containing a DOPA&#8208;Fe chromophore.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Berkeleyone&#8197;A and Preaustinoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based upon the recognition of latent symmetry within D&#8208;ring, we accomplished the first enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone&#8197;A and its five preaustinoid congeners. Meanwhile, we also uncovered a series of biomimetic rearrangements that would lend credence to the proposed biosynthetic sequence of DMOA&#8208;derived meroterpenoids.







Abstract
Herein we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of 3,5&#8208;dimethylorsellinic acid&#8208;derived meroterpenoids (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone A and its five congeners ((&#8722;)&#8208;preaustinoids&#8197;A, A1, B, B1, and B2) in 12&#8211;15 steps, starting from commercially available 2,4,6&#8208;trihydroxybenzoic acid hydrate. Based upon the recognition of latent symmetry within D&#8208;ring, our convergent synthesis features two critical reactions: 1)&#8197;a symmetry&#8208;breaking, diastereoselective dearomative alkylation to assemble the entire carbon core, and 2)&#8197;a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;mediated sequential Krapcho dealkoxycarbonylation/carbonyl &#945;&#8208;tert&#8208;alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework. We also conducted our preliminary biomimetic investigations and uncovered a series of rearrangements (&#945;&#8208;ketol, &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketone, etc.) responsible for the biomimetic diversification of (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone&#8197;A into its five preaustinoid congeners.

Meanwhile, we also uncovered a series of biomimetic rearrangements that would lend credence to the proposed biosynthetic sequence of DMOA-derived meroterpenoids.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of 3,5-dimethylorsellinic acid-derived meroterpenoids (&#8722;)-berkeleyone A and its five congeners ((&#8722;)-preaustinoids&#8197;A, A1, B, B1, and B2) in 12&#8211;15 steps, starting from commercially available 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid hydrate. Based upon the recognition of latent symmetry within D-ring, our convergent synthesis features two critical reactions: 1)&#8197;a symmetry-breaking, diastereoselective dearomative alkylation to assemble the entire carbon core, and 2)&#8197;a Sc(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated sequential Krapcho dealkoxycarbonylation/carbonyl &#945;-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework. We also conducted our preliminary biomimetic investigations and uncovered a series of rearrangements (&#945;-ketol, &#945;-hydroxyl-&#946;-diketone, etc.) responsible for the biomimetic diversification of (&#8722;)-berkeleyone&#8197;A into its five preaustinoid congeners.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Dielectric Property and Energy Transfer on Charge Separation in Non&#8208;Fullerene&#8208;Based Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic effect of the higher dielectric property of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and corresponding photoactive films and the energy transfer from donor to acceptor on charge separation of selected non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices, these results well interpret the high device performance with a tiny driving force, and the intrinsic physical working mechanism on non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices is proposed.







Abstract
In non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices, it is unclear how excitons efficiently dissociate into charge carriers under small driving force. Here, we developed a modified method to estimate dielectric constants of PM6 donor and non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. Surprisingly, most non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and blend films showed higher dielectric constants. Moreover, they exhibited larger dielectric constants differences at the optical frequency. These results are likely bound to reduced exciton binding energy and bimolecular recombination. Besides, the overlap between the emission spectrum of donor and absorption spectra of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors allowed the energy transfer from donor to acceptors. Hence, based on the synergistic effect of dielectric property and energy transfer resulting in efficient charge separation, our finding paves an alternative path to elucidate the physical working mechanism in non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Confined Spaces in [n]Cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of [n]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylenes was synthesized. K&#8208;region functionalization of the pyrene moieties led to a confined space within those macrocycles. This confined space is especially pronounced for n=5 and resulted in a host&#8208;in&#8208;host binding with shape complementary alkaline crown ethers. A multifaceted approach combining computation, spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis elucidated the binding.







Abstract
A set of strained aromatic macrocycles based on [n]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;(4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrahydro)pyrenylenes is presented with size&#8208;dependent photophysical properties. The K&#8208;region of pyrene was functionalized with ethylene glycol groups to decorate the outer rim and thereby confine the space inside the macrocycle. This confined space is especially pronounced for n=5, which leads to an internal binding of up to 8.0&#215;104&#8197;m&#8722;1 between the ether&#8208;decorated [5]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylene and shape&#8208;complementary crown ether&#8211;cation complexes. Both the ether&#8208;decorated [n]cyclo&#8208;pyrenylenes as well as one of their host&#8211;guest complexes have been structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. In combination with computational methods the structural and thermodynamic reasons for the exceptionally strong binding have been elucidated. The presented rim confinement strategy makes cycloparaphenylenes an attractive supramolecular host family with a favorable, size&#8208;independent read&#8208;out signature and binding capabilities extending beyond fullerene guests.

         <title>Synthesis, Electronic Structure, and Reactivity of a Planar Four&#8208;Coordinate, Cobalt&#8211;Imido Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;coordinate, planar cobalt&#8211;imido compound was isolated and characterized. Integrated experimental and computational studies identified radical character on the iminyl nitrogen accounting for a reduction in overall bond order. Upon thermolysis, the complex underwent selective P&#8211;N coupling with the desymmetrized pincer. Transition state analysis revealed that thermodynamic control is the origin of the observed selectivity.







Abstract
A four&#8208;coordinate cobalt&#8211;imido complex, (tBumPNP)Co=NMes (tBumPNP=modified PNP pincer ligand) has been synthesized from addition of 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenylazide (Mes&#8211;N3) to the corresponding dinitrogen complex. The solid&#8208;state structure determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction established a rare, idealized planar geometry with a Co=N bond distance of 1.716(2)&#8197;&#197;. Magnetic measurements revealed an S=1 ground state with CAS&#8208;SCF calculations supporting radical character on the imide nitrogen. Thermolysis of the cobalt&#8211;imido compound induced selective insertion of the imido group into a Co&#8722;P bond and yielded a three&#8208;coordinate cobalt complex with a distorted T&#8208;shaped geometry. Transition state analysis conducted with DFT calculations established the thermodynamic stability of the P&#8211;N coupled product and provided insight into the exclusive selectivity.

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Generation in Dark&#8208;Hypoxia by Catalytic Microenvironment&#8208;Tailored Nanoreactors for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence&#8208;Monitored Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic microenvironment&#8208;tailored nanoreactors (CMTNs) with a built&#8208;in ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescent 1O2 sensor were fabricated for monitored chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Benefiting from the impermeability of liposomal lipid membrane to ions and glutathione (GSH), the liposome&#8208;based CMTNs afford favorable pH for MoO42&#8722;&#8208;catalyzed generation of 1O2 from H2O2 and protect MoO42&#8722; from GSH chelation&#8208;triggered inactivation.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) has a potent anticancer effect, but photosensitized generation of 1O2 is inhibited by tumor hypoxia and limited light penetration depth. Despite the potential of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) to circumvent these issues by exploration of 1O2&#8208;producing catalysts, engineering efficient CDT agents is still a formidable challenge since most catalysts require specific pH to function and become inactivated upon chelation by glutathione (GSH). Herein, we present a catalytic microenvironment&#8208;tailored nanoreactor (CMTN), constructed by encapsulating MoO42&#8722; catalyst and alkaline sodium carbonate within liposomes, which offers a favorable pH condition for MoO42&#8722;&#8208;catalyzed generation of 1O2 from H2O2 and protects MoO42&#8722; from GSH chelation owing to the impermeability of liposomal lipid membrane to ions and GSH. H2O2 and 1O2 can freely cross the liposomal membrane, allowing CMTN with a built&#8208;in NIR&#8208;II ratiometric fluorescent 1O2 sensor to achieve monitored tumor CDT.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Electric Directional Anisotropy in Polar Soft Ferromagnets of Two&#8208;Dimensional Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;electric (ME) correlation in two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D&#8208;OIHPs) is demonstrated with a polar soft ferromagnetic system for the first time. The polarity of 2D&#8208;OIHPs is found in the nonmagnetic organic layers and also in the magnetic inorganic layers, where the ME response should be induced. Reflecting the soft magnetic nature, the ME&#8208;response is achieved by a low magnetic field.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (2D&#8208;OIHPs) are attracting interest due to their structural tunability and rich functional characteristics, such as ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. Here, we report the chiral&#8208;polar ferromagnetic 2D&#8208;OIHP copper chlorides with discernable electric polarization in the inorganic layers. In these systems, the magneto&#8208;electric (ME) correlation has been clearly observed by measuring a magneto&#8208;electric directional anisotropy (MEA), in which an optical absorption coefficient changes with reversal of the light propagating direction. We have found that the MEA can be induced by a low magnetic field of about 50&#8197;mT, reflecting soft magnetic nature. The present results suggest a new paradigm for designing functional ME multiferroics, which effectively couples magnetic and electric properties.

         <title>Optimizing Charge Transfer and Out&#8208;Coupling of A Quasi&#8208;Planar Deep&#8208;Red TADF Emitter: towards Rec.2020 Gamut and External Quantum Efficiency beyond 30&#8201;%</title>

A deep&#8208;red TADF emitter pCNQ&#8211;TPA for UHD display was demonstrated, which realized the desired chromaticity matching rec.2020 standard and the record external quantum efficiency beyond 30&#8201;%. It is showed that its quasi&#8208;planar structure not only improves horizontal ratio of emitting dipole orientation for out&#8208;coupling enhancement, but also balances the intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer for radiation facilitation and quenching suppression.







Abstract
Herein, we report a deep&#8208;red TADF emitter pCNQ&#8211;TPA, composed of quinoxaline&#8208;5,8&#8208;dicarbonitrile (pCNQ) acceptor and triphenylamine (TPA) donor. pCNQ&#8211;TPA supported its OLED with desired CIE coordinates of (0.69, 0.31) and the record maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.3&#8201;%, which is the best red TADF diode with Rec.2020 gamut for UHDTV. It is showed that through tuning pCNQ&#8211;TPA doping concentration, intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer are balanced to synchronously improve emission color saturation and TADF radiation, and remedy aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, rendering photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) reaching 90&#8201;% for deep&#8208;red emission peaked at &#8776;690&#8197;nm. Quasi&#8208;planar structure further endows pCNQ&#8211;TPA with an improved horizontal ratio of emitting dipole orientation, which increases light out&#8208;coupling ratio to 0.34 for achieving the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device efficiencies.

         <title>Titanocene&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2] Cycloaddition of Bisenones and Comparison with Photoredox Catalysis and Established Methods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For [2+2] cycloaddition reactions of bisenones, higher yields and diastereoselectivities as well as greater substrate scope were observed under catalysis by Cp2Ti(TFA) than with previously established methods (see scheme). The mechanism is characterized by a highly unusual combination of an unfavorable and rate&#8208;determining 5&#8208;exo and favorable 4&#8208;exo cyclization, as established by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Cp2Ti(TFA) is a broadly applicable catalyst for the [2+2] cycloaddition of bisenones by inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer. The attractiveness of this mechanism is shown by comparison with outer&#8208;sphere ET methods. DFT calculations show that the reaction proceeds through a unique unfavorable 5&#8208;exo (the rate&#8208;determining step) and a favorable 4&#8208;exo cyclization.

         <title>A Supramolecular Complex of C60&#8211;S with High&#8208;Density Active Sites as a Cathode for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C60&#8211;S supramolecular complex with high&#8208;density active sites for the adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) was synthesized as a cathode material for Li&#8211;S batteries by a simple one&#8208;step process. All C60 molecules in the complex provide active sites to adsorb LiPSs (see picture). Under practical conditions with a high S loading and a low electrolyte/S ratio, a Li&#8211;S battery delivered a high capacity of 809&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (3.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
The well&#8208;known &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and low sulfur utilization hinder the practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, we describe a novel C60&#8211;S supramolecular complex with high&#8208;density active sites for LiPS adsorption that was formed by a simple one&#8208;step process as a cathode material for Li&#8211;S batteries. Benefiting from the cocrystal structure, 100&#8201;% of the C60 molecules in the complex can offer active sites to adsorb LiPSs and catalyze their conversion. Furthermore, the lithiated C60 cores promote internal ion transport inside the composite cathode. At a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1, the C60&#8211;S cathode with a sulfur loading of 4&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibited a high capacity of 809&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (3.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The development of the C60&#8211;S supramolecular complex will inspire the invention of a new family of S/fullerenes as cathodes for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries and extend the application of fullerenes.

         <title>In&#8197;Cellulo M&#246;ssbauer and EPR Studies Bring New Evidence to the Long&#8208;Standing Debate on Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster Binding in Human Anamorsin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined in&#8197;cellulo M&#246;ssbauer&#8208; and EPR&#8208;based approach is applied to address controversial aspects of Fe&#8211;S cluster&#8208;binding properties of human anamorsin, a protein involved in the biogenesis of cytosolic [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster&#8208;binding proteins. We show that human anamorsin binds two [2Fe&#8211;2S] clusters in&#8208;cell in two highly conserved cysteine&#8208;rich motifs typical of the eukaryotic CIAPIN1 protein family, with different electron&#8208;spin&#8208;relaxation properties.







Abstract
Human anamorsin is an iron&#8211;sulfur&#8201;(Fe&#8211;S)&#8208;cluster&#8208;binding protein acting as an electron donor in the early steps of cytosolic iron&#8211;sulfur protein biogenesis. Human anamorsin belongs to the eukaryotic CIAPIN1 protein family and contains two highly conserved cysteine&#8208;rich motifs, each binding an Fe&#8211;S cluster. In&#8197;vitro works by various groups have provided rather controversial results for the type of Fe&#8211;S clusters bound to the CIAPIN1 proteins. In order to unravel the knot on this topic, we used an in&#8197;cellulo approach combining M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopies to characterize the iron&#8211;sulfur&#8208;cluster&#8208;bound form of human anamorsin. We found that the protein binds two [2Fe&#8211;2S] clusters at both its cysteine&#8208;rich motifs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human anamorsin is an iron&#8211;sulfur&#8201;(Fe&#8211;S)-cluster-binding protein acting as an electron donor in the early steps of cytosolic iron&#8211;sulfur protein biogenesis. Human anamorsin belongs to the eukaryotic CIAPIN1 protein family and contains two highly conserved cysteine-rich motifs, each binding an Fe&#8211;S cluster. In&#8197;vitro works by various groups have provided rather controversial results for the type of Fe&#8211;S clusters bound to the CIAPIN1 proteins. In order to unravel the knot on this topic, we used an in&#8197;cellulo approach combining M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopies to characterize the iron&#8211;sulfur-cluster-bound form of human anamorsin. We found that the protein binds two [2Fe&#8211;2S] clusters at both its cysteine-rich motifs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The&#160;Role of Non&#8209;Covalent Interactions on Cluster Formation: Pentamer, Hexamers and Heptamer of Difluoromethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) has broadened with the inclusion of new types of interactions and&#160;a&#160;plethoraof weak donor/acceptor partners. This work illustrates the potential of chirped&#8209;pulse Fourier transform microwave technique, which has revolutionized the field of rotational spectroscopy. In particular, it has been exploited to reveal the role of NCIs&#8217; in the molecular self&#8209;aggregation of difluoromethane&#160;where&#160;a pentamer, two hexamers and a heptamer were detected.&#160;The development of a new automated assignment program and a sophisticated computational screening protocol was essential for identifying the homoclusters in conditions of spectral congestion.&#160;The major role of dispersion forces leads to less directional interactions and more distorted structures than those found in polar clusters although, a detailed analysis demonstrates that the dominant interaction energy is the pairwise interaction. The tetramer&#160;cluster is identified as a structural unit in larger clusters, representing the maximum expression of bond between dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Liposomes with Water as a pH&#8208;responsive Functionality for Targeting of Acidic Tumor and Infection Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many drug&#8208;loaded nanocarriers have been described that possess pH&#8208;responsive functionalities to allow self&#8208;targeting to acidic tumor or infection sites, based on charge reversal and electrostatic double&#8208;layer attraction with target cells. However, common pH&#8208;responsive functionalities usually change charge from negative at physiological pH to positive after relatively long exposure times to an acidic pH. Here a novel lipid, named DCPA was synthesized under microwave&#8208;assisted heating. DCPA possesses a pyridine betaine, hydrophilic group that can be complexed with water through hydrogen bonding (DCPA&#8208;H  2  O). DCPA&#8208;H  2  O liposomes became protonated relatively fast already at pH &lt; 6.8, due to the high HOMO binding energy of DCPA&#8208;H  2  O. In murine models, DCPA&#8208;H  2  O liposomes had longer blood circulation times than natural DPPC or cationic DCPM liposomes, while after tail&#8208;vein injection DCPA&#8208;H  2  O liposomes targeted faster to solid tumors and intra&#8208;abdominal infectious biofilms. Therapeutic efficacy in a murine, infected wound&#8208;healing model of tail&#8208;vein injected ciprofloxacin&#8208;loaded DCPA&#8208;H  2  O liposomes exceeded the ones of clinically applied ciprofloxacin as well as of ciprofloxacin&#8208;loaded DPPC or DCPM liposomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical synthesis of activity&#8208;based E2&#8208;ubiquitin probes for the structural analysis of E3 ligase&#8208;catalyzed transthiolation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activity&#8208;based E2 conjugating enzyme (E2)&#8208;ubiquitin (Ub) probes have recently emerged as effective tools for studying the molecular mechanism of E3 ligase (E3)&#8208;catalyzed ubiquitination. However, the preparation of existing activity&#8208;based E2&#8208;Ub probes depends on recombination technology and bioconjugation chemistry, limiting their structural diversity. Herein we describe an expedient total chemical synthesis of an E2 enzyme variant through a hydrazide&#8208;based native chemical ligation, which enabled the construction of a structurally new activity&#8208;based E2&#8208;Ub probe to covalently capture the catalytic site of Cys&#8208;dependent E3s. Chemical cross&#8208;linking coupled with mass spectrometry (CXMS) demonstrated the utility of this new probe in structural analysis of the intermediates formed during Nedd4 and Parkin&#8208;mediated transthiolation. This study exemplifies the utility of chemical protein synthesis for the development of protein probes for biological studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying structure&#8208;selectivity correlations in the electrochemical reduction of CO2: comparison of well&#8208;ordered atomically&#8208;clean and chemically&#8208;etched Cu single crystal surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite significant theoretical efforts, the identification of the active sites for the electrochemical reduction of CO  2  (CO  2  RR) to specific chemical products has remained elusive. This is partially due to insufficient experimental data gathered on clean and atomically well&#8208;ordered electrode surfaces. Here, ultrahigh vacuum based preparation methods and surface science characterization techniques are used together with gas chromatography to demonstrate that subtle changes in the preparation of well&#8208;oriented Cu(100) and Cu(111) single crystal surfaces drastically affect their CO  2  RR selectivity. Copper single crystals with clean, flat, and atomically ordered surfaces are theoretically predicted to yield hydrocarbons. However, these were found experimentally to favour the production of H  2  . Only when roughness and defects are introduced, for example through an electrochemical etching or a plasma treatment, significant amounts of hydrocarbons are generated. These results clearly indicate that structural and morphological effects are the key factors determining the catalytic selectivity of CO  2  RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Hydroamination of Push&#8208;Pull&#8208;Activated Linear Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bioorthogonal reaction between  N,N  &#8208;dialkylhydroxylamines and push&#8208;pull&#8208;activated halogenated alkynes is described. We explore the use of rehybridization effects in activating alkynes, and we show that electronic effects, when competing stereoelectronic and inductive factors are properly balanced, sufficiently activate a linear alkyne in the uncatalyzed conjugative retro&#8208;Cope elimination reaction while adequately protecting it against cellular nucleophiles. This design preserves the low steric profile of an alkyne and pairs it with a comparably unobtrusive hydroxylamine. The kinetics are on par with those of the fastest strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reactions, the products regioselectively formed, the components sufficiently stable and easily installed, and the reaction suitable for cellular labeling.</dc:description>

         <title>Biphasic Electrolyte Inhibiting the Shuttle Effect&#160;of Redox Molecules in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox molecules (RMs) as the electron carriers have been widely used in electrochemical energy storage devices (ESDs), such as lithium&#8208;redox flow batteries and lithium&#8208;O  2  &#160;batteries. Unfortunately,&#160;the migration of RMs to Li anode&#160;leads to the side reaction between them, resulting in the reduced coulombic efficiency and early cell death. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study that a biphasic organic electrolyte is constructed to settle down this issue, in&#160;which nonafluoro&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrahydrohexyl&#8208;trimethoxysilane&#160;(NFTOS) and ether (or sulfone) with LiTFSI can be separated to form the immiscible anolyte and catholyte. RMs are extracted to&#160;the catholyte&#160;due to the enormous solubility coefficients in the biphasic electrolyte with high and low polarity, resulting in the inhibition of shuttle effect. When coupling with lithium anode, the Li&#8208;Li symmetric, Li&#8208;redox flow and Li&#8208;O  2  &#160;batteries can achieve&#160;considerably prolonged cycle life with the biphasic electrolytes. This&#160;concept provides a promising strategy to suppress&#160;the shuttle effect of&#160;RMs in their wide application in ESDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Conformer&#8208;Induced Formation of&#160; Zirconium&#8208;Organic Framework&#160; for Methane Storage and MTO Product Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In pursuit of novel adsorbents with efficient adsorptive gas storage and separation capabilities remains highly desired and challenging. Although the documented zirconium&#8208;tricarboxylate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have displayed a variety of topologies encompassing underlying and geometry mismatch ones, the employed organic linkers are exclusively rigid and poorly presenting one type of conformation in the resultant structures. Herein, a used and semirigid tricarboxylate ligand of H3TATAB was judiciously selected to isolate a zirconium&#8208;based  spe&#8208;MOF after   the preliminary discovery of  srl&#8208;MOF. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the fully deprotonated TATAB linker in  spe&#8208;MOF exhibits two distinct conformers, concomitant with popular Oh  and rare S6  symmetrical Zr6  molecular building blocks, generating an unprecedented (3,3,12,12)&#8208;c nondefault topology. Specifically, the  spe&#8208;MOF exhibits structurally higher complexity, hierarchical micropores, open metal sites free and rich electronegative groups on the pore surfaces, leading to relatively high methane storage capacity without considering the missing&#8208;linker defects and efficient MTO product separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) for Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Has Anti&#8208;proliferative Activity in Lung Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is involved in protein&#8208;protein interactions that play key roles in inflammation and cancer. Current strategies to develop small molecule modulators of MIF functions are mainly restricted to MIF tautomerase active site. Here, we use this site to develop proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) in order to eliminate MIF from its protein&#8208;protein interaction network. We report the first potent MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC, denoted  MD13  , which induced almost complete MIF degradation at low micromolar concentrations with a DC  50  around 100 nM in A549.  MD13  suppresses the proliferation of A549 cells, which can be explained by deactivation of the MAPK pathway and subsequent induction of cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase.  MD13  also exhibits antiproliferative effect in a 3D tumor spheroid model. In conclusion, we describe the first MIF&#8208;directed PROTAC (  MD13  ) as a research tool, which also demonstrates the potential of PROTACs in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Reactive Oxygen Species Generation by Chiral Co3O4 Supraparticles under Electromagnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation and development of venous thromboembolism accounts for considerable morbidity and mortality.  One of the most common methods to treat thromboembolism is the use of thrombolytic drugs to activate fibrinolytic protease. The aim of this treatment was to initiate the lysis of fibrin; however, there are many side&#8208;effects associated with this form of treatment.  Herein, we fabricated chiral Co  3  O  4  supraparticles (SPs) with a  g  &#8208;factor of up to 0.02 at 550 nm and paramagnetic performance applied in the treatment of thromboembolism under an electromagnetic field (MF).  In vitro  experiments showed that  d  &#8208;SPs degraded blood clot within 8 hours under MF. Compared to  l  &#8208;SPs,  d  &#8208;SPs exhibited much stronger thrombolytic ability and effectively enhanced the survival rate of thrombosis model mice more than 70% in the 25 d of observation. The results of mechanism study showed that under MF, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by  d  &#8208;SPs were 1.5 times higher than that of  l  &#8208;SPs, which might be attributed to the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effects. This discovery paves an inspired pathway to develop chiral nanomaterials for the efficient treatment of thrombosis under MF.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Azaylide&#8208;Based Amphiphiles by Staudinger Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208; and regent&#8208;free reactions are powerful tools creating various functional molecules and materials. However, such chemical bonds are usually hydrolysable or require specific functional groups, which limits their use in aqueous media. Here we report that the development of new amphiphiles through the Staudinger reaction. Simple mixing of chlorinated aryl azide with a hydrophilic moiety and various triarylphosphines (  PAr3  ) gave rise to azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles  NPAr3  , rapidly and quantitatively. The obtained  NPAr3  formed  ca  . 2 nm&#8208;sized spherical aggregates (  NPAr3  )  n  in water. The hydrolysis of  NPAr3  was significantly suppressed as compared with those of non&#8208;chlorinated amphiphiles  nNPAr3  . Computational study revealed the stability is mainly governed by the LUMO modulation around phosphorus atom due to the  o  &#8208;substituted halogen groups. Furthermore, hydrophobic dyes such as Nile red and BODIPY were encapsulated by the spherical aggregates (  NPAr3  )  n  in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanine&#8208;Dyad Molecular Probe for Simultaneous Profiling of Multiple Radical Species Evolution in Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Real&#8208;time sensing the evolution of bacterial infection&#8208;associated multiple radical species is critical to accurately profile the pathogenesis and host&#8208;defense mechanisms, however, only a few currently existing techniques are capable of fully achieving the demanded accuracy in complex living conditions. Here, we present a unique dual wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) cyanine&#8208;dyad molecular probe (HCy5&#8208;Cy7) for simultaneous monitoring of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) variations both in vitro and in vivo. HCy5&#8208;Cy7 specifically turns on its fluorescence at 660 nm via superoxide or hydroxyl radical (O  2  &#8226;     &#8208;    , &#8226;OH)&#8208;mediated oxidation of reduced HCy5 moiety to Cy5, while peroxynitrite or hypochlorous species (ONOO  &#8208;  , ClO  &#8208;  )&#8208;induced Cy7 structural degradation causes the emission turn&#8208;off at 800 nm. Such multispectral but reverse signal responses allow multiplex manifestation of in situ oxidative and nitrosative stress events during the pathogenic and defensive processes in both bacteria&#8208;infected macrophage cells and living mice. Most importantly, this study may also provide new perspectives for understanding the bacterial pathogenesis and advancing the precision medicine against infectious diseases   .</dc:description>

         <title>Electrical Loss Management by Molecularly Manipulating Dopant&#8208;free Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) towards 16.93% CsPbI2Br Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites offer a pathway towards thermally stable photovoltaics. However, moisture&#8208;induced phase degradation restricts the application of hole transport layers (HTLs) with hygroscopic dopants. Dopant&#8208;free HTLs fail to realize efficient photovoltaics due to severe electrical loss. Herein, we developed an electrical loss management strategy by manipulating poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) with a small molecule, i.e., SMe&#8208;TATPyr. The developed P3HT/SMe&#8208;TATPyr HTL shows a three&#8208;time increase of carrier mobility owing to breaking the long&#8208;range ordering of &#8220;edge&#8208;on&#8221; P3HT and inducing the formation of &#8220;face&#8208;on&#8221; clusters, over 50% decrease of the perovskite surface defect density, and a reduced voltage loss at the perovskite/HTL interface because of favorable energy level alignment. The CsPbI  2  Br perovskite solar cell demonstrates a record&#8208;high efficiency of 16.93% for dopant&#8208;free HTL, and superior moisture and thermal stability by maintaining 96% efficiency at low&#8208;humidity condition (10%&#8208;25% R. H.) for 1500 hours and over 95% efficiency after annealing at 85  o  C for 1000 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Double ionic&#8208;electronic transfer interface layers for all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interface between electrode and solid electrolyte concerning the high resistance and poor stability as well as poor compatibility against the Li+ migration is impeding the large&#8208;scale employment of all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here, we report double ionic&#8208;electronic transfer interface layers at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces by in situ polymerization of 2, 2'&#8208;bithiophene in polyethylene oxide (PEO) electrolyte. For all solid&#8208;state LiFePO4||PT&#8208;PEO&#8208;PT||Li cells, the formation of conductive polythiophene (PT) layer at cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface resulted in at least 7&#8208;fold decrease in interface resistance, and realized capacity retention of about 94% after 1000 cycles along with lower polarization voltage under 2 C rate. The mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductive layers imparted superior interface stability and contact while keeping good compatibility with Li anode.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;driven Oxygen Vacancies Extends Charge Carrier Lifetime for Efficient Solar Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excessive surface oxygen vacancies would decrease the charge carrier lifetime and cause the serious recombination at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. In this context, a&#8220;photocharge/discharge&#8221;strategy exposure to AM 1.5G sunlight is proposed to initiate the WO  3  photoelectrode and suppress the main charge recombination, which remarkably improves the photoelectrochemical (PEC) perormance. The photocharged WO  3  surrounded by a 8&#8208;10 nm overlayer and oxygen vacancies could be operated more than 25 cycles with 50 h durability without significant decay on PEC activity. Further heterojuncted with the CuO, the photocharged WO  3  /CuO photpanode exhibits an outstanding photocurrent of 3.2 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.23 V  RHE  with a low onset potential of 0.6 V  RHE  , which is one of the best performance of  p&#8208;n  heterojunction structure. Importantly, using the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics combined with time&#8208;domain density functional theory, we clarify the prolonged charge carrier lifetime of photocharged WO  3  , as well as how electronic systems of photocharged WO  3  /CuO semiconductors enable the effective photoinduced electrons transfer from WO  3  into CuO. This work provides a feasible route to address excessive defects existed &#160;in photoelectrodes whilst without causing the extra recombination, further enhancing the carrier lifetime and boosting PEC water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Clinical Technologies for Hyperpolarized Xenon&#8208;129 MRI and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarization is a technique that can increase nuclear spin polarization with the corresponding gains in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal by 4&#8208;8 orders of magnitude. By applying this process to biologically relevant samples, they can be used as exogenous MRI contrast agents. A technique called Spin Exchange Optical Pumping (SEOP) can be applied to hyperpolarize noble gases such as 129Xe. Hyperpolarized 129Xe is poised to revolutionize clinical lung imaging, offering a non&#8208;ionizing, high contrast alternative to CT imaging and conventional proton MRI. Moreover, CT and conventional proton MRI report on lung tissue structure but provide no functional information although substantial progress has been made recently using ultrashort (UTE) TE MRI to obtain surrogate ventilation metrics. On the other hand, by breathing hyperpolarized 129Xe gas, strong MRI signal can be obtained to produce functional lung images reporting on lung ventilation, perfusion and diffusion with 3D readout in seconds. In this Review, the physics of SEOP is discussed and the different production modalities are explained in the context of their clinical application. We also briefly compare SEOP to other hyperpolarization methods and conclude this paper with the biomedical outlook for hyperpolarized 129Xe applications to lung imaging and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Particle&#8208;by&#8208;particle in situ characterization of the protein corona via real&#8208;time 3D single&#8208;particle tracking spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles (NPs) adsorb proteins when exposed to biological fluids, forming a dynamic protein corona that affects their fate in biological environments. A comprehensive understanding of the protein corona is lacking due to the inability of current techniques to precisely measure the full corona in situ at the single particle level. Herein, we introduce a 3D real&#8208;time single&#8208;particle tracking spectroscopy to "lock&#8208;on" to single freely diffusing polystyrene NPs and probe their individual protein coronas, primarily using bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions as a model system. The fluorescence signals and diffusive motions of the tracked NPs enable quantification of the "hard corona" using mean&#8208;squared displacement analysis. Critically, this method's particle&#8208;by&#8208;particle nature enabled a lock&#8208;in&#8208;type frequency filtering approach to extract the full protein corona, despite the typically confounding effect of high background signal from unbound proteins. From these results, the dynamic in situ full protein corona is observed to contain double the number of proteins than are observed in the ex situ measured "hard" protein corona.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The selective N&#8208;arylation of p&#8208;aminophenylalanine in polypeptides with pre&#8208;formed palladium oxidative addition complexes is described. The depressed pKa of the aniline NH2 group enables chemoselective C&#8722;N bond formation on peptides containing multiple other aliphatic amino groups at lysines or the N&#8208;terminus via Curtin&#8208;Hammett control under mild conditions. Using palladium complexes derived from electron&#8208;poor aryl halides, p&#8208;aminophenylalanine is fully arylated in aqueous buffer in as little as one hour at micromolar concentrations. A complementary protocol using the non&#8208;nucleophilic, organic base 1,5&#8208;diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non&#8208;5&#8208;ene (DBN), expands the substrate scope to tolerate electron&#8208;rich functional groups provides up to 97% conversion.

         <title>Discovery of First Magnesium Fluorooxoborate with Stable Fluorine Terminated Framework for Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first magnesium fluorooxoborate MgB5O7F3 was synthesized as a new competitive candidate for deep&#8208;UV NLO application. More importantly, we demonstrated that fluorooxoborate system with the general formula of MB5O7F3 (M=divalent metal) possesses stable fluorine terminated framework, which makes them tend to retain their crystallized space groups unchanged.







Abstract
The generated light can be tuned to cover almost the entire spectral range from deep&#8208;ultraviolet to terahertz wavelengths by utilizing the nonlinear optical crystals with a simple frequency doubling process. Among them, the discovery of novel candidates for the production of deep&#8208;ultraviolet light is by extension a great challenge toward realizing the vast potential. Actually, the availability for this process mainly depends on whether the critical performance can be well coexisted in one practical crystal. Herein, the first magnesium fluorooxoborate MgB5O7F3 was synthesized as a new competitive candidate for deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical application. It has a sufficiently large nonlinearity and a deep&#8208;ultraviolet phase matching wavelength, indicating that it holds great potential for the production of coherent light below 200&#8197;nm. The critical performance enhancement of MgB5O7F3 when compared with its isomorphic phases was demonstrated and discussed. More importantly, we proposed that fluorooxoborate system with the general formula of MB5O7F3 (M=divalent metal) possesses stable fluorine terminated framework, which makes them tend to retain their crystallized space groups unchanged.

Cu(ts) both ways: Carbene&#8208;supported copper&#8208;alumanyl complexes, [LCu&#8208;Al(SiNDipp)], display divergent reactivity with carbodiimides and CO2, implying an ambiphilicity in the Cu&#8211;Al interaction that is dependent on the identity of the carbene co&#8208;ligand.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;alumanyl complexes, [LCu&#8208;Al(SiNDipp)], where L=carbene=NHCiPr (N,N&#8242;&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and Me2CAAC (1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and featuring unsupported Al&#8722;Cu bonds, have been prepared. Divergent reactivity observed with carbodiimides and CO2 implies an ambiphilicity in the Cu&#8211;Al interaction that is dependent on the identity of the carbene co&#8208;ligand.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electro&#8208;reforming of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural on Vertically Oriented Nickel Nanosheet/Carbon Hybrid Catalysts: Structure&#8211;Function Relationships</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and stable electro&#8208;reforming of HMF into FDCA on a Ni nanosheet/carbon paper electrode is achieved at a potential of 1.36&#8197;VRHE with 99.7&#8201;% conversion. A precursor&#8208;limiting electrodeposition method creates a unique Ni nanosheet forest structure with vastly different physical appearance and catalytic activity comparing with conventional Ni catalysts.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;promoted electrocatalytic biomass reforming has shown promising prospect in enabling high value&#8208;added product synthesis. Here, we developed a novel hybrid catalyst with Ni nanosheet forests anchored on carbon paper. The hybrid catalyst exhibits high efficiency in electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA coupling with H2 production in high purity. The Ni nanosheets have small crystal grain sizes with abundant edges, which is able to deliver an efficient HMF oxidation to FDCA (selectivity &gt;99&#8201;%) at low potential of 1.36&#8197;VRHE with high stability. The post&#8208;reaction structure analysis reveals the Ni nanosheets would transfer electrons to carbon and readily turn into NiOx and Ni(OH)x during the reaction. DFT results suggest high valence Ni species would facilitate the chemical adsorption (activation) of HMF revealing the reaction pathway. This work emphasizes the importance of the precise control of Ni activity via atomic structure engineering.

         <title>Heterometallic Coinage Metal Acetylenediide Clusters Showing Tailored Thermochromic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of heterometallic coinage metal acetylenediide clusters (C2)3&#8208;Au6AgM6 (M=Ag/Cu) were prepared via a heterometallic precursor approach. They are isostructural but display different thermochromic luminescence. The replacement of silver with copper changes the HOMO character to induce dual&#8208;emission in (C2)3&#8208;Au6AgCu6, and this dual&#8208;emission is associated from two emissive states favored at different temperatures.







Abstract
Acetelyenediide (C22&#8722;) species have been encapsulated in bimetallic and trimetallic clusters: [(AuL)6Ag7(C&#8801;C)3](BF4)7 (2) and [(AuL)6AgCu6(C&#8801;C)3](BF4)7 (3), L=phenylbis(2&#8208;pyridyl)phosphine (PPhpy2). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that they are isostructural and six silver atoms in 2 are replaced with copper in 3. Both clusters have a trefoil skeleton, which can be viewed as three trigonal bipyramidal (LAu&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;AuL)M2Ag (M=Ag/Cu) motifs sharing a common silver atom. TDDFT calculations showed Cu&#8208;doping significantly increases the energy level of (C2&#8208;Cu)&#8208;involved occupied orbital, thus inducing interesting transition coupling of dual&#8208;emission at low temperature. This work not only provides a strategy for constructing heterometallic clusters, but also shows the prospect for pursuing novel thermochromic luminescent materials by incorporating multi&#8208;congeneric metal components.

         <title>Enhancing Rechargeable Persistent Luminescence via Organic Dye Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple dye&#8208;sensitization strategy was discovered to boost the rechargeable persistent luminescence performance of the persistent luminescence nanoparticles. The dye sensitized nanoparticles are used for PersL imaging guided tumorectomy. They provide simultaneous enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;background afterglow intraoperative anatomic tumor navigation and simple microscopic fluorescent cellular imaging.







Abstract
Owing to their unique afterglow ability, long&#8208;wavelength light activatable persistent luminescence (PersL) nanoparticles (PLNPs) have been emerging as an important category of imaging probes. Long&#8208;wavelength LED light has been shown to be effective in recharging these nanoparticles. However, finding a simple and effective method to amplify such renewable PersL signals under long&#8208;wavelength light is still a key challenge. Herein, we discovered that a dye&#8208;sensitization strategy was able to effectively boost the renewable PersL signals of the NIR emitting ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ (ZGC)) under long&#8208;wavelength LED light. Moreover, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle tumorectomy demonstration, this new class of dye sensitized ZGC enabled simultaneous intraoperative anatomic tumor navigation and effective microscopic detection of tumor cells in pathological diagnosis.

         <title>Synthetic Zippers as an Enabling Tool for Engineering of Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are the origin of a wide range of natural products, including many clinically used drugs. Efficient engineering of these often&#8208;giant biosynthetic machineries to produce novel non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) is an ongoing challenge. Here we describe a cloning and co&#8208;expression strategy to functionally combine NRPS fragments of Gram&#8208;negative and &#8208;positive origin, synthesising novel peptides at titres up to 220 mg l  &#8208;1  . Extending from the recently introduced definition of e  X  change&#160;  U  nits (XUs),&#160;we inserted synthetic zippers (SZs) to split single protein NRPSs into independently expressed and translated polypeptide chains. These synthetic type of NRPS (type S) enables easier access to engineering, overcomes cloning limitations, and provides a simple and rapid approach to building peptide libraries via the combination of different NRPS subunits.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are the origin of a wide range of natural products, including many clinically used drugs.

         <title>A family of superhelicenes &#8211; Easily tunable, chiral nanographenes by merging helicity with planar &#960;&#8208;systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating helicity into large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitutes a new field of research at the interface between chemistry and material sciences. Lately, interest in the design of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes has surged. This new class of twisted, chiral nanographenes not only reveals unique characteristics but also finds its way into emerging applications such as spintronics. Insights into their structure&#8208;property relationships and on&#8208;demand tuning are scarce. To close these knowledge gaps, we designed a straightforward synthetic route towards a full&#8208;fledged family of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes: superhelicenes. Common are two hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) connected via a central 5&#8208;membered ring. By means of structurally altering this 5&#8208;membered ring, we realized a versatile library of molecular building blocks. Not only the superhelicene structure, but also their features are tuned with ease. In&#8208;depth physico&#8208;chemical characterizations served as a proof of concept thereof. The superhelicene enantiomers were separated, their circular dichroism was measured in preliminary studies and concluded with an enantiomeric assignment. Our work was rounded&#8208;off by crystal structure analyses. Mixed stacks of M&#8208; and P&#8208;isomers led to twisted molecular wires. Using such stacks, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities were calculated, giving reason to expect outstanding hole transporting properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Sanglifehrin A and B and Analogs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sanglifehrin A and B are immunosuppressive macrocyclic natural products endowed with and differentiated by a unique spirocyclic lactam. Here, we report an enantioselective total synthesis and biological evaluation of sanglifehrin A and B and analogs. Access to the spirocyclic lactam was achieved via convergent assembly of a key pyranone intermediate followed by a stereo&#8208;controlled spirocyclization. The 22&#8208;membered macrocyclic core was synthesized by ring&#8208;closing metathesis in the presence of 2,6&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl) benzeneboronic acid (BFBB). The spirocyclic lactam and macrocycle fragments were united by a Stille coupling to furnish sanglifehrin A and B. Additional sanglifehrin B analogs with variation at the C40 position were additionally prepared. Biological evaluation revealed that the 2&#8208;CF3 analog of sanglifehrin B exhibited higher anti&#8208;proliferative activity than the natural products sanglifehrin A and B in Jurkat cells. Both natural products induced higher&#8208;order homodimerization of cyclophilin A (CypA), but only sanglifehrin A promoted CypA complexation with inosine&#8208;5'&#8208;monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2). The synthesis reported here will enable further evaluation of the spirolactam and its contribution to sanglifehrin&#8208;dependent immunosuppressive activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing Visible Light in Low&#8208;bandgap C4N Derived Responsive Bifunctional Air Electrodes for Solar Energy Conversion/Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report facile synthesis and multiple inherent properties of low&#8208;bandgap mesoporous C  4  N particles and showcase its previously&#8208;unexplored use as universal responsive bifunctional oxygen catalysts for constructing visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive (VLS) rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (RZAB) and polymer&#8208;air battery (RPAB) towards solar energy conversion/storage. Compared to widely&#8208;studied g&#8208;C  3  N  4  , as&#8208;obtained C  4  N shows a smaller bandgap of 1.99 eV with larger photocurrent response and can function simultaneously as visible&#8208;light&#8208;harvesting antenna and bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution (ORR/OER) catalyst, enabling effective photo&#8208;coupling to tune oxygen catalysis. In addition to good energy storage performance, the C  4  N&#8208;enabled VLS&#8208;RZAB displays a low charge voltage of 1.35 V under visible light &#8211; below the theoretical RZAB voltage of 1.65 V, corresponding to a high energy efficiency of 97.78 %. Pairing C  4  N cathode with polymer anode also endows an entirely&#8208;new all&#8208;polymer VLS&#8208;RPAB with light&#8208;boosted charge performance, implying the generality of our strategy. Combined theoretical and experimental studies unveil that the ORR and OER active sites in C  4  N are separate carbon sites near pyrazine&#8208;nitrogen atoms and photo&#8208;generated energetic holes can activate OER for improved reaction kinetics. This study not only highlights a rarely&#8208;explored carbon nitride polymer and its new property and application but also opens new opportunities to develop organic semiconductors for photo&#8208;coupled rechargeable batteries towards solar energy utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Interactions in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Isoreticular Series for Molecular Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to improve homogeneous molecular catalyst stability, efficiency, and selectivity is immobilization on supporting surfaces or within host matrices. Here, we examine the immobilization of CO2  reduction catalyst [ReBr(CO)3(4,4&#8217;&#8208;dcbpy)] and photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)2(5,5&#8217;&#8208;dcbpy)]Cl2  using the isoreticular series of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) UiO&#8208;66, &#8208;67, and &#8208;68. Specific host pore size choice enables distinct catalyst and photosensitizer spatial location &#8211; either at the outer MOF particle surface or inside the MOF cavities &#8211; affecting catalyst stability, electronic communication between reaction centre and photosensitizer, and consequently the apparent catalytic rates. These results allow for a rational understanding of optimized supramolecular layout of catalyst, photosensitizer, and host matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled peptide nano&#8208;superstructure towards enzyme mimicking hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural arrangement of amino acid residues in native enzymes underlies their remarkable catalytic properties, thus providing a notable point of reference for designing potent yet simple biomimetic catalysts. Herein, we describe a minimalistic approach to construct a dipeptide&#8208;based nano&#8208;superstructure with enzyme&#8208;like activity. The self&#8208;assembled biocatalyst comprises one peptide as a single building block, readily synthesized from histidine. Through coordination with zinc ion, the peptide self&#8208;assembly procedure allows the formation of supramolecular &#946;&#8208;sheet ordered nanocrystals, which can be used as basic units to further construct higher&#8208;order superstructure. As a result, remarkable hydrolysis activity and enduring stability are demonstrated. Our work exemplifies the use of a bioinspired supramolecular assembly approach to develop next&#8208;generation biocatalysts for biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterocycle/Heteroallene Ring Opening Copolymerisation: Selective Catalysis Delivering Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom containing polymers have strong potential as sustainable replacements for petrochemicals, show controllable monomer&#8208;polymer equilibria and properties spanning plastics, elastomers, fibres, resins, foams, coatings, adhesives and self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. Their current and future applications span packaging, house&#8208;hold goods, clothing, automotive components, electronics, optical materials, sensors and medical products. An interesting route to these polymers is the catalysed ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation (ROCOP) of heterocycles and heteroallenes. It is a living polymerization, occurs with high atom economy and creates precise, new polymer structures inaccessible by traditional methods. In the last decade there has been renaissance in research and increasing examples of commercial products made using ROCOP. It is better known in the production of polycarbonates and polyesters but is also a powerful route to make N&#8208;, S&#8208; and other heteroatom containing polymers, including polyamides, polycarbamates, polythioesters and others.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heteroatom containing polymers have strong potential as sustainable replacements for petrochemicals, show controllable monomer-polymer equilibria and properties spanning plastics, elastomers, fibres, resins, foams, coatings, adhesives and self-assembled nanostructures. Their current and future applications span packaging, house-hold goods, clothing, automotive components, electronics, optical materials, sensors and medical products. An interesting route to these polymers is the catalysed ring-opening copolymerisation (ROCOP) of heterocycles and heteroallenes. It is a living polymerization, occurs with high atom economy and creates precise, new polymer structures inaccessible by traditional methods. In the last decade there has been renaissance in research and increasing examples of commercial products made using ROCOP. It is better known in the production of polycarbonates and polyesters but is also a powerful route to make N-, S- and other heteroatom containing polymers, including polyamides, polycarbamates, polythioesters and others. This review presents an overview of the different catalysts, monomer combinations and polymer classes accessed by heterocycle/heteroallene ROCOP. It aims to provide a guide for users both to the catalysis and the resulting materials properties as well as highlighting opportunities for future research and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Loading linear arrays of Cu(II) inside aromatic amide helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The very stable helices of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid oligoamides are shown to uptake Cu(II) ions in their cavity through deprotonation of their amide functions with minimal alteration of their shape, unlike most metallo&#8208;organic structures which generally much differ from their organic precursors. The outcome is the formation of intramolecular linear arrays of a defined number of Cu(II) centers (up to sixteen in this study) at a 3 &#197; distance, forming a molecular mimic of a metal wire completely surrounded by an organic sheath. The helices pack in the solid state so that the arrays of Cu(II) extend intermolecularly. Conductive&#8208;AFM and cyclic voltammetry suggest that electrons are transported throughout the metal&#8208;loaded helices in contrast with hole transport observed for analogous foldamers devoid of metal ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Decarbonylative Iodination of Aryl Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Ligand&#8208;Assisted Halide Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an efficient and broadly applicable palladium&#8208;catalyzed iodination of inexpensive and abundant aryl and vinyl carboxylic acids via  in situ  activation to the acid chloride and formation of a phosphonium salt. The use of 1&#8208;iodobutane as iodide source in combination with a base and a deoxychlorinating reagent gives access to a wide range of aryl and vinyl iodides under Pd/Xantphos catalysis, including complex drug&#8208;like scaffolds. Stoichiometric experiments and kinetic analysis suggest a unique mechanism involving C&#8211;P reductive elimination to form the Xantphos phosphonium chloride which subsequently initiates an unusual halogen exchange by outer sphere nucleophilic substitution.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Switchable Catalysis for One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Cyclic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the temporal/spatial control over reactions, switchable catalysis is emerging as a powerful tool to regulate polymer sequence and architecture directly from monomer mixtures.  Herein,  a cobalt salen pentenoate complex [salen = (  R,R  )&#8208;  N,N&#8242;  &#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutylsalicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine  ] is rationally designed as the catalyst for the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides/anhydrides/CO  2  . Via the migratory insertion of carbon monoxide (CO) into the Co&#8208;O bonds, the ROCOP active species  &#945;  &#8208;alkene&#8208;  &#969;  &#8208;O&#8208;Co  III  (salen) can be rapidly and quantitatively transformed into  &#945;  &#8208;alkene&#8208;  &#969;  &#8208;O  2  C&#8208;Co  III  (salen) telechelic linear precursors. Upon dilution of reaction mixtures, the homolytic cleavage of Co&#8208;C bonds induced by visible light generates  &#945;  &#8208;alkene acyl radicals that spontaneously undergo intramolecular radical addition to afford organocobalt functionalized cyclic polyesters and CO  2  &#8208;based polycarbonates with excellent regioselectivity. The cyclic products can either react with radical scavengers to generate metal&#8208;free cyclic polymers or serve as the photo initiators for  organometallic mediated radical polymerization (OMRP)  to produce tadpole&#8208;shaped copolymers. This work opens a new avenue for the direct synthesis of cyclic polymers from monomer mixtures via switchable catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of Magnesium&#8208;Doped Lithium Metal Anode for High Performance Lithium Metal Batteries through Modeling and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li)&#8208;magnesium (Mg) alloy with limited Mg amount, which can also be called Mg&#8208;doped Li (Li&#8208;Mg), has been considered as a potential alternative anode for high energy density rechargeable Li metal batteries. However, the optimum doping&#8208;content of Mg in Li&#8208;Mg anode and the mechanism of the improved performance are not well understood. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the effect of Mg amount in Li&#8208;Mg anode. The Li&#8208;Mg with about 5 wt.% Mg (abbreviated as Li&#8208;Mg5) has the lowest absorption energy of Li, thus all the surface area can be &#8220;controlled&#8221; by Mg atoms, leading to the smooth and continuous deposition of Li on the surface around the Mg center. A localized high concentration electrolyte enables Li&#8208;Mg5 to exhibit the best cycling stability in Li metal batteries with high&#8208;loading cathode and lean electrolyte under 4.4 V high&#8208;voltage, which is approaching the demand of practical application. This electrolyte also helps generate an inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, which leads to smooth, compact and less corrosion layer on the Li&#8208;Mg5 surface. Both theoretical simulations and experimental results prove that Li&#8208;Mg5 has optimum Mg content and gives best battery cycling performance. This work also provides an effective approach to identify optimal alloy&#8208;type Li metal anodes for improving long&#8208;term cycling stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene/Carboxylic Acid Co&#8208;Catalysis Enables Oxidative Esterification of Demanding Aldehydes/Enals,

at Low Catalyst Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the discovery that simple carboxylic acids, such as benzoic acid, boost the activity of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts in the oxidative esterification of aldehydes. A simple and efficient protocol for the transformation of a wide range of sterically hindered alpha&#8208; and beta&#8208;substituted aliphatic aldehydes/enals, catalyzed by a novel and readily accessible N&#8208;Mes&#8208;/N&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salt, and benzoic acid as co&#8208;catalyst, was developed. A whole series of a/b&#8208;substituted aliphatic aldehydes/enals hitherto not amenable to NHC&#8208;catalyzed esterification could be reacted at typical catalyst loadings of 0.02 &#8208; 1.0 mol %. For benzaldehyde, even 0.005 mol % of NHC catalyst proved sufficient &#8208; the lowest value ever achieved in NHC catalysis. Preliminary studies point to carbox&#173;ylic acid&#8208;induced acceleration of acyl transfer from azolium enolate intermediates as the mechanistic basis of the observed effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Human Oxygenase Variants Employing a Single Protein FeII Ligand Are Catalytically Active</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A human 2&#8208;oxoglutarate and FeII dependent oxygenase was engineered to possess only one protein FeII binding ligand. The resultant variants retained significant levels of catalytic activity. Biomimetic catalysts containing only one metal binding site are therefore of interest.







Abstract
Aspartate/asparagine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxylase (AspH) is a human 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) and FeII oxygenase that catalyses C3 hydroxylations of aspartate/asparagine residues of epidermal growth factor&#8208;like domains (EGFDs). Unusually, AspH employs two histidine residues to chelate FeII rather than the typical triad of two histidine and one glutamate/aspartate residue. We report kinetic, inhibition, and crystallographic studies concerning human AspH variants in which either of its FeII binding histidine residues are substituted for alanine. Both the H725A and, in particular, the H679A AspH variants retain substantial catalytic activity. Crystal structures clearly reveal metal&#8208;ligation by only a single protein histidine ligand. The results have implications for the functional assignment of 2OG oxygenases and for the design of non&#8208;protein biomimetic catalysts.

         <title>Semiconductor Bow&#8208;Tie Nanoantenna from Coupled Colloidal Quantum Dot Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective tip&#8208;to&#8208;tip fusion of two tetrahedral nanocrystal quantum dots yielded the smallest bow&#8208;tie nanoantenna architecture, which manifests an electromagnetic&#8208;photocatalyitic hotspot at its epicenter.







Abstract
Top&#8208;down fabricated nanoantenna architectures of both metallic and dielectric materials show powerful functionalities for Raman and fluorescence enhancement with relevance to single molecule sensing while inducing directionality of chromophore emission with implications for single photon sources. We synthesize the smallest bow&#8208;tie nanoantenna by selective tip&#8208;to&#8208;tip fusion of two tetrahedral colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) forming a dimer. While the tetrahedral monomers emit non&#8208;polarized light, the bow&#8208;tie architecture manifests nanoantenna functionality of enhanced emission polarization along the bow&#8208;tie axis, as predicted theoretically and revealed by single&#8208;particle spectroscopy. Theory also predicts the formation of an electric&#8208;field hotspot at the bow&#8208;tie epicenter. This is utilized for selective light&#8208;induced photocatalytic metal growth at that location, unlike growth on the free tips in dark conditions, thus demonstrating bow&#8208;tie dimer functionality as a photochemical reaction center.

         <title>Discovery of Oligosaccharide Antigens for Semi&#8208;Synthetic Glycoconjugate Vaccine Leads against Streptococcus suis Serotypes 2, 3, 9 and&#8197;14**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
30 novel oligosaccharides resembling the capsular polysaccharides related to four major serotypes (2, 3, 9, 14) of Streptococcus suis (S.&#8197;suis) were synthesized. The conjugation&#8208;ready glycans were used to screen the sera of pigs and rabbits. With a glycan array study, glycan epitopes of lead antigens for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines to protect from S.&#8197;suis serotypes 2 and 9 were identified.







Abstract
Streptococcus suis bacteria are one of the most serious health problems for pigs and an emerging zoonotic agent in humans working in the swine industry. S.&#8197;suis bacteria express capsular polysaccharides (CPS) a major bacterial virulence factor that define the serotypes. Oligosaccharides resembling the CPS of S. suis serotypes 2, 3, 9, and 14 have been synthesized, glycans related to serotypes 2 and 9 were placed on glycan array surfaces to screen blood from infected pigs. Lead antigens for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic S. suis serotypes 2 and 9 glycoconjugate veterinary vaccines were identified in this way.

         <title>XFEL Crystal Structures of Peroxidase Compound II</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic fine&#8208;tuning of heme reactivity: Free&#8208;electron laser crystal structures of two different heme&#8208;containing peroxidases&#8212;cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase&#8212;show differences in the nature of the ferryl species. Precise enzymatic fine&#8208;tuning within structurally similar heme active sites is implicated.







Abstract
Oxygen activation in all heme enzymes requires the formation of high oxidation states of iron, usually referred to as ferryl heme. There are two known intermediates: Compound I and Compound II. The nature of the ferryl heme&#8212;and whether it is an FeIV=O or FeIV&#8208;OH species&#8212;is important for controlling reactivity across groups of heme enzymes. The most recent evidence for Compound I indicates that the ferryl heme is an unprotonated FeIV=O species. For Compound II, the nature of the ferryl heme is not unambiguously established. Here, we report 1.06&#8197;&#197; and 1.50&#8197;&#197; crystal structures for Compound II intermediates in cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), collected using the X&#8208;ray free electron laser at SACLA. The structures reveal differences between the two peroxidases. The iron&#8208;oxygen bond length in CcP (1.76&#8197;&#197;) is notably shorter than in APX (1.87&#8197;&#197;). The results indicate that the ferryl species is finely tuned across Compound I and Compound II species in closely related peroxidase enzymes. We propose that this fine&#8208;tuning is linked to the functional need for proton delivery to the heme.

         <title>Simultaneous Broadening and Enhancement of Cr3+ Photoluminescence in LiIn2SbO6 by Chemical Unit Cosubstitution: Night&#8208;Vision and Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy Detection Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable photoluminescence tuning of ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared emitting LiIn2SbO6:Cr3+ phosphor is achieved by chemical unit cosubstitution of [Zn2+&#8211;Zn2+] for [Li+&#8211;In3+], and its potential in night&#8208;vision and NIR spectroscopic applications is demonstrated.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emitting phosphor materials have been extensively developed for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. Although Cr3+&#8208;activated phosphors have been widely reported, it is challenging to achieve ultra&#8208;broad and tunable NIR emission. Here, a new ultra&#8208;broadband NIR&#8208;emitting LiIn2SbO6:Cr3+ phosphor with emission peak at 965&#8197;nm and a full&#8208;width at half maximum of 217&#8197;nm is reported. Controllable emission tuning from 965 to 892&#8197;nm is achieved by chemical unit cosubstitution of [Zn2+&#8211;Zn2+] for [Li+&#8211;In3+], which can be ascribed to the upshift of 4T2g energy level due to the strengthened crystal field. Moreover, the emission is greatly enhanced, and the FWHM reaches 235&#8197;nm. The as&#8208;prepared luminescent tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphors have demonstrated the potential in night&#8208;vision and NIR spectroscopy techniques. This work proves the feasibility of chemical unit cosubstitution strategy in emission tuning of Cr3+&#8208;doped phosphors, which can stimulate further studies on the emission&#8208;tunable NIR&#8208;emitting phosphor materials.

         <title>Activation of the Catalytic Activity of Thrombin for Fibrin Formation by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise regulation of protein activity is important to understand complex biological signaling networks and to devise new therapeutic approaches. Here, we use either polyaptamers or split aptamer&#8208;conjugated AuNPs to inhibit the activity of thrombin. Mechanical force generated by ultrasound is exploited to activate thrombin, thereby catalyzing the formation of fibrin from fibrinogen.







Abstract
The regulation of enzyme activity is a method to control biological function. We report two systems enabling the ultrasound&#8208;induced activation of thrombin, which is vital for secondary hemostasis. First, we designed polyaptamers, which can specifically bind to thrombin, inhibiting its catalytic activity. With ultrasound generating inertial cavitation and therapeutic medical focused ultrasound, the interactions between polyaptamer and enzyme are cleaved, restoring the activity to catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin. Second, we used split aptamers conjugated to the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). In the presence of thrombin, these assemble into an aptamer tertiary structure, induce AuNP aggregation, and deactivate the enzyme. By ultrasonication, the AuNP aggregates reversibly disassemble releasing and activating the enzyme. We envision that this approach will be a blueprint to control the function of other proteins by mechanical stimuli in the sonogenetics field.

         <title>Introduction of Photolatent Bases for Locally Controlling Dynamic Exchange Reactions in Thermo&#8208;Activated Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vitrimers are covalently crosslinked polymers capable of rearranging their network topology through thermo&#8208;activated associative exchange reactions. However, a locally controlled onset of these rearrangement reactions at elevated temperatures is a major challenge. A fundamental concept is demonstrated that enables controlled and, moreover, spatially resolved topology rearrangements triggerable by UV irradiation.







Abstract
Vitrimers exhibit a covalently crosslinked network structure, as is characteristic of classic thermosetting polymers. However, they are capable of rearranging their network topology by thermo&#8208;activated associative exchange reactions when the topology freezing transition temperature (Tv) is exceeded. Despite the vast number of developed vitrimers, there is a serious lack of methods that enable a (spatially) controlled onset of these rearrangement reactions above Tv. Herein, we highlight the localized release of the efficient transesterification catalyst 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) by the UV&#8208;induced cleavage of a photolatent base within a covalently crosslinked thiol&#8211;epoxy network. Demonstrated with stress relaxation measurements conducted well above the network's Tv, only the controlled release of TBD facilitates the immediate onset of transesterification in terms of a viscoelastic flow. Moreover, the spatially resolved UV&#8208;mediated photoactivation of vitrimeric properties is confirmed by permanent shape changes induced locally in the material.

         <title>Interfacial Polymerization at the Alkane/Ionic Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial polymerization at the alkane/ionic liquid interface has been designed. The extendibility, designability, and controllability brought by the ionic liquid replace the instability and low solubility caused by water in conventional polymerization. The polyamide nanofilms synthesized at the new delicate water&#8208;insoluble monomer interfaces possess adjustable pore size and exhibit unprecedented performance in various separation applications.







Abstract
Polymerization at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface has attracted much attention for synthesizing ultrathin polymer films for molecular sieving. However, it remains a major challenge to conduct this process outside the alkane&#8211;water interface since it not only suffers water&#8208;caused side reactions but also is limited to water&#8208;soluble monomers. Here, we report the interfacial polymerization at the alkane/ionic liquid interface (IP@AILI) where the ionic liquid acts as the universal solvent for diversified amines to synthesize task&#8208;specific polyamide nanofilms. We propose that IP@AILI occurs when acyl chloride diffuses from the alkane into the ionic liquid instead of being triggered by the diffusion of amines as in the conventional alkane&#8211;water system, which is demonstrated by thermodynamic partitioning and kinetic monitoring. The prepared polyamide nanofilms with precisely adjustable pore sizes display unprecedented permeability and selectivity in various separation processes.

         <title>pH&#8208;Amplified CRET Nanoparticles for In Vivo Imaging of Tumor Metastatic Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pH&#8208;amplified self&#8208;illuminating nanoprobes dually respond to acidity and myeloperoxidase of phagosome in inflammatory macrophages were synthesized. The nanoparticles exhibit excellent imaging capability for identification of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes in diverse animal tumor models.







Abstract
Noninvasive imaging strategies have been extensively investigated for in vivo mapping of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, the current imaging strategies fail to accurately assess tumor metastatic status in SLNs with high sensitivity. Here we report pH&#8208;amplified self&#8208;illuminating near&#8208;infrared nanoparticles, which integrate chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) and signal amplification strategy, enabling accurate identification of metastatic SLNs. After draining into lymph nodes, the nanoparticles were phagocytosed and dissociated in acidic phagosomes of inflammatory macrophages to emit near&#8208;infrared luminescent light. Using these nanoparticles, we successfully differentiated tumor metastatic lymph nodes from benign ones. These nanoparticles also exhibited excellent imaging capability for early detection of metastatic SLNs in diverse animal tumor models with small tumor volume (100&#8211;200&#8197;mm3).

         <title>Off&#8208;Set Interactions of Ruthenium&#8211;bda Type Catalysts for Promoting Water&#8208;Splitting Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the position of substituents on the axial ligand of the popular Ru(bda)L2 water&#8208;splitting catalyst can enable catalysis at low concentrations with high turnover frequencies. Kinetic results indicate superiority of asymmetric catalysts and DFT studies show that this is through positioning of two catalytic units in parallel planes minimizing the X&#8211;&#960; distance and optimizing stacking.







Abstract
O&#8722;O bond formation with Ru(bda)L2&#8208;type catalysts is well&#8208;known to proceed through a bimolecular reaction pathway, limiting the potential application of these catalysts at low concentrations. Herein, we achieved high efficiencies with mononuclear catalysts, with TOFs of 460&#177;32&#8197;s&#8722;1 at high catalyst loading and 31&#177;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 at only 1&#8197;&#956;M catalyst concentration, by simple structural considerations on the axial ligands. Kinetic and DFT studies show that introduction of an off&#8208;set in the interaction between the two catalytic units reduces the kinetic barrier of the second&#8208;order O&#8722;O bond formation, maintaining high catalytic activity even at low catalyst concentrations. The results herein furthermore suggest that &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions may only play a minor role in the observed catalytic activity, and that asymmetry can also rationalize high activity observed for Ru(bda)(isoq)2 type catalysts and offer inspiration to overcome the limitations of 2nd order catalysis.

         <title>Development of Continuous Flow Systems to Access Secondary Amines Through Previously Incompatible Biocatalytic Cascades**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of continuous flow reactors enabled previously inaccessible enzyme combinations in multi&#8208;enzyme cascade reactions. This included combination of oxidases with aminating biocatalysts (transaminase/reductive aminase) and was extended to the continuous in situ biocatalytic generation of amino donors for the reductive aminase.

A key aim of biocatalysis is to mimic the ability of eukaryotic cells to carry out multistep cascades in a controlled and selective way. As biocatalytic cascades get more complex, reactions become unattainable under typical batch conditions. Here a number of continuous flow systems were used to overcome batch incompatibility, thus allowing for successful biocatalytic cascades. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, reactive carbonyl intermediates were generated in situ using alcohol oxidases, then passed directly to a series of packed&#8208;bed modules containing different aminating biocatalysts which accordingly produced a range of structurally distinct amines. The method was expanded to employ a batch incompatible sequential amination cascade via an oxidase/transaminase/imine reductase sequence, introducing different amine reagents at each step without cross&#8208;reactivity. The combined approaches allowed for the biocatalytic synthesis of the natural product 4O&#8208;methylnorbelladine.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Aminoarylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkenes by Merging Photoredox with Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;aminoarylation of vinyl ethers, enamides, ene&#8208;carbamates and vinyl thioethers by synergistic photoredox and nickel catalysis is reported. The radical cascade features high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation is achieved as well as 1,2&#8208;aminoacylation of vinyl ethers.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation of vinyl ethers, enamides, ene&#8208;carbamates and vinyl thioethers by synergistic photoredox and nickel catalysis is reported. 2,2,2&#8208;Trifluoroethoxy carbonyl protected &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;oxy acids are used as amidyl radical precursors. anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of the amidyl radical to the alkene and Ni&#8208;mediated radical/transition metal cross over lead to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation product. The radical cascade, which can be conducted under practical and mild conditions, features high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation is achieved using a L&#8208;(+)&#8208;lactic acid derived vinyl ether as the substrate, offering a novel route for the preparation of protected enantiopure &#945;&#8208;arylated &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols. In addition, 1,2&#8208;aminoacylation of vinyl ethers is achieved by using an acyl succinimide as the electrophile for the Ni&#8208;mediated radical coupling.

         <title>Observation of Borane&#8211;Olefin Proximity Interaction Governing the Structure and Reactivity of Boron&#8208;Containing Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With borane&#8208;containing macrocyclic polyenes obtained by multi&#8208;step insertion of a strained alkyne into 9&#8208;borafluorene, the first direct crystallographic evidence of attractive borane&#8211;olefin interaction, which is beyond van der Waals force and governs the reactivity of the molecules, is provided.







Abstract
While attractive interactions between borane and olefin have been postulated to trigger various boron&#8208;mediated organic transformations, proximity structures of these functional groups, other than the formation of weak van der Waals complexes, have never been directly observed. Here we show that a close intramolecular borane&#8211;olefin interaction operates in macrocyclic systems containing borane and olefinic groups obtained by multi&#8208;step 1,2&#8208;carboboration between a strained alkyne and 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives. Depending on Lewis acidity of the borane moiety and the size of the macrocycles, the magnitude of interaction changes, resulting in different reaction modes. The whole picture of the multi&#8208;step reactions has been revealed experimentally with theoretical supports. The present finding may not only provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental boron&#8208;mediated interaction but also lead to the development of new organic transformations involving molecular activation by boranes.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Alkene Hydromethylation via Protonolysis of Titanacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the direct Markovnikov hydromethylation of unactivated alkenes by protonolysis of titanacyclobutanes has been developed. This approach enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of a methyl group into complex, polyfunctional molecules and has been demonstrated with a series of mono&#8208; and disubstituted alkenes containing pendant alcohols, ethers, amides, carbamates, and basic amines.







Abstract
Methyl groups are ubiquitous in biologically active molecules. Thus, new tactics to introduce this alkyl fragment into polyfunctional structures are of significant interest. With this goal in mind, a direct method for the Markovnikov hydromethylation of alkenes is reported. This method exploits the degenerate metathesis reaction between the titanium methylidene unveiled from Cp2Ti(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(&#956;&#8208;CH2)AlMe2 (Tebbe's reagent) and unactivated alkenes. Protonolysis of the resulting titanacyclobutanes in&#8197;situ effects hydromethylation in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and site&#8208;selective manner. The broad utility of this method is demonstrated across a series of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted alkenes containing pendant alcohols, ethers, amides, carbamates, and basic amines.

         <title>Anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Anion Coinage Bonds: The Case of Tetrachloridoaurate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gold atom of the AuCl4&#8722; moiety forms attractive anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion and anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;neutral electron&#8211;donor interactions. These interactions are rationalized as &#960;&#8208;hole coinage bonds and give rise to robust and reliable supramolecular synthons which control recognition and organization phenomena in the solid state. Hence, they might be considered for tuning structural and functional features in materials and biosystems.







Abstract
Interactions in crystalline tetrachloridoaurates of acetylcholine and dimethylpropiothetine are characterized by Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl and Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O short contacts. The former interactions assemble the AuCl4&#8722; units into supramolecular anionic polymers, while the latter interactions append the acetylcholine and propiothetine units to the polymer. The distorted octahedral geometry of the bonding pattern around the gold center is rationalized on the basis of the anisotropic distribution of the electron density, which enables gold to behave as an electrophile (&#960;&#8208;hole coinage&#8208;bond donor). Computational studies prove that gold atoms in negatively charged species can function as acceptors of electron density. The attractive nature of the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl/O interactions described here complement the known aurophilic bonds involved in gold&#8208;centered interactions.

         <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Cyclization for the Synthesis of Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quinazolinone motif is an important feature in natural products and drug candidates although enantioselective approaches to such scaffolds remain rare. An enantioselective Cu&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization delivers pyrroloquinazolines, featuring quaternary stereocenters and synthetic handles for further derivatization, with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol.







Abstract
Quinazolinones are common substructures in molecules of medicinal importance. We report an enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative cyclization for the assembly of privileged pyrroloquinazolinone motifs. The reaction proceeds with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol, and can deliver products containing quaternary stereocenters. The utility of the products is demonstrated through further manipulations.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Topological Transformation of a Molecular Borromean Ring via Controlled Oxidation of Thioether Moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled oxidation from thioether to sulfoxide and sulfone groups is a new post&#8208;synthetic modification to achieve the stimuli&#8208;responsive structural transformation from the molecular Borromean ring to tetranuclear metallacycles.







Abstract
A Cp*&#8208;Rh based D&#8208;shaped binuclear metallacycle and a template&#8208;free molecular Borromean ring (BR) were obtained in high yield using the semi&#8208;rigid thioether dipyridyl ligand 1,4&#8208;bis[(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylthio)methyl]benzene (Bptmb). The topological transformation from a binuclear metallacycle and a BR to tetranuclear metallacycles was realized via the controlled oxidation of thioethers. The strategy used in this work can be regarded as a new form of stimuli&#8208;responsive post&#8208;synthesis modification (PSM).

         <title>Exploiting Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Conditions to Trigger Pathway Complexity in the Growth of a MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that human&#8208;made self&#8208;assembled materials, such as porous coordination polymers, can follow distinct growth pathways in a given energy landscape in response to a controlled diffusion of reagents.







Abstract
Coordination polymers (CPs), including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), are crystalline materials with promising applications in electronics, magnetism, catalysis, and gas storage/separation. However, the mechanisms and pathways underlying their formation remain largely undisclosed. Herein, we demonstrate that diffusion&#8208;controlled mixing of reagents at the very early stages of the crystallization process (i.e., within &#8776;40&#8197;ms), achieved by using continuous&#8208;flow microfluidic devices, can be used to enable novel crystallization pathways of a prototypical spin&#8208;crossover MOF towards its thermodynamic product. In particular, two distinct and unprecedented nucleation&#8208;growth pathways were experimentally observed when crystallization was triggered under microfluidic mixing. Full&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations also confirm the occurrence of these two distinct pathways during crystal growth. In sharp contrast, a crystallization by particle attachment was observed under bulk (turbulent) mixing. These unprecedented results provide a sound basis for understanding the growth of CPs and open up new avenues for the engineering of porous materials by using out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Nonaflate: A New and Practical Trifluoromethoxylating Reagent and its Application to the Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Trifluoromethoxylated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trifluoromethoxy group has elicited much interest among drug and agrochemical discovery teams because of its unique properties. We developed trifluoromethyl nonafluorobutanesulfonate (nonaflate), TFNf, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, bench&#8208;stable, reactive, and scalable trifluoromethoxylating reagent. TFNf is easily and safely prepared in a simple process in large scale and the nonaflyl part of TFNf can easily be recovered as nonaflyl fluoride after usage and recycled. The synthetic potency of TFNf was showcased with the underexplored synthesis of various trifluoromethoxylated alkenes, through a high regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydro(halo)trifluoromethoxylation of alkyne derivatives such as haloalkynes, alkynyl esters and alkynyl sulfones. The synthetic merits of TFNf were further underscored with a high yielding and smooth nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylation of alkyl triflates/bromides and primary/secondary alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Pincer Motifs and Potential Metal&#8211;Metal Cooperativity in Cobalt Dinitrogen Chemistry: Efficient Catalytic Silylation of N2 to N(SiMe3)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand scaffold with two fused PNN pincer compartments combines two beneficial features for N2 fixation with molecular catalysts, viz. a bimetallic pocket and ligand&#8208;based protonation sites. Its cobalt(I) dinitrogen complexes are shown to efficiently mediate the reductive silylation of N2.







Abstract
Using a pyrazolate&#8208;bridged dinucleating ligand that provides two proximate pincer&#8208;type PNN binding sites (&#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one pincer&#8221;), different synthetic routes have been developed towards its dicobalt(I) complex 2 that features a twice deprotonated ligand backbone and two weakly activated terminal N2 substrate ligands directed into the bimetallic pocket. Protonation of 2 is shown to occur at the ligand scaffold and to trigger conversion to a tetracobalt(I) complex 4 with two end&#8208;on &#956;1,2&#8208;bridging N2; in THF 4 is labile and undergoes temperature&#8208;dependent N2/triflate ligand exchange. These pyrazolate&#8208;based systems combine the potential of exhibiting both metal&#8211;metal and metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity, viz. two concepts that have emerged as promising design motifs for molecular N2 fixation catalysts. Complex 2 serves as an efficient (pre)catalyst for the reductive silylation of N2 into N(SiMe3)3 (using KC8 and Me3SiCl), yielding up to 240&#8197;equiv N(SiMe3)3 per catalyst.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;mediated in situ self&#8208;assembly promotes in vivo bioorthogonal reaction for pretargeted multimodality imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pretargeted imaging has emerged as a promising approach to advance nuclear imaging of malignant tumors, however, the application of pretargeted strategy for multimodality imaging of enzyme activity in vivo is challenging. Herein, we combine the enzyme&#8208;mediated fluorogenic reaction and in situ self&#8208;assembly with the inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reaction to develop an activatable pretargeted strategy for multimodality imaging. The  trans  &#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) bearing small&#8208;molecule probe,  P&#8208;FFGd&#8208;TCO  , can be activated by alkaline phosphatase and in situ self&#8208;assembles into nanoaggregates (  FMNPs&#8208;TCO  ) retained on the membranes, permitting to (1) amplify near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence (FL) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals, and (2) enrich TCOs to promote IEDDA ligation. The Gallium&#8208;68 (  68  Ga) labeled tetrazine can readily conjugate the tumor&#8208;retained  FMNPs&#8208;TCO  to enhance radioactivity uptake in tumors. Hence, strong NIR FL, MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) signals are concomitantly achieved, allowing for pretargeted multimodality imaging of ALP activity in HeLa tumor&#8208;bearing mice.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical van der Waals Beryllium Borates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Van der Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials hold great potentials to extend the DUV NLO applications to two&#8208;dimension, but they are rare in nature. In this study, we have proposed a design principle to realize vdW DUV NLO materials via structural evolution from the non&#8208;vdW (BO3)&#8208;(BeO3F) layers in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) to the vdW (BO3)&#8208;(BeO4H) layers in berborite Be2BO5H3 (BBH) and the vdW (BO4)&#8208;(BeO4) layers in beryllium metaborate BeB2O4 (BEBO). Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, the fundamental NLO properties of BBH and BEBO demonstrate that the balanced DUV NLO performance can be achieved in these two systems. Importantly, the BBH, an existing layered material in nature, can achieve available DUV phase&#8208;matched output with strong second harmonic generation (SHG) effect for the 177.3/193.7 nm DUV lasers, which is almost identical to that of KBBF. Remarkably, the BEBO shows excellent DUV SHG capacity and even shorter phase&#8208;matching wavelength than KBBF. Therefore, the newly discovered vdW BBH and BEBO, once verified by experiments, could provide an ideal platform to study the DUV NLO effects from three&#8208;dimension to two&#8208;dimension.</dc:description>

         <title>Gausemycins A,B &#8211; cyclic lipoglycopeptides from Streptomyces sp.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel family of natural lipoglycopeptides produced by  Streptomyces  sp. INA&#8208;Ac&#8208;5812. Two major components of the mixture, named gausemycins A and B, were isolated, and their structures were elucidated. The compounds are cyclic peptides with a unique peptide core and several remarkable structural features, including unusual positions of D&#8208;amino acids, lack of the Ca  2+  &#8208;binding Asp&#8208;X&#8208;Asp&#8208;Gly (DXDG) motif, tyrosine glycosylation with arabinose, presence of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;phenylbutyric acid (Ahpb) and chlorinated kynurenine (ClKyn),  N  &#8208;acylation of the ornithine side chain. Gausemycins have pronounced activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Mechanistic studies highlight significant differences compared to known glyco&#8208; and lipopeptides. Gausemycins exhibit only slight Ca  2+  &#8208;dependence of activity and induce no pore formation at low concentrations. Moreover, there is no detectable accumulation of cell wall biosynthesis precursors under treatment with gausemycins.</dc:description>

         <title>Void Space vs. Surface Functionalization for Proton Conduction in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Void space and functionality of pore surface are important structural factors for proton&#8208;conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with the impregnation of conducting media. However, there is no clear study that compare their priority factors, which need to be considered when designing proton&#8208;conductive MOFs. Here, we first demonstrate the effect of void space and pore surface modification on proton conduction in MOFs through the surface&#8208;modified isoreticular MOF&#8208;74(Ni) series [Ni  2  (dobdc or dobpdc), dobdc = 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate and dobpdc = 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;(1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate]. The MOF with lower porosity with the same surface functionality shows a higher proton conductivity than that of higher porosity despite including a smaller amount of conducting media. The density functional theory calculations suggest that strong hydrogen bonding between conducting media under high porosity is inefficient for realizing high proton conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategic Design of Catalytic Lysine&#8208;Targeting Reversible Covalent BCR&#8208;ABL Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted covalent inhibitors have re&#8208;emerged as validated drugs to overcome acquired resistance in cancer treatment. Herein, by using a carbonyl boronic acid (CBA) warhead, we report the structure&#8208;based design of BCR&#8208;ABL inhibitors via reversible covalent targeting of the catalytic lysine with improved potency against both wild&#8208;type and mutant ABL kinases, especially ABLT315I bearing the gatekeeper residue mutation. We show the evolutionarily conserved lysine can be targeted selectively, and the selectivity depends largely on molecular recognition of the non&#8208;covalent pharmacophore in this class of inhibitors, probably due to the moderate reactivity of the warhead. We report the first co&#8208;crystal structures of covalent inhibitor&#8208;ABL kinase domain complexes, providing insights into the interaction of this warhead with the catalytic lysine. We also employed label&#8208;free mass spectrometry to evaluate off&#8208;targets of our compounds at proteome&#8208;wide level in different mammalian cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Control Viscoelasticity of Polymer Networks with Crosslinks of Superposed Fast and Slow Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depending on the dynamics of the crosslinks, polymer networks can have distinct bulk mechanical behaviors, from viscous liquids to tough solids. Here, by means of designing a crosslink with variable molecular dynamics, we show the control of viscoelasticity of polymer networks in a broad range quantitatively. The hexanoate&#8208;isoquinoline@cucurbit[7]uril (HIQ@CB[7]) crosslink exhibits in a combination of protonated and deprotonated states of similar association affinity but distinct molecular dynamics. The molecular property of this crosslink is contributed by linear combination of the parameters at the two states, which is precisely tuned by pH. Using this crosslink, we achieve the quantitative control of viscoelasticity of quasi&#8208;ideal networks in 5 orders of magnitude, and we show the reversible control of mechanical response, such as stiffness, strength and extensibility, of tough random polymer networks. This strategy offers a way to tailor the mechanical properties of polymer networks at the molecular level and paves the way for engineering &#8220;smart&#8221; responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Ligand&#8208;Directed Heterogeneous Catalysis: When the Dynamically Changing Nature of the Ligand Layer Controls the Hydrogenation Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a mechanistic study on formation and dynamic changes of a ligand&#8208;based heterogeneous Pd catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Deposition of allyl cyanide as a precursor of a ligand layer renders Pd highly active and nearly 100% selective toward propenol formation by promoting acrolein adsorption in a desired configuration via the C=O end. Employing a combination of real space microscopic and  in operando  spectroscopic surface sensitive techniques, we show that an ordered active ligand layer is formed under operational conditions, consisting of stable butylimin species. In a competing process, unstable amine species evolve on the surface, which desorb in the course of the reaction. Obtained atomistic&#8208;level insights into the formation and dynamic evolution of the active ligand layer under operational conditions provide important input required for controlling chemoselectivity by purposeful surface functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Getting Ready for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: The Infrared Spectrum of Hydrated Aluminum Hydride&#8208;Hydroxide HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8208;1, n = 9&#8211;14</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrated singly charged aluminum ions eliminate molecular hydrogen in a size regime from 11 to 24 water molecules. Here we probe the structure of HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8208;1, n = 9&#8211;14, by infrared multiple photon spectroscopy in the region of 1400&#8211;2250 cm&#8208;1. Based on quantum chemical calculations, we assign the features at 1940&#160;cm&#8209;1 and 1850 cm&#8208;1 to the Al&#8208;H stretch in five&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinate aluminum(III) complexes, respectively. Hydrogen bonding towards the hydride is observed, starting at n = 12. The frequency of the Al&#8208;H stretch is very sensitive to the structure of the hydrogen bonding network, and the large number of isomers leads to significant broadening and red&#8208;shifting of the absorption of the hydrogen bonded Al&#8208;H stretch. The hydride can even act as a double hydrogen bond acceptor, shifting the Al&#8208;H stretch to frequencies below those of the water bending mode. The onset of hydrogen bonding and disappearance of the free Al&#8208;H stretch coincides with the onset of hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

Based on quantum chemical calculations, we assign the features at 1940&#160;cm&#8209;1 and 1850 cm-1 to the Al-H stretch in five- and six-coordinate aluminum(III) complexes, respectively. Hydrogen bonding towards the hydride is observed, starting at n = 12. The frequency of the Al-H stretch is very sensitive to the structure of the hydrogen bonding network, and the large number of isomers leads to significant broadening and red-shifting of the absorption of the hydrogen bonded Al-H stretch. The hydride can even act as a double hydrogen bond acceptor, shifting the Al-H stretch to frequencies below those of the water bending mode. The onset of hydrogen bonding and disappearance of the free Al-H stretch coincides with the onset of hydrogen evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 3D Anionic Metal Covalent Organic Framework with soc Topology Built from Octahedral Ti(IV) Complex for Photocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains challenging due to the limited types of organic building blocks. With octahedral Ti(IV) complex as the building unit, this study reports on the first 3D anionic titanium&#8208;based COF (  Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1  ) with an edge&#8208;transitive (6, 4)&#8208;connected  soc  topology.  Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1  exhibits high crystallinity, superior stability, and large specific surface area (1000.4 m  2  g  &#8722;1  ). Moreover,  Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1  has a broad absorption band in the UV spectrum with an optical energy gap of 1.86 eV, and exhibits high photocatalytic activity toward Meerwein addition reactions. This research demonstrates an attractive strategy for the design of 3D functional COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Aglacins A, B and E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (PEDA) reaction, between electron&#8208;rich 2&#8208;methylbenzaldehydes and unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactones, was developed to directly construct the basic tricyclic core of aryltetralin lactone lignans. The first asymmetric total synthesis of aglacins A, B and E was achieved based on this newly developed methodology, which enable us to revise the absolute configuration of these natural lignans. This strategy was also used to efficiently prepare naturally occurring aryl&#8211;dihydronaphthalene&#8208;type lignans (&#8211;)&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroisojusticidine B and (+)&#8208;linoxepin in four and six steps, as well as 27 members of natural product&#8208;like molecules bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center at C&#8208;8&#8217;.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Vinylogous Addition Reactions Initiated by Meinwald Rearrangement of Vinyl Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric multiple vinylogous addition reactions initiated by Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides were realized by employing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complexes as catalysts. Direct vinylogous additions via dienolates of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes were realized. A series of chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and spiro&#8208;cyclohexene indolinones were synthesized in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The first catalytic asymmetric multiple vinylogous addition reactions initiated by Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides were realized by employing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complex catalysts. The vinyl epoxides, as masked &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, via direct vinylogous additions with isatins, 2&#8208;alkenoylpyridines or methyleneindolinones, provided a facile and efficient way for the synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and spiro&#8208;cyclohexene indolinones, respectively with high efficiency and stereoselectivity. The control experiments and kinetic studies revealed that the Lewis acid acted as dual&#8208;tasking catalyst, controlling the initial rearrangement to match subsequent enantioselective vinylogous addition reactions. A catalytic cycle with a possible transition model was proposed to illustrate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Fabrication of Gradient and Patterned Organic Thin Films by Bipolar Electrolytic Micelle Disruption Using Redox&#8208;Active Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipolar electrolytic micelle disruption (BEMD) system is established by integrating bipolar electrochemistry with a redox&#8208;controlled micelle disruption process. Using the BEMD approach, gradient and patterned organic films with a wide range of a polymerizable monomer, an organic pigment and aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecules, were successfully fabricated.







Abstract
Bipolar electrochemistry could be regarded as a powerful approach for selective surface modification due to the beneficial feature that a wirelessly controllable potential distribution on bipolar electrodes (BPEs). Herein we report a bipolar electrolytic micelle disruption (BEMD) system for the preparation of shaped organic films. A U&#8208;shaped bipolar electrolytic system with a sigmoidal potential gradient on the BPE gave gradient&#8208;thin films including various interesting organic compounds, such as a polymerizable monomer, an organic pigment and aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecules. The gradient feature was characterized by UV&#8211;Vis absorption, thickness measurements and surface morphology analysis. Corresponding patterned films were also fabricated using a cylindrical bipolar electrolytic setup that enables site&#8208;selective application of the potential on the BPE. Such a facile BEMD approach will open a long&#8208;term perspective with respect to organic film preparation.

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interactions in Supported Atomically Dispersed Gold Catalysts for Efficient Fenton&#8208;like Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substituted solid solution was used to achieve self&#8208;exfoliation of synthetic materials and optimize electronic metal&#8211;carrier interactions to increase the material's high efficiency and stable water treatment catalytic performance.







Abstract
The atomically dispersed metal is expected as one of the most promising Fenton&#8208;like catalysts for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants (ROPs) by the strong &#8220;electronic metal&#8211;support interactions&#8221; (EMSIs). Here, we develop an atomically dispersed metal&#8211;atom alloy made by guest Au atoms substitute host V atoms in the two&#8208;dimensional VO2(B) nanobelt support (Au/VO2) to activate Fenton&#8208;like oxidation for elimination of ROPs. The 2D nanobelt structure enlarges the exposure of atomically Au thus increasing the number of active sites to absorb more S2O82&#8722; ions. And the EMSIs regulate the charge density in Au atoms to present positive charge Au+, lowering the energy barrier of S2O82&#8722; decomposition to produce SO4.&#8722;. The Au/VO2 catalyst possesses excellent durable and reliable characteristics and exhibits record&#8208;breaking efficiency with TOF as high as 21.42&#8197;min&#8722;1, 16.19&#8197;min&#8722;1, and 80.89&#8197;min&#8722;1 for rhodamine, phenol, and bisphenol&#8197;A degradation, respectively.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atomically dispersed metal is expected as one of the most promising Fenton-like catalysts for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants (ROPs) by the strong &#8220;electronic metal&#8211;support interactions&#8221; (EMSIs). Here, we develop an atomically dispersed metal&#8211;atom alloy made by guest Au atoms substitute host V atoms in the two-dimensional VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(B) nanobelt support (Au/VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to activate Fenton-like oxidation for elimination of ROPs. The 2D nanobelt structure enlarges the exposure of atomically Au thus increasing the number of active sites to absorb more S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions. And the EMSIs regulate the charge density in Au atoms to present positive charge Au&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, lowering the energy barrier of S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; decomposition to produce SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The Au/VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst possesses excellent durable and reliable characteristics and exhibits record-breaking efficiency with TOF as high as 21.42&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 16.19&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 80.89&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for rhodamine, phenol, and bisphenol&#8197;A degradation, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chiral Metal Nanoparticle Superlattices Enabled by Porphyrin&#8208;Based Supramolecular Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral metal nanoparticle superlattices with diverse structures were engineered by templating from porphyrin based supramolecular structures. The chirality transfer from molecular systems to colloidal systems is on the basis of weak chain&#8208;chain van der Waals forces.







Abstract
Herein, we show that chiral metal nanoparticle superlattices can be produced through coassembly of achiral metal nanoparticles and porphyrin&#8208;based organic molecules. This chirality transfer from molecules to nanoparticle superstructures across three orders of magnitude in length scale is enabled by the hetero chain&#8208;chain van der Waals interactions. As far as we know, these are the first chiral nanoparticle assemblies based on chirality transfer through weak van der Waals forces. The dimensionality of the nanoparticle superlattices (1D chiral chains, 2D chiral sheets (cones), and 3D chiral particles) can be controlled based on a same synthetic chiral porphyrin molecule. Metalation of these porphyrin molecules with zinc cations results in the switching of molecular packing from J&#8208;type to H&#8208;type, which thereby produces 1D chiral nanoparticle chains. Functionalization of these zinc porphyrins with oleylamine can induce the assembly of nanoparticles into 2D chiral nanoparticle sheets.

         <title>Correlation between Oxygen Vacancies and Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity for a Model Electrode: PrBaCo2O5+&#948;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancies content and ordering are influencing the oxygen evolution reaction activity of one of the most active perovskite electrocatalyst, PrBaCo2O5+d. It is suggested that a high oxygen vacancy content in the perovskite lattice is beneficial for the activity, while lattice oxygen ordering leads to a drop in the OER activity.







Abstract
The role of the perovskite lattice oxygen in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically studied in the PrBaCo2O5+&#948; family. The reduced number of physical/chemical variables combined with in&#8208;depth characterizations such as neutron dif&#8208;fraction, O K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), magnetization and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies, helps investigating the complex correlation between OER activity and a single perovskite property, such as the oxygen content. Larger amount of oxygen vacancies appears to facilitate the OER, possibly contributing to the mechanism involving the oxidation of lattice oxygen, i.e., the lattice oxygen evolution reaction (LOER). Furthermore, not only the number of vacancies but also their local arrangement in the perovskite lattice influences the OER activity, with a clear drop for the more stable, ordered stoichiometry.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Photocatalyzed Hydroboration of Alkynes and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein the photocatalytic hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes using newly&#8208;designed copper photocatalysts with B2Pin2. The hydroborated products were obtained under mild conditions in high yields, excellent diastereoselectivities, a high functional group tolerance and developed under continuous flow conditions to demonstrate their synthetic utility. Finally, the reaction mechanism was also studied.







Abstract
The photocatalytic hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes is reported. The use of newly&#8208;designed copper photocatalysts with B2Pin2 permits the formation a boryl radical, which is used for hydroboration of a large panel of alkenes and alkynes. The hydroborated products were isolated in high yields, with excellent diastereoselectivities and a high functional group tolerance under mild conditions. The hydroboration reactions were developed under continuous flow conditions to demonstrate their synthetic utility. The reaction mechanism was studied and suggested an oxidation reaction between an in situ formed borate and the Cu&#8208;photocatalyst in its excited state for the boryl radical formation.

         <title>Structural and Functional Analyses of the Tridomain&#8208;Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase FmoA3 for 4&#8208;Methyloxazoline Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimeric structure of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), FmoA3 which consists of Cy&#8208;A&#8208;PCP domains, was solved by two strategies, X&#8208;ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy. The molecular basis of the &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid recognition mechanism of the A domain of FmoA3 was proposed. The Cy domain of FmoA3 was expected to lose peptide bond formation activity by eliminating its ability to bind with a donor PCP.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are attractive targets for bioengineering to generate useful peptides. FmoA3 is a single modular NRPS composed of heterocyclization (Cy), adenylation (A), and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains. It uses &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;serine to synthesize a 4&#8208;methyloxazoline ring, probably with another Cy domain in the preceding module FmoA2. Here, we determined the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail homodimeric structures of FmoA3 by X&#8208;ray crystallography (apo&#8208;form, with adenylyl&#8208;imidodiphosphate and &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;seryl&#8208;AMP) and cryogenic electron microscopy single particle analysis, and performed site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments. The data revealed that &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;serine can be accommodated in the active site because of the extra space around Ala688. The Cy domains of FmoA2 and FmoA3 catalyze peptide bond formation and heterocyclization, respectively. FmoA3&#8217;s Cy domain seems to lose its donor PCP binding activity. The collective data support a proposed catalytic cycle of FmoA3.

         <title>Enhancing Rechargeable Persistent Luminescence via Organic Dye Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Firefly&#8208;like persistent luminescence nanoparticles for accurate imaging guided tumor surgery are reported by Gang Han et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101492). Organic dye molecules act as &#8220;wings&#8221; and can be conjugated with persistent luminescence nanoparticles. Such dye&#8208;sensitized nanoparticles emit boosted afterglow signals for a long period of time without the need for additional light input, reminiscent of a firefly.

From the teaching class with the bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of ortho&#8208;quinols drawn on the chalk board to the laboratory with the (+)&#8208;ferruginol substrate and our chiral bis&#8208;iodyl reagent in the flask: The single ortho&#8208;quinol diastereomer thus produced combine by pairs to reach a C2&#8208;symmetric transition state in which [4+2] and [2+4] processes are equivalent, as described by Laurent Pouys&#233;gu, St&#233;phane Quideau et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103410). Under high pressure, this transition state leads to the product, the natural (+)&#8208;maytenone, which was first isolated from the plant Maytenus dispermus, here appearing on the background image.

         <title>Exploiting Supramolecular Dynamics in Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks to Generate Metal&#8211;Oxide and Metal&#8211;Carbon Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular metal&#8211;phenolic networks, consisting of metal ions coordinated with phenolic motifs, can undergo selective thermodynamic transformations into nanoporous structures, including metal&#8211;carbon networks and metal&#8211;oxide networks, with tunable network organization and surface wettability.







Abstract
Supramolecular complexation is a powerful strategy for engineering materials in bulk and at interfaces. Metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs), which are assembled through supramolecular complexes, have emerged as suitable candidates for surface and particle engineering owing to their diverse properties. Herein, we examine the supramolecular dynamics of MPNs during thermal transformation processes. Changes in the local supramolecular network including enlarged pores, ordered aromatic packing, and metal relocation arise from thermal treatment in air or an inert atmosphere, enabling the engineering of metal&#8211;oxide networks (MONs) and metal&#8211;carbon networks, respectively. Furthermore, by integrating photo&#8208;responsive motifs (i.e., TiO2) and silanization, the MONs are endowed with reversible superhydrophobic (&gt;150&#176;) and superhydrophilic (&#8776;0&#176;) properties. By highlighting the thermodynamics of MPNs and their transformation into diverse materials, this work offers a versatile pathway for advanced materials engineering.

         <title>Implications of Quenching&#8208;to&#8208;Dequenching Switch in Quantitative Cell Uptake and Biodistribution of Dye&#8208;Labeled Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quenching&#8208;to&#8208;dequenching switch of fluorescence&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in biological environments was unveiled by Chun&#8208;Xia Zhao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101730). With dye molecules at a solid state, the release and/or degradation of the dye&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in biological environments led to a several&#8208;fold increase of fluorescence intensity due to the state switch, which has significant implications in quantitative cell uptake and biodistribution studies.

         <title>Novel Insight into Proximal DNA Domain Interactions from Temperature&#8208;Controlled Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization explores the thermodynamics of hybrid quadruplex&#8211;duplex oligonucleotide assemblies comprised of multiple domains and brings insight into mutual domain interaction. As described by Renato Zenobi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016757), thermal denaturation experiments were conducted to reveal unfolding intermediates and changes in thermodynamics DNA complexes depending on the number of domains and their position in a single MS experiment.

         <title>Bioinspired Network Analysis Enabled Divergent Syntheses and Structure Revision of Pentacyclic Cytochalasans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent syntheses of a series of bioactive pentacyclic cytochalasans is reported by Pema&#8208;Tenzin Puno, Jun Deng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102831). Inspired by nature's way of synthesizing various secondary metabolites from a common precursor to maximize the number of natural products, total synthesis and structure revision of pentacyclic cytochalasans were realized from a common precursor aspochalasin D based on bioinspired structure network analysis and DFT calculations.

         <dc:description>
A bowl&#8208;shaped nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographene composed of a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core substituted with six arene rings circularly bonded with one another, undergoes the bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl inversion with a low barrier. This inversion resembles that of an umbrella flipped by the strong wind. The transition state is not planar, but possesses a rather twisted, S&#8208;shaped conformation with Ci symmetry. The bowl&#8208;inversion mechanism follows a quadruple&#8208;well potential model, as reported by Andrzej&#8197;L. Sobolewski, Micha&#322;&#8197;K. Cyra&#324;ski, Daniel&#8197;T. Gryko et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202104092).

         <title>Superprotonic Conductivity of MOF&#8208;808 Achieved by Controlling the Binding Mode of Grafted Sulfamate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superprotonic conductivity of sulfamate&#8208;grafted MOF&#8208;808 was described by Yung&#8197;Sam Kim, Seung&#8197;Bin Baek, Myoung Soo Lah et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103191). The modulation of the binding mode of the grafted sulfamate from the monodentate mode to the bridging bidentate mode resulted in more efficient proton conduction by generating more acidic cationic sulfiliminium group (&#8211;S=NH2+).

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensional arrangement of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), which are a partially oxidized dysprosium(III) phthalocyaninato double&#8208;decker complexes, [DyPc2]Ix, was synthesized in the Communication by Keiichi Katoh, Masahiro Yamashita et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102666) by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. The results of spectrophotometric analysis on [DyPc2]Ix are consistent with the Drude model, which theoretically explains the optical response of the metal. Since conductivity was observed at temperatures lower than the spin blocking temperature (TB), magnetoresistance (MR) effects observed as magnetic hysteresis were observed for the SMM. Our strategy may pave the way for the construction of electro&#8208;conductive SMM as spin valves.

         <title>High&#8208;Rate CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products over a Copper&#8208;Copper Iodide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;CuI composite catalyst achieves a remarkable C2+ partial current density of 591&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE, substantially higher than Cu or CuI alone. It is ascribed to the presence of residual Cu+ and adsorbed iodine species which improve CO adsorption and facilitate C&#8722;C coupling during CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multicarbon hydrocarbon and oxygenate (C2+) products with high energy density and wide availability is of great importance, as it provides a promising way to achieve the renewable energy storage and close the carbon cycle. Herein we design a Cu&#8208;CuI composite catalyst with abundant Cu0/Cu+ interfaces by physically mixing Cu nanoparticles and CuI powders. The composite catalyst achieves a remarkable C2+ partial current density of 591&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow cell, substantially higher than Cu (329&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and CuI (96&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) counterparts. Induced by alkaline electrolyte and applied potential, the Cu&#8208;CuI composite catalyst undergoes significant reconstruction under CO2RR conditions. The high&#8208;rate C2+ production over Cu&#8208;CuI is ascribed to the presence of residual Cu+ and adsorbed iodine species which improve CO adsorption and facilitate C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Engineering High&#8208;Spin State Cobalt Cations in Spinel Zinc Cobalt Oxide for Spin Channel Propagation and Active Site Enhancement in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering high&#8208;spin state cobalt cations in spinel ZnCo2O4 propagates a spin channel for spin&#8208;selected charge transport and enhances active sites for intermediate adsorption. High&#8208;spin cobalt cations can be directly engineered by varying the calcination temperature.







Abstract
Spinel zinc cobalt oxide (ZnCo2O4) is not considered as a superior catalyst for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the bottleneck reaction in water&#8208;electrolysis. Herein, taking advantage of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that the existence of low&#8208;spin (LS) state cobalt cations hinders the OER activity of spinel zinc cobalt oxide, as the t2g6eg0 configuration gives rise to purely localized electronic structure and exhibits poor binding affinity to the key reaction intermediate. Increasing the spin state of cobalt cations in spinel ZnCo2O4 is found to propagate a spin channel to promote spin&#8208;selected charge transport during OER and generate better active sites for intermediates adsorption. The experiments find increasing the calcination temperature a facile approach to engineer high&#8208;spin (HS) state cobalt cations in ZnCo2O4, while not working for Co3O4. The activity of the best spin&#8208;state&#8208;engineered ZnCo2O4 outperforms other typical Co&#8208;based oxides.

         <title>ZW800&#8208;PEG: A Renal Clearable Zwitterionic Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophore for Potential Clinical Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZW800&#8208;PEG is a water&#8208;soluble, non&#8208;sticky, and renal clearable near&#8208;infrared fluorophore owing to the balanced zwitterionic charges. By introducing a stable sulfide linker, it improves serum stability and also exhibits potential for augmenting photothermal therapy. It shows a maximum emission wavelength at 800&#8197;nm, enabling its use for image&#8208;guided interventions in the OR using conventional near&#8208;infrared imaging systems.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has advanced medical imaging and image&#8208;guided interventions during the past three decades. Despite tremendous advances in imaging devices, surprisingly only a few dyes are currently available in the clinic. Previous fluorophores, ZW800&#8208;1A and ZW800&#8208;1C, significantly improved the poor performance of the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green. However, ZW800&#8208;1A is not stable in serum and ZW800&#8208;1C induces severe stacking in aqueous media. To solve such dilemmas, ZW800&#8208;PEG was designed by introducing a flexible yet stable thiol PEG linker. ZW800&#8208;PEG shows high solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents, thus improving renal clearance with minimal binding to serum proteins during systemic circulation. The sulfide group on the meso position of the heptamethine core improves serum stability and physicochemical properties including the maximum emission wavelength shift to 800&#8197;nm, enabling the use of ZW800&#8208;PEG for image&#8208;guided interventions and augmenting photothermal therapy.

We developed a size effect that controls the crystallization of perovskite and enhances the passivation effect with g&#8208;C3N4 additive. The similarity in value of lattice constant and distance between double hydrogen binding sites affects crystallization. The combination allows g&#8208;C3N4 to cover tin&#8208;based perovskite, thus improves hydrophobicity and oxidation resistance of films and leads to splendid PCE of wearable device with excellent stability.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) demonstrate a potential application in wearable electronics due to its hypotoxicity. However, poor crystal quality is still the bottleneck for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible devices. In this work, graphite phase&#8208;C3N4 (g&#8208;C3N4) is applied into tin&#8208;based perovskite as a crystalline template, which delays crystallization via a size&#8208;effect and passivates defects simultaneously. The double hydrogen bond between g&#8208;C3N4 and formamidine cation can optimize lattice matching and passivation. Moreover, the two&#8208;dimensional network structure of g&#8208;C3N4 can fit on the crystals, resulting an enhanced hydrophobicity and oxidation resistance. Therefore, the flexible tin&#8208;based PSCs with g&#8208;C3N4 realize a stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.56&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis. In addition, the PSCs can maintain 91&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 1000&#8197;h under N2 environment and keep 92&#8201;% of their original PCE after 600&#8197;cycles at a curvature radius of 3&#8197;mm.

         <title>Catalytic Co&#8208;Conversion of CH4 and CO2 Mediated by Rhodium&#8211;Titanium Oxide Anions RhTiO2&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2 to syngas mediated by single Rh atom&#8208;doped titanium oxide anions (RhTiO2&#8722;) has been experimentally identified. The production of free 2&#8201;H2+CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) could be achieved at room temperature while the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of the COads from RhTiO2CO&#8722;.







Abstract
Catalytic co&#8208;conversion of methane with carbon dioxide to produce syngas (2&#8201;H2+2&#8201;CO) involves complicated elementary steps and almost all the elementary reactions are performed at the same high temperature conditions in practical thermocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate by mass spectrometric experiments that RhTiO2&#8722; promotes the co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2 to free 2&#8201;H2+CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) at room temperature; the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of COads from the RhTiO2CO&#8722; to reform RhTiO2&#8722;. This study not only identifies a promising active species for dry (CO2) reforming of methane to syngas, but also emphasizes the importance of temperature control over elementary steps in practical catalysis, which may significantly alleviate the carbon deposition originating from the pyrolysis of methane.

         <dc:description>
Acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimides (AABIs), nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrenes with two imide functionalities (see structure), were found to exhibit excellent electron affinity, affording an air&#8208;stable radical anion. The intrinsic electron mobility of one derivative obeyed a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, the corresponding single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor device showed high electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and properties of acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimide (AABI), a nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrene with two imide functionalities. AABI exhibits excellent electron affinity as evident by its low&#8208;lying LUMO level (&#8722;4.1&#8197;eV vs. vacuum). Single&#8208;electron reduction of one AABI derivative afforded the corresponding radical anion, which was stable under ambient conditions. Photoconductivity measurements suggest that the intrinsic electron mobility of an N&#8208;phenethyl AABI derivative obeys a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, an electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was attained with the corresponding single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) device. The vacuum&#8208;deposited OFET device consisting of a polycrystalline sample exhibited high electron mobility of up to 0.27&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 even in air. This study demonstrates that dual incorporation of both imide substituents and imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms is an effective strategy to create novel electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Engineering of a Peptide &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Methyltransferase to Methylate Non&#8208;Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide backbone methylation is a highly desired modification. Using split intein, synthetic peptides and an engineered variant of the methylase, fOphMA2, it was possible to enzymatically methylate amide bonds involving non&#8208;natural amino acids. This has application in the biotechnological production of therapeutic peptides.







Abstract
Introduction of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;methylated non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids into peptides can improve their biological activities, membrane permeability and proteolytic stability. This is commonly achieved, in nature and in the lab, by assembling pre&#8208;methylated amino acids. The more appealing route of methylating amide bonds is challenging. Biology has evolved an &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;automethylating enzyme, OphMA, which acts on the amide bonds of peptides fused to its C&#8208;terminus. Due to the ribosomal biosynthesis of its substrate, the activity of this enzyme towards peptides with non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids has not been addressed. An engineered OphMA, intein&#8208;mediated protein ligation and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis have allowed us to demonstrate the methylation of amide bonds in the context of non&#8208;natural amides. This approach may have application in the biotechnological production of therapeutic peptides.
