         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Unlocking Reactivity of Fragments for Fast Target&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating photochemistry within kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) techniques, we significantly accelerated the identification of enzyme inhibitors, demonstrating the potential of KTGS for rapid discovery of bioactive ligands in medicinal chemistry. The chiral linkage gives rise to the formation of enantiomers, which were assessed via a highly stereocontrolled synthesis of both templated ligand enantiomers.







Abstract
We showcase the successful combination of photochemistry and kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) for rapidly pinpointing enzyme inhibitors. KTGS is a fragment&#8208;based drug discovery (FBDD) methodology in which the biological target (BT) orchestrates the construction of its own ligand from fragments featuring complementary reactive functionalities. Notably, fragments interacting with the protein binding sites leverage their spatial proximity, facilitating a preferential reaction. Consequently, the resulting bivalent ligand exhibits heightened affinity. Within the realm of KTGS strategies, in situ click chemistry stands out as the most widely used to identify potent protein binders. This approach requires significant protein contributions, such as binding interactions and appropriate orientations of fragments, to overcome high activation barriers. This leads to prolonged incubation times and the potential for generating false negatives, thereby limiting this strategy to proteins that are stable enough in buffer. We herein unveil the possibility to integrate photochemistry into the realm of KTGS, accelerating the ligation reaction between fragments to a time scale of minutes. This approach should significantly expand the narrow reactivity window of traditional KTGS reactions, paving the way for the exploration and development of novel photo&#8208;KTGS reactions.

         <title>Enhancing Anion&#8208;Selective Catalysis for Stable Lithium Metal Pouch Cells through Charge Separated COF Interlayer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective catalysis anionic decomposition strategy for Li metal anode is reported by charge&#8208;separated TP&#8208;COF. The strong adsorption between TP&#8208;COF and FSI&#8722; lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of FSI&#8722;, accelerating the decomposition of FSI&#8722; and generating a stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries were achieved under realistic conditions.







Abstract
Regulating the composition of solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (SEI) is the key to construct high&#8208;energy density lithium metal batteries. Here we report a selective catalysis anionic decomposition strategy to achieve a lithium fluoride (LiF)&#8208;rich SEI for stable lithium metal batteries. To accomplish this, the tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl) amine&#8208;pyromeletic dianhydride covalent organic frameworks (TP&#8208;COF) was adopted as an interlayer on lithium metal anode. The strong donor&#8208;acceptor unit structure of TP&#8208;COF induces local charge separation, resulting in electron depletion and thus boosting its affinity to FSI&#8722;. The strong interaction between TP&#8208;COF and FSI&#8722; lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of FSI&#8722;, accelerating the decomposition of FSI&#8722; and generating a stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI. This feature facilitates rapid Li+ transfer and suppresses dendritic Li growth. Notably, we demonstrate a 6.5&#8197;Ah LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2|TP&#8208;COF@Li pouch cell with high energy density (473.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and excellent cycling stability (97.4&#8201;%, 95&#8197;cycles) under lean electrolyte 1.39&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, high areal capacity 5.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and high current density 2.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our selective catalysis strategy opens a promising avenue toward the practical applications of high energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks&#8208;based Electrolytes with Controllable Hydrogen Bonding Networks for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A HOF&#8208;based novel solid&#8208;state electrolyte was constructed by taking advantage of the abundant multisite hydrogen bonding and stabilizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions in HOF&#8208;DAT. Benefiting from the abundant C=O groups in the HOF backbone as ion hopping sites and the flexible hydrogen bonding skeleton of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs, a fast Li+ ion conductivity (2.2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), a high Li+ transference number (0.88), and a wide electrochemical window of 5.05&#8197;V were achieved.







Abstract
The lack of stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high&#8208;ionic conductivity and the rational design of electrode/electrolyte interfaces remains challenging for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here, for the first time, a high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) battery is developed based on the Li&#8208;ion&#8208;conducted hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (LHOF) electrolyte and the HOF&#8208;DAT@CNT composite cathode. Benefiting from the abundant dynamic hydrogen bonding network in the backbone of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs, fast Li+ ion transport (2.2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), a high Li+ transference number (0.88), and a wide electrochemical window of 5.05&#8197;V are achieved. Symmetric batteries constructed with LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs exhibit a stably cycled duration of over 1400&#8197;h with uniform deposition, which mainly stems from the jumping sites that promote a uniformly high rate of Li+ flux and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network structure that can relieve the structural changes during Li+ transport. LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs&#8208;based Li&#8722;O2 batteries exhibit high specific capacity (10335&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and stable cycling life up to 150 cycles. Moreover, the solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery with LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs endow good rate capability (129.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (210 cycles). The design of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs opens an avenue for the development of novel SSEs&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Oxidation of Ammonia Catalyzed by a Molecular Iron Complex: Translating Chemical Catalysis to Mediated Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of using a molecular mediator in the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to N2 is reported. An iron electrocatalyst bearing a macrocyclic ligand with four N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors functions at low temperatures (&#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C) and retains high reactivity even at extremely low loadings (approximately 0.043&#8197;mM; 0.004&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of the Fe catalyst.







Abstract
Ammonia is a promising candidate in the quest for sustainable, clean energy. With its capacity to serve as an energy carrier, the oxidation of ammonia opens avenues for carbon&#8208;neutral approaches to address worldwide growing energy needs. We report the catalytic chemical oxidation of ammonia by an Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal complex, trans&#8208;[LFeII(MeCN)2][PF6]2, where L is a macrocyclic ligand bearing four N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors. Using triarylaminium radical cations in MeCN, up to 182 turnovers of N2 per Fe were obtained from chemical catalysis with an extremely low loading of the Fe catalyst (0.043&#8197;mM, 0.004&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst). This chemical catalysis was successfully transitioned to mediated electrocatalysis for the oxidation of ammonia. Molecular electrocatalysis by the Fe catalyst and the mediator (p&#8208;MeOC6H4)3N exhibited a catalytic half&#8208;wave potential (Ecat/2) of 0.18&#8197;V vs [Cp2Fe]+/0 in MeCN, and achieved 9.3 turnovers of N2 at an applied potential of 0.20&#8197;V vs [Cp2Fe]+/0 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C in controlled&#8208;potential electrolysis, with a Faradaic efficiency of 75&#8201;%. Based on computational results, the catalyst undergoes sequential oxidation and deprotonation steps to form [LFeIV(NH2)2]2+, and thereafter bimetallic coupling to form an N&#8722;N bond.

&lt;p&gt;The first example of using a molecular mediator in the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reported. An iron electrocatalyst bearing a macrocyclic ligand with four &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors functions at low temperatures (&#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C) and retains high reactivity even at extremely low loadings (approximately 0.043&#8197;mM; 0.004&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of the Fe catalyst.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia is a promising candidate in the quest for sustainable, clean energy. With its capacity to serve as an energy carrier, the oxidation of ammonia opens avenues for carbon-neutral approaches to address worldwide growing energy needs. We report the catalytic chemical oxidation of ammonia by an Earth-abundant transition metal complex, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;[LFe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(MeCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, where L is a macrocyclic ligand bearing four &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors. Using triarylaminium radical cations in MeCN, up to 182 turnovers of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per Fe were obtained from chemical catalysis with an extremely low loading of the Fe catalyst (0.043&#8197;mM, 0.004&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst). This chemical catalysis was successfully transitioned to mediated electrocatalysis for the oxidation of ammonia. Molecular electrocatalysis by the Fe catalyst and the mediator (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-MeOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N exhibited a catalytic half-wave potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat/2&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.18&#8197;V vs [Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe]&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt; in MeCN, and achieved 9.3 turnovers of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at an applied potential of 0.20&#8197;V vs [Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe]&lt;sup&gt;+/0&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C in controlled-potential electrolysis, with a Faradaic efficiency of 75&#8201;%. Based on computational results, the catalyst undergoes sequential oxidation and deprotonation steps to form &lt;b&gt;[LFe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>Stable Lithium Oxygen Batteries Enabled by Solvent&#8208;diluent Interaction in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide&#8208;based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally selected methyl nonafluorobutyl ether (M3) diluent is introduced into the N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA)&#8208;based electrolyte to construct a localized high concentration electrolyte. The interaction between the DMA solvent and M3 diluent increases the coordination number of Li+&#8208;anions, facilitating the formation of an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase to improve the Li metal stability and consequently realizing stable and high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;O2 batteries.







Abstract
In the pursuit of next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8722;O2 batteries, it is imperative to develop an electrolyte with stability against the strong oxidation environments. N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA) is a recognized solvent known for its robust resistance to the highly reactive reduced oxygen species, yet its application in Li&#8722;O2 batteries has been constrained due to its poor compatibility with the Li metal anode. In this study, a rationally selected hydrofluoroether diluent, methyl nonafluorobutyl ether (M3), has been introduced into the DMA&#8208;based electrolyte to construct a localized high concentration electrolyte. The stable &#8722;CH3 and C&#8722;F bonds within the M3 structure could not only augment the fundamental properties of the electrolyte but also fortify its resilience against attacks from O2&#8722; and 1O2. Additionally, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;F) presented in the M3 diluent could facilitate coordination with the electron&#8208;donating groups (&#8722;CH3) in the DMA solvent. This intermolecular interaction promotes more alignments of Li+&#8208;anions with a small amount of M3 addition, leading to the construction of an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI that enhances the stability of the Li anode. As a result, the Li&#8722;O2 batteries with the DMA/M3 electrolyte exhibit superior cycling performance at both 30&#8201;&#176;C (359th) and &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C (120th).

         <title>Dearomative Construction of 2D/3D Frameworks from Quinolines via Nucleophilic Addition/Borate&#8208;Mediated Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative construction of triply&#8208;fused 2D/3D frameworks was achieved from quinolines via nucleophilic addition and borate&#8208;mediated photocycloaddition in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective manner. The borate complex accelerates the photocycloaddition and suppresses rearomatization in the excited state. Based on mechanistic analysis, further photoinduced cycloadditions affording other types of 2D/3D frameworks from isoquinoline and phenanthrene are also developed.







Abstract
Dearomative construction of multiply&#8208;fused 2D/3D frameworks, composed of aromatic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rings and saturated three&#8208;dimensional (3D) rings, from readily available quinolines has greatly contributed to drug discovery. However, dearomative cycloadditions of quinolines in the presence of photocatalysts usually afford 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline (THQ)&#8208;based polycycles, and dearomative access to 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQ&#8208;based structures remains limited. Herein, we present a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective dearomative transformation of quinolines into 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQ&#8208;based 6&#8211;6&#8211;4&#8208;membered rings without any catalyst, through a combination of nucleophilic addition and borate&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the photoexcited borate complex, generated from quinoline, organolithium, and HB(pin), accelerates the cycloaddition and suppresses the rearomatization that usually occurs in conventional photocycloaddition. Based on our mechanistic analysis, we also developed further photoinduced cycloadditions affording other types of 2D/3D frameworks from isoquinoline and phenanthrene.

         <title>Benign and Selective Amination of Lignins towards Aromatic Biobased Building Blocks with Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research article presents two new benign methodologies to access reactive and soluble lignin&#8208;based polyamines. The aminated lignin products have potential as renewable building blocks in aromatic polymeric materials or as potential chelating, antibacterial agents, for instance.







Abstract
Lignin is a widely available second&#8208;generation biopolymer and the main potential source of renewable aromatic building blocks. Lignin&#8208;based polyamines offer great potential in applications based on chemical and materials sciences. However, common aminations techniques for lignin usually involve toxic chemicals and generate hindered and low reactivity amines.
In this study, we developed two new, simple, and benign 2&#8208;step methodologies for the elaboration of lignin&#8208;based polyamines from different technical lignins (kraft, soda and organosolv) with a selectivity towards reactive primary amines. These methods involve grafting amide groups onto lignin followed by a hydrolysis step. Non&#8208;toxic heterocyclic compounds N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline were used as amidation agents. Hydrolysis was performed in acetone&#8208;water mixtures. Reactions were studied on model compounds and optimized on lignins. Aminated lignins were fully characterized and primary amines were quantified using quantitative 19F&#8197;NMR.
Our methods generated aminated lignins with low apparent molar masses and high solubility in water and solvents. Nitrogen contents of the products ranged between 2.0 and 3.5&#8197;mmol/g with reactive primary amines counts up to 1.7&#8197;mmol/g. These soluble and reactive lignin&#8208;based polyamines offer great potential as a replacement for fossil&#8208;based polyamines in e.g., the synthesis of aromatic polymer materials or as potential chelating, antibacterial agents.

The unique cascaded dual&#8208;cavity boride nanoreactor is rationally designed as a sulfur host, which achieves controlled catalysis in the heterogeneous catalytic system of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The coupling between atoms regulates catalyst activity and suppresses Li2S passivation. The mechanism and application investigation of nanoreactor provides a guiding strategy for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
The catalytic process of Li2S formation is considered a key pathway to enhance the kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Due to the system&#8216;s complexity, the catalytic behavior is uncertain, posing significant challenges for predicting activity. Herein, we report a novel cascaded dual&#8208;cavity nanoreactor (NiCo&#8722;B) by controlling reaction kinetics, providing an opportunity for achieving hierarchical catalytic behavior. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, the multilevel structure can effectively suppress polysulfides dissolution and accelerate sulfur conversion. Furthermore, we differentiate the adsorption (B&#8722;S) and catalytic effect (Co&#8722;S) in NiCo&#8722;B, avoiding catalyst deactivation caused by excessive adsorption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared battery displays high reversible capacity, even with sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (E/S=4&#8197;&#956;l&#8201;mg&#8722;1), the areal capacity can reach 18.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Steam&#8208;Assisted Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol over Ru&#8722;In Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru/In2O3&#8208;ZrO2 was found to be active for ethanol production from CO2 hydrogenation, but ethanol productivity decreased substantially after several hours of reaction due to the excessive reduction of In species. With the addition of steam as a mild oxidant and using porous polymer layers to control In mobility, Ru&#8722;In2O3 interface sites were stabilized, and ethanol could be produced with superior overall selectivity (70&#8201;%, rest CO).







Abstract
Multicomponent catalysts can be designed to synergistically combine reaction intermediates at interfacial active sites, but restructuring makes systematic control and understanding of such dynamics challenging. We here unveil how reducibility and mobility of indium oxide species in Ru&#8208;based catalysts crucially control the direct, selective conversion of CO2 to ethanol. When uncontrolled, reduced indium oxide species occupy the Ru surface, leading to deactivation. With the addition of steam as a mild oxidant and using porous polymer layers to control In mobility, Ru&#8722;In2O3 interface sites are stabilized, and ethanol can be produced with superior overall selectivity (70&#8201;%, rest CO). Our work highlights how engineering of bifunctional active ensembles enables cooperativity and synergy at tailored interfaces, which unlocks unprecedented performance in heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>The Role of Phosphorus on Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis for Ruthenium Phosphides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaline HOR performance of ruthenium&#8208;based phosphides were explored to investigate the catalytic role of phosphorus. P&#8208;species induced orbital overlap and d&#8208;band structure regulation would optimally enhance the hydroxyl binding energy under moderate P&#8208;content, which increase the proportion of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water with improved connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bond network and subsequently boost the HOR kinetics.







Abstract
Transition metal/p&#8208;block compounds are regarded as the most essential materials for electrochemical energy converting systems involving various electrocatalysis. Understanding the role of p&#8208;block element on the interaction of key intermediates and interfacial water molecule orientation at the polarized catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface during the electrocatalysis is important for rational designing advanced p&#8208;block modified metal electrocatalysts. Herein, taking a sequence of ruthenium phosphides (including Ru2P, RuP and RuP2) as model catalysts, we establish a volcanic&#8208;relation between P&#8208;proportion and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity. The dominant role of P for regulating hydroxyl binding energy is validated by active sites poisoning experiments, pH&#8208;dependent infection&#8208;point behavior, in situ surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, in which P could tailor the d&#8208;band structure of Ru, optimize the hydroxyl adsorption sites across the Ru&#8722;P moieties, thereby leading to improved proportion of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water and facilitated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process, which are responsible for the enhanced alkaline HOR performance.

         <title>DNA Logical Computing on a Transistor for Cancer Molecular Diagnosis</title>

A transistor&#8208;based DNA molecular computing platform that is capable of simultaneously detecting multiple microRNAs and rapidly providing diagnostic results through built&#8208;in logic computing. The platform enables both accurate and efficient diagnosis of cancers, showing great potential in precision medicine and personalized therapy.







Abstract
Given the high degree of variability and complexity of cancer, precise monitoring and logical analysis of different nucleic acid markers are crucial for improving diagnostic precision and patient survival rates. However, existing molecular diagnostic methods normally suffer from high cost, cumbersome procedures, dependence on specialized equipment and the requirement of in&#8208;depth expertise in data analysis, failing to analyze multiple cancer&#8208;associated nucleic acid markers and provide immediate results in a point&#8208;of&#8208;care manner. Herein, we demonstrate a transistor&#8208;based DNA molecular computing (TDMC) platform that enables simultaneous detection and logical analysis of multiple microRNA (miRNA) markers on a single transistor. TDMC can perform not only basic logical operations such as &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;, but also complex cascading computing, opening up new dimensions for multi&#8208;index logical analysis. Owing to the high efficiency, sensing and computations of multi&#8208;analytes can be operated on a transistor at a concentration as low as 2&#215;10&#8722;16 M, reaching the lowest concentration for DNA molecular computing. Thus, TDMC achieves an accuracy of 98.4&#8201;% in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma from 62 serum samples. As a convenient and accurate platform, TDMC holds promise for applications in &#8220;one&#8208;stop&#8221; personalized medicine.

         <title>Enabling Efficient Anchoring&#8208;Conversion Interface by Fabricating Double&#8208;Layer Functionalized Separator for Suppressing Shuttle Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel double&#8208;layer strategy to functionalize separators is proposed, where Co/CoN4 layer serves as adsorption&#8208;catalytic centers for high&#8208;order and low&#8208;order LiPSs, combined with 2D MXene layer that acts as the second barrier for additional leaked LiPSs, and thus a circulation interface of adsorption&#8208;conversion&#8208;reactivation of S species has been realized, effectively alleviating the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur/selenium batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LiSBs) with high energy density still face challenges on sluggish conversion kinetics, severe shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and low blocking feature of ordinary separators to LiPSs. To tackle these, a novel double&#8208;layer strategy to functionalize separators is proposed, which consists of Co with atomically dispersed CoN4 decorated on Ketjen black (Co/CoN4@KB) layer and an ultrathin 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene layer. The theoretical calculations and experimental results jointly demonstrate metallic Co sites provide efficient adsorption and catalytic capability for long&#8208;chain LiPSs, while CoN4 active sites facilitate the absorption of short&#8208;chain LiPSs and promote the conversion to Li2S. The stacking MXene layer serves as a microscopic barrier to further physically block and chemically anchor the leaked LiPSs from the pores and gaps of the Co/CoN4@KB layer, thus preserving LiPSs within efficient anchoring&#8208;conversion reaction interfaces to balance the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8197;S&#8221; and Li2S. Consequently, with an ultralight loading of Co/CoN4@KB&#8208;MXene, the LiSBs exhibit amazing electrochemical performance even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte, and the outperforming performance for lithium&#8208;selenium batteries (LiSeBs) can also be achieved. This work exploits a universal and effective strategy of a double&#8208;layer functionalized separator to regulate the equilibrium adsorption&#8208;catalytic interface, enabling high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycle LiSBs/LiSeBs.

The theoretical calculations and experimental results jointly demonstrate metallic Co sites provide efficient adsorption and catalytic capability for long-chain LiPSs, while CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; active sites facilitate the absorption of short-chain LiPSs and promote the conversion to Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. The stacking MXene layer serves as a microscopic barrier to further physically block and chemically anchor the leaked LiPSs from the pores and gaps of the Co/CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@KB layer, thus preserving LiPSs within efficient anchoring-conversion reaction interfaces to balance the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8197;S&#8221; and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. Consequently, with an ultralight loading of Co/CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@KB-MXene, the LiSBs exhibit amazing electrochemical performance even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte, and the outperforming performance for lithium-selenium batteries (LiSeBs) can also be achieved. This work exploits a universal and effective strategy of a double-layer functionalized separator to regulate the equilibrium adsorption-catalytic interface, enabling high-energy and long-cycle LiSBs/LiSeBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of a Fluorescent Probe with High Selectivity based on Thiol&#8208;ene Click Nucleophilic Cascade Reactions for Delving into the Action Mechanism of Serotonin in Depression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to achieve rapid and accurate detection of serotonin in organisms is a key question in studying the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders such as depression. To study the action mechanism of serotonin, we have developed a highly selective molecular probe based on thiol&#8208;ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions that enables real&#8208;time imaging of brain tissues in depression.







Abstract
The intrinsic correlation between depression and serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is a highly debated topic, with significant implications for the diagnosis, treatment, and advancement of drugs targeting neurological disorders. To address this important question, it is of utmost priority to understand the action mechanism of serotonin in depression through fluorescence imaging studies. However, the development of efficient molecular probes for serotonin is hindered by the lack of responsive sites with high selectivity for serotonin at the present time. Herein, we developed the first highly selective serotonin responsive site, 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate, utilizing thiol&#8208;ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions. The novel responsive site was then employed to construct the powerful molecular probe SJ&#8208;5&#8208;HT for imaging the serotonin level changes in the depression cells and brain tissues. Importantly, the imaging studies reveal that the level of serotonin in patients with depression may not be the primary factor, while the ability of neurons in patients with depression to release serotonin appears to be more critical. Additionally, this serotonin release capability correlates strongly with the levels of mTOR (intracellular mammalian target of rapamycin). These discoveries could offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning depression and furnish mTOR as a novel direction for the advancement of antidepressant therapies.

Here we explored the decay of the molecule upon electron attachment. The main dissociation processes of the formed anion are characterized by loss of either a bromine atom or a NO2 group, both competing for the excess electron.

Abstract
2&#8208;Bromo&#8208;1&#8208;(3,3&#8208;dinitroazetidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;one (RRx&#8208;001) is a hypoxic cell chemotherapeutics with already demonstrated synergism in combined chemo&#8208;radiation therapy. The interaction of the compound with secondary low&#8208;energy electrons formed in large amounts during the physico&#8208;chemical phase of the irradiation may lead to these synergistic effects. The present study focuses on the first step of RRx&#8208;001 interaction with low&#8208;energy electrons in which a transient anion is formed and fragmented. Combination of two experiments allows us to disentangle the decay of the RRx&#8208;001 anion on different timescales. Sole presence of the electron initiates rapid dissociation of NO2 and HNO2 neutrals while NO2&#8722; and Br&#8722; anions are produced both directly and via intermediate complexes. Based on our quantum chemical calculations, we propose that bidirectional state switching between &#960;*(NO2) and &#963;*(C&#8722;Br) states explains the experimental spectra. The fast dynamics monitored will impact the condensed phase chemistry of the anion as well.

         <title>Fluorinated Dialkyl Chloronium Salts: Synthesis and Reactivity for Fluoroalkylation and Hydride Abstraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the synthesis of highly electrophilic fluorinated dialkyl chloronium salts [Cl(CH2CF3)2][M(OTeF5)n] (M=Sb, n=6; M=Al, n=4), which are able to alkylate weak nucleophiles, while their high hydride ion affinity enables the activation of linear alkanes leading to the formation of branched carbocations.







Abstract
A new concept for the synthesis of dialkyl chloronium cations [R&#8722;Cl&#8722;R]+ is described (R=CH3, CH2CF3), that allows the formation of fluorinated derivatives. By utilizing the xenonium salt [XeOTeF5][M(OTeF5)n] (M=Sb, n=6; M=Al, n=4) chlorine atoms of chloroalkanes or the deactivated chlorofluoroalkane CH2ClCF3 are oxidized and removed as ClOTeF5 leading to the isolation of the corresponding chloronium salt. Since the resulting highly electrophilic cation [Cl(CH2CF3)2]+ is able to alkylate weak nucleophiles, this compound can be utilized for the introduction of a fluorinated alkyl group to those. In addition, the fluorinated alkyl chloronium cation displays a high hydride ion affinity, enabling the activation of linear hydrocarbons by hydride abstraction even at low temperatures ultimately leading to the formation of branched carbocations.

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Cu Penetration Electrode Boosts Asymmetric C&#8722;C Coupling for Ampere&#8208;Level CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ Reduction in Acid</title>

         <dc:description>
Tensile&#8208;strained copper hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (Cu HPE) enhances the asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling to steer the selectivity and activity of multicarbon (C2+) products. A faradaic efficiency of 84.5&#8201;% and a partial current density as high as 3.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for C2+ products, alongside a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 81.5&#8201;% and stable electrolysis for 240&#8197;h were demonstrated in a strong acidic electrolyte (pH=1).







Abstract
The synthesis of multicarbon (C2+) products remains a substantial challenge in sustainable CO2 electroreduction owing to the need for sufficient current density and faradaic efficiency alongside carbon efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate ampere&#8208;level high&#8208;efficiency CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products in both neutral and strongly acidic (pH=1) electrolytes using a hierarchical Cu hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE). High concentration of K+ could concurrently suppress hydrogen evolution reaction and facilitate C&#8722;C coupling, thereby promoting C2+ production in strong acid. By optimizing the K+ and H+ concentration and CO2 flow rate, a faradaic efficiency of 84.5&#8201;% and a partial current density as high as 3.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for C2+ products, alongside a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 81.5&#8201;% and stable electrolysis for 240&#8197;h were demonstrated in a strong acidic solution of H2SO4 and KCl (pH=1). Experimental measurements and density functional theory simulations suggested that tensile&#8208;strained Cu HPE enhances the asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling to steer the selectivity and activity of C2+ products.

By optimizing the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flow rate, a faradaic efficiency of 84.5&#8201;% and a partial current density as high as 3.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products, alongside a single-pass carbon efficiency of 81.5&#8201;% and stable electrolysis for 240&#8197;h were demonstrated in a strong acidic solution of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and KCl (pH=1). Experimental measurements and density functional theory simulations suggested that tensile-strained Cu HPE enhances the asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling to steer the selectivity and activity of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Solid Electrolyte Interface via Dual Reaction Strategy for Highly Reversible Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin layered solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is in situ constructed by dual reaction strategy, which synergistically utilizes spontaneous electrostatic reaction and electrochemical decomposition via introducing the functional additive CMIM (1&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride). CMIM&#8242;s unique molecular structure also enables the disruption of hydrogen bonding, guides uniform Zn2+ deposition, and promotes rapid ion transfer to enhance battery stability, thus affording highly reversible queous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
In situ construction of solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) is an effective strategy to enhance the reversibility of zinc (Zn) anodes. However, in situ SEI to afford high reversibility under high current density conditions (&#8805;20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) is highly desired yet extremely challenging. Herein, we propose a dual reaction strategy of spontaneous electrostatic reaction and electrochemical decomposition for the in situ construction of SEI, which is composed of organic&#8208;rich upper layer and inorganic&#8208;rich inner layer. Particularly, in situ SEI performs as &#8220;growth binder&#8220; at small current density and &#8220;orientation regulator&#8221; at high current density, which significantly suppresses side reactions and dendrite growth. The in situ SEI affords the record&#8208;breaking reversibility of Zn anode under practical conditions, Zn//Zn symmetric cells can stably cycle for over 1300&#8197;h and 400&#8197;h at current densities of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, showcasing an exceptional cumulative capacity of 67.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the practicality of this in situ SEI is verified in Zn//PANI pouch cells with high mass loading of 25.48&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a universal strategy to design advanced SEI for practical Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Photocatalytic Multisite Functionalization of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes by Merging Polar Cycloaddition and Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is established by merging dipolar cycloaddition with photoredox promoted radical ring&#8208;opening remote C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. This transformation was triggered by XAT followed by a cascade of 1,5&#8208;HAT and intermolecular fluorine atom transfer. With this method, a broad spectrum of valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;nitrile products are synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes.







Abstract
Although highly appealing for rapid access of molecular complexity, multi&#8208;functionalization of alkenes that allows incorporation of more than two functional groups remains a prominent challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy that merges dipolar cycloaddition with photoredox promoted radical ring&#8208;opening remote C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, thus enabling a smooth 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes. A highly regioselective [3+2] cycloaddition anchors a reaction trigger onto alkene substrates. The subsequent halogen atom transfer (XAT) selectively initiates ring&#8208;opening process, which is followed by a series of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8208;HAT) and intermolecular fluorine atom transfer (FAT) events. With this method, site&#8208;selective introduction of three different functional groups is accomplished and a broad spectrum of valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;nitrile products are synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes.

         <title>From Ultrafast Photoinduced Small Polarons to Cooperative and Macroscopic Charge&#8208;Transfer Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond infrared spectroscopy is used to study the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium dynamics of the ultrafast and persistent photoinduced phase transition of the Rb0.94Mn0.94Co0.06[Fe(CN)6]0.98&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.2H2O material, induced at room temperature. The data show that optical excitation creates small CT polarons within 250&#8197;fs. Above threshold excitation, a cooperative and macroscopic phase transition occurs on the 100&#8197;ps timescale.







Abstract
We study by femtosecond infrared spectroscopy the ultrafast and persistent photoinduced phase transition of the Rb0.94Mn0.94Co0.06[Fe(CN)6]0.98&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.2H2O material, induced at room temperature by a single laser shot. This system exhibits a charge&#8208;transfer based phase transition with a 75&#8197;K wide thermal hysteresis, centred at room temperature, from the low temperature Mn3+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe2+ tetragonal phase to the high temperature Mn2+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe3+ cubic phase. At room temperature, the photoinduced phase transition is persistent. However, the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium dynamics leading to this phase is multi&#8208;scale. Femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, particularly sensitive to local reorganizations through the evolution of the frequency of the N&#8722;C vibration modes with the different characteristic electronic states, reveals that at low laser fluence and on short time scale, the photoexcitation of the Mn3+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe2+ phase creates small charge&#8208;transfer polarons [Mn2+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe3+]* within &#8771;250&#8197;fs. The local trapping of photoinduced intermetallic charge&#8208;transfer is characterized by the appearance of a polaronic infrared band, due to the surrounding Mn2+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe2+ species. Above a threshold fluence, when a critical fraction of small CT&#8208;polarons is reached, the macroscopic phase transition to the persistent Mn2+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe3+ cubic phase occurs within &#8771; 100&#8197;ps. This non&#8208;linear photo&#8208;response results from elastic cooperativity, intrinsic to a switchable lattice and reminiscent of a feedback mechanism.

         <title>Solvent Minimized Synthesis of Amides by Reactive Extrusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct amidation of esters is converted from a ball&#8208;milled process into a continuous solvent&#8208;minimised reactive extrusion protocol capable of delivering 500&#8197;grams (1.3&#8197;mols) of amide product over a continuous operation for 7&#8197;hours. Key to this, was translation of heating profiles used for the ball&#8208;milling study directly to the extruder and consideration of the physical form of input substrates.







Abstract
Herein, we report on the translation of a small scale ball&#8208;milled amidation protocol into a large scale continuous reactive extrusion process. Critical components to the successful translation were: a) understanding how the different operating parameters of a twin&#8208;screw extruder should be harnessed to control prolonged continuous operation, and b) consideration of the physical form of the input materials. The amidation reaction is applied to 36 amides spanning a variety of physical form combinations (liquid&#8208;liquid, solid&#8211;liquid and solid&#8208;solid). Following this learning process, we have developed an understanding for the translation of each physical form combination and demonstrated a 7&#8208;hour reactive extrusion process for the synthesis of an amide on 500&#8197;gram scale (1.3&#8197;mols of product).

&lt;p&gt;The direct amidation of esters is converted from a ball-milled process into a continuous solvent-minimised reactive extrusion protocol capable of delivering 500&#8197;grams (1.3&#8197;mols) of amide product over a continuous operation for 7&#8197;hours. Key to this, was translation of heating profiles used for the ball-milling study directly to the extruder and consideration of the physical form of input substrates.

         <title>A Chemoselective Enrichment Strategy for In&#8208;Depth Coverage of the Methyllysine Proteome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate lysine methylation comprehensively, a robust method for Kme1 enrichment was established. Dimethoxyaryl diazonium crosslinked Kme1 with high reactivity and selectivity among tryptic peptides from cell samples. As a result, over 10000&#8197;Kme1 sites were identified by proteomic analysis. Furthermore, we found a significant amount of methyl marks that were not S&#8208;adenosyl methionine&#8208;dependent by isotope labeling experiments.







Abstract
Proteomics is a powerful method to comprehensively understand cellular posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Owing to low abundance, tryptic peptides with PTMs are usually enriched for enhanced coverage by liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC&#8211;MS/MS). Affinity chromatography for phosphoproteomes by metal&#8208;oxide and pan&#8208;specific antibodies for lysine acetylome allow identification of tens of thousands of modification sites. Lysine methylation is a significant PTM; however, only hundreds of methylation sites were identified by available approaches. Herein we report an aryl diazonium based chemoselective strategy that enables enrichment of monomethyllysine (Kme1) peptides through covalent bonds with extraordinary sensitivity. We identified more than 10000 Kme1 peptides from diverse cell lines and mouse tissues, which implied a wide lysine methylation impact on cellular processes. Furthermore, we found a significant amount of methyl marks that were not S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent by isotope labeling experiments.

         <title>Targeting Mitochondrial Guanine Quadruplexes for Photoactivatable Chemotherapy in Hypoxic Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an oxygen independent photoactivatable chemotherapeutic, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3, that targets mitochondrial guanine quadruplexes. Photoirradiation induces depletion of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial dysfunction causing cell death by triggering apoptosis. Importantly, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 is negligibly toxic under dark conditions but upon irradiation, significant toxicity is observed.







Abstract
A first example of a mitochondrial G&#8208;quadruplex (mitoG4s) targeted Ru(II) photooxidant complex is reported. The complex, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 induces photodamage toward guanine quadruplexes (G4s) located in the mitochondrial genome under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 shows high affinity for mitoG4s and localises within mitochondria of live HeLa cells. Immunolabelling with anti&#8208;G4 antibody, BG4, confirms Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 associates with G4s within the mitochondria of fixed cells. The complex induces depletion of mtDNA in live cells under irradiation at 405&#8197;nm, confirmed by loss of PicoGreen signal from mitochondria. Biochemical studies confirm this process induces apoptosis. The complex shows low dark toxicity and an impressive phototoxicity index (PI) of &gt;89 was determined in Hela under very low intensity irradiation, 5&#8197;J/cm2. The phototoxicity is thought to operate through both Type&#8197;II singlet oxygen and Type&#8197;III pathways depending on normoxic or hypoxic conditions, from live cell assays and plasmid DNA cleavage. Overall, we demonstrate targeting mitoG4s and mtDNA with a photooxidant is a potent route to achieving apoptosis under hypoxic conditions that can be extended to phototherapy.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Specific Interactions Engender Dynamic and Tailorable Properties in Biomimetic Cationic Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural biomaterials such as spider silk and mussel byssi are fabricated by the chemoresponsive phase separation of biomacromolecules. Inspired by these biofabrication schemes, this work demonstrates that ion&#8208;specific interactions between cationic polyelectrolytes and ionic cosolutes offers new opportunities to control the assembly, structure, and dynamic physical properties of soft matter.







Abstract
Biomaterials such as spider silk and mussel byssi are fabricated by the dynamic manipulation of intra&#8208; and intermolecular biopolymer interactions. Organisms modulate solution parameters, such as pH and ion co&#8208;solute concentration, to effect these processes. These biofabrication schemes provide a conceptual framework to develop new dynamic and responsive abiotic soft material systems. Towards these ends, the chemical diversity of readily available ionic compounds offers a broad palette to manipulate the physicochemical properties of polyelectrolytes via ion&#8208;specific interactions. In this study, we show for the first time that the ion&#8208;specific interactions of biomimetic polyelectrolytes engenders a variety of phase separation behaviors, creating dynamic thermal&#8208; and ion&#8208;responsive soft matter that exhibits a spectrum of physical properties, spanning viscous fluids to viscoelastic and viscoplastic solids. These ion&#8208;dependent characteristics are further rendered general by the merger of lysine and phenylalanine into a single, amphiphilic vinyl monomer. The unprecedented breadth, precision, and dynamicity in the reported ion&#8208;dependent phase behaviors thus introduce a broad array of opportunities for the future development of responsive soft matter; properties that are poised to drive developments in critical areas such as chemical sensing, soft robotics, and additive manufacturing.

         <title>Butadiene Sulfone Based Binary Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A nonflammable binary DEE electrolyte comprising of LiTFSI and solid BdS is reported, which demonstrates enhanced Li metal compatibility while exhibiting high Li+ ion migration number, ionic conductivity, and wide electrochemical window for Li metal battery applications.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) have attracted significant interest due to the unique physiochemical properties, yet challenges persist in achieving satisfactory Li anode compatibility through a binary DEE formula. In this study, we introduce a nonflammable binary DEE electrolyte comprising of lithium bis(trifluoro&#8208;methane&#8208;sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and solid butadiene sulfone (BdS), which demonstrates enhanced Li metal compatibility while exhibiting high Li+ ion migration number (0.52), ionic conductivity (1.48&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1), wide electrochemical window (~4.5&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) at room temperature. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the Li compatibility derives from the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich SEI, attributed to the undesirable adsorption and deformation of BdS on Li surface that facilitates the preferential reactions between LiTFSI and Li metal. This stable SEI effectively suppresses dendrites growth and gas evolution reactions, ensuring a long lifespan and high coulombic efficiency in both the Li||Li symmetric cells, Li||LiCoO2 and Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells. Moreover, the BdS eutectic strategy exhibit universal applicability to other metal such as Na and Zn by pairing with the corresponding TFSI&#8208;based salts.

         <title>First Main&#8208;Group Element Lewis Acid Thionyl Chloride Adduct and its Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of adducts of tris(pentafluoroethyl)gallium and &#8208;indium, M(C2F5)3 (M=Ga, In) with weak donor molecules, particularly of the first structurally characterized thionyl chloride adduct of a main group element Lewis acid. [Ga(C2F5)3(SOCl2)] is accessible by dehydration of [Ga(C2F5)3(OH2)2] with thionyl chloride.







Abstract
Although the adduct of aluminum trichloride with thionyl chloride has been reported, no thionyl chloride adduct of a main group element Lewis acid or organometallic compound has been structurally characterized. In this communication we present the synthesis and reactivity of the structurally ascertained adduct of thionyl chloride with tris(pentafluoroethyl)gallane as a representative of a main group element Lewis acid. Gallium and indium compounds with electron withdrawing groups, e.g. the pentafluoroethyl ligand, display versatile properties. While gallates and indates, [MR4]&#8722;, behave as weakly coordinating anions, neutral gallanes and indanes, MR3, are strong Lewis acids. Salts with the tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate and &#8208;indate, [M(C2F5)4]&#8722; (M=Ga, In), have recently been studied in detail. In contrast to this, work on the syntheses of the free Lewis superacids M(C2F5)3 (M=Ga, In) is scarce and underdeveloped. The hydrates [M(C2F5)3(OH2)2] proved to be suitable starting materials, particularly due to their thermal stability. Herein we report on synthesis and characterization of reactive adducts, [M(C2F5)3D], with the weak donor molecules (D) SOCl2 and Me3SiF. The effective Lewis acidities of Ga(C2F5)3 and In(C2F5)3 were experimentally determined by the (modified) Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and their catalytic potential is showcased.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Triggered H&#8208;Abstraction Photoinitiators for the Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Independent Therapy of Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first red&#8208;light triggered H&#8208;abstraction photoinitiators for hypoxic cancer photodynamic therapy. The photoinitiator can initiate red&#8208;light&#8208;induced H&#8208;abstraction with intracellular biomolecules to induce necroptosis and ferroptosis. Moreover, photoinitiator was degraded following H&#8208;abstraction, avoiding the long&#8208;term phototoxicity. This study provides a crucial molecular strategy for hypoxic tumor therapy.







Abstract
The clinical application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is limited by oxygen&#8208;dependence and side effects caused by photosensitizer residues. Photoinitiators based on the H&#8208;abstraction reaction can address these challenges because they can generate alkyl radical&#8208;killing cells independently of oxygen and undergo rapid bleaching following H&#8208;abstraction. Nonetheless, the development of photoinitiators for PDT has been impeded by the absence of effective design strategies. Herein, we have developed aryl&#8208;ketone substituted cyanine (ACy&#8722;R), the first red&#8208;light triggered H&#8208;abstraction photoinitiators for hypoxic cancer therapy. These ACy&#8722;R molecules inherited the near&#8208;infrared absorption of cyanine dye, and aryl&#8208;ketone modification imparted H&#8208;abstraction capability. Experimental and quantum calculations revealed that modifying the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of the aryl (e.g., ACy&#8208;5F) improved the contribution of the O atom to the photon excitation process promoting intersystem crossing and H&#8208;abstraction ability. Particularly, ACy&#8208;5F rapidly penetrated cells and enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum. Even under severe hypoxia, ACy&#8208;5F initiated red&#8208;light induced H&#8208;abstraction with intracellular biomolecules, inducing necroptosis and ferroptosis. Moreover, ACy&#8208;5F was degraded after H&#8208;abstraction, thus avoiding the side effects of long&#8208;term phototoxicity after therapy. This study not only provides a crucial molecular tool for hypoxic tumors therapy, but also presents a promising strategy for the development of multifunctional photosensitizers and photoinitiators.

         <title>Integrating Multipolar Structures and Carboxyl Groups in sp2&#8208;Carbon Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fully conjugated sp2&#8208;c covalent organic framework integrated with multipolar structures and enrichment sites have been prepared for overall photosynthesis of H2O2. Benefiting from optimal multipolar structures and functional sites, TACOF&#8208;1&#8208;COOH facilitated charge transfer and mass movement during the photocatalysis process, leading to highly efficient ORR performance with a H2O2 production rate of 3542&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The direct production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through photocatalytic reaction via H2O and O2 is considered as an ideal approach. However, the efficiency of H2O2 generation is generally limited by insufficient charge and mass transfer. Covalent organic framework (COFs) offer a promising platform as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for H2O2 production due to their potential for rational design at the molecular level. Herein, we integrated the multipolar structures and carboxyl groups into COFs to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production in pure water without any sacrificial agents. The introduction of octupolar and quadrupolar structures, along with an increase of molecular planarity, created efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites. Meanwhile, carboxyl groups could not only boost O2 and H2O2 movement via enhancement of pore hydrophilicity, but also promote proton conduction, enabling the conversion to H2O2 from &#8901;O2&#8722;, which is the crucial intermediate product in H2O2 photocatalysis. Overall, we demonstrate that TACOF&#8208;1&#8208;COOH, consisting of optimal octupolar and quadrupolar structures, along with enrichment sites (carboxyl groups), exhibited a H2O2 yield rate of 3542&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722; 1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (SCC) efficiency of 0.55&#8201;%. This work provides valuable insights for designing metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for efficient H2O2 production.

         <title>The Reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 Nanorods for Efficient and pH&#8208;universal Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Te&#8722;Bi NRs were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 NRs under the CO2RR condition. The obtained Te&#8722;Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO2RR towards formate with high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline).







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to generate chemical fuels such as formate presents a promising route to a carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, its practical application is hindered by the competing CO production and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as the lack of pH&#8208;universal catalysts. Here, Te&#8208;modified Bi nanorods (Te&#8722;Bi NRs) were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11 NRs under the CO2RR condition. Our study illustrates that the complex reconstruction process of Bi2Te4O11 NRs during CO2RR could be decoupled into three distinct steps, i.e., the destruction of Bi2Te4O11, the formation of Te/Bi phases, and the dissolution of Te. The thus&#8208;obtained Te&#8722;Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO2RR towards formate production, showing high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline). In a flow cell reactor under neutral, alkaline, or acidic conditions, the catalysts achieved HCOOH Faradaic efficiencies of up to 94.3&#8201;%, 96.4&#8201;%, and 91.0&#8201;%, respectively, at a high current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations, along with operando spectral measurements, reveal that Te manipulates the Bi sites to an electron&#8208;deficient state, enhancing the adsorption strength of the *OCHO intermediate, and significantly suppressing the competing HER and CO production. This study highlights the substantial influence of catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions and offers insights into designing highly active and stable electrocatalysts towards CO2RR.

&lt;p&gt;Te&#8722;Bi NRs were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; NRs under the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR condition. The obtained Te&#8722;Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR towards formate with high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) to generate chemical fuels such as formate presents a promising route to a carbon-neutral future. However, its practical application is hindered by the competing CO production and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as the lack of pH-universal catalysts. Here, Te-modified Bi nanorods (Te&#8722;Bi NRs) were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; NRs under the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR condition. Our study illustrates that the complex reconstruction process of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; NRs during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR could be decoupled into three distinct steps, i.e., the destruction of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, the formation of Te/Bi phases, and the dissolution of Te. The thus-obtained Te&#8722;Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR towards formate production, showing high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline). In a flow cell reactor under neutral, alkaline, or acidic conditions, the catalysts achieved HCOOH Faradaic efficiencies of up to 94.3&#8201;%, 96.4&#8201;%, and 91.0&#8201;%, respectively, at a high current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Density functional theory calculations, along with operando spectral measurements, reveal that Te manipulates the Bi sites to an electron-deficient state, enhancing the adsorption strength of the *OCHO intermediate, and significantly suppressing the competing HER and CO production. This study highlights the substantial influence of catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions and offers insights into designing highly active and stable electrocatalysts towards CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds and In situ Photoinduced Metallic Bi0/Ni0 Accelerating Z&#8208;Scheme Charge Transfer of BiOBr@NiFe&#8208;LDH for Highly Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme junction BiOBr@NiFe&#8208;LDH with stable interface and abundant atomic&#8208;level charge transfer channels is fabricated. Bi0 and Ni0 in situ formed at the interface and surface of LDH separately act as electron mediator and electron extractor to facilitate the charge migration. The system exhibits a high charge transfer efficiency up to 71.2&#8201;%, nearly 10&#8208;fold than the BiOBr, optimizing the efficiency of photocatalytic activation of PMS for tetracycline degradation.







Abstract
For heterojunction system, the lack of stable interfacial driving force and definite charge transfer channel makes the charge separation and transfer efficiency unsatisfactory. The photoreaction mechanism occurring at the interface also receives less attention. Herein, a 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme junction BiOBr@NiFe&#8208;LDH with large&#8208;area contact featured by short interface hydrogen bonds and strong interfacial electric field (IEF) is synthesized, and in situ photoinduced metallic species assisting charge transfer mechanism is demonstrated. The hydrogen bonds between O atoms from BiOBr and H atoms from NiFe&#8208;LDH induce a significant interfacial charge redistribution, establishing a robust IEF. Notably, during photocatalytic reaction, Bi0 and Ni0 are in situ performed in heterojunction, which separately act as electron transport mediator and electron trap to further accelerate charge transfer efficiency up to 71.2&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the existence of Bi0 strengthens the IEF. Therefore, high&#8208;speed spatial charge separation is realized in Bi0/BiOBr@Ni0/NiFe&#8208;LDH, leading to a prominent photocatalytic activity with a tetracycline removal ratio of 88.3&#8201;% within 7&#8197;min under visible&#8208;light irradiation and the presence of persulfate, far exceeding majority of photocatalysts reported previously. This study provides valid insights for designing hydrogen bonding heterojunction systems, and advances mechanistic understanding on in situ photoreaction at interfaces.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Nanocatalyst for Precise In&#8208;Situ Antimicrobial Synthesis via Photoredox&#8208;Catalytic Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A red light&#8208;activated nanocatalyst MB@PMOF has been developed to facilitate in situ synthesis of antimicrobials through a photoredox&#8208;catalytic click reaction in bacterial infected tissue. This approach enables precise and potent treatment against severe bacterial infections, providing innovative design concepts for a new generation of alternative antibacterial therapies.







Abstract
The excessive and prolonged use of antibiotics contributes to the emergence of drug&#8208;resistant S. aureus strains and potential dysbacteriosis&#8208;related diseases, necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. Herein, we present a light&#8208;activated nanocatalyst for synthesizing in situ antimicrobials through photoredox&#8208;catalytic click reaction, achieving precise, site&#8208;directed elimination of S. aureus skin infections. Methylene blue (MB), a commercially available photosensitizer, was encapsulated within the CuII&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework, MOF&#8208;199, and further enveloped with Pluronic F&#8208;127 to create the light&#8208;responsive nanocatalyst MB@PMOF. Upon exposure to red light, MB participates in a photoredox&#8208;catalytic cycle, driven by the 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic carboxylate salts (BTC&#8722;) ligand presented in the structure of MOF&#8208;199. This light&#8208;activated MB then catalyzes the reduction of CuII to CuI through a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process, efficiently initiating the click reaction to form active antimicrobial agents under physiological conditions. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated the effectiveness of MB@PMOF&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis in inhibiting S. aureus, including their methicillin&#8208;resistant strains, thereby accelerating skin healing in severe bacterial infections. This study introduces a novel design paradigm for controlled, on&#8208;site drug synthesis, offering a promising alternative to realize precise treatment of bacterial infections without undesirable side effects.

         <title>Sterically Controlled Lewis Acid&#8722;Base Interaction Toward para&#8208;Selective Borylation of Aromatic Aldimines and Benzylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for para selective C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic aldimines and benzylamines has been developed using iridium catalysis. While aromatic aldimines participate in a sterically controlled Lewis acid&#8722;base interaction where the in situ generated pinacolborane acts as a transient directing group (DG), interestingly the origin of the para selectivity of benzylamines stems from the sterical demand of the N&#8208;substituents.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization of arenes at the para position remains extremely challenging primarily due to its relative inaccessibility from the catalytic site. As a consequence, it is significantly restricted to limited molecular scaffolds. Herein, we report a method for the para&#8208;C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic aldimines and benzylamines using commercially available ligands under iridium catalysis. The established method displays excellent para selectivity for variously substituted aromatic aldimines, benzylamines and bioactive molecules. Based on several control experiments, it is proposed that a Lewis acid&#8722;base interaction between the nitrogen and boron functionality guides the para selectivity via a steric shield for the aromatic aldimines, where Bpin acts as a transient directing group. However, the steric shield of the in situ generated N&#8722;Bpin moiety controlled the overall selectivity for the para borylation of benzylamines.

         <title>Optimizing the Microenvironment in Solid Polymer Electrolytes by Anion Vacancy Coupled with Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D flower&#8208;like SnS2 composite with abundant sulfur vacancies is synthesized under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots, and it is employed as filler to optimize the microenvironment in solid polymer electrolytes. As a result, the constructed composite electrolyte not only exhibits high room temperature ionic conductivity and Li+ transference number but also demonstrates significantly improved mechanical properties, providing solid state lithium metal batteries with excellent cycling stability and extended cycle life.







Abstract
The practical application of solid polymer electrolyte is hindered by the small transference number of Li+, low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial stability, which are seriously determined by the microenvironment in polymer electrolyte. The introduction of functional fillers is an effective solution to these problems. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is demonstrated that the anion vacancy of filler can anchor anions of lithium salt, thereby significantly increasing the transference number of Li+ in the electrolyte. Therefore, flower&#8208;like SnS2&#8208;based filler with abundant sulfur vacancies is prepared under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots (CDs). It is worth mentioning that the CDs dotted on the surface of SnS2 have rich organic functional groups, which can serve as the bridging agent to enhance the compatibility of filler and polymer, leading to superior mechanical performance and fast ion transport pathway. Additionally, the in situ formed Li2S/Li3N at the interface of Li metal and electrolyte facilitate the fast Li+ diffusion and uniform Li deposition, effectively mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. As a result, the assembled lithium metal batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability, reflecting the superiority of the carbon dots derived vacancy&#8208;rich inorganic filler modification strategy.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical application of solid polymer electrolyte is hindered by the small transference number of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial stability, which are seriously determined by the microenvironment in polymer electrolyte. The introduction of functional fillers is an effective solution to these problems. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is demonstrated that the anion vacancy of filler can anchor anions of lithium salt, thereby significantly increasing the transference number of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the electrolyte. Therefore, flower-like SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based filler with abundant sulfur vacancies is prepared under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots (CDs). It is worth mentioning that the CDs dotted on the surface of SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have rich organic functional groups, which can serve as the bridging agent to enhance the compatibility of filler and polymer, leading to superior mechanical performance and fast ion transport pathway. Additionally, the in situ formed Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N at the interface of Li metal and electrolyte facilitate the fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and uniform Li deposition, effectively mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. As a result, the assembled lithium metal batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability, reflecting the superiority of the carbon dots derived vacancy-rich inorganic filler modification strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Responsive Formation Cycling Enabling LiF&#8208;Rich Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discover a novel additive&#8208;free strategy to create LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) through low&#8208;temperature formation cycling. Achieving superior battery performance across a wide temperature range, this approach is applicable to various cathode systems, highlighting its versatility and potential for advancing battery technology.







Abstract
Formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase is highly desirable for wide&#8208;temperature battery, but its application is hindered by the unwanted side reactions associated with conventional method of introducing fluorinated additives. Here, we developed an additive&#8208;free strategy to produce LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) by low&#8208;temperature formation cycling. Using LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 as a model cathode, the atomic ratio of LiF in the CEI formed at &#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C is about 17.7&#8201;%, enhanced by ~550&#8201;% compared to CEI formed at 25&#8201;&#176;C (2.7&#8201;%). The underlying mechanism is uncovered by both experiments and theoretic simulation, indicating that the decomposition of LiPF6 to LiF is transformed into spontaneous and exothermic on positively charged cathode surface and lowering the temperature shift chemical equilibrium towards the formation of LiF&#8208;rich CEI. Superior to conventional fluorinated additives, this approach is free from unwanted side reactions, imparting batteries with both high&#8208;temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C) cyclability and low&#8208;temperature rate performance (capacity enhanced by 100&#8201;% at 3&#8197;C at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). This low&#8208;temperature formation cycling to construct LiF&#8208;rich CEI is extended to various cathode systems, such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2, LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, demonstrating the versatility and potential impact of our strategy in advancing the performance and stability of wide&#8208;temperature batteries and beyond.

         <title>Lithiation Induced Hetero&#8208;Superlattice Zn/ZnLi as Stable Anode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero&#8208;superlattice Zn/ZnLi anode containing periodic arrangements of metallic Zn phase and zincophilic ZnLi phase at the nanoscale, is well designed and fabricated via electrochemical lithiation method. The HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi anode can effectively guide Zn ion stripping/deposition evenly during repeatedly stripping/plating processes. Consequently, the HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi anode with hetero&#8208;superlattice structure can cycle over 2800&#8197;h without a short&#8208;circuit at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Three dimensional (3D) framework structure is one of the most effective ways to achieve uniform zinc deposition and thus inhibit the Zn dendrites growth in working Zn metallic anode. A major challenge facing for the most commonly used 3D zincophilic hosts is that the zincophilic layer tends to peel off during repeatedly cycling, making it less stable. Herein, for the first time, a hetero&#8208;superlattice Zn/ZnLi (HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi) anode containing periodic arrangements of metallic Zn phase and zincophilic ZnLi phase at the nanoscale, is well designed and fabricated via electrochemical lithiation method. Based on binding energy and stripping energy calculation, and the operando optical observation of plating/stripping behaviors, the zincophilic ZnLi sites with a strong Zn adsorption ability in the interior of the 3D ZnLi framework structure can effectively guide uniform Zn nucleation and dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition, which significantly improves the cycling stability of the HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi alloy (over 2800&#8197;h without a short&#8208;circuit at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). More importantly, this strategy can be extended to HS&#8722;Zn/ZnNa and HS&#8722;Zn/ZnK anodes that are similar to the HS&#8722;Zn/ZnLi microstructure, also displaying significantly enhanced cycling performances in AZIBs. This study can provide a novel strategy to develop the dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with stable cycling performance.

         <dc:description>
A new strategy for enantiodivergent accessing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules via palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis was established. The enantioselectivity of this protocol was tuned by the polarity of the solvent, thus providing both enantiomers of the P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules using a single chiral norbornene catalyst.







Abstract
In this work, we describe an efficient and modular method for enantiodivergent accessing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules by utilizing the catalytic atroposelective Catellani&#8208;type C&#8722;H arylation/desymmetric intramolecular N&#8208;arylation cascade reaction. The enantioselectivity of this protocol was proved to be tuned by the polarity of the solvent, thus providing a wide range of both chiral P(V)&#8208;stereogenic enantiomers in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantiomeric excesses. Noteworthy is that the strategy developed herein represents an unprecedented example of solvent&#8208;dictated inversion of the enantioselectivity of P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds.

         <title>Covalent Triazine Based Frameworks with Donor&#8208;Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Structures for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;component covalent triazine framework denoted as 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF) with fine&#8208;tuned donor&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor interaction is demonstrated to establish a rapid lithium&#8208;ion transport channel and induce uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
The appearance of disordered lithium dendrites and fragile solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) significantly hinder the serviceability of lithium metal batteries. Herein, guided by theoretical predictions, a multi&#8208;component covalent triazine framework with partially electronegative channels (4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF) is incorporated as a protective layer to modulate the interface stability of the lithium metal batteries. Notably, the 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF with optimized electronic structure at the molecular level by fine&#8208;tuning the local acceptor&#8208;donor functionalities not only enhances the intermolecular interaction thereby providing larger dipole moment and improved crystallinity and mechanical stress, but also facilitates the beneficial effect of lithiophilic sites (C&#8722;F bonds, triazine cores, C=N linkages and aromatic rings) to further regulate the migration of Li+ and achieve a uniform lithium deposition behavior as determined by various in&#8208;depth in/ex situ characterizations. Due to the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;component organic functionalities, the 4C&#8208;TA0.5TF0.5&#8208;CTF modified full cells perform significantly better than the common two/three&#8208;component 2C&#8208;TA&#8208;CTF and 3C&#8208;TF&#8208;CTF electrodes, delivering an excellent capacity of 116.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (capacity retention ratio: 86.8&#8201;%) after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C and improved rate capability. This work lays a platform for the prospective molecular design of improved organic framework relative artificial SEI for highly stable lithium metal batteries.

Notably, the 4C-TA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;TF&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;-CTF with optimized electronic structure at the molecular level by fine-tuning the local acceptor-donor functionalities not only enhances the intermolecular interaction thereby providing larger dipole moment and improved crystallinity and mechanical stress, but also facilitates the beneficial effect of lithiophilic sites (C&#8722;F bonds, triazine cores, C=N linkages and aromatic rings) to further regulate the migration of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and achieve a uniform lithium deposition behavior as determined by various in-depth &lt;i&gt;in/&lt;/i&gt;ex situ characterizations. Due to the synergistic effect of multi-component organic functionalities, the 4C-TA&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;TF&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;-CTF modified full cells perform significantly better than the common two/three-component 2C-TA-CTF and 3C-TF-CTF electrodes, delivering an excellent capacity of 116.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (capacity retention ratio: 86.8&#8201;%) after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C and improved rate capability. This work lays a platform for the prospective molecular design of improved organic framework relative artificial SEI for highly stable lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Classical Deactivation Mechanism in a Supported Intermetallic Catalyst for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that deactivation of the PtZn/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst occurred due to reconstruction from PtZn IMA to Pt3Zn IMA. This deactivation mechanism differs from traditional coke deposition and sintering, as it is driven by the metal support interaction (MSI). Further investigation revealed that surface modification of alumina, such as with K ions, effectively inhibits the reconstruction of PtZn IMA, thereby enhancing the stability of propane dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based supported intermetallic alloys (IMAs) demonstrate exceptional performance in catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) primarily because of their remarkable resistance to coke formation. However, these IMAs still encounter a significant hurdle in the form of catalyst deactivation. Understanding the complex deactivation mechanism of supported IMAs, which goes beyond conventional coke deposition, requires meticulous microscopic structural elucidation. In this study, we unravel a nonclassical deactivation mechanism over a PtZn/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 PDH catalyst, dictated by the PtZn to Pt3Zn nanophase transformation accompanied with dezincification. The physical origin lies in the metal support interaction (MSI) that enables strong chemical bonding between hydroxyl groups on the support and Zn sites on the PtZn phase to selectively remove Zn species followed by the reconstruction towards Pt3Zn phase. Building on these insights, we have devised a solution to circumvent the deactivation by passivating the MSI through surface modification of &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 support. By exchanging protons of hydroxyl groups with potassium ions (K) on the &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 support, such a strategy significantly minimizes the dezincification of PtZn IMA via diminished metal&#8208;support bonding, which dramatically reduces the deactivation rate from 0.2044 to 0.0587&#8197;h&#8722;1. These findings decode the nonclassical PDH deactivation mechanism over supported IMA catalysts and elaborate a new logic for the design of high&#8208;performance IMA based PDH catalysts with long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Interception and Synthetic Application of Diradical and Diene Forms of Dual&#8208;Nature Azabicyclic o&#8208;Quinodimethanes Generated by 6&#960;&#8208;Azaelectrocyclization</title>

2&#8208;Alkenylarylimines have been shown to undergo 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization thermally to generate azabicyclic o&#8208;quinodimethanes. These o&#8208;quinodimethanes show dual nature as a cyclic diene and a benzylic diradical. The interception of the diradicaloid o&#8208;quinodimethanes by H&#8208;atom transfer enabled the synthesis of five tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids. The cyclic dienes were intercepted by [4+2] cycloaddition to generate bridgehead azabicycles.







Abstract
We demonstrate that 2&#8208;alkenylarylaldimines and ketimines undergo thermal 6&#960;&#8208;azaelectrocyclization to generate a wide range of azabicyclic o&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs). These o&#8208;QDMs exist as a hybrid of a diene and a benzylic diradical. The diradical nature was confirmed by their ability to undergo dimerization and react with H&#8208;atom donor, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and O2. In addition, the interception of the diradicaloid o&#8208;QDMs by H&#8208;atom transfer was used to synthesize five tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids and related bioactive molecules. The diene form can undergo [4+2] cycloaddition reactions with different dienophiles to generate bridged azabicycles in high endo:exo selectivity. The azabicyclic o&#8208;QDMs can be generated for [4+2] cycloaddition from a wide range of electronically and sterically varied 2&#8208;alkenylarylimines, including mono, di, tri and tetrasubstituted alkenes, and imines derived from arylamine, alkylamine (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;), benzylamine, benzylsulfonamide and Boc&#8208;amine.

         <title>The Effects of Pore Defects in &#960;&#8208;Extended Pentadecabenzo[9]helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up synthesis strategy was used to introduce pore defects into the fully conjugated &#960;&#8208;extended helicene. This modification transformed the helicene with original aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) characteristics into a series of novel helicenes with dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties. Consequently, the application range of the helicene in chiral luminescent materials was expanded.







Abstract
The introduction of precise pore defects into nanocarbon structures results in the emergence of distinct physicochemical characteristics. However, there is a lack of research on non&#8208;planar chiral nanographene involving precise pore defects. Herein, we have developed two analogues to the &#960;&#8208;extended pentadecabenzo[9]helicene (EP9H) containing embedded pore defects. Each molecules, namely extended dodecabenzo[7]helicene (ED7H; 1) or extended nonabenzo[5]helicene (EN5H; 2), exhibits dual&#8208;state emission. Significantly, the value of |glum| of 1 is exceptionally high at 1.41&#215;10&#8722;2 in solution and BCPL as 254&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. In PMMA film, |glum| of 1 is 8.56&#215;10&#8722;3, and in powder film, it is 5.00&#215;10&#8722;3. This study demonstrates that nanocarbon molecules with pore defects exhibit dual&#8208;state emission properties while maintaining quite good chiral luminescence properties. It was distinguished from the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect corresponding to the nanocarbon without embedded defect. Incorporating pore defects into chiral nanocarbon molecules also simplifies the synthesis process and enhances the solubility of the resulting product. These findings suggest that the introduction of pore defects can be a viable approach to improve nanocarbon molecules.

         <title>Perylene with Split&#8208;Azulene Embedding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with split azulene embedment remain experimentally rare, despite their exceptional properties. Herein, Pery&#8208;57 with split azulene is synthesized and exhibits remarkable characteristics like NIR II absorption, p&#8208;type transport, and outstanding redox features like diradical character, global antiaromaticity, hydrogen capture. This work stimulates new interest in azulene&#8208;like nonalternant PAHs.







Abstract
Splitting the five and seven&#8208;membered rings of azulene and embedding them separately into a conjugated backbone provides azulene&#8208;like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are of great interest in quantum and material chemistry. However, the synthetic accessibility poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present the synthesis of a novel azulene&#8208;like PAH, Pery&#8208;57, which can be viewed as the integration of a perylene framework into the split azulene. The compact structure of Pery&#8208;57 displays several intriguing characteristics, including NIR II absorption at 1200&#8197;nm, a substantial dipole moment of 3.5&#8197;D, and head&#8208;to&#8208;tail alternating columnar packing. Furthermore, Pery&#8208;57 exhibits remarkable redox properties. The cationic radical Pery&#8208;57&#8901;+ readily captures a hydrogen atom. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR (VT&#8197;NMR ) and variable&#8208;temperature EPR (VT&#8208;EPR) studies reveal that the dianion Pery&#8208;572&#8722; possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state and demonstrates significant global anti&#8208;aromaticity. The dication Pery&#8208;572+ is also predicted to exhibit diradical character. Despite bearing three bulky substituents, Pery&#8208;57 displays p&#8208;type transport characteristics with a mobility of 0.03&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, attributed to its unique azulene&#8208;like structure. Overall, this work directs interest in azulene&#8208;like PAHs, a unique member of nonalternant PAHs showcasing exceptional properties and applications.

&lt;p&gt;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with split azulene embedment remain experimentally rare, despite their exceptional properties. Herein, &lt;b&gt;Pery-57&lt;/b&gt; with split azulene is synthesized and exhibits remarkable characteristics like NIR II absorption, &lt;i&gt;p-&lt;/i&gt;type transport, and outstanding redox features like diradical character, global antiaromaticity, hydrogen capture. This work stimulates new interest in azulene-like nonalternant PAHs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splitting the five and seven-membered rings of azulene and embedding them separately into a conjugated backbone provides azulene-like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are of great interest in quantum and material chemistry. However, the synthetic accessibility poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present the synthesis of a novel azulene-like PAH, &lt;b&gt;Pery-57&lt;/b&gt;, which can be viewed as the integration of a perylene framework into the split azulene. The compact structure of &lt;b&gt;Pery-57&lt;/b&gt; displays several intriguing characteristics, including NIR II absorption at 1200&#8197;nm, a substantial dipole moment of 3.5&#8197;D, and head-to-tail alternating columnar packing. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;Pery-57&lt;/b&gt; exhibits remarkable redox properties. The cationic radical &lt;b&gt;Pery-57&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; readily captures a hydrogen atom. Variable-temperature NMR (VT&#8197;NMR ) and variable-temperature EPR (VT-EPR) studies reveal that the dianion &lt;b&gt;Pery-57&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; possesses an open-shell singlet ground state and demonstrates significant global anti-aromaticity. The dication &lt;b&gt;Pery-57&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is also predicted to exhibit diradical character. Despite bearing three bulky substituents, &lt;b&gt;Pery-57&lt;/b&gt; displays &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-type transport characteristics with a mobility of 0.03&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, attributed to its unique azulene-like structure.

         <title>Boosting the Stability of Subnanometer Pt Catalysts by the Presence of Framework Indium(III) Sites in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of the subnanometer PtIn clusters confined in the sinusoidal 10MR channels of MFI zeolite can be greatly enhanced by the presence of framework In(III) species, resulting into a high activity and stability during the ethane dehydrogenation reaction for more than 1000&#8197;h at 650&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Subnanometer metal clusters show advantages over conventional metal nanoparticles in numerous catalytic reactions owing to their high percentage of exposed surface sites, abundance of under&#8208;coordinated metal sites and unique electronic structures. However, the applications of subnanometer metal clusters in high&#8208;temperature catalytic reactions (&gt;600&#8201;&#176;C) are still hindered, because of their low stability under harsh reaction conditions. In this work, we have developed a zeolite&#8208;confined bimetallic PtIn catalyst with exceptionally high stability against sintering. A combination of experimental and theoretical studies shows that the isolated framework In(III) species serve as the anchoring sites for Pt species, precluding the migration and sintering of Pt species in the oxidative atmosphere at &#8805;650&#8201;&#176;C. The catalyst comprising subnanometer PtIn clusters exhibits long&#8208;term stability of &gt;1000&#8197;h during a cyclic reaction&#8208;regeneration test for ethane dehydrogenation reaction.

A MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructured electrocatalyst with interfacial dual active sites and build&#8208;in electric field is constructed for nitrite reduction reaction, delivering an NH3 yield of 11.46&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 98.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) is an important route for sustainable NH3 synthesis and environmental remediation. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one family of promising NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysts, however, there is plenty of room to improve in their performance, calling for new design principles. Herein, a MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructured electrocatalyst with interfacial dual active sites and build&#8208;in electric field is fabricated for efficient NO3&#8722;RR to NH3 production. By growing Co&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanorods on Ni&#8208;BDC (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) nanosheets, experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate the formation of Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Co bonds at the interface of MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructure, leading to dual active sites tailed for NO3&#8722;RR. The Ni sites facilitate the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8722;, while the Co sites boost the H2O decomposition to supply active hydrogen (Hads) for N&#8208;containing intermediates hydrogenation on adjacent Ni sites, cooperatively reducing the energy barriers of NO3&#8722;RR process. Together with the accelerated electron transfer enabled by built&#8208;in electric field, remarkable NO3&#8722;RR performance is achieved with an NH3 yield rate of 11.46&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 98.4&#8201;%, outperforming most reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Green Solvent &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) Facilitates Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel green solvent, &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL), efficiently facilitates the photocatalytic activation of C&#8722;H bonds in benzylic compounds. Mechanistic studies reveal that GVL&#8242;s high dielectric constant (&#1013;) increases the driving force (&#8722;&#916;G), and its large refractive index (n) reduces reorganization energy (&#955;), collectively reducing the reaction barrier (&#916;G&#8800;). This research advances the overlooked solvent effects in semiconductor photocatalysis.







Abstract
Solvents can significantly influence chemical reactions in condensed phases. Their critical properties are increasingly recognized in various research domains such as organic synthesis and biomass valorization. However, in semiconductor photocatalysis, solvents are primarily viewed as mediums for dissolving and diffusing substances, with their potential beneficial effects on photocatalytic conversions often overlooked. Additionally, common photocatalysis solvents like acetonitrile (ACN) pose serious safety and environmental concerns. In this study, we demonstrate that novel and safe green solvents, such as &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL), can significantly enhance the performance of semiconductor photocatalysis for C&#8722;H bond activation. Non&#8208;specific solvent&#8208;solute interactions are the primary contributors to increased photocatalytic activity in the self&#8208;coupling of benzylic compounds. Specifically, GVL&#8242;s large dielectric constant and high refractive index lower the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining C&#8722;H bond activation step, facilitating a faster coupling reaction. The versatility of GVL is further demonstrated in reactions with multiple reagents and in various oxidation and reduction photocatalytic systems beyond classic C&#8722;H bond activation. This work not only pioneers the use of green solvents but also provides comprehensive insights for proper solvent selection in semiconductor photocatalysis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) photocatalysts are bi&#8208;functionalized with lead sulfide (PbS) and amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) co&#8208;catalysts on the surface. PbS can passivates the defects of MHPs and MoSx provides active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thus synergistically enhancing the charge transport efficiency and HER catalysis and achieving a superior solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (STC) energy conversion efficiency of 4.63&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as attractive candidates for producing green hydrogen via photocatalytic pathway. However, the presence of abundant defects and absence of efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active sites on MHPs seriously limit the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (STC) conversion efficiency. Herein, to address this issue, we present a bi&#8208;functionalization strategy through decorating MHPs with a molecular molybdenum&#8208;sulfur&#8208;containing co&#8208;catalyst precursor. By virtue of the strong chemical interaction between lead and sulfur and the good dispersion of the molecular co&#8208;catalyst precursor in the deposition solution, a uniform and intimate decoration of the MHPs surface with lead sulfide (PbS) and amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) co&#8208;catalysts is obtained simultaneously. We show that the PbS co&#8208;catalyst can effectively passivate the Pb&#8208;related defects on the MHPs surface, thus retarding the charge recombination and promoting the charge transfer efficiency significantly. The amorphous MoSx co&#8208;catalyst further promotes the extraction of photogenerated electrons from MHPs and facilitates the HER catalysis. Consequently, drastically enhanced photocatalytic HER activities are obtained on representative MHPs through the synergistic functionalization of PbS and MoSx co&#8208;catalysts. A solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (STC) conversion efficiency of ca. 4.63&#8201;% is achieved on the bi&#8208;functionalized FAPbBr3&#8208;xIx (FA=CH(NH2)2), which is among the highest values reported for MHPs.

         <title>A Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;Based Organic Semiconductor with Small Exciton Binding Energy via Molecular Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is recognized as a key physical parameter for efficient charge&#8208;carrier generation in opto&#8208;electronic devices and organic photocatalysts (OPCs). The correlation between Eb and aggregation is important to achieve a small level of Eb in the solid state. Here, the influence of aggregation behavior on Eb and device/OPC functions were revealed by using two organic semiconductors with different aggregation behaviors.







Abstract
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is understood as the energy required to dissociate an exciton in free&#8208;charge carriers, and is known to be an important parameter in determining the performance of organic opto&#8208;electronic devices. However, the development of a molecular design to achieve a small level of Eb in the solid state continues to lag behind. Here, to investigate the relationship between aggregation and Eb, star&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds DBC&#8208;RD and TPE&#8208;RD were developed using dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DBC) and tetraphenylethylene (TPE). Theoretical calculations and physical measurements in solution showed no apparent differences between DBC&#8208;RD and TPE&#8208;RD, indicating that these molecules possess similar properties on a single&#8208;molecule level. By contrast, pristine films incorporating these molecules showed significantly different levels of electron affinity, ionization potential, and optical gap. Also, DBC&#8208;RD had a smaller Eb value of 0.24&#8197;eV compared with that of TPE&#8208;RD (0.42&#8197;eV). However, these molecules showed similar Eb values under dispersed conditions, which suggested that the decreased Eb of DBC&#8208;RD in pristine film is induced by molecular aggregation. By comparison with TPE&#8208;RD, DBC&#8208;RD showed superior performances in single&#8208;component organic solar cells and organic photocatalysts. These results indicate that a molecular design suitable for aggregation is important to decrease the Eb in films.

         <title>Gas Diffusion Electrodes for Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Gaseous Ammonia: Stepping Over the Nitrogen Energy Canyon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonia is a promising hydrogen carrier compound. The ammonia oxidation reaction (AmOR) was investigated by direct utilization of gaseous NH3 at gas diffusion electrodes. The most selective catalyst composition of the different multi&#8208;metal catalysts was able to oxidize NH3 mainly to NO2&#8722; avoiding to a large extent the formation of energetically favorable N2 as well as O2, while H2 was exclusively formed at the cathode.







Abstract
As ammonia continues to gain more and more interest as a promising hydrogen carrier compound, so does the electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AmOR). To avoid the liberation of H2 in a reverse Haber&#8211;Bosch reaction under release of the energetically more favorable N2, we propose the oxidation of ammonia to value&#8208;added nitrite (NO2&#8722;), which is usually obtained during the Ostwald process. We investigated the anodic oxidation of gaseous ammonia directly supplied to a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) using a variety of compositionally different multi&#8208;metal catalysts coated on Ni foam under the simultaneous formation of H2 at the cathode. This will double the amount of H2 per ammonia molecule while applying a lower overpotential than that required for water electrolysis (1.4&#8211;1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2). A selectivity study demonstrated that some of the catalyst compositions were able to produce significant amounts of NO2&#8722;, and further investigations using the most promising catalyst composition Nif_AlCoCrCuFe integrated within a GDE demonstrated up to 88&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for NO2&#8722; at the anode coupled to close to 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for the cathodic H2 production.

         <title>Revisiting the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy of Porous Electrodes in Li&#8208;ion Batteries by Employing Reference Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy interpretation is essential for comprehending the electrochemical processes in porous electrodes. This work demonstrates that the high&#8208;frequency impedance arc is attributed to the ion transport resistance in pore channels and solid electrolyte interphase, while the mid&#8208;frequency capacitive behavior results from a series connection of electrical double layer capacitance and pseudo&#8208;capacitance.







Abstract
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), characterized by its non&#8208;destructive and in situ nature, plays a crucial role in comprehending the thermodynamic and kinetic processes occurring within Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, there is a lack of consistent and coherent physical interpretations for the EIS of porous electrodes. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct thorough investigations into the underlying physical mechanisms of EIS. Herein, by employing reference electrode in batteries, we revisit the associated physical interpretation of EIS at different frequencies. Combining different battery configurations, temperature&#8208;dependent experiments, and elaborated distribution of relaxation time analysis, we find that the ion transport in porous electrode channels and pseudo&#8208;capacitance behavior dominate the high&#8208;frequency and mid&#8208;frequency impedance arcs, respectively. This work offers a perspective for the physical interpretation of EIS and also sheds light on the understanding of EIS characteristics in other advanced energy storage systems.

A spontaneous cascade optimization strategy is reported firstly to regulate Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior. A separation&#8208;reconstruction layer is constructed on the Zn anode. The soluble components can be separated into the electrolyte for primary optimization, and the poor&#8208;soluble components are reconstructed into flower&#8208;like arrays for secondary optimization. This strategy realizes the overall improvement of Zn ion battery performance.







Abstract
Parasitic side reactions and dendrite growth on zinc anodes are formidable issues causing limited lifetime of aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs). Herein, a spontaneous cascade optimization strategy is first proposed to regulate Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior. Specifically, PAPE@Zn layer with separation&#8208;reconstruction properties is constructed in situ on Zn anode. In this layer, well&#8208;soluble poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) can spontaneously separation to bulk electrolyte and weaken the preferential coordination between H2O and Zn2+ to achieve primary optimization. Meanwhile, poor&#8208;soluble polymerized&#8208;4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine (PACMO) is reconstructed on Zn anode as hydrophobic flower&#8208;like arrays with abundant zincophilic sites, further guiding the de&#8208;solvation and homogeneous diffusion of Zn2+ to achieve the secondary optimization. Cascade optimization effectively regulates Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior, dendrite growth and side reactions of Zn anode are negligible, and the stability is significantly improved. Consequently, symmetrical cells exhibit stability over 4000&#8197;h (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). PAPE@Zn//NH4+&#8722;V2O5 full cells with a high current density of 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 maintains 72.2&#8201;% capacity retention for 12000&#8197;cycles. Even better, the full cell demonstrates excellent performance of cumulative capacity of 2.33&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at ultra&#8208;low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 0.6 and a high mass&#8208;loading (~17&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The spontaneous cascade optimization strategy provides novel path to achieve high&#8208;performance and practical ZIBs.

         <title>Electrochemical Skeletal Indole Editing via Nitrogen Atom Insertion by Sustainable Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct editing of the core heterocyclic skeleton of pharmaceutical lead compounds typically relies on superstoichiometric amounts of costly hypervalent iodine(III) reagents. Herein, we report the electrochemical nitrogen atom insertion reaction into indoles enabled by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thus, leading to the formation of biologically active quinazoline scaffolds.







Abstract
Skeletal molecular editing gained considerable recent momentum and emerged as a uniquely powerful tool for late&#8208;stage diversifications. Thus far, superstoichiometric amounts of costly hypervalent iodine(III) reagents were largely required for skeletal indole editing. In contrast, we herein show that electricity enables sustainable nitrogen atom insertion reactions to give bio&#8208;relevant quinazoline scaffolds without stoichiometric chemical redox&#8208;waste product. The transition metal&#8208;free electro&#8208;editing was enabled by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and proved robust on scale, while tolerating a variety of valuable functional groups.

         <title>Enhanced Electrical Conductivity of Polyoxometalates by Bridging with Mixed&#8208;Valent Multinuclear Platinum Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three paramagnetic one&#8208;dimensional assembles were successfully obtained from spherical polyoxometalates and multinuclear platinum complexes. Each assemble has mixed&#8208;valent metal oxidation states and unpaired electrons on metal d orbitals, showing semiconducting behaviours, which was 105 times greater than that of the parent polyoxometalates.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are nanosized molecular metal oxide anion clusters with tuneable structures and functionalities, and they exhibit a redox chemistry and catalytic activity in multielectron redox processes. These are typically poor electrical conductors (&lt;10&#8722;10&#8201;Scm&#8722;1), which is attributed to negligible electronic interactions among anions in the solid state. Since the reduced electrons on the d0 metals in POMs are delocalized, electrical conductivity was improved when judicious pathways for the electrons were created by bridging the POMs. Utilized with the electronic interactions between bridging oxygen atoms with the highest occupied molecular orbital in the POMs and the metal dz2 orbitals in the multinuclear platinum complexes, and three mixed&#8208;valent assemblies were synthesized and characterized. Simply mixing Keggin&#8208;type or Dawson&#8208;type POMs with tetranuclear or trinuclear platinum complexes in solution afforded three single crystals, and all three compounds were paramagnetic with mixed oxidation states and better conductivities at room temperature than the parent compounds.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Hybridization Activates Lattice&#8208;Hydroxyl&#8208;Groups of NiCo(OH)x Nanowires for Efficient Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers a concept for enhancing the electrochemical activation and dehydrogenation of lattice&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;groups (M2+&#8722;O&#8722;H&#8652;M3+&#8722;O) to produce high&#8208;valence Ni3+/Co3+ active sites for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction. Notably, the dehydrogenation process is significantly augmented due to the electron&#8208;deficient Ni/Co sites and weakened O&#8722;H bond strength derived from the robust electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of benzoic acid ligands.







Abstract
Electrochemical dehydrogenation of hydroxides plays a crucial role in the formation of high&#8208;valence metal active sites toward 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) to produce the value&#8208;added chemical of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic (FDCA). Herein, we construct benzoic acid ligand&#8208;hybridized NiCo(OH)x nanowires (BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x) with ample electron&#8208;deficient Ni/Co sites for HMFOR. The robust electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of benzoic acid ligands in BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x speeds up the electrochemical activation and dehydrogenation of lattice&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;groups (M2+&#8722;O&#8722;H&#8652;M3+&#8722;O), boosting the formation of abundant electron&#8208;deficient and high&#8208;valence Ni/Co sites. DFT calculation reveals that the deintercalation proton is prone to establishing a hydrogen bridge with the carbonyl group in benzoic acid, facilitating the proton transfer. Coupled with the synergistic oxidation of Ni/Co sites on hydroxyl and aldehyde groups, BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x delivers a remarkable current density of 111.20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.4&#8197;V for HMFOR, exceeding that of NiCo(OH)x by approximately fourfold. And the FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency are as high as 95.24&#8201;% and 95.39&#8201;%, respectively. The ligand&#8208;hybridized strategy in this work introduces a novel perspective for designing high&#8208;performance transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for biomass conversion.

         <dc:description>
Selenium is introduced into the halide perovskite framework, for the first time, using the zwitterionic selenocysteamine. The average and local structures of these mixed&#8208;anion perovskites help determine the band structures and potential trap states, respectively. Calculations show dispersive bands and direct gaps, which can be further tuned to straddle the ideal values for tandem solar cells using halide alloying and chalcogenide alloying.

We incorporate Se into the 3D halide perovskite framework using the zwitterionic ligand: SeCYS (+NH3(CH2)2Se&#8722;), which occupies both the X&#8722; and A+ sites in the prototypical ABX3 perovskite. The new organoselenide&#8208;halide perovskites: (SeCYS)PbX2 (X=Cl, Br) expand upon the recently discovered organosulfide&#8208;halide perovskites. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function analysis reveal the average structures of the organoselenide&#8208;halide perovskites, whereas the local lead coordination environments and their distributions were probed through solid&#8208;state 77Se and 207Pb NMR, complemented by theoretical simulations. Density functional theory calculations illustrate that the band structures of (SeCYS)PbX2 largely resemble those of their S analogs, with similar band dispersion patterns, yet with a considerable band gap decrease. Optical absorbance measurements indeed show band gaps of 2.07 and 1.86&#8197;eV for (SeCYS)PbX2 with X=Cl and Br, respectively. We further demonstrate routes to alloying the halides (Cl, Br) and chalcogenides (S, Se) continuously tuning the band gap from 1.86 to 2.31&#8197;eV&#8211;straddling the ideal range for tandem solar cells or visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. The comprehensive description of the average and local structures, and how they can fine&#8208;tune the band gap and potential trap states, respectively, establishes the foundation for understanding this new perovskite family, which combines solid&#8208;state and organo&#8208;main&#8208;group chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Selenium is introduced into the halide perovskite framework, for the first time, using the zwitterionic selenocysteamine. The average and local structures of these mixed-anion perovskites help determine the band structures and potential trap states, respectively. Calculations show dispersive bands and direct gaps, which can be further tuned to straddle the ideal values for tandem solar cells using halide alloying and chalcogenide alloying.

         <title>Tailoring the Whole Deposition Process from Hydrated Zn2+ to Zn0 for Stable and Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;Methylmethanesulfonamide (NMS) additive is introduced to alter the primary solvent shell of Zn2+, chemically adsorb on the metallic Zn surface, and in situ form an N&#8208;rich organic and inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid SEI. These effects suppress the water&#8208;induced side reactions and ensure the fast transport kinetic and uniform Zn deposition.







Abstract
The practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) indeed faces challenges primarily attributed to the inherent side reactions and dendrite growth associated with the Zn anode. In the present work, N&#8208;Methylmethanesulfonamide (NMS) is introduced to optimize the transfer, desolvation, and reduction of Zn2+, achieving highly stable and reversible Zn plating/stripping. The NMS molecule can substitute one H2O molecule in the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+ and be preferentially chemisorbed on the Zn surface to protect Zn anode against corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thereby suppressing byproducts formation. Additionally, a robust N&#8208;rich organic and inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid solid electrolyte interphase is in situ generated on Zn anode due to the decomposition of NMS, resulting in enhanced Zn2+ transport kinetics and uniform Zn2+ deposition. Consequently, aqueous cells with the NMS achieve a long lifespan of 2300&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high cumulative plated capacity of 3.25&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and excellent reversibility with an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.7&#8201;% over 800 cycles.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;A Mitochondrion&#8208;Localized Two&#8208;Photon Photosensitizer Generating Carbon Radicals Against Hypoxic Tumors&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ESR spectra reported in a Research Article by Chao and co&#8208;workers are not in agreement with reactive &#8220;carbon radicals&#8221; claimed to be produced by 730&#8197;nm irradiation of the iridium(III) complex Ir4&#8208;red. The observed tumor&#8208;damaging effects must be induced by other, unidentified reactive intermediates.







Abstract
It is shown that data presented in a paper by Chao and co&#8208;workers do not support the formation of active &#8220;Carbon Radicals&#8221; as claimed according to the title. The assignments of observed ESR spectra and the mechanistic interpretation are severely flawed. Hence, other reactive intermediates must be responsible for the observed tumor&#8208;damaging effects.

         <title>Back Cover: Enhanced Electrical Conductivity of Polyoxometalates by Bridging with Mixed&#8208;Valent Multinuclear Platinum Complexes (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41/2024)</title>

         <dc:description>
Spherical polyoxometalates , which are insulators, were successfully transformed into semiconductors by linking them with one&#8208;dimensional multinuclear platinum complexes. The assembles comprising two kinds of molecules are paramagnetic due to mixed&#8208;valent metal oxidation states, where unpaired electrons are delocalized over these backbones. Various derivatives with bandgap modulations are expected, represented by the flow of electricity in electronic circuits containing them, as reported by Kazuhiro Uemura et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407743).

A new star in the catalyst sky The cover illustration artistically depicts a dilithium tetraalkynyl palladate catalyst as a constellation of stars in the firmament. This complex facilitates the conversion of aryl chlorides via a complex energy surface depicted as a mountain range. The THF solvent molecules are highlighted with a golden halo because they are a critical part of the catalyst system, enabling a stable bimetallic assembly of palladium and lithium. The catalysts are easily accessible from inexpensive components and allow various cross&#8208;couplings of non&#8208;activated aryl halides that were previously limited to phosphine or carbene systems, as reported by Lukas J. Goo&#223;en et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202408974). Design by Nele Kr&#252;ger and Dr. Jonas F. Goebel.

Dearomative construction of 2D/3D frameworks from 2D aromatics is illustrated in the cover image and reported by Ken Tanaka, Yuki Nagashima et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202403461). The cover mage shows transformations from 2D quinolines into triply&#8208;fused 2D/3D rings through nucleophilic addition, borate complex formation, and photocycloaddition. Mechanistic studies revealed that the borate complex accelerates the photocycloaddition and suppresses rearomatization in the excited state.

Polymerized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are employed to covalently anchor Au and Ag atoms, resulting in bimetallic random copolymers, as reported by Ali Nazemi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409800). When these polymers are used as substrates and undergo reduction, they produce polyNHC&#8208;capped alloy and core&#8211;shell AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles, whose structures are influenced by the proportion of each metal in the metallopolymer. These nanomaterials have been shown to be effective in electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Carbon Quaternization with Redox&#8208;Active Esters and Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kawamata, Baran, and Shenvi disclose a solitary iron&#8208;catalyzed conceptually distinct platform for constructing quaternary carbons using readily available and structurally diverse redox&#8208;active esters (RAEs) and olefins as modular coupling fragments. The heteroselective radical quaternization exhibits appreciable functional group tolerance and enables the synthesis of a palette of quaternary carbon&#8208;containing molecules under practical conditions.







Abstract
Quaternary carbons are embedded in various natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic materials. However, constructing this valuable motif is far from trivial. Conventional approaches mainly rely on classical polar disconnections and encounter bottlenecks concerning harsh conditions, functional group tolerance, regioselectivity, and step economy. In this context, Kawamata, Baran, Shenvi, and co&#8208;workers recently demonstrated that two feedstock chemicals, alkyl carboxylic acids and olefins, could be utilized to construct tetrasubstituted carbons in the presence of an inexpensive iron porphyrin catalyst and a suitable reductant combination through quaternization of the radical intermediates. The method enables access to various sterically encumbered quaternary carbons under mild and robust conditions. Taking a complete detour from conventional approaches, the present heteroselective radical&#8211;radical coupling simplifies the synthesis of quaternary carbon&#8208;containing molecules through an innovative and distinctive disconnection approach.

DNA tetrahedral frameworks find diverse applications as functional constituents for operating dynamic networks, directing crystalline assembly, switchable biocatalysis, and medicine uses including sensing, and stimuli responsive drug carriers.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled supramolecular DNA tetrahedra composed of programmed sequence&#8208;engineered complementary base&#8208;paired strands represent elusive nanostructures having key contributions to the development and diverse applications of DNA nanotechnology. By appropriate engineering of the strands, DNA tetrahedra of tuneable sizes and chemical functionalities were designed. Programmed functionalities for diverse applications were integrated into tetrahedra structures including sequence&#8208;specific recognition strands (aptamers), catalytic DNAzymes, nanoparticles, proteins, or fluorophore. The article presents a comprehensive review addressing methods to assemble and characterize the DNA tetrahedra nanostructures, and diverse applications of DNA tetrahedra framework are discussed. Topics being addressed include the application of structurally functionalized DNA tetrahedra nanostructure for the assembly of diverse optical or electrochemical sensing platforms and functionalized intracellular sensing and imaging modules. In addition, the triggered reconfiguration of DNA tetrahedra nanostructures and dynamic networks and circuits emulating biological transformations are introduced. Moreover, the functionalization of DNA tetrahedra frameworks with nanoparticles provides building units for the assembly of optical devices and for the programmed crystallization of nanoparticle superlattices. Finally, diverse applications of DNA tetrahedra in the field of nanomedicine are addressed. These include the DNA tetrahedra&#8208;assisted permeation of nanocarriers into cells for imaging, controlled drug release, active chemodynamic/photodynamic treatment of target tissues, and regenerative medicine.

         <title>What's Next for First Row Fluorometallacycles?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key roles for fluorometallacycles in first row metal complex&#8208;catalyzed reactions are summarized and several future prospects identified.







Abstract
Hydrocarbon&#8208;derived metallacycles have been identified as key intermediates in a host of catalyzed transformations of unsaturated organic substrates. In contrast, our knowledge of analogous reactivity of fluorometallacycles is underdeveloped and largely confined to first row metals. Our summary of recent advances aims to inform young investigators of the exciting challenges offered by this pursuit.

         <title>Sulfurized Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode Material for Rechargeable Mg Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfurized two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (2D&#8208;MOF) promises high capacity Mg2+ storage. On the one hand, the 2D nature of the material enables fast and reversible Mg2+ diffusion. On the other hand, the S functional groups serve as reversible redox centers to host Mg2+.







Abstract
Rechargeable Mg batteries are a promising energy storage technology to overcome the limitations inherent to Li ion batteries. A critical challenge in advancing Mg batteries is the lack of suitable cathode materials. In this work, we report a cathode design that incorporates S functionality into two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks (2D&#8208;MOFs). This new cathode material enables good Mg2+ storage capacity and outstanding cyclability. It was found that upon the initial Mg2+ insertion and disinsertion, there is an apparent structural transformation that crumbles the layered 2D framework, leading to amorphization. The resulting material serves as the active material to host Mg2+ through reduction and/or oxidation of S and, to a limited extent, O. The reversible nature of S and O redox chemistry was confirmed by spectroscopic characterizations and validated by density functional calculations. Importantly, during the Mg2+ insertion and disinsertion process, the 2D nature of the framework was maintained, which plays a key role in enabling the high reversibility of the MOF cathode.

         <title>Unlocking the Multistage Redox Property of Graphenic Radicals by &#960;&#8208;Extension</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable &#960;&#8208;extended nanographene radical (NR1) is synthesized and isolated in the crystalline form. NR1 exhibits a distinctive four&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior, demonstrating that &#960;&#8208;extension could serve as a viable approach to unlock the multistage redox ability of delocalized organic radicals.







Abstract
Delocalized organic &#960;&#8208;radicals are intrinsically amphoteric redox systems; however, achieving their multistage redox capability presents a challenge. In addition, their instability often hampers their synthesis, isolation, and characterization. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable &#960;&#8208;extended nanographene &#960;&#8208;radical (NR1) and its isolation in the crystalline form. NR1 exhibits an unusual four&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior, as revealed by cyclic voltammetry measurements. The stable charged species, including a cation and a radical dication, are characterized using spectroscopic methods. This study demonstrates that &#960;&#8208;extension could serve as a viable approach to unlock the multistage redox ability of delocalized organic radicals.

         <title>Strong Enhancement in Cobalt(II)&#8208;TPMA Aqueous Hydrogen Photosynthesis through Intramolecular Proton Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>

Introduction of proton relays close to the catalytic metal center boosts hydrogen photosynthesis with cobalt(II) TPMA complexes leading to a 4&#8208;fold increase in quantum efficiency and up to a 22&#8208;fold gain in turnover number.







Abstract
Photosynthetic hydrogen generation by cobalt(II) tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) complexes is mainly limited by protonation kinetics and decomposition routes involving demetallation. In the present work we have explored the effects of both proton shuttles and improved rigidity on the catalytic ability of cobalt(II) TPMA complexes. Remarkably, we demonstrate that, while a small enhancement in the catalytic performance is attained in a rigid cage structure, the introduction of ammonium groups as proton transfer relays in close proximity to the cobalt center allows to reach a 4&#8208;fold increase in the quantum efficiency of H2 formation, and a surprising 22&#8208;fold gain in the maximum turnover number, at low catalyst concentration. The beneficial role of the ammonium relays in promoting faster intramolecular proton transfer to the reduced cobalt center is documented by transient absorption spectroscopy, showcasing the great relevance of tuning the catalyst periphery to achieve efficient catalysis of solar fuel formation.

         <title>Quantitative Kinetic Insights from Operando&#8208;UV/Vis Spectroscopy: An Application to NH3&#8722;SCR of NOx on Cu&#8208;CHA Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV/Vis spectroscopy is coupled with a packed bed flow reactor to extract quantitative kinetic data, simultaneously monitoring both the catalyst redox state and the gas&#8208;phase dynamics during the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx with NH3 over Cu&#8208;CHA. This work highlights the accessibility of kinetic studies directly from operando UV/Vis spectroscopy paving the way for elucidating the structure&#8211;activity relation under kinetically relevant conditions.







Abstract
We employ UV/Vis Diffuse Reflectance spectroscopy directly coupled with a packed bed flow reactor to extract quantitative kinetic information.

&lt;p&gt;UV/Vis spectroscopy is coupled with a packed bed flow reactor to extract quantitative kinetic data, simultaneously monitoring both the catalyst redox state and the gas-phase dynamics during the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; with NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; over Cu-CHA. This work highlights the accessibility of kinetic studies directly from &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; UV/Vis spectroscopy paving the way for elucidating the structure&#8211;activity relation under kinetically relevant conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of a Gold&#8211;Silver Alloy Nanocluster within a Ring&#8208;Shaped Polyoxometalate and Its Photocatalytic Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalates (POMs) can serve as an effective stabilizing ligand for metal nanoclusters to impart distinctive structures and properties. We report the synthesis of a surface&#8208;exposed Au&#8722;Ag alloy nanocluster within a ring&#8208;shaped POM through reaction of an Ag nanocluster with Au ions (Au+). The resulting Au&#8722;Ag alloy nanocluster demonstrated remarkably enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalytic activity in the aerobic oxidation reactions and stability compared to the parent Ag nanocluster.







Abstract
Alloying is an effective method for modulating metal nanoclusters to enrich their structural diversity and physicochemical properties. Recent investigations have demonstrated that polyoxometalates (POMs) can act as effective multidentate ligands for silver (Ag) nanoclusters to endow them with synergistic properties, reactivity, catalytic properties, and stability. However, the application of POMs as ligands has been confined predominantly to monometallic nanoclusters. Herein, we report a synthetic method for fabricating surface&#8208;exposed gold (Au)&#8722;Ag alloy nanoclusters within a ring&#8208;shaped POM ([P8W48O184]40&#8722;). Reacting an Ag nanocluster stabilized by the ring&#8208;shaped POM with Au ions (Au+) was found to substitute several Ag atoms at the core of the nanocluster with Au atoms. The resultant {Au8Ag26} alloy nanocluster demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity and stability compared to the pristine Ag nanocluster in the aerobic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;terpinene under visible&#8208;light irradiation. These findings provide fundamental insights into the formation and catalytic properties of POM&#8208;stabilized alloy nanoclusters and advance exploration into the synthesis and applications of diverse metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Formate&#8208;Mediated Electroenzymatic Synthesis via Biological Cofactor NADH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroenzyme&#8208;coupled system has been constructed for continuous biosynthesis of valuable chemicals with high production rates and turnover frequencies. In the system, formate is obtained from electroreduction of CO2 with good faradic efficiency at high current density and utilized for NADH regeneration with high selectivity. As a temporary energy carrier, formate ensures efficient energy transfer from electricity to chemical production.







Abstract
Synthetic biohybrid systems by coupling artificial system with nature's machinery may offer a disruptive solution to address the global energy crisis. We developed a versatile electroenzymatic pathway for the continuous synthesis of valuable chemicals, facilitated by formate&#8208;driven NADH regeneration. Utilizing a bismuth electrocatalyst, we achieved stable CO2 reduction to formate with approximately 90&#8201;% Faraday efficiency at a current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The generated formate acts as a mediator to regenerate NADH, which is then coupled with immobilized redox enzymes&#8212;alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), L&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and L&#8208;glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)&#8212;to produce targeted chemicals at significant rates and exceptionally high turnover numbers (1.8&#215;106 to 3.1&#215;106). These achievements not only underscore the efficiency of the system but also its practical applicability in industrial settings. By leveraging in situ generated formate, this innovative approach demonstrates the potential of integrating electrocatalysis with enzymatic reactions for sustainable and efficient chemical production on a practical scale.

         <title>Customized Photoelectrochemical C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P Bond Formation Enabled by Tailored Deposition on Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With customized designs of the deposition layer on the BiVO4 photoanode, two PEC systems were developed for highly efficient catalytic C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P bond formation. The modified BiVO4@Al2O3 demonstrated substantial performances for important yet challenging coupling between amides and xanthenes under aerobic conditions, whereas BiVO4@Ni1Co7Pi manifested its versatility in C&#8722;P coupling between aryl bromides and diphenylphosphine oxide, facilitated by a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cycle under ultralow potentials.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) is burgeoning as an innovative solution to organic synthesis. However, the current PEC systems suffer from limited reaction types and unsatisfactory performances. Herein, we employ efficient BiVO4 photoanodes with tailored deposition layers for customizing two PEC approaches toward C&#8722;N and C&#8722;P bond formation. Our process proceeds under mild reaction conditions, deploying easily available substrates and ultra&#8208;low potentials. Beyond photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, customized PEC offers high efficiency, good functional group tolerance, and substantial applicability for decorating drug molecules, highlighting its promising potential to enrich the synthetic toolbox for broader organic chemistry of practical applications.

         <title>Coupling of Aryl Chlorides with Lithium Nucleophiles Enabled by Molecularly Defined Alkynyllithium Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dilithium tetraalkinyl palladates formed in situ from palladium salts and lithium alkynyls effectively promote the coupling of non&#8208;activated aryl chlorides with various nucleophiles with C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N bond formation. The applicability of the protocol has been demonstrated by the synthesis of 49 molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds. The lithium alkinyls act as highly electron rich ligands that seem to be widely inert under the basic reaction conditions.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings of aryl chlorides usually call for bulky, electron&#8208;rich ligands such as phosphines or heterocyclic carbenes. We have now found that similarly powerful cross&#8208;coupling catalysts are obtained by the reaction of palladium salts with alkynyllithium reagents. The species initially formed in this process was characterized as a dilithium tetraalkinyl palladate complex. It catalyzes the coupling of aryl chlorides with the lithium salts of various terminal alkynes to give alkynyl arenes. The isolated Li&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;Pd complex also efficiently promotes the reaction of aryl, and allyl chlorides with (hetero)aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208;, and allyllithium compounds as well as lithium amides. None of these reactions proceeded in the presence of palladium salts alone. The preparative utility of this approach was demonstrated by the synthesis of 49&#8197;molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds.

         <title>A [2.2]Isoindolinophanyl&#8208;Based Carbene (iPC) Ligand: Synthesis, Electronic and Photophysical Properties, and Application in Photocatalysis

A sterically demanding, electrophilic [2.2]isoindolinophanyl&#8208;based carbene (iPC) acts as a potent &#960;&#8208;chromophore and participates in metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (CT) transitions in [RhCl(CO)2(iPC)] and intra&#8208;ligand&#8208;&#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221;&#8208;CT transitions in [Au(iPC)2]OTf (5). The steric demand of the iPC leads to ultralong&#8208;lived green phosphorescence (&#964;=185&#8197;&#956;s) of 5 in solution, which in combination with the large accessible &#960; surface area has been exploited for energy transfer (EnT) photocatalysis.







Abstract
Cyclic amino(alkyl) and cyclic amino(aryl) carbenes (cAACs/cAArCs) have been established as very useful ligands for catalytic and photonic applications of transition metal complexes. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a structurally related sterically demanding, electrophilic [2.2]isoindolinophanyl&#8208;based carbene (iPC) that bears a [2.2]paracyclophane moiety. The latter leads to more delocalized frontier orbitals and intense green fluorescence of (HiPC)OTf (2) from an intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1ILCT) state in the solid state. Base&#8208;promoted synthesis of the free carbene led to an unusual ring expansion and subsequent dimerization reaction, but the beneficial ligand properties can be exploited by trapping in situ at a metal center. The iPC ligand is a very potent &#960;&#8208;chromophore, which participates in low energy metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand (ML)CT transitions in [RhCl(CO)2(iPC)] (4) and IL&#8208;&#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221;&#8208;CT transitions in [Au(iPC)2]OTf (5). The steric demand of the iPC leads to high stability of 5 against air, moisture, or solvent attack, and ultralong&#8208;lived green phosphorescence with a lifetime of 185&#8197;&#956;s is observed in solution. The beneficial photophysical and electronic properties of the iPC ligand, including a large accessible &#960; surface area, were exploited by employing highly efficient energy transfer (EnT) photocatalysis in a [2+2] styrene cycloaddition reaction using 5, which outperformed other established photocatalysts in comparison.

Fluorescent probe for discovering the critical roles of CYP2D6 in natural systems: A fluorescent probe for CYP2D6 is designed using a tailored molecular strategy. The probe quantitatively detects and images CYP2D6 activity in various living systems, thereby providing a robust tool for exploration of the biological functions of CYP2D6 in the pathogenesis of diseases and detailed investigation of CYP2D6&#8208;induced MBI.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key enzyme that mediates the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous substances in humans. However, its biological role in drug&#8208;drug interactions especially mechanism&#8208;based inactivation (MBI), and various diseases remains poorly understood, owing to the lack of molecular tools suitable for selectively monitoring CYP2D6 in complex biological systems. Herein, using a tailored molecular strategy, we developed a fluorescent probe BDPM for CYP2D6. BDPM exhibits excellent specificity and imaging capability for CYP2D6, making it suitable for the real&#8208;time monitoring of endogenous CYP2D6 activity in living bio&#8208;samples. Therefore, our tailored strategy proved useful for constructing the highly selective and enzyme&#8208;activated fluorescent probes. BDPM as a molecular tool to explore the critical roles of CYP2D6 in the pathogenesis of diseases, high&#8208;throughput screening of inhibitors and intensive investigation of CYP2D6&#8208;induced MBI in natural systems.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Highly Chiral 1T Molybdenum Disulfide Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 1T&#8722;MoS2 nanosheets were produced via hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of tartaric acid as a chiral ligand to control mirror symmetry breaking. This novel chiral inorganic nanomaterial exhibits a chiral morphology as well as remarkably high chiroptical activity, with a g&#8208;factor of up to 0.01. The optimization of the synthetic conditions and the material's formation mechanism revealed critical details on the transfer of chirality.







Abstract
Chirality in inorganic nanostructures has recently stimulated the attention of many researchers, both to unravel fundamental questions on the origin of chirality in inorganic and hybrid materials, as well as to introduce novel promising properties that are originated by the symmetry breaking. MoS2 is one of the most investigated among the large family of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. In particular, the metastable metallic 1T&#8722;MoS2 phase is of large interest for potential applications. However, due to thermodynamic reasons, the synthesis of 1T&#8722;MoS2 phase is quite challenging. Herein, we present the first synthesis of chiral 1T&#8722;MoS2 phase which shows remarkably high chiroptical activity with a g&#8208;factor up to 0.01. Chiral 1T&#8722;MoS2 was produced using tartaric acid as a chiral ligand to induce symmetry breaking during the material's growth under hydrothermal conditions, leading to the formation of distorted hierarchical nanosheet assemblies exhibiting chiral morphology. Thorough optimization of the synthetic conditions was carried out to maximize chiroptical activity, which is strongly related to the nanostructures&#8217; morphology. Finally, the formation mechanism of the chiral 1T&#8722;MoS2 nanosheet assemblies was investigated, focusing on the role of molecular intermediates in the growth of the nanosheets and the transfer of chirality.

         <title>Outstanding Superoxide Dismutase Catalytic Activity Of Simple Peptide&#8208;Based Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>

Be positive! A novel Ni superoxide dismutase mimic was engineered, taking advantage of the versatility of the Amino Terminal CuII&#8208; and NiII&#8208;binding (ATCUN) motif to introduce positive charges around the NiII center. This strategy yielded the most potent synthetic NiSOD mimic reported to date, in terms of catalytic efficacy and stability.







Abstract
We present here the most active synthetic Ni superoxide dismutase (NiSOD) mimic reported to date. Reactive oxygen species are aggressive compounds, which concentrations are tightly regulated in vivo. Among them, the superoxide anion, O2&#8901;&#8722;, is controlled by superoxide dismutases. Capitalizing on the versatility of the Amino&#8208;Terminal CuII&#8208; and NiII&#8208;binding (ATCUN) peptide motif, we introduced positive charges around the NiII center to favor the interaction with the superoxide radical anion. At physiological pH, the pentapeptide H&#8722;Cys&#8722;His&#8722;Cys&#8722;Arg&#8722;Arg&#8722;NH2 coordinates NiII after the deprotonation of one thiol, two amides, and either the second thiol or the N&#8208;terminal ammonium, leading to an equilibrium between the two N3S1 and N2S2 coordination modes. Under catalytic conditions, a kcat value of 8.6(4)&#215;106&#8197;L.mol&#8722;1.s&#8722;1 was measured. Within the first second, the catalyst remained undegraded with quantitative consumption of O2&#8901;&#8722; (completed up to 37 catalytic cycles). An extra arginine (Arg) was introduced at the peptide C&#8208;terminus to increase the global charge of the NiII complex from +1 to +2. This had no effect on the catalytic performance, highlighting the critical role of charge distribution in space as a determining factor influencing the reactivity.

This had no effect on the catalytic performance, highlighting the critical role of charge distribution in space as a determining factor influencing the reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Poly(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene)&#8208;Capped Alloy and Core&#8208;Shell AuAg Bimetallic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) are used to covalently immobilize Au and Ag atoms to yield bimetallic random copolymers. Reduction of such polymers results in the formation of polyNHC&#8208;capped alloy and core&#8211;shell AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles whose structures are governed by the relative metal content in their corresponding metallopolymers. The application of these nanomaterials in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction is demonstrated.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized metal nanoparticles (NPs) have recently attracted considerable attention. While most efforts in the field have been devoted to the development of NHC&#8208;tethered monometallic NPs and enhancing their stabilities under various conditions, their bimetallic counterparts are rare in the literature. Herein, we demonstrate that the covalent immobilization of Au and Ag atoms on polymerized NHCs is a powerful method to access bimetallic AuAg NPs. In addition, we show that while AuAg alloy NPs are often obtained via this method, the use of bimetallic polymeric substrates with lower Ag content, relative to Au, results in the formation of core&#8211;shell NPs with Au core and Ag shell. Application of these nanomaterials for oxygen reduction reaction is demonstrated with all materials exhibiting electrocatalytic activity. This work demonstrates for the first time that while bimetallic poly(NHC&#8208;metal)s are viable substrates to access NHC&#8208;stabilized bimetallic NPs, careful adjustment of metal content in the polymeric substrates can finetune the microstructure of the resulting NPs, i.e. alloy vs. core&#8211;shell.

         <title>Using Porous Liquids to Perform Liquid&#8208;Liquid Separations</title>

A schematic of monoethylene glycol (MEG) adsorption measurements using a permeable membrane and a Type&#8197;3 porous liquid showing selective adsorption due to inclusion into the pores of the dispersed porous solid.







Abstract
Porous liquids (PLs) are a new type of fluid sorbent investigated mainly for the separation of gas mixtures. Here, we explore their application to the separation of miscible liquids, using MEG/water (MEG=monoethylene glycol) and EtOH/water as proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle. Recovery of used MEG is industrially important but its extraction into conventional solvents from water is difficult. PLs ZIF&#8208;8@PDMS (PL1, PDMS=polydimethylsilicone) or ZIF&#8208;8@sesame oil (PL2) each consisting of 25&#8197;wt&#8201;% of the hydrophobic microporous material ZIF&#8208;8 dispersed in PDMS or sesame oil respectively, were formulated and found to be exceedingly physically stable to sedimentation. A 5&#8197;nm PEEK membrane was used to provide a permeable barrier between the PL and the alcohol/water phase. MEG was selectively extracted through the membrane from approximately 50&#8201;:&#8201;50&#8197;wt&#8201;% MEG/water mixtures into the PL phase and this procedure could be applied repeatedly. It was effective for MEG/water mixtures as dilute as 3&#8201;:&#8201;97&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The PL could also be regenerated (80&#8201;&#176;C at 0.01&#8197;bar) and re&#8208;used, suggesting its potential for continuous, cyclic extraction. Furthermore, PL3 (silicalite&#8208;1@PDMS) was effective in selective alcohol extraction from beverages. It shows potential for lowering the alcohol concentration in gin or wine due to its excellent chemical stability and nontoxicity. Overall, we show that the enhanced adsorption properties of PLs due the presence of empty pores,&#160;which provides unusually high gas solubilities, also makes them, in principle, applicable to liquid&#8208;liquid separations.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Axial Biaryls by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Using Engineered Imine Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient biocatalytic route for the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) was developed. This DKR approach features a transient aza&#8208;acetal bridge&#8208;promoted racemization followed by an engineered imine reductase (IRED)&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective reduction to generate the axial chirality, providing various biaryls in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er).







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl compounds are ubiquitous scaffolds in natural products, bioactive molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts, but biocatalytic methods for their asymmetric synthesis are limited. Herein, we report a highly efficient biocatalytic route for the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). This DKR approach features a transient six&#8208;membered aza&#8208;acetal&#8208;bridge&#8208;promoted racemization followed by an imine reductase (IRED)&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective reduction to construct the axial chirality under ambient conditions. Directed evolution of an IRED from Streptomyces sp. GF3546 provided a variant (S&#8208;IRED&#8208;Ss&#8208;M11) capable of catalyzing the DKR process to access a variety of biaryl aminoalcohols in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio). Molecular dynamics simulation studies on the S&#8208;IRED&#8208;Ss&#8208;M11 variant revealed the origin of its improved activity and atroposelectivity. By exploiting the substrate promiscuity of IREDs and the power of directed evolution, our work further extends the biocatalysts&#8217; toolbox to construct challenging axially chiral molecules.

         <title>Versatile Dehydration&#8208;Assisted Functionalization of Quantum Dots and Rods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dehydration&#8208;assisted functionalization (DAF) enables rapid ligand exchange and dense surface modification of quantum dots (QDs) and quantum rods (QRs). This study highlights DAF's role in preparing chiral QRs, engineering QD surface charge, utilizing QR aggregates, and conjugating DNA onto cadmium&#8208;free InP/ZnS QDs. DAF provides a versatile solution for diverse QD and QR functionalization applications.







Abstract
Functionalization of quantum dots (QDs) and quantum rods (QRs) with ligands is essential for their further practical application across various domains. Dehydration&#8208;assisted functionalization (DAF) is a versatile method applicable to a wide range of hydrophilic ligands with an affinity to the surface of QDs and QRs. This approach facilitates rapid one&#8208;pot ligand exchange and dense modification by efficiently transferring these ligands onto the surface of QDs and QRs. This study demonstrates the efficacy of DAF in preparing chiral QRs, engineering the surface charge of QDs, utilizing QR aggregates, and conjugating dense DNA onto cadmium&#8208;free InP/ZnS QDs. DAF therefore offers a versatile solution for hydrophilic ligand functionalization of QDs and QRs applicable to diverse applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bismuth cation [BiMe2(SbF6)] reacts with [Pt(PCy3)2] to give heterobimetallic [(PCy3)2Pt&#8594;BiMe2(SbF6)] (1). Compound 1 and related species show the first unsupported M&#8594;Bi donor&#8211;acceptor interactions (M=transition metal), establishing [BiMe2]+ as an effective and robust Z&#8208;type ligand, and experience pronounced spin&#8208;orbit coupling. 1 activates H2, triggering a sequence of reactions that furnish the umpolung of Pt&#8594;Bi to Bi&#8594;Pt dative bonding.







Abstract
Establishing unprecedented types of bonding interactions is one of the fundamental challenges in synthetic chemistry, paving the way to new (electronic) structures, physicochemical properties, and reactivity. In this context, unsupported element&#8208;element interactions are particularly noteworthy since they offer pristine scientific information about the newly identified structural motif. Here we report the synthesis, isolation, and full characterization of the heterobimetallic Bi/Pt compound [Pt(PCy3)2(BiMe2)(SbF6)] (1), bearing the first unsupported transition metal&#8594;bismuth donor/acceptor interaction as its key structural motif. 1 is surprisingly robust, its electronic spectra are interpreted in a fully relativistic approach, and it reveals an unprecedented reactivity towards H2.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Baphicacanthcusine A Enabled by Sequential Ring Contractions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidative ring contraction strategy was employed to accomplish the first total synthesis of baphicacanthcusine A. Rapid construction of a key seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring intermediate set the stage for a series of diastereoselective oxidations to access the skeleton of the natural product. Selective C&#8722;H oxidation gave rise to baphicacanthcusine A in 11&#8197;steps from 3,3&#8217;&#8208;biindole.







Abstract
Reported herein is the first total synthesis of the poly&#8208;pseudoindoxyl natural product baphicacanthcusine A. The synthesis leverages the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to pseudoindoxyls to install vicinal pseudoindoxyl heterocycles in a diastereoselective manner. Key steps include an acid&#8208;mediated cyclization/indole transposition, two diastereoselective oxidative ring contractions, and a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H oxygenation. The synthesis of the oxidation precursors was guided by recognition of an element of hidden symmetry. This work provides a foundation for the chemical synthesis of other poly&#8208;pseudoindoxyl alkaloids.

         <title>A Modified Arbuzov&#8208;Michalis Reaction for Selective Alkylation of Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 41, October 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and selective alkylation method without using strong acids, bases, or metals is reported. This method, which is mechanistically related to the Arbuzov&#8208;Michalis reaction, employes a combination of phosphinites/phosphites and ethyl acrylate as effective alkylating agents, achieving chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective modification of complex natural products and pharmaceutical agents.







Abstract
The alkylation of nucleophiles is among the most fundamental and well&#8208;developed transformations in chemistry. However, to achieve selective alkylation of complex substrates remains a nontrivial task. We report herein a general and selective alkylation method without using strong acids, bases, or metals. In this method, the readily available phosphinites/phosphites, in combination with ethyl acrylate, function as effective alkylating agents. Various nucleophilic groups, including alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, imides, and thiols can be alkylated. This method can be applied in the late&#8208;stage alkylation of natural products and pharmaceutical agents, achieving chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective modification of complex substrates. Experimental studies indicate the relative reactivity of a nucleophile depends on its acidity and its steric environment. Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction pathway resembles that of the Arbuzov&#8208;Michalis reaction.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Functionalization: Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions and Reversibly Bound Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions has now become the vogue in C&#8722;H bond functionalization chemistry. Exploration of such diverse interactions such as hydrogen bonding, Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions etc. and their subsequent integration with palladium catalysis becomes pivotal in redefining the sustainability aspects associated with transition metal catalysis. The precise engineering of templates and their diligent correlation with respect to the substrate, becomes the cornerstone in these strategies.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalysis has stood as a pivotal force in synthetic transformations for decades, maintaining its status as a paramount tool in the realm of C&#8722;H bond activation. While functionalization at proximal positions has become commonplace, achieving selective and sustainable access to distal positions continues to captivate scientific endeavors. Recently, a noteworthy trend has emerged, focusing on the utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions to address the challenges associated with remote functionalization. The integration of these non&#8208;covalent interactions into palladium catalysis stands as a justified response to the demands of achieving selective transformations at distal positions. This review delves into the latest advancements and trends surrounding the incorporation of non&#8208;covalent interactions within the field of palladium catalysis. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to emphasize that multifunctional templates, particularly those harnessing hydrogen bonding, present an elegant and sophisticated approach to activate C&#8722;H bonds in a highly directed fashion. These templates showcase versatility and demonstrate potential applications across diverse contexts within the area of remote functionalization.

         <title>Integrated Design of Homogeneous/Heterogeneous Copper Complex Catalysts to Enable Synergistic Effects on Sulfur and Lithium Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fatal polysulfide shuttling, sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and detrimental lithium dendrites have curtailed the real discharge capacity, working lifespan and safety of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Organic small molecule promotors as one type of emerging active catalysts can fulfil the management of the electrochemical species evolution behaviors. Herein, an integrated engineering is organized by synthesizing dual chlorine&#8208;bridge enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu2(phen)2Cl2) and its derivative generated in electrolyte (Cu&#8208;ETL) as the heterogeneous and homogeneous catalyst, respectively. The well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;ETL with a optimized concentration of 0.25 wt.% as a homogeneous enabler offers highly utilized Cu centers and the sufficient interface contact for guiding the Li2S nucleation/decomposition reactions. The Cu2(phen)2Cl2 loaded on carbon spheres as an interlayer (Cu&#8208;INT) can break through the catalytic limitation resulting from the saturated concentration of Cu&#8208;ETL and thus offers an extended manipulation effect. Benefiting from the synergistic effect, the Li&#8211;S battery shows stable cycling at 3 C upon 500 cycles with a capacity degradation rate as low as 0.029% per cycle. Of specific note, an actual cell energy density of 372.1 Wh kg&#8722;1 is harvested by a 1.2 Ah&#8208;level soft&#8208;packaged pouch cell, implying a chance for requiring the demand of high&#8208;energy batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;[18F]Trifluoroiodomethane&#160;&#8211; Enabling Photoredox&#8208;mediated Radical [18F]Trifluoromethylation for Positron Emission Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) is highly dependent on the available synthetic tools for their radiosynthesis. Herein, we present the&#160;radiosynthesis and application of [18F]trifluoroiodomethane &#8211; the first reagent for broad scope radical [18F]trifluoromethylation chemistry in high molar activity. CF218FI can be prepared from [18F]fluoroform with 67&#177;5% AY and &gt;99% RCP. Its synthetic utility is demonstrated by the radiosynthesis of previously unprecedented 18F&#8208;labeled a&#8208;trifluoromethyl ketones and trifluoromethyl sulfides, important motifs that are present in a range of bioactive compounds. Both protocols are Ru&#8208; and photo&#8208;mediated and proceed under mild reaction conditions. They show good functional group tolerance evidenced by the respective reaction scopes and make use of easily obtainable starting materials. The products can be isolated in 8.3&#8208;11.1 GBq/&#181;mol (starting from ca. 5&#160;GBq [18F]fluoride). The applicability to PET tracer synthesis is shown by the radiolabeling of bioactive compounds, such as derivatives of probenecid and febuxostat. In a broader context, this work opens the door to the utilization of radical [18F]trifluoromethylation chemistry for the radiolabeling of PET tracers in high molar activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance of Staffanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first conductance measurements of [n]staffane oligomers in single&#8208;molecule junctions. Our studies reveal two quantum transport characteristics unique to staffanes that emerge from their strained bicyclic structure. First, though staffanes are composed of weakly conjugated C&#8208;C &#963;&#8208;bonds, staffanes carry a shallower conductance decay value (&#946; = 0.84 &#177; 0.02 n&#8208;1) than alkane chain analogs (&#946; = 0.96 &#177; 0.03 n&#8208;1) when measured with the scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) technique. Staffanes are&#160;more conductive than other &#963;&#8208;bonded organic backbones in the literature on a per atom basis. Density functional theory calculations suggest staffane backbones are effective conduits for charge transport because their significant bicyclic ring strain destabilizes the HOMO&#8208;2 energy, aligning it more closely with the Fermi energy as oligomer order increases. Second, the monostaffane is significantly lower conducting than expected. DFT calculations suggest that short monostaffanes sterically enforce insulating gauche interelectrode orientations over syn orientations. Meanwhile,&#160;[2&#8208;5]staffane wires may accommodate axial mechanical strain by &#8220;rod&#8208;bending&#8221;. These findings show for the first time how bicyclic ring strain can enhance charge transmission in saturated molecular wires. These studies showcase the STM&#8208;BJ technique as a valuable tool for uncovering the stereoelectronic proclivities of molecules at material interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Boron Amino Acid for Positron Emission Tomography and Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoroborate boronophenylalanine (BBPA) is a boron amino acid analog of 4&#8209;boronophenylalanine (BPA) but with a trifluoroborate group (&#8208;BF3&#8208;) instead of a carboxyl group (&#8208;COOH). Clinical studies have shown that 18F&#8208;labeled BBPA ([18F]BBPA) can produce high&#8208;contrast tumor images in positron emission tomography (PET). Beyond PET imaging, BBPA is a theranostic agent for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Because BBPA possesses an identical chemical structure to BNCT and PET, it can potentially predict the boron concentration for BNCT using [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET. The synthesis of BBPA was achieved by selectively fluorinating the &#945;&#8208;aminoborate compound, taking advantage of the varying rates of solvolysis of the B&#8208;F bond. The study showcased the high&#8208;contrast [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET imaging in various tumor models, highlighting its broad applicability for both [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET and BBPA&#8208;BNCT. [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET tumor uptake remains consistent across various doses, including those used in BNCT. This enables accurate estimation of the boron concentration in tumors using [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET. With its dual boron structure, BBPA increases boron concentration in tumor cells and tumor tissues compared to BPA. Thus, less boron carrier is needed. This study introduces a new theranostic boron carrier that enhances boron accumulation in tumors, predicts boron concentration, and enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of BNCT.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological and Morphological Membrane Dynamics in Giant Lipid Vesicles Driven by Monoolein Cubosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid nanoparticles have important applications as biomedical delivery platforms and broader engineering biology applications in artificial cell technologies. These emerging technologies often require changes in the shape and topology of biological or biomimetic membranes. Here we show that topologically&#8208;active lyotropic liquid crystal nanoparticles (LCNPs) can trigger such transformations in the membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Monoolein (MO) LCNPs, cubosomes with an internal nanostructure of space group Im3m incorporate into 1,2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (DOPC) GUVs creating excess membrane area with stored curvature stress. Using time&#8208;resolved fluorescence confocal and lattice light sheet microscopy, we observe and characterise various life&#8208;like dynamic events in these GUVs, including growth, division, tubulation, membrane budding and fusion. Our results shed new light on the interactions of LCNPs with bilayer lipid membranes, providing insights relevant to how these nanoparticles might interact with cellular membranes during drug delivery and highlighting their potential as minimal triggers of topological transitions in artificial cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Tandem Fenton&#8208;like Reaction Systems Based on Structure Adaption to Boost Water Contaminant Mineralization Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mineralization of emerging contaminants by using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is a desirable option to ensure water safety, but still challenged by the excessive chemical and/or energy input. Here, we conceptually proposed the tandem reaction system (TRS) of different reactive oxygen species (ROS) based on structure adaption of target contaminants. To construct a model TRS, we first realized highly selective generation of three classical ROS (1O2, HO&#8226; and SO4&#8226;&#8211;) by peroxymonosulfate activation in an electrochemical Fenton&#8208;like system, where three replaceable Fe&#8208;centered cathodes were rationally designed as electronic mediator. The 1O2+SO4&#8226;&#8211;&#8208;TRS exhibited nearly 100% mineralization of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), whereas only 34.2%, 56.2% and 60.8% for each of the single 1O2/HO&#8226;/SO4&#8226;&#8211;&#8208;AOP systems. Mechanism exploration of SMX degradation in TRS evidenced that the initial reaction with 1O2 selectively destructed the sulfonamide bridge of SMX to form p&#8208;aminobenzenesulfonic acid, which will be vulnerable to sequent SO4&#8226;&#8211; attack to facilitate mineralization. Successful extendibility of 1O2+SO4&#8226;&#8211;&#8208;TRS to other sulfonamide antibiotics and 1O2+HO&#8226;&#8208;TRS to phenolic and arylcarboxylic compounds, as well as the demonstration of 1O2+SO4&#8226;&#8211;&#8208;TRS in treatment of three actual pharmaceutical wastewaters strongly support that TRS is a powerful and sustainable strategy to enhance the mineralization of emerging contaminants in water.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Class of Oxyhalide Solid Electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx for Solid&#8208;state Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;based batteries are gaining momentum due to the abundance and lower cost of sodium compared to lithium. Solid&#8208;state sodium batteries can also provide further safety advantages. However, sodium&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) that meet all the rigorous requirements, such as high ionic conductivity, oxidative stability with the cathode, and ease of processability, are lacking. We present here a new class of sodium&#8208;based oxyhalide electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx with a facile mechanochemical synthesis. The oxyhalide NaNbCl4O exhibits close to two orders of magnitude higher ambient&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion conductivity (1.03 x 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1) compared to the halide counterpart NaNbCl6 (3 x 10&#8208;6 S cm&#8208;1). Structural motifs unique to the oxygen content in NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx are identified with 23Na and 93Nb magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy and x&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Solid&#8208;state sodium batteries assembled with NaNbCl4O electrolyte and the cobalt&#8208; and nickel&#8208;free layered Na0.70Fe0.3Mn0.65Al0.05O2 cathode exhibit a maximum discharge capacity of 155 mA h g&#8208;1 with good cycle life at ambient temperature.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Regulating the transformation of sulfur species is the key to improving the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, in particular, to accelerate the reversible conversion between solid phase Li2S2&#160;and Li2S.

         <title>Increasing the Donor Strength of Alkenylphosphines by Twisting the C=C Double Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;rich phosphines play a crucial role in transition metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysis. While alkyl groups have traditionally been employed to increase the phosphine donor strength, recent studies have shown that zwitterionic functional groups such as phosphorus ylides can result in a further enhancement. Herein we report the concept of twisting a C=C double bond to introduce a zwitterionic substituent by the synthesis and application of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin phosphines with a sulfonyl substituent (sNHOP). This sulfonyl group enables the twisting of the olefin moiety due to steric and electronic stabilization of the carbanionic center. The resulting zwitterionic structure leads to a significant increase of the donor strength of the sNHOP ligands compared to conventional NHOP systems with a planar N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin moiety. The potential of this new ligand platform for catalysis is demonstrated by its application in the gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination and cyclo&#8208;isomerization of alkynes. Here, the ligands outperform the original NHOP ligands suggesting favorable properties for future catalysis applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Thioglycolate Modification of Microscale Zero&#8208;Valent Iron for Superior Heavy Metal Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microscale zero&#8208;valent iron (mZVI) is widely used for water pollutant control and environmental remediation, yet its reactivity is still constrained by the inert oxide shell. Herein, we demonstrate that mechanochemical thioglycolate (TG) modification can dramatically enhance heavy metal (NiII, CrVI, CdII, PbII, HgII, and SbIII) removal rates of mZVI by times of 16.7 to 88.0. Compared with conventional impregnation (wet chemical process), this dry mechanochemical process could construct more robust covalent bonding between TG and the inert oxide shell of mZVI through its electron&#8208;withdrawing carboxylate group to accelerate the electron release from the iron core, and more effectively strengthen the surface heavy metal adsorption through metal(d)&#8208;sulfur(p) orbital hybridization between its thiol group and heavy metal ions. Impressively, this mechanochemically TG&#8208;modified mZVI exhibited an unprecedented NiII removal capacity of 580.4 mg Ni g&#8722;1 Fe, 17.1 and 9.5 times those of mZVI and wet chemically TG&#8208;modified mZVI, respectively. Its application potential was further validated by more than 10 days of stable groundwater NiII removal in a column flow reactor. This study offers a promising strategy to enhance the reactivity of mZVI, and also emphasizes the importance of the modification strategy in optimizing its performance for environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive Profiling of Roquin Binding Preferences for RNA Stem&#8208;Loops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cellular levels of mRNAs are controlled post&#8208;transcriptionally by cis&#8208;regulatory elements located in the 3'&#8208;untranslated region. These linear or structured elements are recognized by RNA&#8208;binding proteins (RBPs) to modulate mRNA stability. The Roquin&#8208;1 and &#8208;2 proteins specifically recognize RNA stem&#8208;loop motifs, the trinucleotide loop&#8208;containing constitutive decay elements (CDEs) and the hexanucleotide loop&#8208;containing alternative decay elements (ADEs), with their unique ROQ domain to initiate mRNA degradation. However, the RNA&#8208;binding capacity of Roquin towards different classes of stem&#8208;loops has not been rigorously characterized, leaving its exact binding preferences unclear. Here, we map the RNA&#8208;binding preference of the ROQ domain at nucleotide resolution introducing sRBNS (structured RNA Bind&#8208;n&#8208;Seq), a customized RBNS workflow with pre&#8208;structured RNA libraries. We found a clear preference of Roquin towards specific loop sizes and extended the consensus motifs for CDEs and ADEs. The newly identified motifs are recognized with nanomolar affinity through the canonical RNA&#8208;ROQ interface. Using these new stem&#8208;loop variants as blueprints, we predicted novel Roquin target mRNAs and verified the expanded target space in cells. The study demonstrates the power of high&#8208;throughput assays including RNA structure formation for the systematic investigation of (structural) RNA&#8208;binding preferences to comprehensively identify mRNA targets and elucidate the biological function of RBPs.</dc:description>

The study demonstrates the power of high-throughput assays including RNA structure formation for the systematic investigation of (structural) RNA-binding preferences to comprehensively identify mRNA targets and elucidate the biological function of RBPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Tailoring Amorphous Zn0.25V2O5 with Precision&#8208;Engineered Artificial Atomic&#8208;Layer 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 Cathode Electrolyte Interphase for Advanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium (V)&#8208;based oxides as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) still encounter challenges such as sluggish Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and V&#8208;dissolution, thus leading to severe capacity fading and limited life span. Here, we designed an ultrafast and facile colloidal chemical synthesis strategy based on crystalline Zn0.25V2O5 (c&#8208;ZVO) to successfully prepare a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 core@shell heterostructures, where atomic&#8208;layer MoS2 uniformly coats on the surface of amorphous a&#8208;ZVO. The tailored amorphous structure of a&#8208;ZVO provides more isotropic pathways and active sites for Zn2+, thus significantly enhancing the Zn2+ diffusion kinetics during charge&#8208;discharge processes. Meanwhile, as an efficient artificial cathode electrolyte interphase, the precision&#8208;engineered atomic&#8208;layer MoS2 with semi&#8208;metallic 1T&#8242; phase not only contributes to improved electron transport but also effectively inhibits the V&#8208;dissolution of a&#8208;ZVO. Therefore, the prepared a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 and conceptually validated a&#8208;V2O5@MoS2 derived from commercial c&#8208;V2O5 exhibit excellent cycling stability at an ultralow current density (0.05 A g&#8722;1) while maintaining good rate capability and capacity retention. This research achievement provides a new effective strategy for various amorphous cathode designs for AZIBs with superior performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Regulation of Organic and Inorganic Components in Interphase by Fiber Separator for High&#8208;stable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncontrollable side reactions at the metal interface have been identified as the root cause of the formation of a fragile solid electrolyte interphase, leading to irreversible sodium loss in sodium metal batteries. Here, we proposed an interface engineering strategy that employed a carboxyl functionalized cellulose separator to provide strong dipole moments and induce the cleavage of P&#8211;F bond to construct a SEI rich in NaF. In addition, we employed nuclear magnetic resonance technology confirmed that the separator with strong dipole moments prevented the reduction of organic solvents by attracting electrons, thereby inhibiting the formation of organic oligomers. SEI with high NaF content and few oligomers is smooth and robust, obviously decreasing the interface impedance of the Na anode. The symmetric Na||Na cells, equipped with the functionalized separator, efficiently operated for 1400 hours with a stable 72 mV overpotential at 0.25 mA cm&#8722;2, exhibiting low energy barrier and fast ion transport kinetics. The Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell also showed stable cycling performance, with the capacity remaining at 94.83% of the initial capacity after 1000 cycles at 1C. The proposed separator could control the formation and composition of SEI, paving the way for the development of long&#8208;life sodium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing the Comprehensive Structure&#8722;Activity Relationship of the Natural Antibiotic Kibdelomycin/Amycolamicin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Kibdelomycin (KBD) and amycolamicin (AMM) are potent natural antibiotics effective against antibiotic&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, including vancomycin&#8208;intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, VISA), methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and quinolone&#8208;resistant S. aureus (QRSA). Their antibacterial activity stems from an unprecedented dual mechanism: the lower binding sites occupy the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket of bacterial type II topoisomerases, while the upper binding sites disrupt the enzyme dimer interface. This dual action, combined with their unique chemical structures, positions KBD and AMM as promising scaffolds for developing new antibiotics. However, the structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) of KBD/AMM remains underexplored due to their highly complex chemical structures. In this study, we utilized total synthesis to produce KBD/AMM analogs with various site modifications and evaluated their antimicrobial activities. Our findings establish the first comprehensive SAR for KBD/AMM, paving the way for the development of novel KBD/AMM&#8208;based antibiotics.</dc:description>

         <title>L&#8208;Cysteine&#8208;Catalysed Hydration of Activated Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydration reactions consist of the introduction of a molecule of water into a chemical compound and are particularly useful to transform alkynes into carbonyls, which are strategic intermediates in the synthesis of a plethora of compounds. Herein we demonstrate that L&#8208;cysteine can catalyse the hydration of activated alkynes in a very effective and fully regioselective manner to access important building blocks in synthetic chemistry such as &#946;&#8208;ketosulfones, amides and esters, in aqueous media. The mild reaction conditions facilitated the integration with enzyme catalysis to access chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy sulfones from the corresponding alkynes in a one&#8208;pot cascade process in good yields and excellent enantiomeric ratios. These findings pave the way towards establishing a general method for metal&#8208;free, cost&#8208;effective, and more sustainable alkyne hydration processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Aromatic Nanobelt with Unique Cellular Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A water&#8208;soluble aromatic nanobelt was synthesized, and its cellular uptake behavior in HeLa cells was investigated. The late&#8208;stage functionalization of the parent methylene&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylene ([6]MCPP) provided an easily accessible alkyne&#8208;functionalized nanobelt in a single reaction step. The alkyne&#8208;substituted [6]MCPP was subjected to Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition by using a dye&#8208;attached azide to obtain a water&#8208;soluble aromatic nanobelt. Cell&#8208;imaging experiments on the synthesized nanobelt in HeLa cells revealed stop&#8208;and&#8208;go cellular uptake dynamics. Similar experiments with control molecules and theoretical studies indicated that the unique dynamics of the nanobelt was derived from the belt&#8208;shaped structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenyl Radical Activates Molecular Hydrogen Through Protium and Deuterium Tunneling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activating dihydrogen, H2, is a challenging endeavor typically achieved using transition metal centers. Pure main group compounds capable of this are rare and have emerged in recent decades. These systems rely on synergistic donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with H2&#8217;s antibonding &#963;* and bonding &#963; orbital. An alternative (hydrocarbon) radical&#8208;mediated activation is problematic, because the H&#8722;H bond is stronger (104.2&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1) than most C&#8722;H bonds. Here, we explore using the phenyl radical to tackle this, forming benzene with a C&#8722;H bond energy (112.9 kcal mol&#8722;1) that provides a thermodynamic driving force. We mainly observe a benzene&#8208;HI complex upon photolysis of iodobenzene in an H2&#8208;doped neon matrix at 4.4 K despite a barrier of 7.6&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1, while phenyl radical forms in case of the heavier D2 isotopologue. When D2 molecules are allowed to diffuse, mono&#8208;deuterated benzene accumulates within hours. Computations using path integral&#8208;based instanton theory highlight that primarily the transferred hydrogen atom is moving during the reaction which greatly increases the tunneling probability. In excellent agreement with the experimental results, we predict significant tunneling rate constants for both isotopologues, H2 and D2, featuring a strong kinetic isotope effect of up to four orders of magnitude at the lowest temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Clay Nanosheet&#8208;Based Nanocomposite Supramolecular Hydrogel Enabling Rapid, Reversible Phase Transition&#160;Only with&#160;Visible Light</title>

         <dc:description>High mechanical properties and rapid sol/gel phase transition are mutually exclusive&#160;in the hydrogels reported to date, most likely because the 3D crosslinked networks of mechanically&#160;robust hydrogels comprise bundled thick fibers that are not rapidly dissociable or formable.&#160;&#160;Herein, we report a visible light&#8208;responsive hydrogel&#160;that&#160;showed a rapid, reversible sol/gel phase transition despite its relatively high mechanical properties (storage modulus ~1000&#160;Pa).&#160;&#160;To construct its 3D crosslinked network, we used a design strategy analogous to that employed for our highly water&#8208;rich yet mechanically robust nanocomposite supramolecular hydrogel&#160;("aqua material").&#160;&#160;In this case, multiple poly(ethylene glycol) chains carrying&#160;ortho&#8208;tetramethoxyazobenzene&#160;termini (AzoPEG) were noncovalently crosslinked by clay nanosheets (CNSs) with surface&#8208;immobilized&#160;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin units using their seven guanidinium ion&#160;(Gu+) pendants (GuCD)&#160;via a multivalent salt&#8208;bridge.&#160;&#160;When&#160;exposed to visible light at 625 and 450 nm, the azobenzene termini isomerized from&#160;trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis&#160;and&#160;cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans, respectively, and were detached from and attached to the surface&#8208;immobilized&#160;GuCD units.&#160;&#160;The advantage of this&#160;CNS&#8208;based nanocomposite supramolecular system is its simple 3D network structure, which forms&#160;and breaks&#160;rapidly without slow chain entangling and disentangling processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Homonuclear Super&#8208;Resolution NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homonuclear 1H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra such as the [1H,1H]&#8208;NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement spectroscopy) are essential for biomolecular structural biology. However, the spectrum contains hundreds to thousands of cross peaks meaning that within approximately 100 ppm2 there is significant signal overlap. Spectral resolution is thus a limiting factor for data interpretation for dynamics and structure elucidation. Acquiring the spectra at higher magnetic fields such as at a 1.2 GHz 1H frequency helps to reduce spectral crowding, since resolution scales proportionally to the magnetic field strength. Here, we show that the linewidths' of cross peaks in [1H,1H]&#8208;NOESY and [1H,1H]&#8208;TOCSY spectra can be further reduced by a factor of 2&#8211;3 in each dimension by super&#8208;resolution spectroscopy. In the indirect dimension a composite exponential&#8208;cosine weighted number of scans along the time increments are recorded and digitally smoothened by a window function. Furthermore, measurement time saving by reduced&#8208;acquisition super&#8208;resolution (RASR) is introduced. Application to the 20 kDa protein KRAS shows that highly resolved NMR spectra suitable for automated analysis can be acquired within less than 3 hours. The method opens an avenue towards automated chemical shift assignment, dynamics and structure determination of unlabeled small and medium size proteins within 24 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrolic&#8208;Nitrogen Chemistry in 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)imidazole Electrolyte Additives toward a 50,000&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aqueous zinc iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries offer benefits such as low cost and high safety. Nevertheless, their commercial application is hindered by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and polyiodide shuttle, which result in a short lifespan. In this study, 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)imidazole (HEI) organic molecules featuring pyrrole&#8208;N groups are introduced as dually&#8208;functional electrolyte additives to simultaneously stabilize Zn anode and confine polyiodide through ion&#8208;dipole interactions. The pyrrole&#8208;N groups in HEI can preserve the interfacial pH equilibrium at Zn anode by reversibly capturing H+ ions and dynamically neutralizing OH&#8722; ions, thereby suppressing the HER. Notably, the H2 evolution rate at the Zn anode is reduced to a mere 2.20 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the pyrrole&#8208;N moieties in HEI effectively curtail the polyiodide shuttle at I2 cathode, which show adsorption energies of &#8722;0.174 eV for I2, &#8722;0.521 eV for I3&#8722;, and &#8722;0.768 eV for I&#8722;, as indicated by density functional theory calculations. Electrochemical testing demonstrates that the Zn//Zn symmetric cell maintains stable cycling for up to 4,200 hours at 1 mA cm&#8722;2. Most strikingly, at a high I2 mass loading of 9.7 mg cm&#8722;2, the Zn&#8208;I2 battery achieves an extraordinary cycle life of 50,000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Intercalating Supramolecular Hydrogels for Tunable Thermal and Viscoelastic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce DNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) that leverage the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA as a cross&#8208;linking mechanism. These DISHs exhibit tunable endothermic or exothermic driven material properties via strategic choice of intercalator. Interestingly, acridine&#8208;PEG cross&#8208;linkers showing increasing elasticity with increasing temperature, suggesting these materials are joined by purely entropic forces.







Abstract
Polymeric supramolecular hydrogels (PSHs) leverage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains to govern their structural characteristics. As these materials are formed via endothermic or exothermic equilibria, their thermal response is challenging to control without drastically changing the nature of the chemistry used to join them. In this study, we introduce a novel class of PSHs utilizing the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) as the primary dynamic non&#8208;covalent interaction. The resulting dsDNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) can be tuned to exhibit both endothermically or exothermically driven binding through strategic selection of intercalators. Bifunctional polyethylene glycol (MW~2000&#8197;Da) capped with intercalators of varying hydrophobicity, charge, and size (acridine, psoralen, thiazole orange, and phenanthridine) produced DISHs with comparable moduli (500&#8211;1000&#8197;Pa), but unique thermal viscoelastic responses. Notably, acridine&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkers displayed invariant and even increasing relaxation times with temperature, suggesting an endothermic binding mechanism. This methodology expands the set of structure&#8208;properties available to biomass&#8208;derived DNA biomaterials and promises a new material system where a broad set of thermal and viscoelastic responses can be obtained due to the sheer number and variety of intercalating molecules.

         <title>Triphenylphosphine Oxide: A Versatile Covalent Functionality for Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently linking molecules to the surfaces of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is challenging yet crucial for the versatile function of SWCNTs. We show that the direct covalent SWCNT functionalization with triphenylphosphine oxide yields a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched carbon nanomaterial platform exhibiting superior dispersibility, thermal stability and electrochemical ion response.







Abstract
Broadening the scope of functionalities that can be covalently bound to single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is crucial for enhancing the versatility of this promising nanomaterial class in applied settings. Here we report the covalent linkage of triphenylphosphine oxide [Ph3P(O)] to SWCNTs, a hitherto overlooked surface functionality. We detail the synthesis and structural characterization of a new family of phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts that can facilitate direct Ph3P(O) transfer and afford novel SWCNTs with tunable Ph3P(O) content (SWCNT&#8208;P). The molecularly&#8208;distributed and robust nature of the covalent Ph3P(O) attachment in SWCNT&#8208;P was supported by a combination of characterization methods including Raman, infrared, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies coupled with thermogravimetric analysis. Electron microscopy further revealed the effectiveness of the Ph3P(O) moiety for de&#8208;bundling SWCNTs to yield SWCNT&#8208;P with superior dispersibility and processability. Finally, electrochemical studies established that SWCNT&#8208;P is sensitive to the presence of Li+, Na+ and K+ wherein the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett Lewis acidity parameters of the ions were quantitatively transduced by Ph3P(O) to electrochemical responses. This work hence presents a synthetic, structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical foundation for a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched responsive nanomaterial platform featuring the Ph3P(O) functionality.

         <title>Cu&#8211;Bi Bimetallic Catalysts Derived from Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Arrays on Copper Foam for Efficient Glycine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycine as one of the most abundant amino acids in human proteins, with extensive applications in both life and industry, is conventionally synthesized through complex procedures or toxic feedstocks. In this study, we present a facile and benign electrochemical pathway for synthesis of glycine through reductive coupling of glyoxylic acid and nitrate over a copper&#8208;bismuth bimetal catalyst derived from a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) array on copper foam (Cu/Bi&#8208;C@CF). Remarkably, Cu/Bi&#8208;C@CF achieves a fantastic selectivity of 89%, corresponding a high Faraday efficiency of 65.9%. From control experiments, introduction of Bi caused the binding energy of Cu shift to lower state, which leads to a high selectivity towards the formation of key hydroxylamine intermediate rather than ammonia product, facilitating the formation of oxime and providing additional sites for subsequent hydrogenation reaction on the way to glycine. Moreover, the MOF array derivation ensures the effective dispersion of Bi and enhances the stability of Cu/Bi&#8208;C@CF. This innovative approach not only presents sustainable pathways for the production of value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds utilizing readily available carbon and nitrogen sources, but also provides novel insights into the design of multistage structural catalysts for sequential reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;selective Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Late&#8208;stage Benzylic Hydrogen Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly regioselective visible light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of benzylic positions in both simple and complex molecules is reported. The process follows a dual catalytic approach using an acridinium photocatalyst in combination with a thiol&#8208;based hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, while the use of D2O as an isotope source ensures operational simplicity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. High reactivity has been achieved for electron&#8208;rich benzylic positions. Moreover, targeted radical formation enables unprecedented selective HIE on intramolecular competing benzylic and alpha to heteroatom positions with moderate to excellent deuterium incorporation. The utility of the reaction was demonstrated on the late&#8208;stage HIE of several natural compounds and drug derivatives. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested a single electron transfer (SET) mechanism followed by deprotonation to generate the benzylic radical, and revealed the importance of halogenated solvents or additives. Upon a weak complexation of the halogenated species to the substrate, an oxidation potential lowering effect is induced, as well as a stabilization of the radical&#8208;cation species through spin delocalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Synthesis of Dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom Electrocatalysts through Pre&#8208;coordination&#8208;directed in situ Confinement for CO2&#160;Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) are the next paradigm shift in single&#8208;atom catalysts because of the enhanced performance brought about by the synergistic effects between adjacent bimetallic pairs. However, there are few methods for synthesizing DSACs with precise bimetallic structures. Herein, a pre&#8208;coordination strategy is proposed to precisely synthesize a library of DSACs. This strategy ensures the selective and effective coordination of two metals via phthalocyanines with specific coordination sites, such as &#8211;F&#8211; and &#8211;OH&#8211;. Subsequently, in&#8208;situ confinement inhibits the migration of metal pairs during high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, and obtains the DSACs with precisely constructed metal pairs. Despite changing synthetic parameters, including transition metal centers, metal pairs, and spatial geometry, the products exhibit similar atomic metal pairs dispersion properties, demonstrating the universality of the strategy. The pre&#8208;coordination strategy synthesized DSACs shows significant CO2 reduction reaction performance in both flow&#8208;cell and practical rechargeable Zn&#8208;CO2 batteries. This work not only provides new insights into the precise synthesis of DSACs, but also offers guidelines for the accelerated discovery of efficient catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Unconventional Phase Metal Heteronanostructures for Higher&#8208;Rate Stable Li&#8208;CO2 and Li&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) and Li&#8208;air batteries hold great potential in achieving carbon neutral given their ultrahigh theoretical energy density and eco&#8208;friendly features. However, these Li&#8208;gas batteries still suffer from low discharging&#8208;charging rate and poor cycling life due to sluggish decomposition kinetics of discharge products especially Li2CO3. Here we report the theory&#8208;guided design and preparation of unconventional phase metal heteronanostructures as cathode catalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2/air batteries. The assembled Li&#8208;CO2 cells with unconventional phase 4H/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) ruthenium&#8208;nickel heteronanostructures deliver a narrow discharge&#8208;charge gap of 0.65 V, excellent rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 200 cycles at 250 mA g&#8208;1. The constructed Li&#8208;air batteries can steadily run for above 150 cycles in ambient air. Electrochemical mechanism studies reveal that 4H/fcc Ru&#8208;Ni with high&#8208;electroactivity facets can boost redox reaction kinetics and tune discharge reactions towards Li2C2O4 path, alleviating electrolyte/catalyst failures induced by the aggressive singlet oxygen from solo decomposition of Li2CO3.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Polyimide Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Exceptional Stability and Capacity Retention at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic polymers are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation green electrode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, achieving long cycling stability and capacity retention at high current densities remains a significant challenge due to weak structural stability and low conductivity. In this study, we report the synthesis of two novel polyimide covalent organic frameworks (PI&#8208;COFs), COF&#8208;JLU85 and COF&#8208;JLU86, by combining truxenone&#8208;based triamine and linear acid anhydride through polymerization. These PI&#8208;COFs feature layers with pore channels embedded with 18 carbonyl groups, facilitating rapid lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and enhancing structural stability under high current densities. Compared to previously reported organic polymer materials, COF&#8208;JLU86 demonstrates the excellent performance at high current densities, with an impressive specific capacity of 1161.1 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1, and outstanding cycling stability, retaining 1289.8 mA h g at 2 A g&#8208;1 after 1500 cycles and 401.1 mA h g&#8208;1 at 15 A g&#8208;1 after 10000 cycles. Additionally, in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide mechanistic insights, revealing that the high concentration of carbonyl redox&#8208;active sites and the optimized electronic structure contribute to the excellent electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Nebulized Immunotherapy of Orthotopic Lung Cancer by Mild Magnetothermal&#8211;based Innate Immunity Activations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advances in adaptive immunity have greatly contributed to the development of cancer immunotherapy. However, its over&#8208;low efficacy and insufficient invasion of immune cells in the tumor tissue, and safety problems caused by cytokine storm, have seriously impeded further clinical application for solid tumor immunotherapy. Notably, the immune microenvironment of the lungs is naturally enriched with alveolar macrophages (AMs). Herein, we introduce a novel nebulized magnetothermal immunotherapy strategy to treat orthotopic lung cancer by using magnetothermal nanomaterial (Zn&#8208;CoFe2O4@Zn&#8208;MnFe2O4&#8208;PEG, named ZCMP), which can release iron ions via an acid/thermal&#8208;catalytic reaction to maximize the use of lung's immune environment through the cascade activations of AMs and natural killer (NK) cells. Nebulized administration greatly enhance drug bioavailability by localized drug accumulation at the lesion site. Upon mild magnetic hyperthermia, the released iron ions catalyze endogenous H2O2 decomposition to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggers the M1 polarization of AMs, and the resultant inflammatory cytokine IFN&#8208;&#946;, IL&#8208;1&#946; and IL&#8208;15 releases to activate c&#8208;Jun, STAT5 and GZMB related signaling pathways, promoting NK cells proliferation and activation. This innovative strategy optimally utilizes the lung's immune environment and shows excellent immunotherapeutic outcomes against orthotopic lung cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest&#8208;Induced &#8220;Breathing&#8208;Helical&#8221; Dynamic System of a Porphyrinic Metallo&#8208;Organic Cage for Advanced Conformational Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest dynamic systems in coordination&#8208;driven metallo&#8208;organic cages have gained significant attentions since their promising applications in chiral separation, drug delivery, and catalytical fields. To maximize guest&#8208;binding affinity, hosts adopting multiple conformations are widely investigated on their structural flexibility for guest accommodation. In this study, a novel metallo&#8208;organic cage S with breathing inner cavity and freely twisted side chains was proposed. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses depicted a characteristic &#8220;breathing&#8208;helical&#8221; dynamic system on the semiflexible framework, which led to an unprecedent co&#8208;crystallisation of racemic and symmetric conformations via the encapsulation locking of C70 guests. By taking advantages of the high binding affinity, selective extraction of C70 was realized. This research provides new ideas for the modification on the helicities of metallo&#8208;organic cages, which could pave a new way for advanced conformational manipulation of supramolecular host systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a FUT8 Inhibitor with Cellular Inhibitory Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Core fucosylation is catalyzed by &#945;&#8208;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase (FUT8), which fucosylates the innermost GlcNAc of N&#8208;glycans. Given the association of FUT8 with various diseases including cancer, selective FUT8 inhibitors applicable to in vivo or cell&#8208;based systems are highly sought&#8208;after. Here, we report the discovery of a compound that selectively inhibits FUT8 in cell&#8208;based assays. High&#8208;throughput screening revealed a FUT8&#8208;inhibiting pharmacophore, and further structural optimization yielded an inhibitor with a KD of 49 nM. Notably, this binding occurs only in the presence of GDP (a product of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by FUT8). Mechanistic studies suggested that this inhibitor generates a highly reactive naphthoquinone methide derivative at the binding site in FUT8, which subsequently reacts with FUT8. Furthermore, prodrug derivatization of this inhibitor improved its stability, enabling suppression of core fucose expression and subsequent EGFR and T&#8208;cell signaling in cell&#8208;based assays, paving the way for the development of drugs targeting core fucosylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Fluorosurfactants for Droplet&#8208;Based in vivo Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorocarbon oils are uniquely suited for many biomedical applications due to their inert, bioorthogonal properties. In order to interface fluorocarbon oils with biological systems, non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants are necessary. However, there is a paucity of non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants with low interfacial tension to stabilize fluorocarbon phases in aqueous environments (such as oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions). We developed non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment covalently bonded to a flexible perfluoropolyether (PFPE) segment that confer lower interfacial tensions (IFTs) between a fluorocarbon oil, HFE&#8208;7700, and water. Synthesis of a panel of surfactants spanning a molecular weight range of 0.64&#8211;66 kDa with various hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balances allowed for identification of minimal IFTs, ranging from 1.4 to 17.8 mN m&#8208;1. The majority of these custom fluorosurfactants display poor solubility in water, allowing their co&#8208;introduction with fluorocarbon oils and minimal leaching. We applied the PEG5PFPE1 surfactant for mechanical force measurements in zebrafish, enabling exceptional sensitivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing a Refined Multi&#8208;Structural Polymer Electrolyte Framework for Highly Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational structural designs of solid polymer electrolytes featuring rich interface&#8208;phase morphologies can improve electrolyte connection and rapid ion transport. However, these rigid interfacial structures commonly result in diminished or entirely inert ionic conductivity within their bulk phase, compromising overall electrolyte performance. Herein, a multi&#8208;component ion&#8208;conductive electrolyte was successfully designed based on a refined multi&#8208;structural polymer electrolyte (RMSPE) framework with uniform Li+ solvation chemistry and rapid Li+ transporting kinetics. The RMSPE&#160;is constructed via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation based on a rational combination of lithiophilic components and rigid/flexible chain units with significant hydrophobic/hydrophilic contrasts. Further refined by coating a robust polymer network, this all&#8208;organic design endows a homogenous micro&#8208;nano porous structure, providing a novel framework favorable for rapid ion transport in both its soft interfacial and bulk phases. The RMSPE exhibited excellent ion conductivity of 1.91 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature and a high Li+ transference number of 0.7. Assembled symmetrical Li cells realized stable cycling for over 2400 h at 3.0 mA cm&#8722;2. LiFePO4 full batteries demonstrated a long lifespan of 3300 cycles with a capacity retention of 93.5% and stable cycling performance at &#8722;35 &#176;C. This innovative design concept offers a promising perspective for achieving high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;based Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Oxetane Potential: Modular Synthetic Platform for the Concise Synthesis of Acyclic Oligo&#8208;Isoprenoids and Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpenes occupy a unique place among the secondary metabolites due to their broad utility and extraordinary structural diversity. Their synthesis via polyene cyclization, either biomimetic or enzymatic, represents the cutting edge of modern synthetic chemistry. However, these endeavors have been inherently tied to the availability of natural and non&#8208;natural acyclic polyene starting materials. Herein, we report an oxetane&#8208;based platform for the modular construction of oxygenated polyolefins with precise geometric control. This &#8220;tail&#8208;to head&#8221; iterative method leverages the site&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis of terminal olefins to form an alkylidene oxetane moiety and the regioselective ring opening of alkenyl&#8208;oxetanes for chain elongation. In addition, the unique and peculiar propensity of alkylidene oxetane fragment in various reactions was also revealed and exploited for site&#8208;selective functionalization, cyclization, and as a protecting group in polyenes.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Generation of 1&#8208;Acetylpyrene as a Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyst for the Thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction represents one of the straightforward approaches to build thietane cores. Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report here a visible&#8208;light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls, though a Norrish type II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction with various non&#8208;volatile electron&#8208;rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocabonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides, as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1&#8208;acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet&#8208;triplet Dexter energy transfer&#8208;based mechanism is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Thermoconvection and Atomic Relay Catalysis Enable Equilibrium Shifting and Rapid Glucose&#8208;to&#8208;Fructose Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous glucose&#8208;to&#8208;fructose isomerization is controlled by thermodynamics to an equilibrium limit of ~50% fructose yield. However, here we report an in&#8208;situ fructose removal strategy enabled by an interfacial local photothermal effect in combination with relay catalysis of geminal and isolated potassium single atoms (K SAs) on graphene&#8208;type carbon (Ksg/GT) to effectively bypass the equilibrium limit and markedly speed up glucose&#8208;to&#8208;fructose isomerization.&#160;At 25 &#186;C, an unprecedented fructose yield of 68.2% was obtained over Ksg/GT in an aqueous solution without any additives under 30&#8208;min solar&#8208;like irradiation. Mechanistic studies expounded that the interfacial thermoconvection caused by the local photothermal effect of the graphene&#8208;type carbon and preferable glucose adsorption on single&#8208;atom K could facilitate the release of in&#8208;situ formed fructose. The geminal K SAs were prone to form a stable metal&#8208;glucose complex via bidentate coordination, and could significantly reduce the C&#8211;H bond electron density by light&#8208;driven electron transfer toward K. This facilitated the hydride shift rate&#8208;determining step and expedited glucose isomerization. In addition, isolated K SAs favored the subsequent protonation and ring&#8208;closure process to furnish fructose. The integration of the interfacial thermoconvection&#8208;enhanced in&#8208;situ removal protocol and tailored atomic catalysis opens a prospective avenue for boosting equilibrium&#8208;limited reactions under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe&#8208;N Co&#8208;Doped BiVO4 Photoanode with Record Photocurrent for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth vanadate ranks among the most promising photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Nonetheless, slow charge separation and transport&#160;are key barriers to its photoefficiency. Here, we present a co&#8208;doping strategy that significantly improves the charge separation performance of BVO. Under standard one sun illumination, the Fe&#8208;N co&#8208;doped BVO photoanode (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;BVO) by N&#8208;coordinated Fe precursor reaches a record photocurrent density of 7.01 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 V vs RHE after modified a surface co&#8208;catalyst. By contrast, much lower photocurrent density is obtained for the N&#8208;doped and Fe&#8208;doped BVO with separated N and Fe precursors. The detailed characterizations show that the high activity of the Fe&#8208;N&#8208;BVO is attributed to the enhanced photo&#8208;induced bulk charge separation and the accelerated surface water oxidation kinetics. XPS, EXAFS and DFT calculations clearly show that, instead of formation of deep trapping state in the individually doped BVO, the co&#8208;doping of Fe&#8208;N into BVO generates Fe&#8208;based electronic states just below the bottom of conduction band and N&#8208;derived states just above the top of valence band. Such modulations in electronic structure enable the efficient trap of the electrons and holes to enhance the separation of photo&#8208;induced carriers, but hinder the charge recombination originated from the deep trapping sites.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photo&#8208;Switchable Peptide Fibril Esterase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent attempts to mimic enzyme catalysis using simple, short peptides have been successful in enhancing various reactions, but the on&#8208;demand, temporal or spatial regulation of such processes by external triggers remains a great challenge. Light irradiation is an ideal trigger for regulating molecular functionality, since it can be precisely manipulated in time and space, and because most reaction mediums do not react to light. We herein report the selection of a photo&#8208;switchable amphiphilic peptide catalyst from a small library of isomeric peptides, each containing an azobenzene&#8208;based light responsive group and a catalytic histidine residue. In its native fibrillar form, the selected peptide is efficiently and enantio&#8208;selectively active for ester hydrolysis, but after irradiation by UV light inducing trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis azobenzene isomerization, the fibrils disassemble to amorphous aggregates that are much less catalytically active. Significantly, this esterase&#8208;like activity can be manipulated multiple times, as the fibrillar peptide assembly is reversibly reduced and restored upon alternate irradiation by UV and visible light, respectively. We propose that this research may shine light on the origin of complex functions in early chemical evolution. Furthermore, it paves the way to regulate additional functions for peptide nanotechnology, such as replication, charge transfer, and delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>A Smart Design of Non&#8208;noble Catalysts for Sustainable Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an important process for propylene synthesis, relies on expensive noble metals or highly toxic oxides as catalysts. In a recent publication in Science, Gong and coworkers report a breakthrough discovery for PDH by introducing a sustainable catalyst composed of titanium oxide overlayers encapsulating nickel nanoparticles, termed Ni@TiOx. This innovative catalyst showcases exceptional performance in PDH, exhibiting high propylene selectivity and stability under industrially relevant conditions. The study elucidates the role of defective TiOx overlayers and the electronic promotional effect of subsurface Ni in enhancing catalytic activity, translating a traditional model catalyst system into a sustainable industrial catalyst for low&#8208;carbon energy and the chemical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Target&#8208;templated Construction of Functional Proteomimetics Using Photo&#8208;foldamer Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current methods for proteomimetic engineering rely on structure&#8208;based design. Here we describe a design strategy that allows the construction of proteomimetics against challenging targets without a priori characterization of the target surface. Our approach relies on (i) a 100&#8208;membered photoreactive foldamer library, the members of which act as local surface mimetics, and (ii) the subsequent affinity maturation of the primary hits using systems chemistry. Two surface&#8208;oriented proteinogenic side chains drove the interactions between the short helical foldamer fragments and the proteins. Diazirine&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinking was applied to sensitively detected and localize binding even to shallow and dynamic patches on representatively difficult targets. Photo&#8208;foldamers identified functionally relevant protein interfaces, allosteric and previously unexplored targetable regions on the surface of STAT3 and an oncogenic K&#8208;Ras variant. Target&#8208;templated dynamic linking of foldamer hits resulted in two orders of magnitude affinity improvement in a single step. The dimeric K&#8208;Ras ligand mimicked protein&#8208;like catalytic functions. The photo&#8208;foldamer approach thus enables the highly efficient mapping of protein&#8208;protein interaction sites and provides a viable starting point for proteomimetic ligand development without a priori structural hypotheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Deep Learning Search for Exceptional Chiroptical Properties? The Halogenated [6]Helicene Case</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The relationship between chemical structure and chiroptical properties is not always clearly understood. Nowadays, efforts to develop new systems with enhanced optical properties follow the trial&#8208;error method. A large number of data would allow us to obtain more robust conclusions and guide research toward molecules with practical applications. In this sense, in this work we predict the chiroptical properties of millions of halogenated [6]helicenes in terms of the rotatory strength (R). We have used DFT calculations to randomly create derivatives including from 1 to 16 halogen atoms, that were then used as a data set to train different deep neural network models. These models allow us to i) predict the Rmax for any halogenated [6]helicene with a very low computational cost, and ii) to understand the physical reasons that favour some substitutions over others. Finally, we synthesized derivatives with higher predicted Rmax obtaining excellent correlation among the values obtained experimentally and the predicted ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks Through a Linker Decomposition Chiral Induction Strategy for Circularly Polarized Light&#160;Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring new strategies for construction of chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is of paramount importance yet remains a challenge. Herein, we report the rational design and construction of chiral COFs through a linker decomposition chiral induction (LDCI) strategy. Three pairs of azine&#8208;linked chiral COFs are successfully synthesized by the condensation reactions of C3&#8208;symmetric 4,4',4''&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzaldehyde (Tz) with flexible chiral dihydrazide linkers derived from malic acid, aspartic acid and tartaric acid, respectively. Remarkably, upon complete or partial decomposition from flexible chiral dihydrazides to hydrazine during COF synthesis, the homochirality of these COFs, originating from the single&#8208;handedness conformation of propeller&#8208;like Tz cores, is well preserved. Such a stereoselective chiral memory realized via the LDCI strategy is confirmed by time&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) and diffuse reflectance circular dichroism (DRCD). Moreover, the resultant azine&#8208;linked chiral COFs are used as the active materials to fabricate photodetectors to directly distinguish circularly polarized light (CPL), showing impressive recognition performances on the identification of left&#8208;handed circularly (LHC) and right&#8208;handed circularly (RHC) polarized lights. Notably, the residual undecomposed flexible chiral linkers within the COFs are found to be conducive to improving the polarization discrimination ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching Sides: Regiochemistry and Functionalization Dictate the Photoswitching Properties of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitchable imines demonstrate light&#8208;dependent dynamic covalent chemistry and can function as molecular ratchets. However, the design of aryliminopyrazoles (AIPs) has been limited to N&#8208;pyrazole derivatives with ortho&#8208;pyrrolidine motifs. The impact of other functionalization patterns on the photoswitching properties remains unknown. Here, we present a systematic structure&#8208;property analysis and study how the photoswitching properties can be tuned through ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization of the phenyl ring in N&#8208;pyrazole and N&#8208;phenyl AIPs. This study establishes the first set of design rules for these AIP photoswitches and reports the most stable Z&#8208;isomer of an AIP to date, enabling its crystallization and resulting in the first reported crystal structure of a metastable Z&#8208;aldimine. Finally, we demonstrate that the AIPs are promising candidates for photoswitching in the condensed phase.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Alkynyl Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynyl amides play crucial roles in organic synthesis in the production of bioactive compounds and valuable heterocycles. Despite numerous studies on their synthesis, challenges persist due to the necessity of harsh or hazardous conditions and the use of costly or unstable reagents. Herein, we present a one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of all three bonds of the alkyne under transition&#8208;metal free conditions. An important feature of this chemistry is the use of readily available feedstock chemicals, such as methyl esters and acetamides. This approach offers efficient access to a wide range of aryl and alkyl alkynyl amides and demonstrates excellent tolerance towards various functional groups in a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn&#8211;Ce Symbiosis: Nanozymes with Multiple Active Sites Facilitate Scavenging of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Based on Electron Transfer and Confinement Anchoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating appropriate valence states of metal active centers, such as Ce3+/Ce4+ and Mn3+/Mn2+, as well as surface vacancy defects, is crucial for enhancing the catalytic activity of cerium&#8208;based and manganese&#8208;based nanozymes. Drawing inspiration from the efficient substance exchange in rhizobia&#8208;colonized root cells of legumes, we developed a symbiosis nanozyme system with rhizobia&#8208;like nano CeOx clusters robustly anchored onto root&#8208;like Mn3O4 nanosupports (CeOx/Mn3O4). The process of "substance exchange" between Ce and Mn atoms&#8212;reminiscent of electron transfer&#8212;not only fine&#8208;tunes the metal active sites to achieve optimal Ce3+/Ce4+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ ratios but also enhances the vacancy ratio through interface defect engineering. Additionally, the confinement anchoring of CeOx on Mn3O4 ensures efficient electron transfer in catalytic reactions. The final CeOx/Mn3O4 nanozyme demonstrates potent catalase&#8208;like (CAT&#8208; like) and superoxide dismutase&#8208;like (SOD&#8208;like) activities, excelling in both chemical settings and cellular environments with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This research not only unveils a novel material adept at effectively eliminating ROS but also presents an innovative approach for amplifying nanozyme efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Self&#8208;antioxidant Capability and Processability of Additive&#8208;free MXene Ink towards High&#8208;performance Customizable Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solution processing of MXene ink is the feasible strategy to realize its state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. Nevertheless, achieving high stability and processability of additive&#8208;free MXene ink is particularly challenging. Herein, we propose an oxyanion&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx MXene ink that exhibits excellent self&#8208;antioxidant capability and processability. The vertex&#8208;connected polyhedrons of oxyanions capping on the Ti3C2 host serve as an in&#8208;situ antioxidative shield, effectively preventing the attack of free H2O molecules while increasing the robustness of the Ti&#8211;C bond and reducing the susceptibility of surface Ti atoms to oxidation. Consequently, the shelf life of MXene ink can be extended up to 5 months at room temperature. Moreover, the high electron accumulation of oxyanions enhances the interlayer interactions among MXene sheets through electrostatic binding, which enables the formation of stable and uniform MXene inks with controlled rheological properties and processability. Inspired by Chinese calligraphy, we utilize the oxyanion&#8208;terminated MXene ink to fabricate high&#8208;performance and customizable paper supercapacitors, which exhibit exceptional flexibility and stability, allowing them to be tailored to desired capacity, stretchability, and shapes. This in&#8208;situ surface chemistry strategy of oxyanion can activate the self&#8208;antioxidant capability and solution processability of MXene, paving the way for its widespread applications in flexible and wearable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>The Electrode/Electrolyte Interface Study during the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction (CO2R) in acidic electrolytes has gained significant attention owing to higher carbon efficiency and stability than in alkaline counterparts. However, the proton source and the role of alkali cations for CO2R are still under debate. By using rotating ring disk electrode and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, we find that a neutral/alkaline environment at the interface is necessary for CO2R even in acidic electrolytes. We also confirm that water molecules, rather than protons serve as the proton source for CO2R. Alkali cations in the outer Helmholtz plane activate H2O and promote the desorption of adsorbed carbon monoxide. Additionally, the solvated CO2, or CO2(aq), is the actual reactant for CO2R. This study provides a deeper understanding of the electrode/electrolyte interface during CO2R in acidic electrolytes and sheds light on further performance improvement of this system.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Materials with Ultrabright Phosphorescence at Room Temperature under Physiological Conditions for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the high efficiency of room temperature phosphorescence in crystal states, the generally utilized nanoparticles of organic materials in bioimaging demonstrated sharply decreased performance by orders of magnitude under physiological conditions, badly limiting the realization of their unique advantages. This case, especially for organic red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence materials, is not only the challenge present in reality but more importantly, for the theoretical problem of deeply understanding and avoiding the quenching effect by oxygen and water toward excited triplet states. Herein, thanks to the intelligent molecular design by the introduction of abundant hydrophobic chains and highly&#8208;branched structures, bright and persistent red/NIR phosphorescence under physiological conditions has been realized, which demonstrated the shielding effect towards oxygen, and strengthened the intermolecular interactions to suppress the non&#8208;radiative transitions. Accordingly, the record phosphorescence intensity of nanoparticles in bioimage, up to 8.21 &#177; 0.36 &#215; 108 p s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 sr&#8722;1, was achieved, to realize the clear phosphorescence imaging of liver and tumors in living mice, even lymph nodes in rabbit models with high SBRs. This work afforded an efficient way to achieve the bright red/NIR phosphorescence nanoparticles, guiding their further applications in biology and medicine.</dc:description>

Accordingly, the record phosphorescence intensity of nanoparticles in bioimage, up to 8.21 &#177; 0.36 &#215; 108 p s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 sr&#8722;1, was achieved, to realize the clear phosphorescence imaging of liver and tumors in living mice, even lymph nodes in rabbit models with high SBRs. This work afforded an efficient way to achieve the bright red/NIR phosphorescence nanoparticles, guiding their further applications in biology and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterogeneous Carbonylation of Alcohols on Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Distinct Mo&#8208;Ni Dual Sites Localized at Edge Sulfur Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcohols carbonylation is of great importance in industry but remains a challenge to abandon the usage of the halide additives and noble metals. Here we report the realization of direct alcohols heterogeneous carbonylation to carbonyl&#8208;containing chemicals, especially in methanol carbonylation, with a remarkable space&#8208;time&#8208;yield (STY) of 4.74 molacetyl/kgcat./h and a durable stability as long as 100 h on Ni@MoS2 catalyst. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the Mo&#8208;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS2 exhibit distinct charge density, which strongly activate CH3OH to break its C&#8208;O bond and non&#8208;dissociatively activate CO. Density functional theory calculations further suggest that the low charge density in Mo&#8208;Ni, the Ni site, could significantly lower the barrier for CO migration and nucleophilic attack of methoxy species, and finally leads to the rapid formation of acetyl products. Ni@MoS2 catalyst could also effectively realize the carbonylation of ethanol, n&#8208;propanol and n&#8208;butanol to their acyl products, which may demonstrate its universal application for alcohols carbonylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Sulfide&#8208;Triggered Artificial DNAzyme Switches for Precise Manipulation of Cellular Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of synthetic molecular tools responsive to biological cues is crucial for advancing targeted cellular regulation. A significant challenge is the regulation of cellular processes in response to gaseous signaling molecules such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S). To address this, we present the design of Gas signaling molecule&#8208;Responsive Artificial DNAzyme&#8208;based Switches (GRAS) to manipulate cellular functions via H2S&#8208;sensitive synthetic DNAzymes. By incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties to the phosphorothioate backbone, DNAzymes are strategically designed with H2S&#8208;responsive azide groups at cofactor binding locations within the catalytic core region. These modifications enable their activation through H2S&#8208;reducing decaging, thereby initiating substrate cleavage activity. Our approach allows for the flexible customization of various DNAzymes to regulate distinct cellular processes in diverse scenarios.  Intracellularly, the enzymatic activity of GRAS promotes H2S&#8208;induced cleavage of specific mRNA sequences, enabling targeted gene silencing and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Moreover, integrating GRAS with dynamic DNA assembly allows for grafting these functional switches onto cell surface receptors, facilitating H2S&#8208;triggered receptor dimerization. This extracellular activation transmits signals intracellularly to regulate cellular behaviors such as migration and proliferation. Collectively, synthetic switches are capable of rewiring cellular functions in response to gaseous cues, offering a promising avenue for advanced targeted cellular engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Antibody&#8208;Oligonucleotide Conjugates for Targeted Delivery of Complementary Antisense Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibody&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugate (AOC) affords preferential cell targeting and enhanced cellular uptake of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO).&#160; Here, we have developed a modular AOC (MAOC) approach based on accurate self&#8208;assembly of separately prepared antibody and ASO modules. Homogeneous multimeric AOC with defined ASO&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio were generated by L&#8208;DNA scaffold mediated precise self&#8208;assembly of antibodies and ASOs. The MAOC approach has been implemented to deliver exon skipping ASOs via transferrin receptor (TfR1) mediated internalization. We discovered an anti&#8208;TfR1 sdAb that can greatly enhance nuclear delivery of ASOs. Cryo&#8208;EM structure of the sdAb&#8208;TfR1 complex showed a new epitope that does not overlap with the binding sites of endogenous TfR1 ligands. In vivo functional analyses of MAOCs with one ASO for single exon skipping and two ASOs for double exon skipping showed that both ASO concentration and exon skipping efficacy of MAOC in cardiac and skeletal muscles are dramatically higher than conventional ASOs in the transgenic Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mouse model. MAOC treatment was well tolerated in vivo and not associated with any toxicity&#8208;related morbidity or mortality. Collectively, our data suggest that the self&#8208;assembled MAOC is a viable option for broadening the therapeutic application of ASO via multi&#8208;specific targeting and delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Metal&#8208;Ions Selectivity Induced by Intramolecular Cation&#8208;&#960; Interaction for the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Precise Heterometallic Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic supramolecules, known for their unique synergistic effects, have shown broad applications in photochemistry, host&#8208;guest chemistry, and catalysis. However, there are great challenges to precisely construct heterometallic supramolecules rather than statistical mixture, due to the limited metal&#8208;ions selectivity of coordination units. Especially, heterometallic architectures precisely encoding with different metal ions usually fail to obtain in one&#8208;pot method when only one type of coordinated motif exists due to its poor metal&#8208;ion selectivity. Herein, we proposed an effective intramolecular cation&#8208;&#960; (IC&#960;) strategy and successfully constructed the heterometallic supramolecule Zn2Cu4L34 by one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly of tritopic terpyridyl ligand L3 with Zn(II) and Cu(II), following the clear self&#8208;assembly mechanism that only thermodynamic dimers ZnL12 and Cu2L22 were constructed with model ligands L1, L2, Zn(II) and Cu(II) with perfect self&#8208;sorting and ultra&#8208;high metal&#8208;selectivity feature. The successful construction of the heterometallic supramolecule Zn2Cu4L34, encoding the definite sequence of metal ions Zn(II) and Cu(II) in one&#8208;pot method, will offer a novel approach to precisely construct heterometallic architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Anchored Polymer&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Solid Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes hold promise for addressing key challenges in rechargeable zinc batteries (ZBs) utilizing aqueous electrolytes. However, achieving simultaneous high ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical strength, and a high cation transference number while effectively suppressing Zn dendrites remains challenging. Herein, we design a novel polymer&#8208;in&#8208;salt solid electrolyte (PISSE) composed of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), and niobium pentoxide with oxygen vacancies (Nb2O5&#8208;x) with high ionic conductivity. PAN polymer matrix provides the electrolyte good mechanical properties and solubility of Zn salt. The high concentration of ZnCl2 effectively decouples the Zn2+ from polymer chain segments and provides more ionic conduction amorphous region. Moreover, incorporating Nb2O5&#8208;x filler accelerates Zn2+ desolvation by anchoring (ZnxCly)2x&#8208;y clusters and enhances the system's mechanical properties, achieving a superior Zn2+ transference number (~0.93) and interfacial stability. Consequently, the optimized PISSE demonstrates exceptional stability during prolonged cycling periods, wide temperature range operation (&#8208;40 &#8451; to 60 &#8451;), remarkable flexibility, and compatibility with diverse electrode materials. This study provides valuable insights into the design of solid&#8208;state electrolytes based on ZBs and elucidates their multifunctional prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence Switches through Wavelength&#8208;Selective Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling multicolor persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) through photoirradiation holds fundamental significance but remains a significant challenge. In this study, we engineered a wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive system utilizing the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer strategy. This system integrates a photoactivated long&#8208;lived luminescent material as the energy donor with a fluorescent photoswitch as the energy acceptor, facilitating programmable persistent luminescence switches. Distinct afterglow color states, such as initial nonemissive, green, yellow, and orange, were achieved through irradiation at 400 nm, 365 nm, and 254 nm, respectively. Based on this capability, we established an interacting network for multistate afterglow color switching among these four emissive states. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of this wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive system in the photo&#8208;controlled rewritable printing of multicolor afterglow images on a single thin film. This work represents a substantial step towards the fabrication of sophisticated wavelength&#8208;selective photoresponsive systems, potentially revolutionizing applications in optical data storage, security labeling, and smart displays by enabling precise control over photoresponsive behaviors under various photoirradiation wavelengths.</dc:description>

Distinct afterglow color states, such as initial nonemissive, green, yellow, and orange, were achieved through irradiation at 400 nm, 365 nm, and 254 nm, respectively. Based on this capability, we established an interacting network for multistate afterglow color switching among these four emissive states. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of this wavelength-selective photoresponsive system in the photo-controlled rewritable printing of multicolor afterglow images on a single thin film. This work represents a substantial step towards the fabrication of sophisticated wavelength-selective photoresponsive systems, potentially revolutionizing applications in optical data storage, security labeling, and smart displays by enabling precise control over photoresponsive behaviors under various photoirradiation wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Fe&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Quinone Networks for Mutually Enhanced Mild Photothermal Therapy and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mild photothermal therapy (MPTT) has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality for attenuating thermal damage to the normal tissues surrounding tumors, while the heat&#8208;induced upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) greatly compromises the curative efficacy of MPTT by increasing cellular thermo&#8208;tolerance. Ferroptosis has been identified to suppress the overexpression of HSPs by the accumulation of lipid peroxides and reactive oxygen species (ROS), but is greatly restricted by overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in tumor microenvironment and undesirable ROS generation efficiency. Herein, a synergistic strategy based on the mutual enhancement of MPTT and ferroptosis is proposed for cleaving HSPs to recover tumor cell sensitivity. A facile method for fabricating a series of Fe&#8208;based metal&#8208;quinone networks (MQNs) by coordinated assembly is proposed and the representative FTP MQNs possess high photothermal conversion efficiency (69.3%). Upon 808 nm laser irradiation, FTP MQNs not only trigger effective MPTT to induce apoptosis but more significantly, potentiate Fenton reaction and marked GSH consumption to boost ferroptosis, and the reinforced ferroptosis effect in turn can alleviate the thermal resistance by declining the HSP70 defense and reducing ATP levels. This study provides a valuable rationale for constructing a large library of MQNs for achieving mutual enhancement of MPTT and ferroptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Cytotoxic Cryptophycin Derivatives with Modification in Unit D for Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytotoxic payloads for drug conjugates suitable for directed tumor therapy need to be highly potent and require a functional group for conjugation with the homing device (antibody, peptide, or small molecule). Cryptophycins are cyclodepsipeptides that stand out from the realm of natural products due to their extraordinarily high cytotoxicity. However, the installation of a suitable conjugation handle without compromising the toxicity is highly challenging. The unit D, natively 2&#8208;hydroxyisocaproic acid (leucic acid), was envisaged as a promising attachment site based on structural information from X&#8208;ray analysis. A versatile, scalable and efficient synthetic route towards conjugable cryptophycins with modification in unit D was developed and an array of new cryptophycin analogues was synthesized. Several derivatives, especially those containing lipophilic groups with low steric demand such as alkylated amino groups, exhibit low picomolar cytotoxicity often combined with efficacy against multidrug&#8208;resistant tumor cells. The newly established cryptophycin analogues comprise a broad range of relevant functional groups used as conjugation handles, among them amino, hydroxy, carboxy, as well as sulfur&#8208;containing derivatives. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of a tubulin&#8208;bound cryptophycin together with quantitative structure activity relationship manifested rationales for the synthesis of most potent cryptophycin derivatives and further confirmed the suitability of modifications in unit D.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of Anode and Cathode Interphases via an Alum Electrolyte Additive for High&#8208;performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A zinc (Zn) metal anode paired with a vanadium oxide (VOx) cathode is a promising system for aqueous Zn&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs); however, side reactions proliferating on the Zn anode surface and the infinite dissolution of the VOx cathode destabilise the battery system. Here, we introduce a multi&#8208;functional additive into the ZnSO4 (ZS) electrolyte, KAl(SO4)2 (KASO), to synchronise the in&#8208;situ construction of the protective layer on the surface of the Zn anode and the VOx cathode. Theoretical calculations and synchrotron radiation have verified that the high&#8208;valence Al3+&#160;plays multifunctional&#160;roles of competing with Zn2+&#160;for solvation and forming a Zn&#8211;Al alloy layer with a homogeneous electric&#160;field to mitigate the side reactions and dendrite generation. The Al&#8208;containing cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface considerably alleviates the irreversible dissolution of the VOx cathode and the accumulation of byproducts. Consequently, the Zn || Zn cell with KASO exhibits an ultra&#8208;long cycle of 6000 h at 2 mA cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the VOx cathodes (VO2, V2O5 and NH4V4O10) in the ZS&#8211;KASO electrolyte showed excellent cycling stability, even at a low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 2.83 and high mass loading (~16 mg cm&#8208;2). This study offers a practical reference for concurrently addressing challenges at the anode and cathode of AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Supramolecular Polymorphism in Cyanine H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed a new cyanine dye 1, with two pedant rod&#8208;like groups, capable of forming two distinct two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular polymorphs in methylcyclohexane; an H&#8208;type aggregate (Agg&#8208;H2) and a J&#8208;type aggregate (Agg&#8208;J). Importantly, these two polymorphs were not accessed through polymerization events, and instead through the thermal transformation of a third particle&#8208;like polymorph (Agg&#8208;H1) formed by the anti&#8208;cooperative assembly of 1. While Agg&#8208;H2 is generated upon cooling the solution of Agg&#8208;H1 by a thermoreversible polymorph transition, the Agg&#8208;J was obtained through a hidden pathway by combining sonication and cooling to the Agg&#8208;H1 solution. This is the first report on the obtention of H&#8208; and J&#8208;type cyanine polymorphs that in turn could be isolated in solid&#8208;state to render two new 2D photoactive materials. This paper unveils new strategies for designing 2D supramolecular polymers using calamitic residues, but also undercovers relevant aspects of pathway complexity and polymorph transitions that might be crucial for developing novel photonic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Specifically Editing Cancer Sialoglycans for Enhanced Immunotherapy In Vivo through Aptamer&#8208;Enzyme Chimeras</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immune checkpoints blockade (ICB) therapies have demonstrated remarkable clinical success in treating cancer. However, its objective response rate remains suboptimal because current therapies rely on limited immune checkpoints that failed to cover the multiple immune evasion pathways of cancer. To explore potential ICB strategies, herein, we propose a glycoimmune checkpoint elimination (glycoICE) therapy depending on targeted edition of sialoglycans on tumor cell surface using aptamer&#8208;enzyme chimera (ApEC). The ApEC is readily generated via a one&#8208;step bioorthogonal procedure, allowing for large&#8208;scale and uniform production. The ApEC is able to target and desialylate cancer cells, leading to the elimination of sialoglycan&#8208;Siglec axis, which in turn activates immune cells and enhances immunotherapy efficiency. In addition to its remarkable therapeutic efficiency, the ApEC exhibits high tumor selectivity, which helps to avoid side effects caused by indiscriminate desialylation of normal tissues. Furthermore, the ApEC has the potential to be a versatile platform for specifical editing of sialoglycans in different tumor models by adjusting the aptamer sequences targeting associated with specific protein markers. This research not only introduces a novel molecular tool for the effective editing of sialoglycans in complex environments, but also provides valuable insights for advancing DNA&#8208;based drugs towards in vivo and clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Restricting Linker Rotation in Nanocages of ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes using Crown Ether "Molecular Locks" for Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have long been prized for their exceptional C3H6/C3H8 separation performance. On the other hand, ZIF&#8208;8 has structural flexibility, where the external pressure triggers channel expansion, potentially deteriorating the molecular sieving ability. Here, we demonstrate a reliable strategy to fine&#8208;tune the flexible pore structure of ZIF&#8208;8 by embedding crown ether within a ZIF&#8208;8 membrane. Benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) was selected as the cavity occupant and perfectly confined in the sodalite (SOD) cage of ZIF&#8208;8. The 15C5 molecules, which have a size comparable to the nanocage, impose a spatial constraint on linker rotation, enabling the phase transition to a rigid structure in the flexible ZIF&#8208;8. The corresponding 15C5@ZIF&#8208;8 membranes achieve an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 220, outperforming that of most membranes. Unlike their flexible counterparts, the resulting membranes manifest a positive increase in the C3H6/C3H8 separation factor with elevated pressure, securing a record&#8208;high C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 331 under 7 bar. More importantly, extraordinary separation stability was demonstrated with continuous measurement, which is highly desirable for practical applications.</dc:description>

The corresponding 15C5@ZIF-8 membranes achieve an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 220, outperforming that of most membranes. Unlike their flexible counterparts, the resulting membranes manifest a positive increase in the C3H6/C3H8 separation factor with elevated pressure, securing a record-high C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 331 under 7 bar. More importantly, extraordinary separation stability was demonstrated with continuous measurement, which is highly desirable for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical recording of pump&#8208;specific drug efflux in living cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug efflux &#8212; a process primarily facilitated by efflux pumps such as multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) &#8212; plays a pivotal role in cellular resistance to chemotherapy resistance. Conventional approaches to assess drug efflux are predominantly conducted in vitro and often lack pump specificity. Here we report the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, which enables the recording of pump&#8208;specific drug efflux in living cells. In BRIEF, a specific substrate is engineered as a bioorthogonal efflux probe (BEP) for specific pumps. The cellular concentration and protein labeling level of the probe can be augmented when the test drug is transported by the same pumps.&#160; Serendipitously, we discovered that per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural monosaccharides, initially designed for metabolic glycan labeling, are exported by some MRPs. Using Ac4GlcNAl as a BEP, we studied the structure&#8208;efflux relationship of flavonoids and identified small molecules, including tannic acid, cholesterol and gallic acid, as novel MRP substrates in high&#8208;throughput screening. Tannic acid, known for anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 properties, showed increased efficacy upon MRP inhibition. Additionally, BRIEF was adapted to assess p&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated efflux using Rhodamine 123 as a BEP, leveraging its light&#8208;activatable proximity labeling ability. BRIEF provides a versatile approach to investigate drug efflux and enhance chemotherapy strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalates&#8208;Mediated Selectivity in Pt Single&#8208;Atoms on Ceria for Environmental Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing the reactivity and selectivity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) remains a crucial yet challenging issue in heterogeneous catalysis. This study demonstrates selective catalysis facilitated by a polyoxometalates&#8208;mediated electronic interaction (PMEI) in a Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst supported on CeO2 modified with Keggin&#8208;type phosphotungstate acid (HPW), labeled as Pt1/CeO2&#8208;HPW. The PMEI effect originates from the unique arrangement of isolated Pt atoms and HPW clusters on CeO2 surface. Electrons are transferred from ceria support to the electrophilic tungsten in HPW clusters, and subsequently, Pt atoms donate electrons to the now electron&#8208;deficient ceria. This phenomenon enhances the positive charge of Pt atoms, moderating O2 activation and limiting lattice oxygen mobility compared to the conventional Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. The resulting electronic structure of Pt combined with the strong and local acidic environment of HPW on Pt1/CeO2&#8208;HPW leads to improved degradation of NH3, N2 selectivity in the NO conversion, and CO2 yield when inputting volatile organic compounds. This study sheds the light on the design of SACs with balanced reactivity and selectivity for environmental catalysis applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The P(III)&#8208;amidite based synthesis of stable isotope labeled mRNA&#8208;cap&#8208;structures enables their sensitive quantitation from brain tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 5&#8217; cap structure is crucial to mRNA function, with its diverse methylation patterns depending on the cellular state. Sensitive analytical methods are sought after to quantify this cap variety also referred to as cap epitranscriptome. To address a bottleneck for accurate and precise quantitation, we report a facile and fast access to high&#8208;quality synthetic standards via a new route, involving P(III)&#8208;amidite chemistry. A range of cap nucleotides and their stable heavy isotopic labeled analogues were derived from nucleoside diphosphates, which themselves were directly prepared in a one&#8208;step reaction sequence starting from unprotected nucleosides using a triphosphorylating reagent in combination with ethylenediamine. Considering a wider scope, the route also enables direct access to magic spot nucleotides and diphosphates of isoprenyl&#8208;alcohols. Stable&#8208;isotope labeled cap nucleotides derived from this route paved the way for the development of a highly sensitive LC&#8208;MS/MS method, applied to the characterization of mouse brain cap epitranscriptomes, which turned out to be very different from those of cultured cell lines of widespread use in the life sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell Surface Engineering by Phase&#8208;Separated Coacervates for Antibody Display and Targeted Cancer Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tripeptide forms phase&#8208;separated coacervates, which functionalize the surface of NK cells, display an anti&#8208;HER2 mAb within the coacervate layer on the cell surface, and guide the NK cells to recognize and kill HER2+ cancer cells.







Abstract
Cell therapies such as CAR&#8722;T have demonstrated significant clinical successes, driving the investigation of immune cell surface engineering using natural and synthetic materials to enhance their therapeutic performance. However, many of these materials do not fully replicate the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study presents a cell surface engineering strategy that utilizes phase&#8208;separated peptide coacervates to decorate the surface of immune cells. We meticulously designed a tripeptide, Fmoc&#8722;Lys&#8722;Gly&#8722;Dopa&#8722;OH (KGdelta; Fmoc=fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; delta=Dopa, dihydroxyphenylalanine), that forms coacervates in aqueous solution via phase separation. These coacervates, mirroring the phase separation properties of ECM proteins, coat the natural killer (NK) cell surface with the assistance of Fe3+ ions and create an outer layer capable of encapsulating monoclonal antibodies (mAb), such as Trastuzumab. The antibody&#8208;embedded coacervate layer equips the NK cells with the ability to recognize cancer cells and eliminate them through enhanced antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This work thus presents a unique strategy of cell surface functionalization and demonstrates its use in displaying cancer&#8208;targeting mAb for cancer therapies, highlighting its potential application in the field of cancer therapy.

         <title>Exocyclic and Linker Editing of Lys63&#8208;linked Ubiquitin Chains Modulators Specifically Inhibits Non&#8208;homologous End&#8208;joining Repair</title>

Strategic modifications to cyclic peptide CP2 followed by screening through in vitro cellular studies, yielding CP7, significantly enhance cell permeability and apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity. CP7 acts as a selective inhibitor of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ), increasing sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and suggesting a promising strategy for enhancing radiation therapy efficacy.







Abstract
Despite the great advances in discovering cyclic peptides against protein targets, their reduced aqueous solubility, cell permeability, and activity of the cyclic peptide restrict its utilization in advanced biological research and therapeutic applications. Here we report on a novel approach of structural alternation of the exocyclic and linker parts that led to a new derivative with significantly improved cell activity allowing us to dissect its mode of action in detail. We have identified an effective cyclic peptide (CP7) that induces approximately a 9&#8208;fold increase in DNA damage accumulation and a remarkable increase in apoptotic cancer cell death compared to the reported molecule. Notably, treating cells with CP7 leads to a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs), which is accompanied by an increase in homologous recombination (HR) repair. Interestingly, treating BRCA1&#8208;deficient cells with CP7 restores HR integrity, which is accompanied by increased resistance to CP7. Additionally, CP7 treatment increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CP7 is a selective inhibitor of NHEJ, offering a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy.

         <title>Enhanced Alkene Oxidative Cleavage in Water via Photoexcited FeIV Species within Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the catalytic activity of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O towards alkene scission in water, facilitated by the hydrophobic COF backbone. The COF acts as a photosensitizer and structural support, enhancing reaction efficiency by proximity effect. The method achieves up to 75&#8201;% yield, producing selectively aldehydes or ketones, and is recyclable for four cycles.







Abstract
The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is a crucial step in synthesizing key organic molecules featuring carbonyl functional groups prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo&#8208;catalytically generated [(bTAML)FeIV&#8722;O&#8722;FeIV(bTAML)]&#8722; species (where bTAML stands for biuret&#8208;modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst. This study marks the inaugural demonstration of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O species facilitating alkene cleavage in water against a backdrop of a hydrophobic COF. Through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including control experiments, we confirm that these two high&#8208;valent iron oxo species collaborate to cleave alkenes, forming an intermediate epoxide. Our approach yields moderate to high success across various alkenes, displaying diverse functional groups (achieving up to 75&#8201;% yield) with notable efficiency and selectivity towards aldehyde/ketone products. Moreover, the heterogeneous COF film, immobilizing (Et4N)2[FeIII(Cl)bTAML], exhibits exceptional recyclability, enduring up to four cycles.

         <title>Encapsulation of Sn Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters in Multichannel Carbon Matrix for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF, a flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries, is synthesized with uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in a multichannel carbon matrix. This design ensures a size&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance with enhanced K+ diffusion kinetics and cycling stability. Theoretical calculations clarify electron transfer and energy barriers of intermediates. In situ XRD and XANES analysis reveals the K+ storage mechanisms.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;small particle sizes are particularly significant to create advanced energy storage materials. Herein, Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped multichannel carbon matrix (denoted as Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF) are designed by a facile and controllable route as flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in multichannel carbon matrix can be precisely identified, which ensure us to clarify the size influence on the electrochemical performance. The sub&#8208;nanoscale effect of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF restrains electrode pulverization and enhances the K+ diffusion kinetics, leading to the superior cycling stability and rate performance. As freestanding anode in PIBs, Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF manifests superior K+ storage properties, such as exceptional cycling stability ( around 331&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rate capability. Especially, the Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF||KFe[Fe(CN)6] full cell demonstrates impressive reversible capacity of around 167&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;A g&#8722;1 even after 200 cycles. Theoretical calculations clarify that the ultrafine Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters are beneficial for electron transfer and contribute to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates, thereby resulting in promising electrochemical performance. Comprehensive investigation for the intrinsic K+ storage process of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF is revealed by in situ analysis. This work provides vital guidance to design sub&#8208;nanoscale functional materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Tuning the Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction between Ni and Fe Atoms in Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Boost CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distance effect and inter&#8208;metal interaction of dual&#8208;atom catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction are demonstrated. The NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibits superior activity compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding configurations. The N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance of around 2.7&#8197;&#197; facilitate the adsorption of *COOH and promote the desorption of *CO, thus enhancing the performance.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are promising for applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction due to the enhanced flexibility of the catalytic sites and the synergistic effect between dual atoms. However, precisely controlling the atomic distance and identifying the dual&#8208;atom configuration of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Here, the Ni and Fe atomic pairs were constructed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support in three different configurations: NiFe&#8208;isolate, NiFe&#8208;N bridge, and NiFe&#8208;bonding. It was found that the NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibited superior CO2 reduction activity and promising stability when compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding catalysts. A series of characterizations and density functional theory calculations suggested that the N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms can exert a more pronounced synergy. It not only regulated the suitable adsorption strength for the *COOH intermediate but also promoted the desorption of *CO, thus accelerating the CO2 electroreduction to CO. This work provides an important implication for the enhancement of catalysis by the tailoring of the coordination structure of DACs, with the identification of distance effect between neighboring dual atoms.

         <title>Programmable Reconfiguration of Supramolecular Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: From Solution Self&#8208;Assembly to Co&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Assistant Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics, nanospheres and multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings are obtained by solution and co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly, which not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domain.







Abstract
Achieving structural reconfiguration of supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers toward topological engineering is of particular interest but challenging. Here, we address the creation of supramolecular architectures to discover how assembled topology influences the structured aggregates, combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics. We first design H&#8208;bonding linear&#8208;brush block copolymer P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), bearing linear block P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC) (poly(norbornene&#8208;terminated diaminopyridine&#8208;co&#8208;norbornene&#8208;terminated hexane)) with pendant H&#8208;bonding DAP (diaminopyridine) motifs, and PEO (poly(ethylene oxide)) densely grafted P(NBPEO) brush block. Thanks to H&#8208;bonding association between DAP and thymine (Thy), incorporation of Thy&#8208;functionalized polystyrene (Thy&#8208;PS65) enables solution self&#8208;assembly and formation of H&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers, generating augmented nanospheres with increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 amount. Noteworthy that integration of inorganic cluster silicotungstic acid (STA) to P(NBC&#8208;co&#8208;NBDAP)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), endows the formation of PEO/STA eutectic core. Therefore, co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly at the interfaces of polymeric, inorganic and supramolecular chemistry is realized, reflecting multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, finally to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings, by gradually increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 while fixing STA content. Interestingly, such solution self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly strategy not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domains. These findings clearly provide unique methodology towards programmable fabrication of geometrical objects promising in smart materials.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Multifunctional Hydrogel Network with Toughly Interfacial Chemistry for Dendrite&#8208;Free Flexible Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life flexible ZIBs. This work offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.







Abstract
Flexible and high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), coupled with low cost and safe, are considered as one of the most promising energy storage candidates for wearable electronics. Hydrogel electrolytes present a compelling alternative to liquid electrolytes due to their remarkable flexibility and clear advantages in mitigating parasitic side reactions. However, hydrogel electrolytes suffer from poor mechanical properties and interfacial chemistry, which limits them to suppressed performance levels in flexible ZIBs, especially under harsh mechanical strains. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life flexible ZIBs. As a result, the trehalose&#8208;modified PAM hydrogel exhibits a superior strength and stretchability up to 100&#8197;kPa and 5338&#8201;%, respectively, as well as strong adhesive properties to various substrates. Also, the PAM/trehalose hydrogel electrolyte provides superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability for Zn anode and regulates Zn nucleation/growth, resulting in achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.8&#8201;%, and long&#8208;term stability over 2400&#8197;h. Importantly, the flexible Zn//MnO2 pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling performance under different bending conditions, which offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.

         <title>Heteroatoms&#8208;Stabilized Single Palladium Atoms on Amorphous Zeolites: Breaking the Tradeoff between Catalytic Activity and Selectivity for Alkyne Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic system based on single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on heteroatom (B, Al, or Ga)&#8208;containing amorphous zeolite, achieves the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the semihydrogenation of alkynes, demonstrating a recorded turnover frequency value of 24198&#8197;h&#8722;1 and high styrene selectivity (95&#8201;%).







Abstract
As a fundamental industrial catalytic process, the semihydrogenation of alkynes presents a challenge in striking a balance between activity and selectivity due to the issue of over&#8208;hydrogenation. Herein, we develop an efficient catalytic system based on single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on boron&#8208;containing amorphous zeolites (Pd/AZ&#8722;B), achieving the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of alkynes. Advanced characterizations and theoretical density functional theory calculations confirm that the incorporated B atoms in the Pd/AZ&#8722;B can not only alter the geometric and electronic properties of Pd atoms by controlling the electron migration from Pd but also mitigate the interaction between alkene and the catalyst supports. This boosts the exceptional catalytic efficacy in the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene under mild conditions (298&#8197;K, 2&#8197;bar H2), achieving a recorded turnover frequency (TOF) value of 24198&#8197;h&#8722;1 and demonstrating 95&#8201;% selectivity to styrene at full conversion of phenylacetylene. By comparison, the heteroatom&#8208;free amorphous zeolite&#8208;anchored Pd nanoparticles and the commercial Lindlar catalyst have styrene selectivities of 73&#8201;% and 15&#8201;%, respectively, under identical reaction conditions. This work establishes a solid foundation for developing highly active and selective hydrogenation catalysts by controllably optimizing their electronic and steric properties.

         <title>Spatial&#8208;coupled Ampere&#8208;level Electrochemical Propylene Epoxidation over RuO2/Ti Hollow&#8208;fiber Penetration Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ampere&#8208;level propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) is achieved over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) in a membraneless reactor, in virtue of the synergetic combination of both the penetration effect and the spatial&#8208;coupling strategy, exhibiting specificity propylene oxide (PO) production of over 80&#8201;% PO faradaic efficiency (FEPO) and a maximum 859&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 PO partial current density (jPO), with significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.







Abstract
The electrochemical propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) provides a promising route for ecofriendly propylene oxide (PO) production, instantly generating active halogen/oxygen species to alleviate chloride contamination inherent in traditional PER. However, the complex processes and unsatisfactory PO yield for current electrochemical PER falls short of meeting industrial application requirements. Herein, a spatial&#8208;coupling strategy over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) is adopted to facilitate efficient PO production, significantly improving PER performance to ampere level (achieving over 80&#8201;% PO faradaic efficiency and a maximum PO current density of 859&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The synergetic combination of the penetration effect of HPE and the spatial&#8208;coupled reaction sequence, enables the realization of ampere&#8208;level PO production with high specificity, exhibiting significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.

         <title>Upcycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes to Heterostructured Electrocatalysts for Stable Direct Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging P and Fe from spent LiFePO4 cathodes, in situ generated PO43&#8722; and NiOOH/Fe3(PO4)2 heterointerfaces effectively inhibit chlorine oxidation while promoting OH&#8722; adsorption and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through electrostatic modulation. The resulting catalyst demonstrates exceptional OER activity and durability in alkaline seawater.







Abstract
The pursuit of carbon&#8208;neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni&#8208;based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine&#8208;rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser&#8208;ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L&#8208;LFP), derived from spent Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43&#8722; species, formed around L&#8208;LFP, effectively repels Cl&#8722; ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH&#8722; adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3&#8201;% activity loss after 600&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high&#8208;performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Catalytic Structural Isomerisation as a Route to &#945;&#8208;Arylated Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, dual catalytic method for the structural isomerisation of easy&#8208;to&#8208;make tertiary allylic alcohols into &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones is reported. Applications of this straightforward approach include a two&#8208;step homologation of diaryl ketone drug molecules.







Abstract
Isomerisation reactions provide streamlined routes to organic compounds which are otherwise hard to directly synthesise. The most common forms are positional, geometrical or stereochemical isomerisations which involve the relocation of a double bond or a change in relative location of groups in space. In contrast, far fewer examples of structural (or constitutional) isomerisation exist where the connectivity between atoms is altered. The development of platforms capable of such rearrangement poses a unique set of challenges because chemical bonds must be selectively cleaved, and new ones formed without overall addition or removal of atoms. Here, we show that a dual catalytic system can enable the structural isomerisation of readily available allylic alcohols into more challenging&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones via a H&#8208;atom transfer initiated semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement. Key to our strategy is the combination of a cobalt catalyst and photocatalyst under reductive, protic conditions which allows intermediates to propagate catalytic turnover. By providing an unusual disconnection to structural motifs which are difficult to access through direct arylation, we anticipate inspiring other advanced catalytic isomerisation strategies that will further retrosynthetic logic for complex molecule synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;Isomerisation reactions provide streamlined routes to organic compounds which are otherwise hard to directly synthesise. The most common forms are positional, geometrical or stereochemical isomerisations which involve the relocation of a double bond or a change in relative location of groups in space. In contrast, far fewer examples of structural (or constitutional) isomerisation exist where the connectivity between atoms is altered. The development of platforms capable of such rearrangement poses a unique set of challenges because chemical bonds must be selectively cleaved, and new ones formed without overall addition or removal of atoms. Here, we show that a dual catalytic system can enable the structural isomerisation of readily available allylic alcohols into more challenging-to-synthesise &#945;-arylated ketones via a H-atom transfer initiated semi-pinacol rearrangement. Key to our strategy is the combination of a cobalt catalyst and photocatalyst under reductive, protic conditions which allows intermediates to propagate catalytic turnover. By providing an unusual disconnection to structural motifs which are difficult to access through direct arylation, we anticipate inspiring other advanced catalytic isomerisation strategies that will further retrosynthetic logic for complex molecule synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;Involved Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Triple&#8208;Bond Monomer Based Polymerization toward Processable Functional Polyamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful polymerization of water, isocyanide, and chlorooxime was established toward polyamide with a novel modifiable architecture. Through hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction, emissive units were introduced to the polyamide, which emission colors could range from blue to red. The refractive index (n) of polyamides was also significantly improved and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
Polyamide plays a pivotal role in engineering thermoplastics. Constrained by the harsh conditions and arduous procedures for its industrial synthesis, developing facile synthesis of polyamides is still challengeable and holds profound significance. Herein, we successfully utilized water as one of the monomers to synthesize functional polyamides under ambient conditions. A powerful multicomponent polymerization of water, isocyanides, and chlorooximes was established in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Soluble and thermally stable polyamides with high weight&#8208;average molecular weights (up to 53 900) were obtained in excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%). The polymerization exhibits unique polymerization&#8208;induced emission characteristics, successfully converting non&#8208;emissive monomers into unconventional emissive polymers. Notably, the resultant polyamides could undergo effective post&#8208;modification via the hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction. By incorporating various functional groups into the polyamide, its emission color could be fine&#8208;tuned from blue to green and to red. Remarkably, the refractive index (n) of the polyamide at 589&#8197;nm could be increased from 1.6173 to 1.7227 and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers after post&#8208;modification, and its micron&#8208;thick films exhibited excellent transparency in the visible region. Thus, this work not only establishes a powerful polymerization toward novel polyamides but also opens up an avenue for their versatile functionalization.

         <title>Visualization of Electrooxidation on Palladium Single Crystal Surfaces via In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed schematic of the entire electrooxidation reaction pathway on the Pd single crystal surface can be outlined by obtaining the direct spectroscopic evidence of *OH and *OO intermediates via in situ Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, it is found that surface&#8208;adsorbed ClO4&#8722; ions can facilitate the deprotonation process of *OH and accelerate the electrooxidation process.







Abstract
The electrooxidation of catalyst surfaces is across various electrocatalytic reactions, directly impacting their activity, stability and selectivity. Precisely characterizing the electrooxidation on well&#8208;defined surfaces is essential to understanding electrocatalytic reactions comprehensively. Herein, we employed in situ Raman spectroscopy to monitor the electrooxidation process of palladium single crystal. Our findings reveal that the Pd surface's initial electrooxidation process involves forming *OH intermediate and ClO4&#8722; ions facilitate the deprotonation process, leading to the formation of PdOx. Subsequently, under deep electrooxidation potential range, the oxygen atoms within PdOx contribute to creating surface&#8208;bound peroxide species, ultimately resulting in oxygen generation. The adsorption strength of *OH and the coverage of ClO4&#8722; can be adjusted by the controllable electronic effect, resulting in different oxidation rates. This study offers valuable insights into elucidating the electrooxidation mechanisms underlying a range of electrocatalytic reactions, thereby contributing to the rational design of catalysts.

         <title>Front Cover: Programmable Chemical Evolution with Natural/non&#8208;natural Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying evolution to create bioactive molecules beyond natural building blocks (BBs) is crucial for chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, the application of evolution with many different non&#8208;natural BBs remains challenging. In their Research Article (e202409746), Yixin Zhang, Fazheng Ren, Weilin Lin et&#8197;al. developed a programmable chemical evolution approach using natural/non&#8208;natural BBs. It starts from creating ancestral molecules, followed by evolving high&#8208;affinity peptidomimetic binders in just a few generations within an astronomically large combinatorial space.

         <dc:description>
Subtractive two&#8208;photon biofabrication facilitates spatiotemporal tissue engineering and drug testing in the laboratory. However, it necessitates the rational design of cell&#8208;compatible, photolabile macromolecular networks that cleave rapidly upon laser exposure. In their Communication (e202404599), Xiao&#8208;Hua Qin and co&#8208;workers develop coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels that enable two&#8208;photon direct laser writing of complex 3D microfluidic networks at 300 mm s&#8722;1. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept laser&#8208;guided tissue morphogenesis is demonstrated at micron&#8208;scale resolution.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal operando Raman spectroscopy, combined with kinetic analysis under controlled chemical conditions, was employed to investigate the formation of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their kinetic impact during methane dry reforming on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, as reported by Matteo Monai, Matteo Maestri et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202408668). In the cover image, an increased CO2 content (depicted by the hot air balloon) relative to methane (represented by the basket) inhibits methane from leading to coke formation, symbolized by the mountains (Cover design: Lia Tagliavini).

         <dc:description>
The dissolution&#8211;recrystallization of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) opens exciting possibilities for fluorochromic detection of radionuclides. In their Research Article (e202410453), Jian Lin et al. introduce a novel method for detecting Th4+ ions using a series of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based MOFs. The inherent instability of MOFs is leveraged to enable Th4+ detection through an unprecedented dissolution&#8211;recrystallization mechanism, transforming a perceived limitation into a valuable tool for fluorochromic sensing of radionuclides.

         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) is reported by Jing Lin and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202408064). The &#8220;dormant&#8221; PS in normal cells, depicted in gray, transforms into its &#8220;active mode&#8221; (red) upon entering tumor cells through the portal, where it is activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment and generates toxic singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, selectively killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal tissues.

         <title>Front Cover: Allostery at a Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Harboring an Intermolecular Motional Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic networks are important devices for allosteric regulation of protein function. In their Communication (e202411472), Rasmus Linser and co&#8208;workers use NMR spectroscopy and simulations to show that intermolecular association can make a connection for such networks to arise from segments previously bearing unrelated motion. Awareness of this kind of constructive, switchable modulation could help understanding and exploiting allosteric modulators for pharmacological or biotechnological avenues.

         <title>Front Cover: Transforming Red Phosphorus Photocatalysis: Dual Roles of Pre&#8208;Anchored Ru Single Atoms in Defect and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;anchoring ruthenium (Ru) single atoms in crystalline red phosphorus boosts its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Yun Hau Ng, Lin Jing et al. highlight in their Research Article (e202409179) the dual role of this innovative strategy in repairing undesired phosphorus defects and enabling Ru nanoparticle anchoring. This results in extended charge lifetimes and enhanced interfacial charge transfer, leading to a &#8220;simple&#8221; yet highly efficient photocatalytic system for hydrogen production.

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductase&#8208;Catalyzed Aromatization of Simple Cyclohexanones to Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) system is reported that facilitates the direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to give substituted phenols. The process entails successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and leverages molecular oxygen from the air to drive the reaction cycle. This approach serves as a robust alternative to conventional synthetic methods.







Abstract
Direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to synthesize substituted phenols represents a significant challenge in modern synthetic chemistry. Herein, we describe a novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) catalytic system that converts substituted cyclohexanones into the corresponding phenols. This process involves the successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds within the six&#8208;membered ring of cyclohexanones and utilizes molecular oxygen to drive the reaction cycle. It demonstrates a versatile and efficient approach for the synthesis of substituted phenols, providing a valuable complement to existing chemical methodologies.

         <dc:description>
During the photocatalytic process, Ru atoms are anchored in situ by COF&#8208;Cu3TG, forming a single&#8208;atom electronic bridge between layers. This, combined with the selection of small&#8208;sized metal cluster, facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic HER capability.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is one of the most valuable technologies in the future energy system. Here, we designed a metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with both small&#8208;sized metal clusters and nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, named COF&#8208;Cu3TG. Based on our design, small&#8208;sized metal clusters were selected to increase the density of active sites and shorten the distance of electron transport to active sites. While another building block containing nitrogen&#8208;rich organic ligands acted as a node that could in situ anchor metal atoms during photocatalysis and form interlayer single&#8208;atom electron bridges (SAEB) to accelerate electron transport. Together, they promoted photocatalytic performance. This represented the further utilization of Ru atoms and was an additional application of the photosensitizer. N2&#8208;Ru&#8208;N2 electron bridge (Ru&#8208;SAEB) was created in situ between the layers, resulting in a considerable enhancement in the hydrogen production rate of the photocatalyst to 10.47&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Through theoretical calculation and EXAFS, the existence position and action mechanism of Ru&#8208;SAEB were reasonably inferred, further confirming the rationality of the Ru&#8208;SAEB configuration. A sufficiently proximity between the small&#8208;sized Cu3 cluster and the Ru&#8208;SAEB was found to expedite electron transfer. This work demonstrated the synergistic impact of small molecular clusters with Ru&#8208;SAEB for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Axial Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray Detection by a Two&#8208;Dimensional Biaxial Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection was achieved by using the multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric material BA2EA2Pb3I10 for the first time. It presents ultra&#8208;low detection limits along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis (19.4&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 17.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively) at zero bias, which was two orders of magnitude lower than commercial &#945;&#8208;Se.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite ferroelectrics combining spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconducting properties is an ideal platform for enabling self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection. However, achievements to date have been only based on uniaxiality, which increases the complexity of device fabrication. Multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric materials have multiple equivalent polarization directions, making them potentially amenable to multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection, but the report on these types of materials is still a huge blank. Herein, a high&#8208;quality (BA)2(EA)2Pb3I10 (1) biaxial ferroelectric single crystal was successfully grown, which exhibited significant spontaneous polarization along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was exhibited along both the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis, with open circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.23&#8197;V and 0.22&#8197;V, respectively. Then, the BPVE revealed along the inversion of polarized direction with the polarized electric fields. Intriguingly, due to the BPVE of 1, 1 achieved multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection for the first time (c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis) with relatively high sensitivities and ultralow detection limits (17.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 19.4&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively). This work provides a reference for the subsequent use of multi&#8208;axial ferroelectricity for multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven optoelectronic detection.

         <title>Crosslink&#8208;Enhanced Emission&#8208;Dominated Design Strategy for Constructing Self&#8208;Protective Carbonized Polymer Dots With Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated strategy was proposed, achieving desired Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) (710&#8197;nm) in self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). Combined with experiments and theoretical calculations, crosslinking, conjugation and steric hindrance factors were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission.







Abstract
Self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with advantageous crosslinked nano&#8208;structures have attracted considerable attention in metal&#8208;free room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, whereas their RTP emissions are still limited to short wavelength. Expanding their RTP emissions to Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) range is attractive but suffers from the difficulties in constructing narrow energy levels and inhibiting intense non&#8208;radiative decay. Herein, a crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated construction strategy was proposed, achieving desired NIR RTP (710&#8197;nm) in self&#8208;protective CPDs for the first time. Structural factors, i.e., crosslinking (covalent&#8208;bond CEE), conjugation (conjugated amine with bridging N&#8722;H and C=C group), and steric hindrance (confined&#8208;domain CEE), were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission in CPDs. Contrast experiments and theoretical calculations further revealed the rationality of the design strategy originating from CEE in terms of promoting the narrow energy level emission of triplet excitons and inhibiting the non&#8208;radiative quenching. This work not only firstly achieves NIR RTP in self&#8208;protective CPDs but also helps understand the origin of NIR RTP to further guide the synthesis of diverse CPDs with efficient long&#8208;wavelength RTP emission.

         <dc:description>
Recently, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers reported new chalcone photoswitches claimed to display advantageous optical and photochemical properties for potential biological applications, i.e., switching with blue, green and red light in aqueous solution. In this Correspondence, we argue that further experimental evidence is required to support the proposed design, data interpretation, and main conclusions.







Abstract
In a recent Communication in this journal, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers proposed a rational design of chalcone photoswitches that are claimed to convert into the respective flavylium cations upon irradiation with blue, green, and red light in aqueous media. Here we argue that the reported improvements on the optical/photochemical properties of the new chalcone photoswitches are not substantiated and that the proposed design and data interpretation rely on assumptions that have yet to be validated. We also identify a series of control experiments that can be performed to verify the hypotheses and better support the conclusions presented by the authors.

         <title>Reaction of &#946;&#8208;Ketoester and 1,3&#8208;Diol to Access Chemically Recyclable and Mechanically Robust Poly(vinyl alcohol) Thermosets through Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester</title>

         <dc:description>
TOC: &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester was designed and used to prepare high&#8208;performance poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) via a straightforward modification with &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, followed by the cross&#8208;linking reaction with 1,3&#8208;diol groups. Treatment with HCl solution and heat allows the deconstruction of the cross&#8208;linked PVA, ensuring the selective and quantitative recovery of the initial materials.







Abstract
The development of mechanically robust, chemically stable, and yet recyclable polymers represents an essential undertaking in the context of advancing a circular economy for plastics. Here, we introduce a novel cleavable &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester (DXE) linkage, synthesized through the catalyst&#8208;free reaction of &#946;&#8208;ketoester and 1,3&#8208;diol, to cross&#8208;link poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for the formation of high&#8208;performance thermosets with inherent chemical recyclability. PVA, modified with &#946;&#8208;ketoester groups through the transesterification reaction with excess tert&#8208;butyl acetoacetate, undergoes cross&#8208;linking reactions with the unmodified 1,3&#8208;diols within PVA itself upon thermal treatment. The cross&#8208;linking architecture improves PVA&#8217;s mechanical properties, with Young's modulus and toughness that can reach up to 656&#8197;MPa and 84&#8197;MJ&#8201;cm&#8722;3, i.e. approximately 3&#8208; and 12&#8208;fold those of linear PVA, respectively. Thermal treatment of the cross&#8208;linked PVA polymers under acid conditions leads to deconstruction of the networks, enabling the excellent recovery (&gt;90&#8201;%) of PVA. In the absence of either thermal or acidic treatment, the cross&#8208;linked PVA maintains its dimensional stability. We show that the recovery of PVA is also possible when the treatment is performed in the presence of other plastics commonly found in recycling mixtures. Furthermore, PVA&#8208;based composites comprising carbon fibers and activated charcoal cross&#8208;linked by the DXE linkages are also shown to be recyclable with recovery of the PVA and the fillers.

     alt="Reaction of &#946;-Ketoester and 1,3-Diol to Access Chemically Recyclable and Mechanically Robust Poly(vinyl alcohol) Thermosets through Incorporation of &#946;-(1,3-dioxane)ester"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOC: &#946;-(1,3-dioxane)ester was designed and used to prepare high-performance poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) via a straightforward modification with &#946;-ketoesters, followed by the cross-linking reaction with 1,3-diol groups. Treatment with HCl solution and heat allows the deconstruction of the cross-linked PVA, ensuring the selective and quantitative recovery of the initial materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of mechanically robust, chemically stable, and yet recyclable polymers represents an essential undertaking in the context of advancing a circular economy for plastics. Here, we introduce a novel cleavable &#946;-(1,3-dioxane)ester (&lt;b&gt;DXE&lt;/b&gt;) linkage, synthesized through the catalyst-free reaction of &#946;-ketoester and 1,3-diol, to cross-link poly(vinyl alcohol) (&lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt;) for the formation of high-performance thermosets with inherent chemical recyclability. &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt;, modified with &#946;-ketoester groups through the transesterification reaction with excess &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl acetoacetate, undergoes cross-linking reactions with the unmodified 1,3-diols within &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt; itself upon thermal treatment. The cross-linking architecture improves &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt;&#8217;s mechanical properties, with Young's modulus and toughness that can reach up to 656&#8197;MPa and 84&#8197;MJ&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. approximately 3- and 12-fold those of linear &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. Thermal treatment of the cross-linked &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt; polymers under acid conditions leads to deconstruction of the networks, enabling the excellent recovery (&amp;gt;90&#8201;%) of &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt;. In the absence of either thermal or acidic treatment, the cross-linked &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt; maintains its dimensional stability. We show that the recovery of &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt; is also possible when the treatment is performed in the presence of other plastics commonly found in recycling mixtures. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt;-based composites comprising carbon fibers and activated charcoal cross-linked by the &lt;b&gt;DXE&lt;/b&gt; linkages are also shown to be recyclable with recovery of the &lt;b&gt;PVA&lt;/b&gt; and the fillers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Sulfur&#8211;Carbon Catalyst Mimicking the Two&#8208;Component Architecture of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;mimicking metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst, composed of S&#8722;C&#8208;supported ruthenium single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs), was designed for electrochemical nitrate reduction. Leveraging the synergistic effects of SAs and NPs, this two&#8208;component M&#8722;S&#8722;C catalyst exhibits an exceptional ammonia yield rate of 37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, surpassing most reported electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The production of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen sources involves competitive adsorption of different intermediates and multiple electron and proton transfers, presenting grand challenges in catalyst design. In nature nitrogenases reduce dinitrogen to NH3 using two component proteins, in which electrons and protons are delivered from Fe protein to the active site in MoFe protein for transfer to the bound N2. We draw inspiration from this structural enzymology, and design a two&#8208;component metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst composed of sulfur&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to NH3. The catalyst demonstrates a remarkable NH3 yield rate of ~37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of ~97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, outperforming those consisting solely of SAs or NPs, and even surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the critical role of Ru SAs with the coordination of S in promoting the formation of the HONO intermediate and the subsequent reduction reaction over the NP&#8208;surface nearby. Such process results in a more energetically accessible pathway for NO3&#8722; reduction on Ru NPs co&#8208;existing with SAs. This study proves a better understanding of how M&#8722;S&#8722;Cs act as a synthetic nitrogenase mimic during ammonia synthesis, and contributes to the future mechanism&#8208;based catalyst design.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Anti&#8208;Ohmic Behaviour in Diradicaloid Molecular Wires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular conductance increases with length at a significant rate in a series of bis(indeno)acene molecular wires. The rapid shrinking of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap induced by the singlet diradicaloid character of these compounds is responsible for the observed behaviour. These results pave the way to long&#8208;range, efficient coherent tunnelling charge transport.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell materials bearing multiple spin centres provide a key route to efficient charge transport in single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. They have narrow energy gaps, and their molecular orbitals align closely to the Fermi level of the metallic electrodes, thus allowing efficient electronic transport and higher conductance. Maintaining and stabilising multiple open&#8208;shell states&#8212;especially in contact with metallic electrodes&#8212;is however very challenging, generally requiring a continuous chemical or electrochemical potential to avoid self&#8208;immolation of the open&#8208;shell character. To overcome this issue, we designed, synthesised, and measured the conductance of a series of bis(indeno) fused acenes, where stability is imparted by a close&#8208;shell quinoidal conformation in resonance with the diradical electronic configuration. We show here that these compounds have anti&#8208;ohmic behaviour, with conductance increasing with increasing molecular length, at an unprecedented rate and across the entire bias window (

&#177;1.3V

 ${\pm 1.3\ V}$



). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations support our findings, showing the rapidly narrowing HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, unique to these diradicaloid structures, is responsible for the observed behaviour. Our results provide a framework for achieving efficient transport in neutral compounds and demonstrate the promise that diradicaloid materials have in single&#8208;molecule electronics, owing to their great stability and unique electronic structure.

         <title>Standardized Parts for Activation of Small GTPase Signaling in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a plug and play approach for the direct control of small GTPase activation in living cells. This approach is applied to the temporal control of filopodia formation, membrane ruffling, cell retraction, and MAPK signaling.







Abstract
Small GTPases comprise a superfamily of over 167 proteins in the human genome and are critical regulators of a variety of pathways including cell migration and proliferation. Despite the importance of these proteins in cell signaling, a standardized approach for controlling small GTPase activation within living cells is lacking. Herein, we report a split&#8208;protein&#8208;based approach to directly activate small GTPase signaling in living cells. Importantly, our fragmentation site can be applied across the small GTPase superfamily. We highlight the utility of these standardized parts by demonstrating the ability to directly modulate the activity of four different small GTPases with user&#8208;defined inputs, providing the first plug and play system for direct activation of small GTPases in living cells.

         <title>MOFite: A High&#8208;Density Lithiophilic and Scalable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Anode for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A salicylaldehydate&#8208;linked iron&#8208;based MOF (Fe&#8722;Tp) was demonstrated as a scalable and high&#8208;performance pristine anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Furthermore, Fe&#8722;Tp has been explored as a performance enhancer for commercial graphite anodes in LIBs, highlighting its potential practical utility.







Abstract
Developing an anode material that has better performance efficiency than commercial graphite while keeping the features of economic scalability and environmental safety is highly desirable yet challenging. MOFs are a promising addition to the ongoing efforts, however, the relatively poor performance, chemical instability, and large&#8208;scale economic production of efficiency&#8208;proven pristine MOFs restrict their utility in real&#8208;life energy storage applications. Furthermore, hierarchical porosity for lucid mass diffusion, high&#8208;density lithiophilic sites are some of the structural parameters for improving the electrode performance. Herein, we have demonstrated the potential of economically scalable salicylaldehydate 3D&#8208;conjugated&#8208;MOF (Fe&#8722;Tp) as a high&#8208;performance anode in Li&#8208;ion batteries: the anode&#8208;specific capacity achieved up to 1447&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 89&#8201;% of cyclic stability after 500&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for pristine MOF. More importantly, incorporating 10&#8201;% Fe&#8722;Tp doping in commercial graphite (MOFite) significantly enhanced lithium storage, doubling capacity after 400&#8197;cycles. It signifies the potential practical utility of Fe&#8722;Tp as a performance booster for commercial anode material.

It signifies the potential practical utility of Fe&#8722;Tp as a performance booster for commercial anode material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Brings High Electron Delocalization for Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural systems optimize charge carrier behavior via molecular spatial arrangement, a phenomenon largely unexplored in artificial systems. PFC&#8208;1, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with controllable &#960;&#8208;stacking, offers valuable insights into this process. Varying &#960;&#8208;stacking perpendicular to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated plane in HOFs alters electron density, redox potential, and charge carrier transport and separation, thereby enhancing catalytic performance.







Abstract
Unlike many studies that regulate transport and separation behaviour of photogenerated charge carriers through controlling the chemical composite, our work demonstrates this goal can be achieved through simply tuning the molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range within hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) without altering the building blocks or network topology. Further investigations reveal that the long&#8208;range &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking significantly promotes electron delocalization and enhances electron density, thereby effectively suppressing electron&#8208;hole recombination and augmenting the charge transfer rate. Simultaneously, acting as a porous substrate, it boosts electron density of Pd nanoparticle loaded on its surfaces, resulting in remarkable CO2 photoreduction catalytic activity (CO generation rate: 48.1&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h) without the need for hole scavengers. Our study provide insight into regulating the charge carrier behaviours in molecular assemblies based on hydrogen bonds, offering a new clue for efficient photocatalyst design.

         <title>Porous Organic Cage as an Efficient Platform for Industrial Radioactive Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic cage (POC) was firstly developed as an efficient platform for industrial radioactive iodine capture, which provides a new insight for sufficiently utilizing binding sites. The constructed NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;)Me (NKPOC=Nankai porous organic cage) demonstrates a record&#8208;high I2 uptake of 48.35&#8197;wt&#8201;%, extraordinary adsorption capacity of unitionic sites (1.62 I2/ionic sites), and remarkable kinetics (k1=0.013&#8197;min&#8722;1).







Abstract
Herein, we firstly develop porous organic cage (POC) as an efficient platform for highly effective radioactive iodine capture under industrial operating conditions (typically &#8805;150&#8201;&#176;C), &#8804;150&#8197;ppmv of I2). Due to the highly dispersed and readily accessible binding sites as well as sufficient accommodating space, the constructed NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;) (NKPOC=Nankai porous organic cage) demonstrates a record&#8208;high I2 uptake capacity of 48.35&#8197;wt&#8201;% and extraordinary adsorption capacity of unit ionic site (~1.62) at 150&#8201;&#176;C and 150&#8197;ppmv of I2. The I2 capacity is 3.5, 1.6, and 1.3&#8197;times higher than industrial silver&#8208;based adsorbents Ag@MOR and benchmark materials of TGDM and 4F&#8208;iCOF&#8208;TpBpy&#8208;I&#8722; under the same conditions. Furthermore, NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;)Me exhibits remarkable adsorption kinetics (k1=0.013&#8197;min&#8722;1), which is 1.2 and 1.6&#8197;times higher than TGDM and 4F&#8208;iCOF&#8208;TpBpy&#8208;I&#8722; under the identical conditions. NKPOC&#8208;DT&#8208;(I&#8722;)Me thus sets a new benchmark for industrial radioactive I2 adsorbents. This work not only provides a new insight for effectively enhancing the adsorption capacity of unit functional sites, but also advances POC as an efficient platform for radioiodine capture in industry.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 Batteries with Redox Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;free aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 batteries were designed via matching Mn2+/MnO2 and S/Cu2S redox couplings, which exhibit high energy density and excellent cycling stability. These merits endow them with significant potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage.







Abstract
The energy densities of conventional aqueous batteries are often unsatisfactory due to the limited capacities of electrode materials. Therefore, the design of creative aqueous batteries has to be considered. Herein, aqueous S&#8208;MnO2 batteries are constructed by matching S/Cu2S redox couples and MnO2 deposition/dissolution. In such batteries, S/Cu2S redox couples undergo the solid&#8208;solid conversion reaction with four&#8208;electron transfer, ensuring a high specific capacity of 2220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in S anodes. Furthermore, the conversion reaction of S/Cu2S redox couples can take place stably in acidic electrolyte that is essential for the MnO2 deposition/dissolution. As a result, the S/Cu2S redox couples can match MnO2 deposition/dissolution well, which endow the batteries with a membrane&#8208;free configuration. As a proof of concept, Ah&#8208;level prismatic and single&#8208;flow batteries were assembled and could operate stably for over 1000&#8197;h, demonstrating their great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage. This work broadens the horizons of aqueous batteries beyond metal&#8208;manganese chemistry.

         <title>Tailoring the Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Reliable Operation of All&#8208;Climate 4.8&#8197;V Li||NCM811 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte is designed to conquer the high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich lithium metal batteries. Our electrolyte demonstrates superb compatibility with both lithium metal anode and NCM811 cathode at even 4.8&#8197;V. We validate a 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class Li||NCM811 pouch cell with energy density of 462.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 pioneeringly, highlighting the practical potential of our electrolyte.







Abstract
Combining high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathodes with lithium metal anodes is among the most promising approaches for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries. However, most current electrolytes fail to simultaneously satisfy the compatibility requirements for the lithium metal anode and the tolerance for the ultra&#8208;high voltage NCM811 cathode. Here, we have designed an ultra&#8208;oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte by meticulously adjusting the composition of fluorinated carbonates. Our study reveals that a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in LiF and Li2O is constructed on the lithium anode through the synergistic decomposition of the fluorinated solvents and PF6&#8722; anion, facilitating smooth lithium metal deposition. The superior oxidation resistance of our electrolyte enables the Li||NCM811&#8197;cell to deliver a capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles at an ultrahigh cut&#8211;off voltage of 4.8&#8197;V. Additionally, a pioneering 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class lithium metal pouch cell with an energy density of 462.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 stably cycles for 110&#8197;cycles under harsh conditions of high cathode loading (30&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), low N/P ratio (1.18), and lean electrolytes (2.3&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1).

         <title>Regulating the Scaling Relations in Ammonia Synthesis through a Light&#8208;Driven Bendable Seesaw Effect on Tailored Iron Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepped {110} surface of the prepared &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s exposes abundant C7 sites with moderate EN, achieving a delicate balance in scaling relations and thermal catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis. A novel light&#8208;induced &#8220;bendable seesaw effect&#8221; resulting from hot electron transfer between catalyst and adsorbates was discovered to regulate the scaling relations and further significantly enhances the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Advancing the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process faces significant challenges due to the intrinsic constraints of scaling relations in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we reported an approach of bending the &#8220;seesaw effect&#8221; to regulate the scaling relations over a tailored &#945;&#8208;Fe metallic material (&#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s), realizing highly efficient light&#8208;driven thermal catalytic ammonia synthesis with a rate of 1260&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 without additional heating. Specifically, the thermal catalytic activity of &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s was significantly enhanced by the novel stepped {110} surface, exhibiting a 3.8&#8208;fold increase compared to the commercial fused&#8208;iron catalyst with promoters at 350&#8201;&#176;C. The photo&#8208;induced hot electron transfer further accelerates the dinitrogen dissociation and hydrogenation simultaneously, effectively overcoming the limitation of scaling relation over identical sites. Consequently, the ammonia production rate of &#945;&#8208;Fe&#8208;110s was further enhanced by 30&#8197;times at the same temperature with irradiation. This work designs an efficient and sustainable system for ammonia synthesis and provides a novel approach for regulating the scaling relations in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Modulating the Bader Charge Transfer in Single p&#8208;Block Atoms Doped Pd Metallene for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely controlling the Bader charge transfer between Pd surface and oxygenated intermediates (*OO) via p&#8208;d electronic interaction on single&#8208;atom p&#8208;block metal doped Pd metallene (M&#8722;Pd metallene, M=In, Sn, Pb, Bi) with only 4&#8211;5 atomic layers thickness enable efficient and stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Metallene is considered as an emerging family of electrocatalysts due to its atomically layered structure and unique surface stress. Here we propose a strategy to modulate the Bader charge transfer (BCT) between Pd surface and oxygenated intermediates via p&#8208;d electronic interaction by introducing single&#8208;atom p&#8208;block metal (M=In, Sn, Pb, Bi) into Pd metallene nanosheets towards efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). X&#8208;ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that doping p&#8208;block metals could facilitate electron transfer to Pd sites and thus downshift the d&#8208;band center of Pd and weaken the adsorption energy of O intermediates. Among them, the developed Bi&#8722;Pd metallene shows extraordinarily high ORR mass activity of 11.34&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 and 0.86&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V and 0.95&#8197;V in alkaline solution, respectively, representing the best Pd&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts ever reported. In the cathode of a Zinc&#8208;air battery, Bi&#8722;Pd metallene could achieve an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.546&#8197;V and keep stable for 760&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations suggest that the BCT between Pd surface and *OO intermediates greatly affects the bond length between them (dPd&#8208;*OO) and Bi doping could appropriately reduce the amount of BCT and stretch the dPd&#8208;*OO, thus enhancing the ORR activity.

         <title>Tetrapodal Hole&#8208;Collecting Monolayer Materials Based on Saddle&#8208;Like Cyclooctatetraene Core for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrapodal hole&#8208;collecting monolayer materials based on a saddle&#8208;like cyclooctatetraene core were developed. These molecules were found to form monolayers on transparent electrode substrates, with some phosphonic acid anchoring groups pointing upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. The perovskite solar cell devices using these hole&#8208;collecting monolayers exhibit high power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7&#8201;% and good operational stability.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;collecting monolayers have greatly advanced the development of positive&#8208;intrinsic&#8208;negative perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs). To date, however, most of the anchoring groups in the reported monolayer materials are designed to bind to the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) surface, resulting in less availability for other functions such as tuning the wettability of the monolayer surface. In this work, we developed two anchorable molecules, 4PATTI&#8208;C3 and 4PATTI&#8208;C4, by employing a saddle&#8208;like indole&#8208;fused cyclooctatetraene as a &#960;&#8208;core with four phosphonic acid anchoring groups linked through propyl or butyl chains. Both molecules form monolayers on TCO substrates. Thanks to the saddle shape of a cyclooctatetraene skeleton, two of the four phosphonic acid anchoring groups were found to point upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. Compared to the devices using 4PATTI&#8208;C4 as the hole&#8208;collecting monolayer, 4PATTI&#8208;C3&#8208;based devices exhibit a faster hole&#8208;collection process, leading to higher power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7&#8201;% and 21.4&#8201;% for a mini&#8208;cell (0.1&#8197;cm2) and a mini&#8208;module (1.62&#8197;cm2), respectively, together with good operational stability. This work represents how structural modification of multipodal molecules could substantially modulate the functions of the hole&#8208;collecting monolayers after being adsorbed onto TCO substrates.

         <title>Substituted Maleimides: Self&#8208;Reportable Linkers and Tags in Bioconjugation, Materials Science, and Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted maleimides are a highly modifiable heterocyclic motif and represent a versatile class of site&#8208;selective linkers characterised by their small size and customisable structures. This minireview encapsulates the evolution of substituted maleimides, detailing their synthetic pathways and specific mechanisms that govern fluorescence. The ongoing development of substituted maleimides aims to expand their applications as next&#8208;generation self&#8208;reportable linkers in bioconjugation, materials science, and nanotechnology.







Abstract
Substituted maleimides are customisable fluorescent linkers and probes with adaptable reactivity and optical properties. Their compact nature and tunability has led to their use in various applications. For example, their solvatochromic properties offer real&#8208;time feedback on linking chemistry and environmental changes, essential for applications in material labelling, drug delivery, and nanoparticle functionalisation. This review focusses on developing, synthesising, and modifying substituted maleimides as environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent linkers and probes. It delves into their photophysical dynamics and strategic applications, highlighting their significant contributions to macromolecule conjugation and the development of self&#8208;reporting materials.

An enantioselective hydro&#8208;cyclization reaction of 2,4&#8208;dienyl hydrazones and oximes has been developed, through Pd0 and Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;regioselective protonation followed by intramolecular allylic amination or etherification. A broad collection of dihydropyrazoles and dihydroisoxazoles, respectively, are constructed with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity, which can be elaborated to furnish multifunctional building blocks.







Abstract
The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydro&#8208;functionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes has been well explored, but most reactions focus on electron&#8208;neutral substrates in an intermolecular manner. Here we first demonstrate that readily available 2,4&#8208;dienyl hydrazones and oximes can be efficiently utilized in the hydro&#8208;cyclization reaction under co&#8208;catalysis of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a chiral palladium complex, furnishing multifunctional dihydropyrazones and dihydroisoxazoles, respectively. Diverse substitution patterns for both types of electron&#8208;deficient diene compounds are tolerated, and corresponding heterocycles were generally constructed with moderate to excellent enantioselectivity, which can be elaborated to access products with higher molecular complexity and diversity. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations support that &#945;&#8208;regioselective protonation of dienyl substrates by acid and concurrent &#960;&#8208;Lewis base activation of Pd0 complex is energetically favoured in the formation of active &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium intermediates, and an outer&#8208;sphere allylic amination or etherification mode is adopted to deliver the observed cyclized products enantioselectively.

         <title>Interfacial Electronic Interactions Promoted Activation for Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia over Ag&#8208;Modified Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The IEIs between Ag and Co3O4 significantly strengthen NO3&#8722; adsorption and stabilize CoO6 octahedrons within Co3O4, while suppressing H2 production. The synergistic effect of multiple active sites realizes tandem catalysis: NO3&#8722; reduction to NO2&#8722; predominantly occurs at Ag sites whereas NO2&#8722; tends to hydrogenate to NH3 at Co sites.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers a promising pathway for ammonia synthesis. The interfacial electronic interactions (IEIs) can regulate the physicochemical capabilities of catalysts in electrochemical applications, while the impact of IEIs on electrocatalytic NRA remains largely unexplored in current literature. In this study, the high&#8208;efficiency electrode Ag&#8208;modified Co3O4 (Ag1.5Co/CC) is prepared for NRA in neutral media, exhibiting an impressive nitrate conversion rate of 96.86&#8201;%, ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 96.11&#8201;%, and ammonia selectivity of ~100&#8201;%. Notably, the intrinsic activity of Ag1.5Co/CC is ~81&#8197;times that of Ag nanoparticles (Ag/CC). Multiple characterizations and theoretical computations confirm the presence of IEIs between Ag and Co3O4, which stabilize the CoO6 octahedrons within Co3O4 and significantly promote the adsorption of reactants (NO3&#8722;) as well as intermediates (NO2&#8722; and NO), while suppressing the Heyrovsky step, thereby improving nitrate electroreduction efficiency. Furthermore, our findings reveal a synergistic effect between different active sites that enables tandem catalysis for NRA: NO3&#8722; reduction to NO2&#8722; predominantly occurs at Ag sites while NO2&#8722; tends to hydrogenate to ammonia at Co sites. This study offers valuable insights for the development of high&#8208;performance NRA electrocatalysts.

         <title>Steering the Site Distance of Atomic Cu&#8722;Cu Pairs by First&#8208;Shell Halogen Coordination Boosts CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic Cu&#8722;Cu pairs with a controllable site distance by first&#8208;shell halogen coordination was reported in this work, which shows an enhanced CO2RR performance of C2 products. In addition, a linear scaling relationship that that long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;I&#8722;Cu) dual sites is accelerated to C2H4 generation, while short&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;Cl&#8722;Cu) dual sites is beneficial for C2H5OH formation was revealed to give a wide comprehension towards site&#8208;distance&#8208;dependent catalytic performance.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2 products of high economic value provides a promising strategy to realize resourceful CO2 utilization. Rational design and construct dual sites to realize the CO protonation and C&#8722;C coupling to unravel their structure&#8208;performance correlation is of great significance in catalysing electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions. Herein, Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites with different site distance coordinated by halogen at the first&#8208;shell are constructed and shows a higher intramolecular electron redispersion and coordination symmetry configurations. The long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;I&#8722;Cu) dual sites show an enhanced Faraday efficiency of C2 products, up to 74.1&#8201;%, and excellent stability. In addition, the linear relationships that the long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites are accelerated to C2H4 generation and short&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu (Cu&#8722;Cl&#8722;Cu) dual sites are beneficial for C2H5OH formation are disclosed. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and theoretical calculations manifest that long&#8208;range Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites can weaken reaction energy barriers of CO hydrogenation and C&#8722;C coupling, as well as accelerating deoxygenation of *CH2CHO. This study uncovers the exploitation of site&#8208;distance&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties to steer the CO2 reduction pathway, as well as a potential generic tactic to target C2 synthesis by constructing the desired Cu&#8722;Cu dual sites.

         <title>Stereodivergency in Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Difunctionalizations: The Impact of Boron Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent borylative difunctionalization strategy is reported. The key component in obtaining stereodivergence lies in the Lewis acidity of the introduced boron group. The more Lewis acidic Bpin group enables chelation control affording an all cis diastereomer. Conversely, the less acidic Bdan group overrides this preference by disfavouring adduct formation, leading to a bifurcation in the stereochemical outcome.







Abstract
A reagent&#8208;controlled diastereodivergent copper&#8208;catalyzed borylative difunctionalization is reported. The formation of Lewis adducts that guide selectivity is commonly invoked in organic reaction mechanisms. Using density functional theory calculations, we identified BpinBdan as a sterically similar and less Lewis acidic alternative to B2pin2. Using a newly developed borylative aldol domino reaction as the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate a change in stereochemical outcome by a simple change of borylating reagent&#8212;B2pin2 affords the diastereomer associated with coordination control while BpinBdan overturns this mode of binding. We show that this strategy can be generalized to other scaffolds and, more importantly, that BpinBdan does not alter the diastereomeric outcome of the reaction when coordination is not involved. BpinBdan can be viewed as a mechanistic probe for coordination in future copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation reactions.

         <title>Subsets of Nanometer Vesicles in the Fly Release Differential Fractions of Vesicular Serotonin Content during Exocytosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serotonin from neurons inside the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila melanogaster was measured using nanoelectrochemical approaches. Differential release fractions were observed upon drug treatment. This is the first example of consistent full release found in any system, suggesting the possibility for one pool of vesicles to release significantly diverse fractions of transmitter load during exocytosis.







Abstract
Serotonin, a monoamine neurotransmitter, is important in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system. Malfunction of serotonin signaling leads to various disorders. We studied serotonin signaling from serotonergic neurons inside the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila melanogaster. Serotonergic neurons and stimulated release were visualized and achieved with mCherry and channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (an optogenetically transfected ion channel), respectively, and two electrochemical techniques quantified serotonin release and vesicular content. Mean vesicular serotonin content released during exocytosis from these neurons was 84&#8201;%, considerably higher than reported in previous studies regarding octopamine (4.5&#8201;%) and glutamate release (31&#8201;%). Serotonin content within all vesicles is uniformly changed when serotonin concentration is inhibited or enhanced. However, serotonin release exhibits two Gaussian distributions: higher frequency of small release events, and similar or slightly higher frequency of large events, resulting in differential release fractions ranging from partial (13&#8211;18&#8201;%) to full (100&#8201;%) release after treatment with agents to either enhance or diminish release. This is the first example of consistent full exocytotic release events we have observed in any system. We suggest one pool of vesicles can release significantly diverse fractions of transmitter load during exocytosis, a potentially novel pathway to regulate exocytosis and neuronal signaling.

&lt;p&gt;Serotonin from neurons inside the ventral nerve cord of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; was measured using nanoelectrochemical approaches. Differential release fractions were observed upon drug treatment. This is the first example of consistent full release found in any system, suggesting the possibility for one pool of vesicles to release significantly diverse fractions of transmitter load during exocytosis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin, a monoamine neurotransmitter, is important in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system. Malfunction of serotonin signaling leads to various disorders. We studied serotonin signaling from serotonergic neurons inside the ventral nerve cord of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Serotonergic neurons and stimulated release were visualized and achieved with mCherry and channelrhodopsin-2 (an optogenetically transfected ion channel), respectively, and two electrochemical techniques quantified serotonin release and vesicular content. Mean vesicular serotonin content released during exocytosis from these neurons was 84&#8201;%, considerably higher than reported in previous studies regarding octopamine (4.5&#8201;%) and glutamate release (31&#8201;%). Serotonin content within all vesicles is uniformly changed when serotonin concentration is inhibited or enhanced.

         <title>Reconstruction of Ferromagnetic/Paramagnetic Cobalt&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts under Gradient Magnetic Fields for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of local gradient magnetic field&#8208;assisted in situ reconstruction is developed to directionally modulate the reconstruction of CoBDC in ferromagnetic/paramagnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8211;shell precatalyst. The Kelvin force induced by gradient magnetic field can increase the proportion of divalent Co in the derived CoOxHy, thereby enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity compared to the reconstructed sample without gradient magnetic field assistance.







Abstract
The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/paramagnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8211;shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores&#8217; local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells&#8217; surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co2+ as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128&#8201;% at 1.63&#8197;V and an overpotential reduction by 28&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100&#8197;h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuning Localized Excitons Toward Enhanced Emission, Photocurrent Enhancement and Piezochromism in Unconventional ACI&#8208;Type 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant fluorescence improvement and considerable piezochromism are firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Pressure&#8208;induced photocurrent enhancement is also observed, because of the promoted electron orbitals coupling resulting from the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
Simultaneous enhancement of free excitons (FEs) emission and self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emission remains greatly challenging because of the radiative pathway competition. Here, a significant fluorescence improvement, associated with the radiative recombination of both FEs and STEs is firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4 (ACA=acetamidinium) crystals with {PbI6} octahedron units, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Note that (ACA)(MA)PbI4 exhibits a 91.5&#8208;fold emission enhancement and considerable piezochromism from green to red in a mild pressure interval of 1&#8197;atm to 2.5&#8197;GPa. The substantial distortion of both individual halide octahedron and the Pb&#8722;I&#8722;Pb angles between two halide octahedra under high pressure indeed determines the pressure&#8208;tuning localized excitons behavior. Upon higher pressure, photocurrent enhancement is also observed, which is attributed to the promoted electronic connectivity in (ACA)(MA)PbI4. The anisotropic compaction reduces the distance between neighboring organic molecules and {PbI6} octahedra, leading to the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions. This work not only offers a deep understanding of the structure&#8208;optical relationships of ACI&#8208;type perovskites, but also presents insights into breaking the limits of luminescent efficiency by pressure&#8208;suppressed nonradiative recombination.

         <title>Thermotropic &#8220;Plumber's Nightmare&#8221;&#8212;A Tight Liquid Organic Double Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A most common cubic phase in lyotropic (surfactant&#8208;water) systems, the &#8220;plumber's nightmare&#8221; labyrinth, has never been found in thermotropic liquid crystals. Here the first example is reported. Intriguingly, removal of just a methyl branch from the fluorescent mesogen's six alkyls converts the double&#8208;network cubic into an array of counter&#8208;twisting helices.







Abstract
Gyroid, double diamond and the body&#8208;centred &#8220;Plumber's nightmare&#8221; are the three most common bicontinuous cubic phases in lyotropic liquid crystals and block copolymers. While the first two are also present in solvent&#8208;free thermotropics, the latter had never been found. Containing six&#8208;fold junctions, it was unlikely to form in the more common phases with rod&#8208;like cores normal to the network columns, where a maximum of four branches can join at a junction. The solution has therefore been sought in side&#8208;branched mesogens that lie in axial bundles joined at their ends by flexible &#8220;hinges&#8221;. But for the tightly packed double framework, geometric models predicted that the side&#8208;chains should be very short. The true Plumber's nightmare reported here, using fluorescent dithienofluorenone rod&#8208;like mesogen, has been achieved with, indeed, no side chains at all, but with 6 flexible end&#8208;chains. Such molecules normally form columnar phases, but the key to converting a complex helical column&#8211;forming mesogen into a framework&#8208;forming one was the addition of just one methyl group to each pendant chain. A geometry&#8208;based explanation is given.

         <title>Chirality and Curvature on Protein Adsorption and Osteogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid enantiomers (L/D&#8208;UG) are designed to self&#8208;assemble into vesicles and 2D nanocrystals with different chirality and curvature, which showed differentiated protein adsorption and subsequent osteogenesis. L&#8208;2D nanocrystal exhibits as one of the most effective materials to promote bone regeneration.







Abstract
Here we designed enantiomeric lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid derivatives (L/D&#8208;UG) and investigated their self&#8208;assembled chiral nanostructures&#8217; interaction with the protein adsorption as well as the osteogenesis. It was found that L or D&#8208;UG molecules can self&#8208;assemble into vesicle bilayers and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanocrystals via a kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. These chiral vesicles and 2D crystals showed differentiated adsorption of proteins, determined by their curvature and chirality. Specifically, fibronectin constituted by L&#8208;amino acids adsorbed preferentially on L&#8208;UG 2D crystal in a semi&#8208;random pattern and L&#8208;2D nanocrystal show as the most effective structures to promote bone regeneration. The controlled vesicle and 2D crystal assemblies with different chirality and curvature helps to clarify their determine roles in protein adsorption and osteogenesis.

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption by Unconventional p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization over Porous High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Metallene for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous high&#8208;entropy alloy PdCuAgBiIn metallene was synthesized and demonstrated high performance for electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime (C6H11NO). Experimental and theoretical studies validated that unconventional p&#8208;d orbital hybridization could tune the local electronic structure of active sites to manipulate active hydrogen supply, which facilitates the generation and enrichment of key intermediates and promotes the formation of C6H11NO.







Abstract
Renewable electricity driven electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime (C6H11NO) from cyclohexanone (C6H10O) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) is a promising alternative to traditional environment&#8208;unfriendly industrial technologies for green synthesis of C6H11NO. Precisely controlling the reaction pathway of the C6H10O/NOx&#8208;involved electrochemical reductive coupling reaction is crucial for selectively producing C6H11NO, which is yet still challenging. Herein, we report a porous high&#8208;entropy alloy PdCuAgBiIn metallene (HEA&#8208;PdCuAgBiInene) to boost the electrosynthesis of C6H11NO from C6H10O and nitrite, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (47.6&#8201;%) and almost 100&#8201;% yield under ambient conditions. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that unconventional orbital hybridization between d&#8208;block metals and p&#8208;block metals could regulate the local electronic structure of active sites and induce electron localization of electron&#8208;rich Pd sites, which tunes the active hydrogen supply, facilitates the generation and enrichment of key intermediates NH2OH* and C6H10O*, and efficiently promotes their C&#8722;N coupling to selectively produce C6H11NO.

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Interfacial Polymerization for Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and efficient electrochemical interfacial polymerization strategy was utilized to rapidly prepare electrochromic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) films at room temperature, which exhibited stable polymorphic electrochromic properties. Additionally, the electrochromic behavior of COFs films at negative potentials can be regulated by uranium, demonstrating the unique color tunability of COFs.







Abstract
A rapid in situ synthesis of electrochromic covalent organic frameworks (EC&#8208;COFs) was proposed by using green electrochemical interface polymerization of N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediamine (TPDA) and 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalaldehyde (DHBD). The synthetized TPDA&#8208;DHBD films exhibit stable polymorphic color variations under different applied potentials, which can be attributed to the redox state changes of bis(triphenylamine) and imine electroactive functional groups within the COFs skeleton. TPDA&#8208;DHBD represents markedly different electrochromisms from red to cyan due to the steric hindrance effect caused by the presence of UO22+, demonstrating the unique tunability of COFs materials. This work offers a new feasible idea for rapid EC&#8208;COFs synthesis and tunable EC&#8208;COFs realization.

         <title>Mechanochemically Promoted Functionalization of Postconsumer Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) and Poly(&#945;&#8208;Methylstyrene) for Bulk Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a methodology of post&#8208;polymerization functionalization to enable bulk depolymerization by chemically recycling to monomer utilizing mechanochemical macro&#8208;radical generation. When sonicated in the presence of a depolymerizable trigger, postconsumer PMMA and PAMS can achieve up to 82&#8201;% depolymerization. High&#8208;purity monomer is collected and used in new materials. This method of functionalization is particularly effective with Mn&gt;1&#8197;million kg/mol polymers, offering a sustainable solution for plastic waste management.







Abstract
We describe a methodology of post&#8208;polymerization functionalization to enable subsequent bulk depolymerization to monomer by utilizing mechanochemical macro&#8208;radical generation. By harnessing ultrasonic chain&#8208;scission in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide methacrylate (PhthMA), we successfully chain&#8208;end functionalize polymers to promote subsequent depolymerization in bulk, achieving up to 82 % depolymerization of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(&#945;&#8208;methylstyrene) (PAMS) within 30&#8197;min. This method of depolymerization yields a high&#8208;purity monomer that can be repolymerized. Moreover, as compared to the most common methods of depolymerization, this work is most efficient with ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) polymers, establishing a method with the potential to address highly persistent, non&#8208;degradable all&#8208;carbon backbone plastic materials. Lastly, we demonstrate the expansion of this depolymerization method to commercial cell cast PMMA, achieving high degrees of depolymerization from post&#8208;consumer waste. This work is the first demonstration of applying PhthMA&#8208;promoted depolymerization strategies in homopolymer PMMA and PAMS prepared by conventional polymerization methods.

         <title>Controlling Protein Assembly with Superchaotropic Nano&#8208;Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In living systems, protein assemblies serve essential functions. Controlling their construction in biotechnology is challenging. We show that anionic boron clusters act as reversible molecular glue for proteins, forming 2D assemblies and preventing temperature denaturation of myoglobin. Nano&#8208;ion concentration controls assembly size with minimal impact on structures, introducing boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions as tools for protein assembly and stabilization.







Abstract
In living systems, protein assemblies have essential functions, serving as structural supports, transport highways for molecular cargo, and containers of genetic material. The construction of protein assemblies, which involves control over space and time, remains a significant challenge in biotechnology. Here, we show that anionic boron clusters, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;commo&#8208;bis[closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;3&#8208;cobaltadodecaborane] (COSAN&#8722;), and halogenated closo&#8208;dodecarboranes (B12X122&#8722;, X=H, Cl, or I), described as super&#8208;chaotropic nano&#8208;ions, induce the formation of 2D assemblies of model proteins, myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and trypsin inhibitor. We found that the nano&#8208;ion concentration reversibly controls the size of the protein assemblies. Furthermore, the secondary structures of the proteins are only slightly affected by assembly formation. For myoglobin, the formation of these assemblies even prevents temperature denaturation, highlighting a preservation effect of nano&#8208;ions. Our study reveals that inorganic boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions act as a reversible molecular glue for proteins, providing a potential starting point for the further development of controlled protein assemblies.

         <title>Development of Organ Targeting Lipid Nanoparticles with Low Immunogenicity and Their Application in the Treatment of Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organ targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with low immunogenicity were developed as novel gene delivery platforms by incorporating Dex (dLNPs) to alleviate side effects induced by traditional LNPs. Lung&#8208;targeting dLNPs delivered siRUNX1 for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis with superior therapeutic performance owing to the synergy of gene and drug therapy. They provide a blueprint for the design of RNA therapeutics with higher efficacy and safety.







Abstract
As the most advanced non&#8208;viral delivery system, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were approved by the FDA, propelling the advancements of gene therapy. However, their clinical applications are hampered by the potential immunogenicity of the lipid components that trigger immune&#8208;related adverse events, like inflammation and allergy. Herein, we formulate various dLNPs with diminished immunogenicity by incorporating dexamethasone (Dex) into liver&#8208;, spleen&#8208;, and lung&#8208;targeting LNPs formulations that exhibit excellent abilities to target specific organs and deliver various types of RNA, such as mRNA and siRNA. In vivo investigations demonstrate unparalleled advantages in safety as compared to conventional LNPs, showing promising potential in the development of RNA therapeutics. Intriguingly, the encapsulation of runt&#8208;related transcription factor&#8208;1 siRNA (siRUNX1) into lung&#8208;targeting dLNPs (dLNPs@siRUNX1) demonstrates remarkable advantages in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis through the synergy of gene therapy and drug therapy. This research establishes secure and universal platforms for the precise delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics, showcasing promising clinical applications in gene therapy.

         <title>Deoxygenative Geminal Silylboration of Amides Using Silylboronates: Synthesis and Use of &#945;&#8208;Boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Silylalkylamines</title>

The deoxygenative geminal silylboration of amides using silylboronates in the presence of alkoxide base catalyst, producing &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines, is reported herein. Both silicon and boron groups from &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines were found useful in the context of further chemoselective transformations, such as protonation and alkylation. This protocol allows to reach various &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;,and &#945;&#8208;borylalkylamines from readily available amides.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Silylalkylamines and &#945;&#8208;borylalkylamines are versatile synthetic intermediates and attractive scaffolds found in pharmaceutical drugs and agrochemicals. Despite great progress on synthetic methods for preparation of &#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines or &#945;&#8208;borylalkylamines, there are no general strategies for preparation of &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines and the reactivity has not been explored. Here we report deoxygenative geminal silylboration of amides using silylboronates in the presence of alkoxide base catalyst, producing &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines.
