      <title>Carbodicarbene Bismaalkene Cations: Unravelling the Complexities of Carbene versus Carbone in Heavy Pnictogen Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>While pnictaalkenes are well&#8208;established for the light group 15 elements, they become more reactive and exceptionally rare as the group is descended. Herein, we report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the first examples of carbodicarbene (CDC)&#8208;stabilized bismuth complexes, which feature low&#8208;coordinate cationic bismuth centers with C=Bi multiple bond character. Monocations [(CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl][SbF6] (8) and&#160;&#160;[(CDC)BiBr2(THF)2][SbF6] (11), dications [(CDC)Bi(Ph)][SbF6]2&#160;(9) and [(CDC)BiBr(THF)3][NTf2]2&#160;(12), and trication [(CDC)2Bi][NTf2]3&#160;(13) have been synthesized via sequential halide abstractions from (CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl2&#160;(7) and (CDC)BiBr3&#160;(10). Notably, the dications and trication exhibit C&#8649;Bi double dative bonds, and thus represent unprecedented bismaalkene cations. In addition,&#160;the synthesis of these species highlights a unique non&#8208;reductive route to C&#8211;Bi &#960;&#8208;bonding character.&#160;The CDC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (7&#8208;13) were compared with related NHC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (1,&#160;3&#8208;6) and show substantially different structural properties. Indeed, the CDC ligand has a remarkable influence on the overall stability of the resulting low&#8208;coordinate Bi complexes, suggesting that CDC is a superior ligand to NHC in heavy pnictogen chemistry.&#160;All compounds have been characterized by multiple analytical methods including&#160;1H and&#160;13C NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography, elemental analysis, and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. In addition, the bonding situation was analyzed with modern charge and energy decomposition analysis.</dc:description>

      <title>A Cisplatin&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Mitochondrial Platinum Accumulation in Living Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Mitochondria have emerged as important target for cisplatin in cancer therapy. Apart from cisplatin, many Pt complexes based on various scaffolds have also been developed to target mitochondria. Yet how cisplatin or these mitochondria&#8208;targeting Pt analogues are being processed at the cellular level remained unexplored, largely due to a lack of tools capable of probing these Pt drugs intracellularly. Herein, we developed the first mitochondria&#8208;targeting fluorescent probe for real&#8208;time monitoring of cisplatin accumulation in mitochondria and applied it to investigate the mitochondria as cellular targets for cisplatin and its Pt  IV  prodrug derivatives in biological systems. We uncovered two distinct pathways whereby Pt complexes could be delivered to mitochondria after cell entry.</dc:description>

      <title>Cell&#8208;selective siRNA delivery using glycosylated dynamic covalent polymers self&#8208;assembled in situ by RNA&#8208;templating</title>
      <dc:description>Dynamic covalent libraries enable exploring complex chemical systems from which bioactive assemblies can adaptively emerge through template effects. In this work, we studied dynamic covalent libraries made of complementary bifunctional cationic peptides, yielding a diversity of species from macrocycles to polymers. Although polymers are typically expressed only at high concentration, we found that siRNA act as a template in the formation of dynamic covalent polymers at low concentration in a process guided by electrostatic binding. Using a glycosylated building block, we were able to show that this templated polymerization further translates into the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands, which subsequently promotes cell uptake, and even cell&#8208;selective siRNA delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Casbane Diterpenes: One Strategy, Multiple Targets</title>
      <dc:description>Of the more than 100 casbane diterpenes known to date, only the eponymous parent hydrocarbon casbene itself has ever been targeted by chemical synthesis. Outlined herein is a conceptually new approach that brings not a single but a variety of casbane derivatives into reach, especially the more highly oxygenated and arguably more relevant members of this family. The key design elements are a catalyst controlled intramolecular cyclopropanation with or without subsequent equilibration, chain extension of the resulting stereoisomeric cyclopropane building blocks via chemoselective hydroboration/cross coupling, and the efficient closure of the strained macrobicyclic framework by ring closing alkyne metathesis. Of arguably highest relevance is the fact that a hydroxy&#8208;directed catalytic  trans  &#8208;hydrostannation allows for late&#8208;stage diversity. These virtues are manifested in concise total syntheses of depressin, yuexiandajisu A, and  ent  &#8208;pekinenin C; the latter turned out to be identical with euphorhylonal A, which had obviously been misassigned in the literature.</dc:description>

      <title>The Logic Behind Markovnikov's Rule: Was It an Inspired Guess? &#8230;No!</title>
      <dc:description>
Based on Markovnikov's 1870 Annalen paper, many western authors have viewed his rule as a relatively unimportant addendum to a paper on isobutyric acid derivatives, and some have suggested that the rule itself was simply an inspired guess. In this Essay, based on an analysis of his work on the structure of the double bond in his graduate dissertations, the argument is made that it was not.







Abstract
Vladimir Vasil&#8242;evich Markovnikov (1837&#8211;1904) was a Russian chemist whose graduate research at Kazan Imperial University from 1860&#8211;1869 gave us, among other things, one of the most enduring empirical rules in organic chemistry. Markovnikov's Rule for electrophilic addition was first published in the inaugural volume of the Journal of the Russian Chemical Society (Zh. Russ. Khim. O&#8208;va.), but it was not until a year later when it was published in German that it received attention internationally. The rule itself was worded differently from the most common modern versions, in that it is expressed in terms of the electronegative part of the adding reagent. It has been suggested that this rule was the result of an inspired guess, but a careful examination of Markovnikov's graduate dissertations reveals a very different picture. In the dissertations, there is a careful build&#8208;up of logic from which the rule itself, as defined by Markovnikov, emerges naturally. Markovnikov's Rule was most decidedly not an inspired guess.

      <title>Paired copper monomers in zeolite omega: the active site for methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion</title>
      <dc:description>The direct conversion of methane to methanol using oxygen is a challenging but potentially rewarding pathway towards utilizing methane. By using a stepwise chemical looping approach, copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites can convert methane to methanol, but productivity is still too low for viable implementation. However, if the nature of the active site could be elucidated, that information could be used to design more effective catalysts. By employing anomalous X&#8208;ray powder diffraction with support from theory and other X&#8208;ray techniques, we have derived a quantitative and spatial description of the highly selective, active copper sites in zeolite omega (Cu&#8208;omega). This is the first comprehensive description of the structure of non&#8208;copper&#8208;oxo active species and will provide a pivotal model for future development for materials for methane to methanol conversion.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Divalent lanthanide organometallics are well known highly reducing compounds usually used for single electron transfer reactivity and small molecule activation. As such, their very reactive nature prevented for many years the study of their physical properties, such as magnetic studies on a reliable basis. In this article, the access to rare organometallic sandwich compounds of Tm II with the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand impacts on the use of divalent organolanthanide compounds as an additional strategy for the design of performing Single Molecule Magnets (SMM).

      <dc:description>
Abstract
Compounds with the fresnoite structure type possess remarkable chemical diversity and a range of unique physical properties, including nonlinear optical (NLO) activity. K2Sb(P2O7)F, which was reported recently, belongs to this group and its structure is not novel in terms of either the topology or local coordination geometry around the Sb3+ cations. The crystallographic disorder observed in the fresnoite&#8208;type structures can be explained by twinning, which is frequent for non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystals.

      <title>Triazenyl Alkynes as Versatile Building Blocks in Multicomponent Reactions: Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Amides</title>
      <dc:description>Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are powerful tool for the construction of polyfunctional molecules in an operationally simple and atom&#8208;economic manner, and the discovery of novel MCRs requests various building blocks. Herein, triazenyl alkynes were disclosed as versatile building blocks in a multicomponent reaction with carboxylic acids, aldehydes and anilines to furnish &#946;&#8208;amino amides with the achievement of high diastereoselectivity and structural diversity. In this process, triazenyl alkynes were bifunctional that the alkyne moiety acts as C2 fragment and triazene serves as directing group to modulate the transition state thus achieving high diastereoselectivity, and this is consistent with DFT calculations. Furthermore, the triazenyl group also enables diverse late&#8208;stage transformation. This protocol opens a new vision for the discovery of building block and rational design of MCRs.</dc:description>

      <title>Site Sensitivity of Interfacial Charge Transfer and Photocatalytic Efficiency in Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding structural effects and reaction mechanisms of photocatalysts is of great interest and importance. Herein we report a comprehensive study of photocatalytic oxidation of methanol on various anatase TiO2 nanocrystals by means of combined in situ and time&#8208;resolved characterizations and density functional theory calculations. Surface site and resulting surface adsorbates were observed to strongly affect the surface band bending/bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface charge migration processes and the interfacial electronic structure/interfacial charge transfer processes. TiO2 nanocrystals predominantly enclosed by the {001} facets expose a high density of reactive fourfold&#8208;coordinated Ti sites (Ti4c) at which CH3OH molecules dissociate to form the CH3O adsorbate (CH3O(a)Ti4c). CH3O(a)Ti4c exhibits the localized density of states almost at the valence band maximum of TiO2 surface, which facilitates the interfacial hole transfer process; meanwhile, CH3O(a)Ti4c with a high coverage greatly promotes the upward surface band bending, which facilitates the bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface hole migration process. Consequently, among all the observed surface adsorbates, CH3O(a)Ti4c exhibits the highest photocatalytic oxidation rate constant. Consequently, TiO2 nanocrystals predominantly enclosed by the {001} facets are most active in photocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction. These results unambiguously exemplify the surface structure effect in photocatalysis and elucidate the underlying mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Sunlight&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) could have well&#8208;defined arrangements of photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;active units that serve as electron or hole transport channels for solar energy harvesting and conversion, but their insufficient charge transfer and rapid charge recombination impede the sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic performance. We report a new donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) system, PyTz&#8208;COF that was constructed from the electron&#8208;rich pyrene (Py) and electron&#8208;deficient thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (Tz). With its bicontinuous heterojunction, PyTz&#8208;COF demonstrated exceptional optoelectronic properties, photocatalytic ability in superoxide anion radical&#8208;mediated coupling of (arylmethyl)amines and photoelectrochemical activity in sunlight&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution. Remarkably, PyTz&#8208;COF exhibited a photocurrent up to 100 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0.2 V vs. RHE and could reach a hydrogen evolution rate of 2072.4 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. This work is paving the way for reticular design of highly efficient and highly active D&#8208;A systems for solar energy harvesting and conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>A General Organocatalytic System for Enantioselective Radical Conjugate Additions to Enals</title>

The process uses an organic photoredox catalyst, which absorbs blue light to generate radicals from stable precursors, in combination with a chiral amine catalyst, which secures a consistently high level of stereoselectivity.

      <dc:description>Biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is regarded as one of the most promising platform chemicals to produce 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran (DMF) as a potential liquid transportation fuel. Pd nanoparticles supported on N&#8208;containing and N&#8208;free mesoporous carbon materials were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenolysis of HMF to DMF under mild reaction conditions. Quantitative conversion of HMF to DMF was achieved in the presence of formic acid (FA) and H  2  over Pd/NMC within 2 h. The reaction mechanism, especially the multiple roles of FA, was explored through a detailed comparative study by varying hydrogen source, additive, and substrate as well as by applying  in situ  ATR&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The major role of FA is to shift the dominant reaction pathway from the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group to the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxymethyl group via the protonation by FA at the C&#8722;OH group, lowering the activation barrier of the C&#8722;O bond cleavage and thus significantly enhancing the reaction rate. XPS results and DFT calculations revealed that Pd  2+  species interacting with pyridine&#8208;like N atoms significantly enhance the selective hydrogenolysis of the C&#8722;OH bond in the presence of FA due to their high ability for the activation of FA and the stabilization of H  &#8208;  .</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The MinDE proteins from  E.coli  have received great attention as a paradigmatic biological pattern forming system. Recently, it has surfaced that these proteins do not only generate oscillating concentration gradients driven by ATP hydrolysis, but that they can reversibly deform giant vesicles. In order to explore the potential of Min proteins to actually perform mechanical work, we introduce a new model membrane system, flat vesicle stacks on top of a supported lipid bilayer.

      <title>Embedment of quantum dots and biomolecules in an in&#8208;situ formed dipeptide hydrogel using microfluidics</title>
      <dc:description>As low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators, dipeptide hydrogel materials are suited for embedding multiple organic molecules and inorganic nanoparticles. Herein, a simple but precisely controllable method is presented that enables the fabrication of dipeptide&#8208;based hydrogels via supramolecular assembly inside microfluidic channels. Water&#8208;soluble quantum dots (QDs) as well as premixed porphyrins and a dipeptide in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are injected into a Y&#8208;shaped microfluidic junction. At the DMSO/water interface the confined fabrication of a dipeptide&#8208;based hydrogel is initiated. Thereafter, the as&#8208;formed hydrogel flows along the meandered&#8208;shaped microfluidics channel in a continuous fashion, gradually completing gelation and QD entrapment. Compared to hydrogelation in conventional test tubes, microfluidically controlled hydrogelation leads to a tailored dipeptide hydrogel regarding material morphology and nanoparticle distribution.&#160; Changing compositions, concentrations, and flow rates leads to a diverse range of hydrogel nanostructures and properties. By stopping the hydrogel flow and removing the microchannel&#8208;bearing part of the microfluidic device, the dynamic assembly and gradual entrapment of QDs can be captured at individual positions inside the microfluidic device. By further analysis, we confirm that QDs are entrapped outside of nanofibers composed by dipeptides and porphyrins inside the hydrogels in a non&#8208;covalent fashion, and can achieve organic/inorganic energy transfer inside hydrogels. The unique combination of &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular peptide building blocks and &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; microfluidic control over hydrogel morphology and nanoparticle embedability provides the basis to implement tailored flow&#8208;through matrices for multiple molecules integrated in one coordinated system with stable and uniform entrapment of compounds of interest.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators, dipeptide hydrogel materials are suited for embedding multiple organic molecules and inorganic nanoparticles. Herein, a simple but precisely controllable method is presented that enables the fabrication of dipeptide&#8208;based hydrogels via supramolecular assembly inside microfluidic channels. Water&#8208;soluble quantum dots (QDs) as well as premixed porphyrins and a dipeptide in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are injected into a Y&#8208;shaped microfluidic junction. At the DMSO/water interface the confined fabrication of a dipeptide&#8208;based hydrogel is initiated. Thereafter, the as&#8208;formed hydrogel flows along the meandered&#8208;shaped microfluidics channel in a continuous fashion, gradually completing gelation and QD entrapment. Compared to hydrogelation in conventional test tubes, microfluidically controlled hydrogelation leads to a tailored dipeptide hydrogel regarding material morphology and nanoparticle distribution.&#160; Changing compositions, concentrations, and flow rates leads to a diverse range of hydrogel nanostructures and properties. By stopping the hydrogel flow and removing the microchannel&#8208;bearing part of the microfluidic device, the dynamic assembly and gradual entrapment of QDs can be captured at individual positions inside the microfluidic device. By further analysis, we confirm that QDs are entrapped outside of nanofibers composed by dipeptides and porphyrins inside the hydrogels in a non&#8208;covalent fashion, and can achieve organic/inorganic energy transfer inside hydrogels. The unique combination of &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular peptide building blocks and &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; microfluidic control over hydrogel morphology and nanoparticle embedability provides the basis to implement tailored flow&#8208;through matrices for multiple molecules integrated in one coordinated system with stable and uniform entrapment of compounds of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Leveraging free volume manipulation to improve membrane separation performance of amine&#8208;functionalized PIM&#8208;1</title>
      <dc:description>Gas&#8208;separation polymer membranes display a characteristic permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off that has limited their industrial use. The most comprehensive approach to improving performance is to devise strategies that simultaneously increase fractional free volume, narrow free volume distribution, and enhance sorption selectivity, but generalizable methods for such approaches are exceedingly rare. Here, we present an  in situ  crosslinking and solid&#8208;state deprotection method to access previously inaccessible sorption and diffusion characteristics in amine&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity. Free volume element (FVE) sizes can be increased while preserving a narrow FVE distribution, enabling below&#8208;upper bound polymers to surpass the H  2  /N  2  , H  2  /CH  4  , and O  2  /N  2  upper bounds and improving CO  2  &#8208;based selectivities by 200%. This approach can transform polymers into chemical analogues with improved performance, thereby overcoming traditional permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;offs.</dc:description>

      <title>1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazole Bridges: A Strategy to Improve Energetics at the Molecular Level</title>
      <dc:description>Many energetic materials synthesized to date have limited applications because of low thermal and/or mechanical stability. This limitation can be overcome by introducing structural modifications such as a bridging group. In this study, a series of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;bridged furazans was prepared. Their structures were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, infrared, elemental, and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. The thermal stability, friction sensitivity, impact sensitivity, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure were evaluated. The hydroxylammonium salt 8 has an excellent detonation performance (D = 9101 m s&#8208;1, P = 37.9 GPa) and insensitive properties (IS = 17.4 J, FS = 330 N), which show its great potential as a high&#8208;performance insensitive explosive. Using quantum computation and crystal structure analysis, the effect of the introduction of the 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole moiety on molecular reactivity and the difference between the sensitivities and thermal stabilities of mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole bridges are considered. The synthetic method for introducing 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole and the systematic study of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;bridged compounds provide a theoretical basis for future energetics design.</dc:description>

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalysed C&#8211;H Bond Zincation of Arenes: Scope, Mechanism and the Role of Heterometallic Intermediates</title>
      <dc:description>Catalytic methods that transform C&#8211;H into C&#8211;X bonds are of paramount importance in synthesis. A particular focus has been the generation of organoboranes, organosilanes and organostannanes from simple hydrocarbons (X = B, Si, Sn). Despite the importance of organozinc compounds (X = Zn), their synthesis by the catalytic functionalisation of C&#8211;H bonds remains unknown. Here we show that a palladium catalyst and zinc&#8211;hydride reagent can be used to transform C&#8211;H into C&#8211;Zn bonds. The new catalytic C&#8211;H zincation protocol has been applied to a variety of arenes &#8211; including fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene &#8211; with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. A mechanistic study shows that heterometallic Pd&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Zn complexes play a key role in catalysis. The conclusions of this work are twofold; the first is that valuable organozinc compounds are finally accessible by catalytic C&#8211;H functionalisation, the second is that heterometallic complexes are intimately involved in bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking steps of C&#8211;H functionalisation .</dc:description>

By carefully selecting the two metals and appropriate chiral ligands, we could synthesize both  syn&#8208;  and  anti&#8208;  &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol motifs with high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity from the same set of starting materials.

      <title>In Situ Observation of Non&#8208;Classical 2&#8208;Norbornyl Cation in Confined Zeolites under Ambient Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>Carbonium ions are an important class of reaction intermediates, but their dynamic evolution is difficult to be monitored by  in situ  techniques under experimental conditions because of their extremely short life. Probably the most famous case is 2&#8208;norbornyl cation (2NB  +  ): its existing form (classical or non&#8208;classical) had been debated for decades, until the concrete proof of non&#8208;classical geometry was obtained by X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization under ultra&#8208;low temperature (40 K) and super acidic environment. However, we are in lack of understanding to 2NB  +  under ambient conditions. Herein, by taking advantage of the confinement effect and delocalized acidic environment of zeolites, we successfully stabilized 2NB  +  and unequivocally confirmed its &#8220;non&#8208;classical&#8221; structure inside the ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite by  ab initio  molecular dynamics simulations and  13  C solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. It is the first time to  in situ  observe the non&#8208;classical 2NB  +  without the super acidic environment under ambient temperature, which provides a new strategy to expand the carbocation chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>The discrete breast cancer stem cell mammosphere activity of Group 10&#8208;bis(azadiphosphine) metal complexes</title>
      <dc:description>We report the anti&#8208;breast cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of a series of Group 10&#8208;bis(azadiphosphine) complexes  1  &#8208;  3  under exclusively three&#8208;dimensional cell culture conditions. The breast CSC mammosphere potency of  1  &#8208;  3  is dependent on the Group 10 metal present, increasing in the following order:  1  (nickel complex) &lt;  2  (palladium complex) &lt;  3  (platinum complex). Notably,  3  reduces the formation and size of mammospheres to a greater extent than salinomycin, an established CSC&#8208;active compound, or any reported anti&#8208;CSC metal complex tested under similar conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the most effective complexes  2  and  3  readily penetrate CSC mammospheres, enter CSC nuclei, induce genomic DNA damage, and trigger caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically probe the anti&#8208;CSC activity of a series of structurally related Group 10 complexes and to be conducted entirely using three&#8208;dimensional CSC culture conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective, Stereoconvergent Resolution Copolymerization of Racemic cis&#8208;Internal Epoxides and Anhydrides</title>
      <dc:description>Enantioselective copolymerization of unsymmetric disubstituted epoxides (e.g.  racemic  cis  &#8208;internal epoxides) is a very challenging issue, due to their poor reactivity, and complicated stereo&#8208;/regio&#8208;selectivity. Herein, we present an unprecedented enantioselective resolution copolymerization of  racemic  cis  &#8208;internal epoxides and anhydrides mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, affording optically active polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers, and the unreacted substrates in good enantioselectivity. An unexpected stereoconvergence is observed in this resolution copolymerization, where the selectivity factor (  s&#8208;  factor) for the enantioselective formation of copolymer significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient (  k  rel  ) based on the unreacted epoxide at various conversions. The catalytic activity and copolymer enantioselectivity are revealed to be strongly influenced by the phenolate  ortho  &#8208;substituents of the ligand set, as well as the axial linker and its chirality. The use of enantiopure binaphthol&#8208;linked bimetallic (  R,R,R,R,R  )&#8208;Al(III) complex without any substituent at the phenolate ortho&#8208;positions of the ligand allows not only a stereoconvergent access to the highly stereoregular semi&#8208;crystalline polyesters with an unprecedented levels of enantioselectivities of up to 99%  ee  (with a  s&#8208;  factor of 437), but also a concomitant kinetic resolution of the epoxide substrates (with a  k  rel  of 118). Mechanistic studies performed by combining experimental observations and density functional theory calculations suggest that both the enantiomorphic site of the ligand set and the propagating chain&#8208;end control mechanisms determined the enantioconvergent access to enantioenriched copolymers.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual Ratiometric SERS and Photoacoustic Core&#8208;Satellite Nanoprobe for Quantitatively Visualizing Hydrogen Peroxide in Inflammation and Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Excessive production of oxidative species alters the normal redox balance and leads to human diseases, such as chronic inflammation and cancer. Oxidative species are short&#8208;lived species, which makes the direct, precise and real&#8208;time measurements difficult.

Herein, we developed a novel core&#8208;satellite gold nanostructure nanoprobe with dual ratiometric surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging strategies, to quantitatively visualize and precisely treat the inflammation/cancer&#8208;related oxidative species. The H  2  O  2  activated second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) PA images of the nanoprobe can accelerate real&#8208;time image acquisition of the entire area of the disease, which can further precisely differentiate between the inflammation region and normal tissue. Additionally, the fingerprint spectrum of the SERS with high sensitivity enabled ratiometrically measuring the point signals of different parts of the disease, along with the guidance of the NIR&#8208;II PA imaging. It can not only quantitatively and precisely monitor the oxidative species (  e.g.  H  2  O  2  ) produced in inflammation, tumor, and osteoarthritis in rabbits in real&#8208;time, but also track the process of the anti&#8208;inflammatory treatment process.</dc:description>

      <title>Four Mechanistic Mysteries: The Benefits of Writing a Critical Review</title>
      <dc:description>
Clues from the recent literature have been used to unravel a series of mechanistic puzzles regarding the reactions of epoxides with titanium(III) reagents. Four examples are highlighted that will change the way in which titanium(III) chemistry is practiced.







Abstract
While writing a comprehensive review on the reactions of epoxides with titanium(III) reagents, we encountered a series of mechanistic puzzles. Using clues from the literature, many of which were not available at the time that the mysteries emerged, it was possible to demystify a number of these conundrums. We discuss four examples, which we believe will significantly change the way in which titanium(III) chemistry is practiced. Our experience underscores the importance of comprehensive and critical reviews in chemistry and the truism that the authors are prime beneficiaries of the review process.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Layers Hierarchically Integrate Three Synergistic Active Sites for Tandem Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A tri&#8208;functional metal&#8211;organic layer with [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ photosensitizers and Hf12 secondary building units capped with triflate groups as strong Lewis acid sites and PPA&#8208;Co groups as hydrogen&#8208;transfer catalysts synergistically catalyzed dehydrogenative tandem transformations of indolines with alkenes or aldehydes to afford 3&#8208;alkylindoles and bisindolylmethanes, respectively.







Abstract
We report the design of a bifunctional metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL), Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co, composed of [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ [DBB&#8208;Ru, DBB=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;benzoato)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine] connecting ligand as a photosensitizer and Co(dmgH)2(PPA)Cl (PPA&#8208;Co, dmgH=dimethylglyoxime; PPA=4&#8208;pyridinepropionic acid) on the Hf12 secondary building unit (SBU) as a hydrogen&#8208;transfer catalyst. Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co efficiently catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of indolines and tetrahydroquinolines to afford indoles and quinolones. We extended this strategy to prepare Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co&#8208;OTf MOL with a [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ photosensitizer and Hf12 SBU capped with triflate as strong Lewis acids and PPA&#8208;Co as a hydrogen transfer catalyst. With three synergistic active sites, Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co&#8208;OTf competently catalyzed dehydrogenative tandem transformations of indolines with alkenes or aldehydes to afford 3&#8208;alkylindoles and bisindolylmethanes with turnover numbers of up to 500 and 460, respectively, illustrating the potential use of MOLs in constructing novel multifunctional heterogeneous catalysts.

      <title>Towards the circular economy: converting aromatic plastic waste back to arenes over Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The upgrading of plastic waste is one of the grand challenges for the 21  st  century owing to its disruptive impact on environment. Here, we show the first example of the catalytic conversion of various aromatic plastic wastes with C&#8211;O and/or C&#8211;C linkages to arenes (75&#8208;85% yield)&#160; via catalytic hydrogenolysis over Ru/Nb  2  O  5&#160;  catalyst. This catalyst not only allows the selective conversion of single&#8208;component aromatic plastic, and more importantly, enables the simultaneous conversion of a mixture of aromatic plastic to arenes. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique features including: (1) the small sized Ru clusters on Nb  2  O  5&#160;  , which prevent the adsorption of aromatic ring and its hydrogenation; (2) the strong oxygen affinity of NbO  x  species for C&#8211;O bond activation and Br&#248;nsted acid sites for C&#8211;C bond activation. This study offers a catalytic path to integrate aromatic plastic waste back into the supply chain of plastic production under the context of circular economy.</dc:description>

      <title>Unimolecular Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysts for Selective Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides</title>
      <dc:description>Anion&#8208;binding can regulate anion transport in chloride channels via dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions, which gives insights into the designing of new organocatalytic transformations, but is surprisingly unexplored in polymerization catalysis. Herein, we describe an effective unimolecular anion&#8208;binding organocatalysis where 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine is anchored to a thiourea for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of  O  &#8208;carboxyanhydrides (OCAs), which well addresses the formidable challenge of synthesizing high molecular weight (MW) stereoregular polyesters. Ring&#8208;opening polymerization of PheOCA (OCA from phenylalanine) mediated by unimolecular anion&#8208;binding organocatalyst generates highly isotactic poly(phenyllactic acid) (Ph&#8208;PLA) with MW up to 150.0 kDa. Specifically, high MW Ph&#8208;PLA exhibits 30&#8208;fold increase in the elongation at break in comparison to its low MW congener. Moreover, active species of the polymerization are moisture&#8208;tolerant and can be conducted in unpurified solvent, facilitating facile synthesis of high MW stereoregular polyesters with pendant functional groups.  Calculations and experiment studies indicate a dynamic cooperative anion&#8208;binding mechanism where the dynamic anion&#8208;binding interaction of thiourea moiety to propagating species facilitates efficient chain propagation and the synergetic decarboxylation retains high selectivity for OCA ring&#8208;opening over side reactions (e.g., cyclization, epimerization and transesterification).</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Reporting of Folding and Aggregation by Orthogonal Hantzsch Luminophores within a Single Polymer Chain</title>
      <dc:description>Self&#8208;reporting, fluorescence methods for monitoring&#160; folding and aggregation of proteins have a long history in biochemistry. Placing orthogonal luminophores within individual synthetic polymer chains for self&#8208;reporting both folding (i.e., its intra&#8208;molecular compaction to isolated single&#8208;chain nanoparticles, SCNPs) and unbidden aggregation (i.e., the inter&#8208;molecular association of SCNPs) remains as a great challenge. Herein, a simple and efficient platform to identify both single&#8208;chain compaction and inter&#8208;molecular aggregation phenomena via photoluminescence is presented based on simultaneous synthesis through Hantzsch ester formation of orthogonal luminophores within the same polymer chain. Hence, starting from non&#8208;luminescent beta&#8208;ketoester&#8208;decorated chains, intra&#8208;molecular compaction is visually detected through fluorescence arising from Hantzsch fluorophores generated as intra&#8208;chain connectors during folding. Complementary, inter&#8208;molecular association is identified via aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) from orthogonal luminophores displaying intense photoluminescence at redshifted wavelengths after formation of multi&#8208;SCNPs assemblies. This strategy holds promise to perceive with the naked eye the aggregation state / compaction degree of SCNPs during functional applications.</dc:description>

      <title>The Transient Covalent Bond in Abiotic Nonequilibrium Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Biochemical systems accomplish many critical functions with systems that operate out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium using the energy of chemical fuels. The formation of a transient covalent bond is a simple but very effective tool in designing analogous reaction networks. This Minireview focuses on the fuel chemistries that have been used to generate transient bonds in recent demonstrations of abiotic nonequilibrium systems (i.e., systems that do not make use of biological components). Fuel reactions are divided into two fundamental classifications depending on whether the fuel contributes structural elements to the activated state, a distinction that dictates how they can be used. Reported systems are further categorized by overall fuel reaction (e.g., hydrolysis of alkylating agents, carbodiimide hydration) and illustrate how similar chemistry can be used to effect a wide range of nonequilibrium behavior, ranging from self&#8208;assembly to the operation of molecular machines.</dc:description>

      <title>Adaptive Chirality of an Achiral Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Organic Framework for Chirality Induction in Water</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral framework materials have been developed for many applications including chiral recognition, chiral separation, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptical materials. Herein, we report that an achiral cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;based supramolecular organic framework (  SOF&#8208;1  ) with the dynamic rotational conformation of tetraphenylethene units can exhibit adaptive chirality to produce  M  &#8208;  SOF&#8208;1  or  P  &#8208;  SOF&#8208;1  with mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism (CD) with g  abs  &#8776; &#177;10  &#8722;4  and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with g  lum  &#8776; &#177;10  &#8722;4  induced by  L&#8208;/D&#8208;  phenylalanine in water, respectively. The chirality induction in CD (g  abs  &#8776; &#8722;10  &#8208;4  ) and CPL (g  lum  &#8776; &#8722;10  &#8722;4  ) of  P  &#8208;  SOF&#8208;1  from achiral  SOF&#8208;1  can be presented using a small amount of adenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate disodium (ATP) or adenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;diphosphate disodium (ADP) (only 0.4 equiv) in water. Furthermore, the adaptive chirality of  SOF&#8208;1  can be used to determine dipeptide sequences (e.g., Phe&#8208;Ala and Ala&#8208;Phe) and distinguish polypeptides/proteins (e.g., somatostatin and human insulin) with characteristic CD spectra. Therefore, achiral  SOF&#8208;1  as an ideal chiroptical platform with adaptive chirality may be applied to determine the enantiopurity of amino acids (e.g.,  L&#8208;/D&#8208;  phenylalanine), develop aqueous CPL materials, and distinguish biological chiral macromolecules (e.g., peptides/proteins) via chirality induction in water.</dc:description>

      <title>Anionic Polymerization in Porous Organic Frameworks: a Strategy to Fabricate Anchored Polymers and Copolymers</title>
      <dc:description>Polymerizations in confining systems provide a strategy to form materials with hierarchical constructions of linear polymers and 3D architectures. However, in this field, anionic polymerization is almost unexplored: we have filled the gap by implementing an anionic mechanism to create polymers and copolymers as confined to, or anchored to, high surface area porous nanoparticles. Far diverse linear polymers with soft and glassy chains, such as polyisoprene and polymethylmethacrylate, were produced by confined anionic polymerization in 3D networks of porous aromatic frameworks. Alternatively, multiple anions were generated on the designed frameworks which bear removal protons at selected positions, and initiate chain propagation, resulting in chains covalently connected to the 3D network. Such growth can continue outside the pores to produce polymer&#8208;matrix nanoparticles coated with anchored chains.&#160; Sequential reactions were promoted by the  living  character of this anionic propagation  ,  yielding nanoparticles that were covered by a second polymer anchored by anionic block&#8208;copolymerization. The intimacy of the matrix and the grown&#8208;in polymers was demonstrated unconventionally by magnetization transfer across the interfaces in 2D  1  H&#8208;  13  C&#8208;HETCOR NMR spectra.

      <title>Polaron Delocalization in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Polymers and its Impact on Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymers are promising materials for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as they minimize detrimental faradaic side&#8208;reactions during OECT operation, yet their steady&#8208;state OECT performance still lags far behind their all&#8208;donor counterparts. Here, we report three D&#8208;A polymers based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit that afford OECT performances similar to those of all&#8208;donor polymers, hence representing a significant improvement to the previously developed D&#8208;A copolymers. In addition to improved OECT performance, DFT simulations of the polymers and their respective hole polarons also revealed a positive correlation between hole polaron delocalization and steady&#8208;state OECT performance, providing new insights into the design of OECT materials. More importantly, we demonstrate how polaron delocalization can be tuned directly at the molecular level by selection of the building blocks comprising the polymers&#8217; conjugated backbone, thus paving the way for the development of even higher performing OECT polymers.</dc:description>

      <title>Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidative Ring Expansion of Cyclic Ketones to Macrolactones via Cerium and Cyanoanthracene Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>We describe a cerium catalyzed aerobic oxidative ring expansion for the expedient construction of synthetically challenging macrolactones under visible&#8208;light conditions. Cyanoanthracene has been employed as co&#8208;catalyst to accelerate the turnover of cerium cycle leading to a fast conversion within 20 min of irradiation. Taking advantage of the high efficiency and operationally&#8208;simple conditions, a collection of over 100 macrolactones equipped with ring systems ranging from 9&#8208; to 19&#8208;membered macrocycles have been prepared from simple building blocks. Moreover, the enabling potential of this strategy to simplify the generation of molecular complexity has been demonstrated through the concise synthesis of sonnerlactone.</dc:description>

Taking advantage of the high efficiency and operationally&#8208;simple conditions, a collection of over 100 macrolactones equipped with ring systems ranging from 9&#8208; to 19&#8208;membered macrocycles have been prepared from simple building blocks. Moreover, the enabling potential of this strategy to simplify the generation of molecular complexity has been demonstrated through the concise synthesis of sonnerlactone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ultrasound controlled anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization of platelet decorated microglia for targeted ischemic stroke therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Stroke is a neurological disease with poor prognosis. Strong inflammatory and immune response exist after stroke, resulting in severe sequelae with high mortality. Microglia, the main immune cell in cerebrum, possess therapeutic potential for stroke as its specific anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype can reduce inflammation and promote neuron regeneration. However, the on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization of microglia at stroke site is uncontrollable for therapeutic application. Here, we develop a platelet hybrid microglia platform which can specifically polarize to anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype by ultrasound irradiation for targeted cerebrum repair after stroke. The engineered microglia have strong adherence to the injured cerebral vessels with platelet membrane fusion and can realize on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization with the ultrasound responsive IL&#8208;4 liposome decoration. Intravenously injected microglia platform showed anticipated anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization at stroke site with insonation control and accelerated the M2&#8208;type polarization of endogenous microglia for long&#8208;tern stroke recovery. Satisfied prognoses were achieved with reduced apoptosis, promoted neurogenesis and functional recovery, indicating the implications of microglia platform for stroke therapy.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
A conjugated polymer containing tetrazine groups in the backbone was prepared and found to undergo rapid inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) click chemistry, enabling facile functionalization with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivatives. The product polymers change color, become fluorescent, and exhibit changes to their physical properties, such as solubility, depending on the functionality that is appended.







Abstract
A soluble poly(tetrazine) polymer was prepared via Suzuki polycondensation of 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;bromofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine and a fluorene diboronate derivative. It can undergo efficient and quantitative post&#8208;polymerization inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder click reactions with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives. The resulting polymers were oxidized to convert dihydropyridazine rings into pyridazines. The absorption spectra of the product polymers, both before and after oxidation, showed hypsochromic shifts that correlated with steric hindrance of the appended side chains. They also exhibited a significantly enhanced fluorescence intensity relative to the original poly(tetrazine). While gel&#8208;permeation chromatography indicated that the product polymers exhibited longer retention times, NMR end&#8208;group analysis showed that the polymers retained relatively constant degrees of polymerization. Graft copolymers were easily prepared via reaction with TCO&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) chains and a cross&#8208;linked foam was produced by reacting the poly(tetrazine) with a bis&#8208;TCO crosslinker.

Single crystal structural determination reveals that Au 23  has eight uncoordinated gold atoms in the shape of a distorted bicapped triangular prism. The accessibility of the exposed Au atoms has been confirmed quantitatively by luminescent titration with 2&#8208;naphthalenethiol. Furthermore, this cluster has excellent performance toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. This atomically precise cluster stays intact after the catalytic reaction, demonstrating its excellent stability due to the protection of negatively charged multidentate ligand dpa.</dc:description>

Specifically, N  +  &#8208;(n)&#8208;NH  +  returns to the aqueous phase alone or together with nanoparticles after demulsification without contaminating the oil phase, and the whole aqueous phase can be recycled many times triggered by pH.

      <title>Designable Al32&#8208;oxo Clusters with Hydrotalcite&#8208;like Structures: Snapshots of Boundary Hydrolysis and Optical Limiting</title>
      <dc:description>The hydrolysis of earth&#8208;abundant Al(III) has implications in mineral mimicry, geochemistry and environmental chemistry. The design and synthesis of third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are important in modern chemistry due to their extensively optical applications. To study the hydrolysis and NLO properties, herein the assembly of Al(III) ions with &#960; conjugated carboxylate ligands were carried out. As a result, a series of Al32&#8208;oxo clusters with hydrotalcite&#8208;like cores and &#960; conjugated shells were isolated. Thanks to the accurate X&#8208;ray diffraction methods, the boundary hydrolysis snapshots that occur at equatorial unsaturated coordination sites of Al(III) ions are discovered. The charge distribution analysis and theoretical DFT calculations further supported proposed boundary substitution idea. Z&#8208;scan experiment results showed that the Al32&#8208;oxo clusters possess significant reverse saturable absorption (RSA) response with the minimal normalized transmittance up to 29%, indicating they are suitable candidates for optical limiting (OL) materials. This work is conducive to understanding the hydrolysis of Al(III) but also provides insight into the layered materials who also have strong boundary activity at the edges or corners.</dc:description>

      <title>The Characteristics of Disulfide&#8208;Centered Hydrogen Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>The disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds in the three different model systems of diethyl disulfide&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H 2  O/H 2  CO/HCONH 2  clusters were characterized by high&#8208;resolution Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. The global minimum energy structures for each cluster are experimentally observed, and are characterized by one of the three different S&#8722;S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H&#8722;C/N/O disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and two O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. Non&#8208;covalent interaction and natural bond orbital analyses further confirm the experimental observations. The symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) analysis reveals that electrostatic is dominant in diethyl disulfide&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H 2  O/HCONH 2  clusters being consistent with normal hydrogen bonds, whilst dispersion takes over in diethyl disulfide&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H 2  CO cluster. Our study gives accurate structural parameters for the disulfide bond involved in non&#8208;covalent clusters providing important benchmarking data for the theoretical evaluation of more complex systems.</dc:description>
