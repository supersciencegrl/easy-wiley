         <title>Significant Enhancement of the Upconversion Emission in Er3+ Highly&#8208;Doped Nanoparticles at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Relatively low efficiency is the bottleneck for the application of lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The high&#8208;level&#8208;doping strategy realized in recent years has not improved the efficiency as much as expected. It is argued that cross relaxation (CR) is not detrimental to upconversion. Here we combine theoretical simulation and spectroscopy to elucidate the role of CR in upconversion process of Er3+ highly doped (HD) UCNPs. It is found that if CR is purposively suppressed, upconversion efficiency can be significantly improved. Specifically, we demonstrate experimentally that inhibition of CR by introducing cryogenic environment (40 K) enhances upconversion emission by more than two orders of magnitude. This work not only elucidates the nature of CR and its non&#8208;negligible adverse effects, but also provides a new perspective for improving upconversion efficiency. The result can be directly applied to cryogenic imaging and wide range temperature sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Dicyclohepta[a,g]heptalene&#8208;Containing Polycyclic Conjugated Hydrocarbon and the Impact of Non&#8208;Alternant Topologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating the non&#8208;hexagonal rings into polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) can significantly affect their electronic and optoelectronic properties and chemical reactivities. Here, we report the first bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a dicyclohepta[a,g]heptalene&#8208;embedded PCH (1) with four continuous heptagons, which are arranged in a &#8220;Z&#8221; shape. Compared with its structural isomer bischrysene 1R with only hexagonal rings, compound 1 presents a distinct antiaromatic character, especially the inner heptalene core possessing clean antiaromatic nature. In addition, PCH 1 exhibits a narrower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)&#8208;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap than its benzenoid contrast 1R verified by the experimental measurements and theoretical calculation. Our work reported herein not only provides a new way to synthesize novel PCHs with non&#8208;alternant topologies but also offers the possibility to tune their electronic and optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable Pure&#8208;Red Multiple Resonance&#8208;induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode with External Quantum Efficiency over 20%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing solution&#8208;processable red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity and efficiency based on multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) is a formidable challenge. Herein, by introducing auxiliary electron donor and acceptor moieties into the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) distributed positions of multiple resonance skeleton simultaneously, an effective strategy to obtain red MR&#8208;TADF emitters was represented. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept molecule BN&#8208;R exhibits a narrowband pure&#8208;red emission at 624 nm, with a high luminous efficiency of 94% and a narrow bandwidth of 46 nm. Notably, the fabricated solution&#8208;processable pure&#8208;red OLED based on BN&#8208;R exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiency over 20% with the Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.663, 0.337) and a long operational lifetime (LT50) of 1088 hours at an initial luminance of 1,000 cd m&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Excitation of Aldehyde to Activate the C(sp2)&#8211;H Bond by Cobaloxime Catalysis toward Fluorenones Synthesis with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Represented herein is a new manner to form fluorenones via direct excitation of substrate instead of photocatalyst to activate sp2 C&#8211;H bond under redox&#8208;neutral condition. Our design relies on the photoexcited triplet state of aromatic aldehyde intermediates with higher reactivity that can be intercepted by cobaloxime catalyst through single electron transfer for following &#946;&#8208;H elimination. The simple generation of acyl radical and successful interception by a metal catalyst cobaloxime avoid the use of both photocatalyst and stoichiometric external oxidants, affording a series of highly substituted fluorenones, even for six&#8208;membered ketones, such as xanthone and thioxanthone derivatives in good to excellent yields, and H2 is as the only byproduct. This catalytic system features the readily available metal catalyst, mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope, in which sunlight reaction and scale&#8208;up experiment by the continuous&#8208;flow approach make the developed methodology sustainable and amenable for potentially operational procedures.</dc:description>

         <title>Stainless Steel&#8208;Like Passivation Inspires Persistent Silicon Anodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passivation of stainless steel by additives forming mass&#8208;transport blocking layers is widely practiced, where Cr element is added into bulk Fe&#8208;C forming the Cr2O3&#8208;rich protective layer. Here we extend the long&#8208;practiced passivation concept to Si anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, incorporating the passivator of LiF/Li2CO3 into bulk Si. The passivation mechanism is studied by various ex situ characterizations, redox peak contour maps, thickness evolution tests, and finite element simulations. The results demonstrate that the passivation can enhance the lithiation of Li2Si and de&#8208;lithiation of Li3.75Si, induce the formation of F&#8208;rich robust solid electrolyte interphase, stabilize the Si/LiF/Li2CO3 composite, and mitigate the volume change of Si anodes upon cycling. The 3D passivated Si anode can fully retain a high capacity of 3701 mAh g&#8208;1 after 1500 cycles and tolerate high rates up to 50 C. This work provides insight into how to construct durable Si anodes through effective passivation.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Azulene&#8208;based 2D Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Organic Memristors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a conjugated and unsymmetric building block composed of an electron&#8208;poor seven&#8208;membered sp2 carbon ring and an electron&#8208;rich five&#8208;membered carbon ring, azulene and its derivatives have been recognized as one of the most promising building blocks for novel electronic devices due to its intrinsic redox activity. By using 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;benzene and azulene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbaldehyde as the starting materials, an azulene(Azu)&#8208;based 2D conjugated covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;Azu, is prepared through liquid&#8208;liquid interface polymerization strategy for the first time. The as&#8208;fabricated Al/COF&#8208;Azu/indium tin oxide (ITO) mem&#8208;ristor shows typical non&#8208;volatile resistive switching performance due to the electric filed induced intramolecular charge transfer effect. Associated with the unique memristive performance, a simple convolutional neural network is built for image recognition. After 8 epochs of training, image recognition accuracy of 80% for a neutral network trained on a larger data set is achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step&#160;In Situ&#160;Polymerization: A Facile Design Strategy for Block Copolymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To optimize the rapid transport of lithium ions (Li+) inside lithium metal batteries (LMBs), block copolymer electrolytes (BCPEs) have been fabricated in situ in LMBs via a one&#8208;step method combining reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and carboxylic acid&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP). The BCPEs balanced the Li+ coordination characteristics of the polyether&#8208; and polyester&#8208;based electrolytes to achieve a rapid Li+ migration in the SPEs. The carboxylic acid played a dual role since it both catalyzed the ROP and stabilized the interface. Furthermore, the in situ assembly of LMBs did effectively enable an efficient intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation of Li+ at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The in situ assembled Li/BCPE4/LFP exhibited high&#8208;capacity retention of 92% after 400 cycles at 1 C. The one&#8208;step in situ fabrication of BCPEs provides a new direction for the design of polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Handedness Inversion and Circularly Polarized Light Reflection Tuning in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Macrocyclic Chiral Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of macrocyclic azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitches have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and characterized. In the molecular structures, binaphthyl is covalently linked to ortho&#8208;positions of azobenzene, and four different substituents are linked to 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions of binaphthyl. The photoswitches show enhanced helical twisting power (HTP) when doping in commercially available achiral liquid crystals to form self&#8208;organized helical superstructures, i.e., cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs). All the photoswitches exhibit reversible photoisomerization driven by visible light of different wavelengths in both organic solvent and liquid crystals. The photoswitches with shorter substituents enable handedness inversion of CLCs upon photoisomerization. These are the first examples of ortho&#8208;linked azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitches that enable handedness inversion in CLCs. The photoswitches with longer substituents display only HTP values decreasing while maintaining the same handedness.</dc:description>

         <title>Olefin Dihydroxylation Using Nitroarenes as Photoresponsive Oxidants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vicinal diols are abundant among natural and synthetic molecules, and also represent valuable intermediates throughout organic synthesis. Olefin dihydroxylation is an effective strategy to access these derivatives owing to the broad range and availability of alkene feedstocks. OsO4 is the among most used reagents to achieve this transformation, yet its high toxicity and cost remain concerning. Herein, we present a mechanistically distinct strategy for olefin dihydroxylation using nitroarenes as photoresponsive oxidants. Upon purple LED irradiation, these species undergo a [3+2]&#8208;photocycloaddition with a wide range of olefins to give a stable 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine intermediate. This species can be accumulated in solution and then reduced in situ to the desired diols, utilising readily accessible and easy to handle solid reagents as H2 surrogates.</dc:description>

         <title>Data&#8208;driven Machine Learning for Understanding Surface Structures of Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of heterogeneous catalysts is necessarily surface&#8208;focused, generally achieved via adsorption energy and microkinetic modelling. A prerequisite is to ensure the adsorption energy is physically meaningful is the stable existence of the conceived active&#8208;site structure on the surface. The development of improved understanding of the catalyst surface however is practically challenging because of the complex nature of dynamic surface formation and evolution under in&#8208;situ reactions. We propose therefore data&#8208;driven machine&#8208;learning (ML) approaches as a solution. In this minireview we summarize recent progress in using machine&#8208;learning to search&#8208;out and predict (meta)stable structures, assist operando simulation under reaction conditions and micro&#8208;environments and, identify and critically analyze experimental characterization data. We conclude that ML will become the new norm to lower costs associated with discovery and benefit researchers in optimal design of heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Semi&#8208;solid Zinc Powder&#8208;based Slurry Anode for Advanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, for the first time, we design a semi&#8208;solid zinc slurry anode consisting of zinc powder and the intrinsically zincophilic tin additive dispersed in a conductive elastic rheological network. Experimental observations and theoretical simulations reveal that zinc can be deposited homogeneously on the dispersed tin particles, which avoids agglomerative zinc deposition and alleviates volume change during repeated zinc stripping/plating.







Abstract
The booming of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) draws the researchers&#8217; attention to issues of zinc metal anodes, such as uncontrollable dendrite growth, corrosion, and volume effects. Zinc powder anode is more suitable for the industrial application of AZIBs than the widely used zinc foil anode due to its low cost, tunability and processability. However, the related solutions are rarely studied because the above issues of zinc metal anode are more serious in zinc powder anode. Herein, for the first time, we design a semi&#8208;solid zinc slurry anode consisting of zinc powder and zincophilic tin additive dispersed in a conductive elastic rheological network. Zinc can be deposited homogeneously on the dispersed tin particles, which avoids agglomerative zinc deposition and alleviates volume change during repeated zinc stripping/plating. Moreover, the practical application of the full cell with slurry is very promising since its operating life can be easily extended by facile slurry renewal.

         <title>Heterogenization of Salen Metal Molecular Catalysts in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterogenization of a Salen metal complex molecular catalyst into a rigid covalent organic framework (COF) through covalent linkage with the light&#8208;harvesting unit of pyrene for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Co/Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF showed the best hydrogen evolution activity (1378&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), which is superior to the previously reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based COF photocatalysts







Abstract
Integrating a molecular catalyst with a light harvester into a photocatalyst is an effective strategy for solar light conversion. However, it is challenging to establish a crystallized framework with well&#8208;organized connections that favour charge separation and transfer. Herein, we report the heterogenization of a Salen metal complex molecular catalyst into a rigid covalent organic framework (COF) through covalent linkage with the light&#8208;harvesting unit of pyrene for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The chemically conjugated bonds between the two units contribute to fast photogenerated electron transfer and thereby promote the proton reduction reaction. The Salen cobalt&#8208;based COF showed the best hydrogen evolution activity (1378&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), which is superior to the previously reported nonnoble metal based COF photocatalysts. This work provides a strategy to construct atom&#8208;efficient photocatalysts by the heterogenization of molecular catalysts into covalent organic frameworks.

         <title>Oligothiophene&#8208;Ring&#8208;Strapped Perylene Bisimides: Functionalizable Coaxial Donor&#8211;Acceptor Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new macrocycle consisting of oligothiophene&#8208;ring&#8208;strapped perylene bisimide was synthesized, and the perpendicular donor&#8211;acceptor orientation was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal analysis. This functionalizable macrocycle enabled the synthesis of the corresponding linear dimer and 2D polymer. The precise positioning and preferred orientation of donor and acceptor units in this macrocycle led to ultrafast electron transfer and long&#8208;lived charge separation.







Abstract
Aesthetic designs from nature enable new knowledge to be gained and, at the same time, inspire scientific models. In this context, multicomponent macrocycles embody the advantage of precisely positioning the structural units to achieve efficient communication between them. However, the construction of a functionalizable macrocycle for ultrafast charge separation and stabilization has not been attempted. Herein, we report the synthesis, crystal structure, and transient absorption of a new functionalizable macrocycle consisting of an oligothiophene&#8208;ring&#8208;strapped perylene bisimide. Transient absorption results point to a sequential improvement in charge separation and stabilization from the macrocycle to the corresponding linear dimer and 2D polymer due to the unique design. Our macrocycle design with a supportive spatial arrangement of the donor and acceptor units will inspire the development of more complex synthetic systems with exciting electron&#8208;transfer and charge&#8208;separation features.

&lt;p&gt;A new macrocycle consisting of oligothiophene-ring-strapped perylene bisimide was synthesized, and the perpendicular donor&#8211;acceptor orientation was confirmed by single-crystal analysis. This functionalizable macrocycle enabled the synthesis of the corresponding linear dimer and 2D polymer. The precise positioning and preferred orientation of donor and acceptor units in this macrocycle led to ultrafast electron transfer and long-lived charge separation.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Di&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenidecaphyrin(1.1.0.0.0.1.1.0.0.0) and Its Bis&#8208;Organopalladium Complexes: Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded porphyrins containing 2,7&#8208;pyrenylene as key structural elements have been prepared. The resulting macrocycle showed unexpected coordination modes toward PdII. The two bis&#8208;Pd complexes characterized in this study exhibited noteworthy chiroptical properties, including dissymmetry factors (gabs) as high as 0.038 at 763&#8197;nm, and low energy absorption bands extending into the NIR&#8208;II region.







Abstract
A non&#8208;aromatic expanded carbaporphyrinoid, incorporating two built&#8208;in 2,7&#8208;pyrenylene moieties was synthesized. The intrinsically labile structure was demonstrated by proton&#8208;triggered conformational changes between the figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight and quasi&#8208;M&#246;bius conformers. Upon treatment with Pd(OAc)2, the reaction produces two bis&#8208;PdII complexes with distinct coordination modes. Metal coordination serves to fix the macrocyclic frameworks with the net result that both bis&#8208;PdII complexes could be resolved by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a chiral stationary phase. The isolated enantiomers showed persistent chiroptical properties as evidenced by the intense response in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra and the record high absorption dissymmetry factors (gabs of up to 0.038) seen in the near&#8208;infrared spectral region. Moreover, the mutual interconversion of these two PdII complexes was found to be stereospecific and to favor the more stable isomers under weakly acidic conditions.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Directed Automated Mannoside Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Motivated by the importance of fluorination in drug discovery, fluorine&#8208;directed automated glycan assembly (AFGA) is disclosed. This strategy leverages the C(sp3)&#8722;F bond at C2 to enable &#945;&#8208;stereocontrolled glycosylation that eliminates the reliance on O&#8208;based directing groups. Reactions display extremely high levels of efficiency and selectivity, and the method has been demonstrated in the synthesis of linear and branched fluorinated oligomannoses.







Abstract
Automated glycan assembly (AGA) on solid support has become invaluable in reconciling the biological importance of complex carbohydrates with the persistent challenges associated with reproducible synthesis. Whilst AGA platforms have transformed the construction of many natural sugars, validation in the construction of well&#8208;defined (site&#8208;selectively modified) glycomimetics is in its infancy. Motivated by the importance of fluorination in drug discovery, the biomedical prominence of 2&#8208;fluoro sugars and the remarkable selectivities observed in fluorine&#8208;directed glycosylation, fluorine&#8208;directed automated glycan assembly (FDAGA) is disclosed. This strategy leverages the fluorine atom for stereocontrolled glycosylation on solid support, thereby eliminating the reliance on O&#8208;based directing groups. The logical design of C2&#8208;fluorinated mannose building blocks, and their application in the fully (&#945;&#8208;)stereocontrolled automated assembly of linear and branched fluorinated oligomannosides, is disclosed. This operationally simple strategy can be integrated into existing AGA and post&#8208;AGA protocols to augment the scope of programmed carbohydrate synthesis.

         <title>A Ferroelectric Aminophosphonium Cyanoferrate with a Large Electrostrictive Coefficient as a Piezoelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric Iron (III) cyanometallate complex stabilized by organo&#8208;aminophosphonium cations was synthesized and utilized for efficient piezoelectric energy harvesting and storage applications.







Abstract
Hybrid materials possessing piezo&#8208; and ferroelectric properties emerge as excellent alternatives to conventional piezoceramics due to their merits of facile synthesis, lightweight nature, ease of fabrication and mechanical flexibility. Inspired by the structural stability of aminophosphonium compounds, here we report the first A3BX6 type cyanometallate [Ph2(iPrNH)2P]3[Fe(CN)6] (1), which shows a ferroelectric saturation polarization (Ps) of 3.71&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Compound 1 exhibits a high electrostrictive coefficient (Q33) of 0.73&#8197;m4&#8197;C&#8722;2, far exceeding those of piezoceramics (0.034&#8211;0.096&#8197;m4&#8197;C&#8722;2). Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) analysis demonstrates the polarization switching and domain structure of 1 further confirming its ferroelectric nature. Furthermore, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) polymer composite films of 1 were prepared and employed as piezoelectric nanogenerators. Notably, the 15&#8197;wt&#8201;% 1&#8208;TPU device gave a maximum output voltage of 13.57&#8197;V and a power density of 6.03&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Tuning Mass Transport in Electrocatalysis Down to Sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm through Nanoscale Grade Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a nanoscale grade&#8208;separation strategy to achieve confined mass transport at the few&#8208;nanometer through utilization of ordered 3d interconnected sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm pores. The results reveal that 3d criss&#8208;crossing mesopores allow efficient diffusion of H2 bubbles along the interconnected channels. After the support of ultrafine ruthenium, the 3d arrangement of pores was on a superior level to 2d system in maximizing catalyst performance.







Abstract
Nano and single&#8208;atom catalysis open new possibilities of producing green hydrogen (H2) by water electrolysis. However, for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which occurs at a characteristic reaction rate proportional to the potential, the fast generation of H2 nanobubbles at atomic&#8208;scale interfaces often leads to the blockage of active sites. Herein, a nanoscale grade&#8208;separation strategy is proposed to tackle mass&#8208;transport problem by utilizing ordered three&#8208;dimensional (3d) interconnected sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm pores. The results reveal that 3d criss&#8208;crossing mesopores with grade separation allow efficient diffusion of H2 bubbles along the interconnected channels. After the support of ultrafine ruthenium (Ru), the 3d mesopores are on a superior level to two&#8208;dimensional system at maximizing the catalyst performance and the obtained Ru catalyst outperforms most of the other HER catalysts. This work provides a potential route to fine&#8208;tuning few&#8208;nanometer mass transport during water electrolysis.

         <title>Trifluoromethylation of Carbonyl and Unactivated Olefin Derivatives by C(sp3)&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;mediated trifluoromethylation of carbonyl&#8208;type compounds and unactivated olefins enabled by visible&#8208;light irradiation via &#963; C(sp3)&#8722;C bond&#8208;functionalization has been developed. This protocol is characterized by its modularity, mild conditions and wide scope&#8212;even in the context of late&#8208;stage functionalization, thus offering a complementary approach en route to valuable C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 architectures from easily accessible precursors.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Cu&#8208;mediated trifluoromethylation of carbonyl&#8208;type compounds and unactivated olefins enabled by visible&#8208;light irradiation via &#963; C(sp3)&#8722;C bond&#8208;functionalization. The reaction is distinguished by its modularity, mild conditions and wide scope&#8212;even in the context of late&#8208;stage functionalization&#8212;thus offering a complementary approach en route to valuable C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 architectures from easily accessible precursors.

         <title>Medium/High&#8208;Entropy Amalgamated Core/Shell Nanoplate Achieves Efficient Formic Acid Catalysis for Direct Formic Acid Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy alloy hexagonal nanoplates (HEA HP) with PtBiPb medium&#8208;entropy core and PtBiNiCo high&#8208;entropy shell has been successfully achieved. The HEA HP not only displays the record formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) performance, but also readily achieves much higher peak power density (321.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) along with the long&#8208;term lifetime under the operating fuel cell conditions.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have been attracting extensive research interests in designing advanced nanomaterials, while their precise control is still in the infancy stage. Herein, we have reported a well&#8208;defined PtBiPbNiCo hexagonal nanoplates (HEA HPs) as high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Structure analysis decodes that the HEA HP is constructed with PtBiPb medium&#8208;entropy core and PtBiNiCo high&#8208;entropy shell. Significantly, the HEA HPs can reach the specific and mass activities of 27.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 7.1&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 for formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR), being the record catalyst ever achieved in Pt&#8208;based catalysts, and can realize the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) power density (321.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in fuel cell. Further experimental and theoretical analyses collectively evidence that the hexagonal intermetallic core/atomic layer shell structure and multi&#8208;element synergy greatly promote the direct dehydrogenation pathway of formic acid molecule and suppress the formation of CO*.

         <title>Dendritic Quaternary&#8208;Encoded Oligourethanes for Data Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic quaternary&#8208;encoded oligourethanes bearing self&#8208;immolative linkages are developed for high&#8208;strength data encryption. Specifically, the fragmentation paths of dendritic quaternary&#8208;encoded oligourethanes under MALDI&#8208;ToF MS/MS conditions can be translated into 2D matrices with &#8776;1.98&#215;1087 permutations, and each 2772&#8208;bit code 2D matrix can be further used as a unique decryption key to decipher the QR code for confidential communications.







Abstract
The use of sequence&#8208;defined digital polymers for data storage and encryption has received increasing attention due to their precision structures similar to natural biomacromolecules (e.g., DNA) but increased stability. However, the rapid development of sequencing techniques raises the concern of information leakage. Herein, dendritic quaternary&#8208;encoded oligourethanes bearing a photoresponsive trigger, self&#8208;immolative backbones, and a mass spectrometry tag of PEG dendron have been developed for data encryption. Although the sequence information in linear analogs can be readily deciphered by mass spectrometry, sequencing of dendritic oligourethanes cannot be achieved by either primary MS or tandem MS/MS owing to the unique spatial conformation. Intriguingly, the fragmentation pathways of a quaternary dendrimer under MS/MS conditions can be converted to 2772&#8208;bit 2D matrices with &#8776;1.98&#215;1087 permutations, serving as high&#8208;strength encryption keys for highly reliable data encryption.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Complex Nucleoside Antibiotics A201A, A201D and A201E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired total synthesis of A201A, A201D and A201E is presented, as modeled on the biosynthetic pathway reported previously. The L&#8208;galactofuranose was obtained from a cheap and readily available D&#8208;galactopyranose through a C1/C6 head&#8208;to&#8208;tail oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;switch strategy. The challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanoside, an essential core structure of the A201 family, was accessed through remote 2&#8208;quinolinecarbonyl&#8208;assisted glycosylation.







Abstract
Herein, bioinspired total syntheses of A201A, A201D, and A201E based on a previously reported biosynthetic pathway are presented. The challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanoside, a core structure of the A201 family, was obtained by remote 2&#8208;quinolinecarbonyl&#8208;assisted glycosylation. We accomplished the total synthesis of A201A and A201E based on the critical 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanoside moiety through late&#8208;stage glycosylation without any interference from basic dimethyl adenosine. We also confirmed the absolute configuration of A201E by total synthesis. This modular synthesis strategy enables efficient preparation of A201 family antibiotics, allowing the study of their structure&#8211;activity relationships and mode of action. This study satisfies the increasing demand for developing novel antibiotics inspired by the A201 family.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light Powered Asymmetric Hydrogel Nanomotors for Enhanced Immunochemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using copper sulfides (Cu2&#8722;xS) with a strong absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region and a microfluidic chip in flow&#8208;focusing configuration with magnet&#8208;assisted photopolymerization, a 1064&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II light driven asymmetric hydrogel nanomotor with encapsulated DOX (AHNM&#8208;DOX) was developed. It demonstrated high motion efficiency and facilitated deep tissue penetration for enhanced in vivo immunochemotherapy.







Abstract
Nanomotors are appealing drug carriers, and the strength of the propelling force is important for their motion capability. Though high motion efficiency has been achieved with 808&#8197;nm light driven Janus&#8208;structured noble metal nanomotors, the NIR&#8208;I light penetration depth and material biocompatibility limit their broad application. Herein, we develop a 1064&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II light driven asymmetric hydrogel nanomotor (AHNM) with high motion capability and load it with doxorubicin for enhanced immunochemotherapy. Magnetic field assisted photopolymerization generates an asymmetric distribution of Fe3O4@Cu9S8 nanoparticles in the AHNM, producing self&#8208;thermophoresis as driving force under NIR&#8208;II irradiation. The AHNM is also functionalized with dopamine for the capture and retention of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to boost immune activation. The as&#8208;obtained NIR&#8208;II light driven AHNM has a high tumor tissue penetration capability and enhances immunochemotherapy, providing a promising strategy for cancer therapy.

         <title>Spectroscopic Manifestations and Implications for Catalysis of Quasi&#8208;d10 Configurations in Formal Gold(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the interplay of X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and computational analysis, we show that gold +I and +III complexes, despite their physically distinct electronic structures, tend to activate substrates to similar extents. We focus in particular on the role of electron&#8208;sharing covalency of the metal&#8208;ligand bonds and provide an explanation for the often&#8208;similar reactivities observed for gold complexes in these physical oxidation states.







Abstract
Several gold +I and +III complexes are investigated computationally and spectroscopically, focusing on the d&#8208;configuration and physical oxidation state of the metal center. Density functional theory calculations reveal the non&#8208;negligible electron&#8208;sharing covalent character of the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand &#963;&#8208;bonding framework. The bonding of gold(III) is shown to be isoelectronic to the formal CuIII complex [Cu(CF3)4]1&#8722;, in which the metal center tries to populate its formally unoccupied 3dx2&#8208;y2 orbital via &#963;&#8208;bonding, leading to a reduced d10 CuI description. However, Au L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals excitation into the d&#8208;orbital of the AuIII species is still possible, showing that a genuine d10 configuration is not achieved. We also find an increased electron&#8208;sharing nature of the &#963;&#8208;bonds in the AuI species, relative to their AgI and CuI analogues, due to the low&#8208;lying 6s orbital. We propose that gold +I and +III complexes form similar bonds with substrates, owing primarily to participation of the 5dx2&#8208;y2 or 6s orbital, respectively, in bonding, indicating why AuI and AuIII complexes often have similar reactivity.

         <title>Photocatalytic Deuterium Atom Transfer Deuteration of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes with High Functional Group Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetically benign deuterium atom transfer (DAT) deuteration of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes has been achieved. This DAT protocol realized higher functional group (FG) tolerance and chemoselectivity than the existing method, and allowed access to complex deuterated compounds including a heavy drug and deuterium&#8208;labeled amino acids.







Abstract
Due to its mild reaction conditions and unique chemoselectivity, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) hydrogenation represents an indispensable method for the synthesis of complex molecules. Its analog using deuterium, deuterium atom transfer (DAT) deuteration, is expected to enable access to complex deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds. However, DAT deuteration has been scarcely studied for synthetic purposes, and a method that possesses the favorable characteristics of HAT hydrogenations has remained elusive. Herein, we report a protocol for the photocatalytic DAT deuteration of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. In contrast to the previous DAT deuteration, this method tolerates a variety of synthetically useful functional groups including haloarenes. The late&#8208;stage deuteration also allows access to deuterated amino acids as well as donepezil&#8208;d2. Thus, this work demonstrates the potential of DAT chemistry to become the alternative method of choice for preparing deuterium&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Vinylphosphonates and Diarylvinylphosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted ethylphosphonate and ethylphosphine oxide compounds are widely used in drugs, pesticides, and ligands. However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis is still rare. Of the only asymmetric hydrogenation methods available at present, all cases use rare metal catalysts. Herein, we report an efficient earth&#8208;abundant transition&#8208;metal nickel catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation affording the corresponding chiral ethylphosphine products with up to 99% yield, 96% ee (enantiomeric excess) (99% ee, after recrystallization) and 1000 S/C (substrate/catalyst); this is also the first study on the asymmetric hydrogenation of terminal olefins using a nickel catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere. The catalytic mechanism was investigated via deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and calculations which indicate that the two added hydrogen atoms of the products come from hydrogen gas. Additionally, it is believed that the reaction involves a Ni(II) rather than Ni(0) cyclic process based on the weak attractive interactions between the Ni catalyst and terminal olefin substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Nature of Zinc in Copper&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Zirconium Catalysts by Operando Spectroscopies for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active Zn species in Cu&#8208;based methanol synthesis catalysts have not been clearly identified yet due to their complex nature and dynamic structural changes during reactions. Herein, atomically dispersed Zn on ZrO2 support is established in Cu&#8208;based catalysts by separating Zn and Zr components from Cu (Cu&#8208;ZnZr) via the double&#8208;nozzle flame spray pyrolysis (DFSP) method. It exhibits superiority in methanol selectivity and yield compared to those with Cu&#8208;ZnO interface and isolated ZnO nanoparticles. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the atomically dispersed Zn species are induced during the reaction due to the strengthened Zn&#8208;Zr interaction. They can suppress formate decomposition to CO and decrease the H2 dissociation energy, shifting the reaction to methanol production. This work enlightens the rational design of unique Zn species by regulating coordination environments and offers a new perspective for exploring complex interactions in multi&#8208;component catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic B/N Lewis Pairs: Insights into the Structural Variations and Photochromism via Light&#8208;Induced Fluorescence to Phosphorescence Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a series of ring&#8208;constrained B/N Lewis pairs (LPs) as modular systems, we have engineered the electronic interactions between B Lewis acid and N Lewis base sites by systematically tuning the steric effects, culminating in the discovery of a unique method to achieve rarely accessible room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials via photochemical activation of fluorescent heavy atom&#8208;free organic materials.







Abstract
Ultralong afterglow emissions due to room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are of paramount importance in the advancement of smart sensors, bioimaging and light&#8208;emitting devices. We herein present an efficient approach to achieve rarely accessible phosphorescence of heavy atom&#8208;free organoboranes via photochemical switching of sterically tunable fluorescent Lewis pairs (LPs). LPs are widely applied in and well&#8208;known for their outstanding performance in catalysis and supramolecular soft materials but have not thus far been exploited to develop photo&#8208;responsive RTP materials. The intramolecular LP M1BNM not only shows a dynamic response to thermal treatment due to reversible N&#8594;B coordination but crystals of M1BNM also undergo rapid photochromic switching. As a result, unusual emission switching from short&#8208;lived fluorescence to long&#8208;lived phosphorescence (rad&#8208;M1BNM, &#964;RTP=232&#8197;ms) is observed. The reported discoveries in the field of Lewis pairs chemistry offer important insights into their structural dynamics, while also pointing to new opportunities for photoactive materials with implications for fast responsive detectors.

A unified strategy for the deoxygenative or desulfurative pyridylation of various alcohols and thiols was developed through SET of FLPs derived from pyridinium salts and PtBu3. This method provides an opportunity for the selective heteroarylation of a diverse range of alcohols and thiols, and the versatility of this protocol was further demonstrated by the successful modification of pharmaceutically relevant molecules.







Abstract
A unified strategy for the deoxygenative or desulfurative pyridylation of various alcohols and thiols has been developed through a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) derived from pyridinium salts and PtBu3. Mechanistic studies revealed that N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts serve as effective Lewis acids for the formation of FLPs with PtBu3, and the generated phosphine radical cation ionically couples with the in situ generated xanthate, eventually affording the alkyl radical through facile &#946;&#8208;scission under photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction efficiency was further accelerated by visible&#8208;light irradiation. This method is conceptually appealing by using encounter complexes in FLP chemistry to promote SET, which provides a previously unrecognized opportunity for the selective heteroarylation of a diverse range of alcohols and thiols with various functional groups, even in complex settings under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Structure Elucidation, Total Synthesis, Antibacterial In Vivo Efficacy and Biosynthesis Proposal of Myxobacterial Corramycin

Corramycin is a novel natural product produced by the myxobacterium Corallococcus coralloides. The structure, extraordinary total synthesis and biosynthesis of the antibiotic is described for the first time. Its promise as an in vivo septicemia model, the absence of cross&#8208;resistance with commonly used antibiotic classes, and the lack of cytotoxicity make Corramycin a potential new drug in the fight against multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the myxobacterial natural product Corramycin isolated from Corallococcus coralloides. The linear peptide structure contains an unprecedented (2R,3S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;histidine moiety. Corramycin exhibits anti&#8208;Gram&#8208;negative activity against Escherichia coli (E.&#8197;coli) and is taken up via two transporter systems, SbmA and YejABEF. Furthermore, the Corramycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was identified and a biosynthesis model was proposed involving a 12&#8208;modular non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthase. Bioinformatic analysis of the BGC combined with the development of a total synthesis route allowed for the elucidation of the molecule's absolute configuration. Importantly, intravenous administration of 20&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of Corramycin in an E.&#8197;coli mouse infection model resulted in 100&#8201;% survival of animals without toxic side effects. Corramycin is thus a promising starting point to develop a potent antibacterial drug against hospital&#8208;acquired infections.

         <title>Tailored Cross&#8208;&#946; Assemblies Establish Peptide &#8220;Dominos&#8221; Structures for Anchoring Undruggable Pharmacophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of the peptide chain, the tilt angle of the &#946;&#8208;sheets in the self&#8208;assembly could be manipulated to form a collapsed&#8208;domino&#8208;like structure, resulting in a controllable display of the active sites for PD&#8208;L1 recognition.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;sheets have the ability to hierarchically stack into assemblies, and much effort has been spent on designing different peptides to regulate their assembly behaviors. Although the progress is remarkable, it remains challenging to manipulate them in a controllable way for achieving both tailored structures and specific functions. In this study, we obtained bola&#8208;like peptides using de novo design and combinatorial chemical screening. By regulating the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of the peptide chain, a series of assemblies with different tilt angles and active sites of the &#946;&#8208;sheet were obtained, resembling collapsed dominos. The structure&#8208;activity relationship of the optimized peptide NQ40 system was established and its ability to target the PD&#8208;L1 was demonstrated. This study successfully established the structure&#8208;function relationship of &#946;&#8208;sheets assemblies and has positive implications on the rational design of peptide assemblies that possess recognition abilities.

         <title>Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imines as Super Nucleophiles in Catalytic Couplings of Amides with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (mNHI) based superbases are introduced in this work. The mNHIs were utilized as metal&#8208;free catalysts in transformations using CO2 for the coupling of amides.







Abstract
An extended class of stable mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (mNHIs), containing a highly polarized exocyclic imine moiety, were synthesized. The calculated proton affinities (PA) and experimentally determined Tolman electronic parameters (TEPs) reveal that these synthesized mNHIs have the highest basicity and donor ability among NHIs reported so far. The superior nucleophilicity of newly designed mNHIs was utilized in devising a strategy to incorporate CO2 as a bridging unit under reductive conditions to couple inert primary amides. This strategy was further extended to hetero&#8208;couplings between amide and amine using CO2. These hitherto unknown catalytic transformations were introduced in the diversification of various biologically active drug molecules under metal&#8208;free conditions. The underlying mechanism was explored by performing a series of control experiments, characterizing key intermediates using spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques.

         <title>Bimetallic Aluminum&#8208; and Niobium&#8208;Doped MCM&#8208;41 for Efficient Conversion of Biomass&#8208;Derived 2&#8208;Methyltetrahydrofuran to Pentadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective conversion of biomass&#8208;derived 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MTHF) into pentadienes has been achieved over an aluminum and niobium bimetallic atomically doped MCM&#8208;41. The NbV sites enhance the catalytic performance by binding 2&#8208;MTHF.







Abstract
The production of conjugated C4&#8211;C5 dienes from biomass can enable the sustainable synthesis of many important polymers and liquid fuels. Here, we report the first example of bimetallic (Nb, Al)&#8208;atomically doped mesoporous silica, denoted as AlNb&#8208;MCM&#8208;41, which affords quantitative conversion of 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MTHF) to pentadienes with a high selectivity of 91&#8201;%. The incorporation of AlIII and NbV sites into the framework of AlNb&#8208;MCM&#8208;41 has effectively tuned the nature and distribution of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites within the structure. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption, diffuse reflectance infrared and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy collectively reveal the molecular mechanism of the conversion of adsorbed 2&#8208;MTHF over AlNb&#8208;MCM&#8208;41. Specifically, the atomically&#8208;dispersed NbV sites play an important role in binding 2&#8208;MTHF to drive the conversion. Overall, this study highlights the potential of hetero&#8208;atomic mesoporous solids for the manufacture of renewable materials.

Specifically, the atomically-dispersed Nb&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; sites play an important role in binding 2-MTHF to drive the conversion. Overall, this study highlights the potential of hetero-atomic mesoporous solids for the manufacture of renewable materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Edge&#8208;hosted Atomic Co&#8722;N4 Sites on Hierarchical Porous Carbon for Highly Selective Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The edge&#8208;hosted Co&#8722;N4 sites in the carbon matrix are more efficient and selective than basal plane&#8208;hosted ones in catalyzing 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;ORR, achieving a remarkable selectivity of &#8776;95&#8201;% in the electrochemical production of H2O2.







Abstract
Not only high efficiency but also high selectivity of the electrocatalysts is crucial for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable energy storage applications. Herein, we systematically investigate the edge effect of carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathways (two&#8208;electron (2&#8201;e&#8722;) or four&#8208;electron (4&#8201;e&#8722;)) and conclude that the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;ORR proceeding over the edge&#8208;hosted atomic Co&#8722;N4 sites is more favorable than the basal&#8208;plane&#8208;hosted ones. As such, we have successfully synthesized and tuned Co&#8208;SACs with different edge&#8208;to&#8208;bulk ratios. The as&#8208;prepared edge&#8208;rich Co&#8722;N/HPC catalyst exhibits excellent 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;ORR performance with a remarkable selectivity of &#8776;95&#8201;% in a wide potential range. Furthermore, we also find that oxygen functional groups could saturate the graphitic carbon edges under the ORR operation and further promote electrocatalytic performance. These findings on the structure&#8211;property relationship in SACs offer a promising direction for large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost electrochemical H2O2 production via the 2&#8201;e&#8722;&#8208;ORR.

         <title>Durable Nickel&#8208;Iron (Oxy)hydroxide Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts through Surface Functionalization with Tetraphenylporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe dissolution is the major deactivation mechanism of Nickel&#8208;Iron (oxy)hydroxide in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction. The water molecule hydrates eluted Fe that easily escape from the double layer. Surface immobilization of tetraphenylporphyrin forms a nonpolar layer that suppresses the penetration of Fe without interrupting the activity. This increases the fraction of Fe redeposition onto the electrode and maintains an active site population.







Abstract
NiFe&#8208;based oxides are one of the best&#8208;known active oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Unfortunately, they rapidly lost performance in Fe&#8208;purified KOH during the reaction. Herein, tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) was loaded on a catalyst/electrolyte interface to alleviate the destabilization of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide. We propose that the degradation occurs primarily due to the release of thermodynamically unstable Fe. TPP acts as a protective layer and suppresses the dissolution of hydrated metal at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. In the electric double layer, the nonpolar TPP layer on the NiFe surface also invigorates the redeposition of the active site, Fe, which leads to prolonging the lifetime of NiFe. The TPP&#8208;coated NiFe was demonstrated in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, where hydrogen was generated at a rate of 126&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1 for 115&#8197;h at a 1.41&#8197;mV&#8201;h&#8722;1 degradation rate. Consequently, TPP is a promising protective layer that could stabilize oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.

         <title>Stepwise Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization Enabled Mimetic Synthesis of Axially Chiral B,N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of stepwise asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (AASI) strategy, diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles bearing B&#8722;C and C&#8722;N axes that are related to the moieties of axially chiral enamines and arylborons were obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated that the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions played a unique effect on the promotion of stereospecific isomerization.







Abstract
Axially chiral molecules bearing multiple stereogenic axes are of great importance in the field of organic chemistry. However, the efficient construction of atropisomers featuring two different types of stereogenic axes has rarely been explored. Herein, we report the novel atroposelective synthesis of configurationally stable axially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles. By using stepwise asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (AASI) strategy, diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles bearing B&#8722;C and C&#8722;N axes that are related to the moieties of axially chiral enamines and arylborons were also obtained. In this case, all four stereoisomers of diaxially chiral B,N&#8208;heterocycles were stereodivergently afforded in high enantioselectivities. Density functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated that the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions played a unique role in the promotion of stereospecific isomerization, thereby leading to the highly efficient central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.

         <title>Understanding Aerobic Nitrogen Photooxidation on Titania through In Situ Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ and ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic characterization and computational simulations were employed to elucidate the role of O2 in promoting N2 dissociation through a low&#8208;energy pathway evolving from *OxNy to an *ON intermediate. A TiO2 photocatalyst exhibited outstanding N2 photofixation performance with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;nitrate energy conversion efficiency up to 0.13&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nitrate is an important raw material for chemical fertilizers, but it is industrially manufactured in multiple steps at high temperature and pressure, urgently motivating the design of a green and sustainable strategy for nitrate production. We report the photosynthesis of nitrate from N2 and O2 on commercial TiO2 in a flow reactor under ambient conditions. The TiO2 photocatalyst offered a high nitrate yield of 1.85&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 as well as a solar&#8208;to&#8208;nitrate energy conversion efficiency up to 0.13&#8201;%. We combined reactivity and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to elucidate the mechanism of nitrate formation and unveil the special role of O2 in N&#8801;N bond dissociation. The mechanistic insight into charge&#8208;involved N2 oxidation was further demonstrated by in situ transient absorption spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance. This work exhibits the mechanistic origin of N2 photooxidation and initiates a potential method for triggering inert catalytic reactions.

         <title>Multicomponent Assembly of Complex Oxindoles by Enantioselective Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary catalysis enabled the three&#8208;component reaction of N&#8208;aryl diazoamides, aldehydes, and enamines/indoles, providing access to polyfunctionalized oxindoles in good yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities (&gt;90 examples, up to 94&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee, and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). The reaction involves the assembly of two highly reactive intermediates generated in situ by orthogonal catalytic processes under mild and operationally simple reaction conditions.







Abstract
Chiral oxindoles are important chemical scaffolds found in many natural products, and their enantioselective synthesis thus attracts considerable attention. Highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthetic methods for constructing C3 quaternary oxindoles have been well&#8208;developed. However, the efficient synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;substituted tertiary oxindoles has been rarely reported due to the ease of racemization of the tertiary stereocenter via enolization. Therefore, we herein report on the multicomponent assembly (from N&#8208;aryl diazoamides, aldehydes, and enamines/indoles) of complex oxindoles by enantioselective cooperative catalysis. These reactions proceed under mild conditions and show broad substrate scope, affording the desired coupling products (&gt;90 examples) with good to excellent stereocontrol. Additionally, this research also demonstrates the synthetic potential of this annulation by constructing the 6,6,5&#8208;tricyclic lactone core structure of Speradine&#8197;A.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Ultralong Afterglow Emission with Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching from CsCdCl3&#8201;:&#8201;Mn Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution processed CsCdCl3&#8201;:&#8201;Mn perovskite exhibit highly efficient (81.5&#8201;%) afterglow emission (150&#8197;s) with anti&#8208;thermal quenching from 300 to 400&#8197;K. We further demonstrate the application of the developed materials for optical storage and logic operation applications.







Abstract
Triplet exciton&#8208;based long&#8208;lived phosphorescence is severely limited by the thermal quenching at high temperature. Herein, we propose a novel strategy based on the energy transfer from triplet self&#8208;trapped excitons to Mn2+ dopants in solution&#8208;processed perovskite CsCdCl3. It is found the Mn2+ doped hexagonal phase CsCdCl3 could simultaneously exhibit high emission efficiency (81.5&#8201;%) and long afterglow duration time (150&#8197;s). Besides, the afterglow emission exhibits anti&#8208;thermal quenching from 300 to 400&#8197;K. In&#8208;depth charge&#8208;carrier dynamics studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculation provide unambiguous evidence that carrier detrapping from trap states (mainly induced by Cl vacancy) to localized emission centers ([MnCl6]4&#8722;) is responsible for the afterglow emission with anti&#8208;thermal quenching. Enlightened by the present results, we demonstrate the application of the developed materials for optical storage and logic operation applications.

         <title>Compacting Electric Double Layer Enables Carbon Electrode with Ultrahigh Zn Ion Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrical double layer (EDL) of carbon electrode can be compacted via surface charge modulation strategy to boost Zn ion storage capability. Zn//amino functionalized carbon Zn ion hybrid supercapacitor can deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 255.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 as well as excellent cycling stability.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based cathodes for aqueous zinc ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) typically undergo low Zn ion storage capability due to their electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) energy storage mechanism that is restricted by specific surface area and thickness of electric double layer (EDL). Here, we report a universal surface charge modulation strategy to effectively enhance the capacitance of carbon materials by decreasing the thickness of EDL. Amino groups with lone pair electrons were chosen to increase the surface charge density and enhanced the interaction between carbon electrode and Zn ions, thus effectively compacting the EDL. Consequently, amino functionalized porous carbon based ZHSCs can deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 255.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 along with excellent cycling stability (95.5&#8201;% capacity retention after 50&#8201;000 cycles) in 1&#8197;M ZnCl2 electrolyte. This study demonstrates the feasibility of EDL modified carbon as Zn2+ storage cathode and great prospect for constructing high performance ZHSCs.

         <title>Increasing the Distance of Adjacent Palladium Atoms for Configuration Matching in Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distance between adjacent Pd atoms is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated to be significant for defining the reaction pathways for selective hydrogenation processes exemplified by acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation here. Increasing the distance favors the formation of ethylene while restraining those of byproducts due to the simultaneously promoted C2H4 desorption and destabilized transition state of C2H3* coupling.







Abstract
Precisely tailoring the distance between adjacent metal sites to match adsorption configurations of key species for the targeted reaction pathway is a great challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study on the atomically sites&#8208;tailored pathway in Pd&#8208;catalyzed acetylene hydrogenation, i.e., increasing the distance of adjacent Pd atoms (dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd) for configuration matching in acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation against coupling. dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd is identified as a structural descriptor for describing the competitiveness for reaction pathways, and the increased dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd prefers the semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway due to simultaneously promoted C2H4 desorption and the destabilized transition state of the C2H3* coupling. Spectroscopic, kinetics and electronic structure studies reveal that increasing dPd&#8208;a&#8208;Pd to 3.31&#8197;&#197; delivers superior selectivity and stability due to energy matching and appropriate hybridization of Pd 4d with In 2s and, especially, 2p orbitals.

         <title>Electrical Pulse Induced One&#8208;step Formation of Atomically Dispersed Pt on Oxide Clusters for Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrical pulse approach is employed to obtain dispersed Pt on diverse oxide clusters in one step with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon being the support. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, Pt1&#8722;FeOx/CN enables the zinc&#8208;air batteries to achieve an excellent electrochemical performance at an ultralow temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed sites anchored on small oxide clusters are attractive new catalytic materials.

&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersed sites anchored on small oxide clusters are attractive new catalytic materials.

&lt;/sub&gt;/CN is shown to exhibit high activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half-wave potential of 0.94&#8197;V vs RHE, in contrast to the poor catalytic performance of atomically dispersed Pt on large Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles.

         <title>Umpolung Synthesis of Pyridyl Ethers by BiV&#8208;Mediated O&#8208;Arylation of Pyridones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that sterically&#8208; and electronically&#8208;diverse pyridyl ethers can be accessed via BiV&#8208;mediated C&#8722;O coupling of 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;pyridones with arylboronic acids. Use of a bismacyclic reagent not only confers modularity on our methodology, but also results in highly regioselective O&#8208;arylation that is unprecedented for BiV.







Abstract
We report that O&#8208;selective arylation of 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;pyridones with arylboronic acids is affected by a modular, bismacycle&#8208;based system. The utility of this umpolung approach to pyridyl ethers, which is complementary to conventional methods based on SNAr or cross&#8208;coupling, is demonstrated through the concise synthesis of Ki6783 and picolinafen, and the formal synthesis of cabozantib and golvatinib. Computational investigations reveal that arylation proceeds in a concerted fashion via a 5&#8208;membered transition state. The kinetically&#8208;controlled regioselectivity for O&#8208;arylation&#8212;which is reversed relative to previous BiV&#8208;mediated pyridone arylations&#8212;is attributed primarily to the geometric constraints imposed by the bismacyclic scaffold.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structures of Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Coordination Environment Engineering for Boosting CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three Ni2 dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with electronic structures tailored by the regulation of the coordination environment of Ni atoms, have been prepared for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The optimal Ni2&#8722;N3C4 exhibits the highest performance for the reduction of CO2 to CO, highlighting the significance of the electronic structure for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in DACs.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have emerged as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction owing to the synergistic effect between the binary metal sites. However, rationally modulating the electronic structure of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a great challenge. Herein, we report the electronic structure modulation of three Ni2 DACs (namely, Ni2&#8722;N7, Ni2&#8722;N5C2 and Ni2&#8722;N3C4) by the regulation of the coordination environments around the dual&#8208;atom Ni2 centres. As a result, Ni2&#8722;N3C4 exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction, not only better than the corresponding single&#8208;atom Ni catalyst (Ni&#8722;N2C2), but also higher than Ni2&#8722;N7 and Ni2&#8722;N5C2 DACs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the high electrocatalytic activity of Ni2&#8722;N3C4 for CO2 reduction could be attributed to the electronic structure modulation to the Ni centre and the resulted proper binding energies to COOH* and CO* intermediates.

         <title>Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Dimethyl Carbonate from CO2: Engineering Reactive Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Ceria with Vacancy Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling vacancy clusters on the surface of CeO2 allows construction of solid frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) that mediate CO2 conversion to dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The FLPs promote the production of DMC by lowering the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) barrier (CH3OCOO*&#8594;CH3OCO*+*O).







Abstract
The chemical conversion of CO2 to long&#8208;chain chemicals is considered as a highly attractive method to produce value&#8208;added organics, while the underlying reaction mechanism remains unclear. By constructing surface vacancy&#8208;cluster&#8208;mediated solid frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), the 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economical, efficient chemical conversion of CO2 to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was realized. By taking CeO2 as a model system, we illustrate that FLP sites can efficiently accelerate the coupling and conversion of key intermediates. As demonstrated, CeO2 with rich FLP sites shows improved reaction activity and achieves a high yield of DMC up to 15.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, by means of synchrotron radiation in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier&#8208;transform spectroscopy, combined with density functional theory calculations, the reaction mechanism on the FLP site was investigated systematically and in&#8208;depth, providing pioneering insights into the underlying pathway for CO2 chemical conversion to long&#8208;chain chemicals.

         <title>Genome Mining Enabled by Biosynthetic Characterization Uncovers a Class of Benzoxazolinate&#8208;Containing Natural Products in Diverse Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>

Benzoxazolinate is a rare bis&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that interacts with proteins and DNA. It was found that a putative acyl AMP&#8208;ligase mediates the last cyclization step to afford benzoxazolinate. The enzyme was then used as a probe for genome mining, which led to the discovery of a new class of benzoxazolinate&#8208;containing compounds in diverse bacteria.







Abstract
Benzoxazolinate is a rare bis&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that interacts with proteins and DNA and confers extraordinary bioactivities on natural products, such as C&#8208;1027. However, the biosynthetic gene responsible for the key cyclization step of benzoxazolinate remains unclear. Herein, we show a putative acyl AMP&#8208;ligase responsible for the last cyclization step. We used the enzyme as a probe for genome mining and discovered that the orphan benzobactin gene cluster in entomopathogenic bacteria prevails across Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. It turns out that Pseudomonas chlororaphis produces various benzobactins, whose biosynthesis is highlighted by a synergistic effect of two unclustered genes encoding enzymes on boosting benzobactin production; the formation of non&#8208;proteinogenic 2&#8208;hydroxymethylserine by a serine hydroxymethyltransferase; and the types I and II NRPS architecture for structural diversity. Our findings reveal the biosynthetic potential of a widespread benzobactin gene cluster.

&lt;p&gt;Benzoxazolinate is a rare bis-heterocyclic moiety that interacts with proteins and DNA. It was found that a putative acyl AMP-ligase mediates the last cyclization step to afford benzoxazolinate. The enzyme was then used as a probe for genome mining, which led to the discovery of a new class of benzoxazolinate-containing compounds in diverse bacteria.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzoxazolinate is a rare bis-heterocyclic moiety that interacts with proteins and DNA and confers extraordinary bioactivities on natural products, such as C-1027. However, the biosynthetic gene responsible for the key cyclization step of benzoxazolinate remains unclear. Herein, we show a putative acyl AMP-ligase responsible for the last cyclization step. We used the enzyme as a probe for genome mining and discovered that the orphan benzobactin gene cluster in entomopathogenic bacteria prevails across Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. It turns out that &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas chlororaphis&lt;/i&gt; produces various benzobactins, whose biosynthesis is highlighted by a synergistic effect of two unclustered genes encoding enzymes on boosting benzobactin production; the formation of non-proteinogenic 2-hydroxymethylserine by a serine hydroxymethyltransferase; and the types I and II NRPS architecture for structural diversity. Our findings reveal the biosynthetic potential of a widespread benzobactin gene cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatiotemporally Controlled Formation and Rotation of Magnetic Nanochains In Vivo for Precise Mechanotherapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;mode imaging&#8208;guided cancer mechanotherapy was developed through in situ assembly and spinning of magnetic nanochains. This novel therapeutic modality could be suitable for precise yet effective cancer treatment in local regions.







Abstract
Systemic cancer therapy is always accompanied with toxicity to normal tissue, which has prompted concerted efforts to develop precise treatment strategies. Herein, we firstly develop an approach that enables spatiotemporally controlled formation and rotation of magnetic nanochains in vivo, allowing for precise mechanotherapy of tumor. The nanochain comprised nanocomposites of pheophorbide&#8208;A (PP) modified iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP) and lanthanide&#8208;doped down&#8208;conversion NP (DCNP). In a permanent magnetic field, the nanocomposites would be aligned to form nanochain. Next, MnO2 NPs were subsequently administered to accumulate in tumor as suppliers of Mn2+, which coordinates with PP to immobilize the nanochain. In a rotating magnetic field, the nanochain would rapidly rotate, leading to apoptosis/necrosis of tumor cell. The nanochain showed high T2&#8208;MR and NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging signals, which facilitated guided therapy. The strategy has great potential in practical applications.

         <title>A 2.75&#8197;V ammonium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We bypassed the reduction susceptibility of NH4+ and promoted the NH4+ ion battery toward a record&#8208;breaking operation voltage of 2.75&#8197;V by co&#8208;utilizing the storage of the other significant charge carrier in electrolytes, viz, anions, realizing a high&#8208;voltage metal&#8208;free battery.







Abstract
The popular metal&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs) suffer from environmental and economic issues because of their heavy dependency on nonrenewable metals. Here, we propose a metal&#8208;free ammonium (NH4+)&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery with a record&#8208;breaking operation voltage of 2.75&#8197;V. The working mechanism of this sustainable battery involves the reversible anion (PF6&#8722;) intercalation chemistry in graphite cathode and NH4+ intercalation behavior in PTCDI (3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide) anode. This new battery configuration successfully circumvented the reduction susceptibility of NH4+ and the lack of mature NH4+&#8208;rich cathodes for NH4+ ion batteries (AIBs). The customized organic NH4+ electrolyte endows the graphite||PTCDI full battery with durable longevity (over 1000&#8197;cycles) and a high energy density (200&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). We show that the development of AIBs should be high&#8208;voltage&#8208;oriented while circumventing low operation potential to avoid NH4+ reduction.

         <title>Activating Nitrogen&#8208;doped Graphene Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts in Acidic Electrolytes using Hydrophobic Cavities and Proton&#8208;conductive Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on how to overcome the deactivation of N&#8208;doped graphene catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media based on the mechanistic understanding. Compatible suppression of the hydration of protonated pyridinic&#8208;N (pyri&#8208;NH+) by hydrophobic cavity and the introduction of proton conductivity by proton&#8208;conductive particles made the activity of N&#8208;doped graphenes close to that of Pt catalysts under acidic conditions.







Abstract
Although pyridinic&#8208;nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N) doped graphene is highly active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of fuel cells in alkaline media, the activity critically decreases under acidic conditions. We report on how to prevent the deactivation based on the mechanistic understanding that 
 governs the ORR kinetics. First, we considered that the deactivation is due to the hydration of pyri&#8208;NH+, leading to a lower shift of the redox potential. Introducing the hydrophobic cavity prevented the hydration of pyri&#8208;NH+ but inhibited the proton transport. We then increased proton conductivity in the hydrophobic cavity by introducing SiO2 particles coated with ionic liquid polymer/Nafion&#174; which kept the high onset potentials with an increased current density even in acidic media.

         <title>A Sustainable NH4+ Ion Battery by Electrolyte Engineering</title>

We propose an effective and sustainable strategy for the water hydrogen bond network modulation by adding sucrose into the electrolytes. The sucrose can form sucrose&#8208;water hydrogen bond networks to break the continuous water hydrogen bond network, thereby inhibiting water decomposition. Moreover, the weak hydrogen bond interaction between ammonium and sucrose facilitates ion migration, leading to an improved ionic conductivity.







Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion battery is a promising sustainable energy storage system. However, the side reactions originating from electrolytes (the water decomposition and host material dissolution) preclude its practical applications. Unlike the metal&#8208;based aqueous batteries, the idea of &#8220;ultrahigh concentrated electrolyte&#8221; is not feasible due to the strong hydrolysis of ammonium ions. Therefore, we propose an effective and sustainable strategy for the water hydrogen bond network modulation by adding sucrose into the electrolytes. The sucrose can form sucrose&#8208;water hydrogen bond networks to break the continuous water hydrogen bond network, thereby inhibiting water decomposition significantly. Moreover, the weak hydrogen bond interaction between ammonium and sucrose facilitates rapid ion migration, leading to an improved ionic conductivity. This work presents a new electrolyte modulating strategy for the practical application of aqueous ammonium ion batteries.

The introduced Br&#8722; can prevent the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8221; MnO2 formed during charging and improve the reversibility by chemical&#8208;electrochemical reactions.







Abstract
Mn2+/Mn3+ redox pair has been considered as a promising cathode for high energy density batteries, due to its attractive features of high redox potential, solubility and outstanding kinetics. However, the disproportionation side reaction of Mn3+, which results in accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8221; MnO2 limits its reversibility and further energy density. Herein, a novel catholyte based on mixture of Mn2+ and Br&#8722; was proposed for flow batteries with high energy density and long cycle life. In the design, the &#8220;dead&#8221; MnO2 can be fully discharged via Br&#8722; by a chemical&#8208;electrochemical reaction. Coupled with Cd/Cd2+ as anode, the assembled Bromine&#8208;Manganese flow battery (BMFB) demonstrates a high energy efficiency of 76&#8201;% at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with energy density of 360&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1. The battery assembled with silicotungstic acid as anode could continuously run for over 2000 cycles at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. With high power density, energy density and durability, the BMFB shows great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Multiple Roles of Alkanethiolate&#8208;Ligands in Direct Formation of H2O2 over Pd Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the reaction conditions of direct H2O2 formation over alkylthiolate(RS) decorated Pd, we find that the RS is oxidized yielding RSO2 as the effective ligand. The RSO2 ligand shows superior ability for proton transfer to the intermediate surface species OOH, which accelerates the formation of H2O2. The superior selectivity and yield by thiolate&#8208;decorated Pd as compared to uncoated Pd nanoparticles is confirmed by experiments.







Abstract
Coadsorbed organic species including thiolates can promote direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from H2 and O2 over Pd particles. Here, density functional theory based kinetic modeling, augmented with activity measurements and vibrational spectroscopy are used to provide atomistic understanding of direct H2O2 formation over alkylthiolate(RS) Pd. We find that the RS species are oxidized during reaction conditions yielding RSO2 as the effective ligand. The RSO2 ligand shows superior ability for proton transfer to the intermediate surface species OOH, which accelerates the formation of H2O2. The ligands promote the selectivity also by blocking sites for unselective water formation and by modifying the electronic structure of Pd. The work rationalizes observations of enhanced selectivity of direct H2O2 formation over ligand&#8208;funtionalized Pd nanoparticles and shows that engineering of organic surface modifiers can be used to promote desired hydrogen transfer routes.

A novel poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) with large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system has been successfully designed and synthesized via a condensation polymerization strategy. Its high molecular planarity originating from &#960;&#8208;conjugated PPPA chains results in ultrafast Zn2+ ion diffusion kinetics. Such a planar configuration with reduced energy gap also effectively accelerates intramolecular electron transfer during charge/discharge process.







Abstract
A novel poly(phenazine&#8208;alt&#8208;pyromellitic anhydride) (PPPA) has been successfully designed and synthesized via a condensation polymerization strategy as promising cathode material in organic zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM), FTIR and XPS characterizations verify a reversible Zn2+&#8208;coordination mechanism in our PPPA cathode. Intriguingly, an ultrahigh Zn2+ diffusion coefficient of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 was found in this large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, which is the highest one among all organic cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Theoretical calculations reveal the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated plane in our PPPA sample results in a significant reduction on energy gap, effectively accelerating intramolecular electron transfer during charge/discharge process. Our finding provides insights to achieve high zinc&#8208;ion transport kinetics by a design strategy on planar polymer system.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Carboxylation Enabled by a Chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
An enantioselective carboxylation reaction using CO2 has been demonstrated as efficient for the synthesis of chiral carboxylic acids including profen family anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. The reaction takes place under atmospheric pressure and benefits from mild conditions using nickel&#8208;catalysis in combination with a chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand, namely Me&#8208;Sbpy.







Abstract
In contrast to previous approaches to chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic acids that based on reactions using hazardous gases, pressurized setup and mostly noble metal catalysts, in this work, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed general, efficient and highly enantioselective carboxylation reaction of racemic benzylic (pseudo)halides under mild conditions using atmospheric CO2 has been developed. A unique chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand named Me&#8208;SBpy featuring compact polycyclic skeleton enabled both high reactivity and stereoselectivity. The utility of this method has been demonstrated by synthesis of various chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic acids (30 examples, up to 95&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er), including profen family anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and transformations using the acids as key intermediates. Based on mechanistic experimental results, a plausible catalytic cycle involving Ni&#8208;complex/radical equilibrium and Lewis acid&#8208;assisted CO2 activation has been proposed.

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Blown Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethane Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water is utilized to prepare self&#8208;blown non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane foams by in situ generating the blowing agent (CO2) during the polymer network formation. The partial hydrolysis of one of the comonomers, the cyclic carbonate, generates the blowing agent. The process is facile, versatile, up scalable, uses low cost readily available reagents, can be complete in 30&#8197;minutes and is compatible with existing infrastructures for polymer foaming.







Abstract
For 80&#8197;years, polyisocyanates and polyols were central building blocks for the industrial fabrication of polyurethane (PU) foams. By their partial hydrolysis, isocyanates release CO2 that expands the PU network. Substituting this toxic isocyanate&#8208;based chemistry by a more sustainable variant&#8212;that in situ forms CO2 by hydrolysis of a comonomer&#8212;is urgently needed for producing greener cellular materials. Herein, we report a facile, up&#8208;scalable process, potentially compatible to existing infrastructures, to rapidly prepare water&#8208;induced self&#8208;blown non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane (NIPU) foams. We show that formulations composed of poly(cyclic carbonate)s and polyamines furnish rigid or flexible NIPU foams by partial hydrolysis of cyclic carbonates in the presence of a catalyst. By utilizing readily available low cost starting materials, this simple but robust process gives access to greener PU foams, expectedly responding to the sustainability demands of many sectors.

Substituting this toxic isocyanate-based chemistry by a more sustainable variant&#8212;that in situ forms CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by hydrolysis of a comonomer&#8212;is urgently needed for producing greener cellular materials. Herein, we report a facile, up-scalable process, potentially compatible to existing infrastructures, to rapidly prepare water-induced self-blown non-isocyanate polyurethane (NIPU) foams. We show that formulations composed of poly(cyclic carbonate)s and polyamines furnish rigid or flexible NIPU foams by partial hydrolysis of cyclic carbonates in the presence of a catalyst. By utilizing readily available low cost starting materials, this simple but robust process gives access to greener PU foams, expectedly responding to the sustainability demands of many sectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Catalyst&#8208;Solvent Interactions in Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Sulfur Reduction Electrocatalysis for Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalyst&#8208;solvent interaction is found to determine the lean&#8208;electrolyte sulfur reduction activity and cyclic stability for Li&#8722;S batteries. This interaction is confirmed via a series of synchrotron&#8208;based analysis, in situ spectroscopy and theoretical computations. Benefitting from the strong interaction between solvent and cobalt catalyst, the Li&#8722;S battery achieves stable cycling and high capacity retention under lean electrolyte conditions.







Abstract
Efficient catalyst design is important for lean&#8208;electrolyte sulfur reduction in Li&#8722;S batteries. However, most of the reported catalysts were focused on catalyst&#8208;polysulfide interactions, and generally exhibit high activity only with a large excess of electrolyte. Herein, we proposed a general rule to boost lean&#8208;electrolyte sulfur reduction by controlling the catalyst&#8208;solvent interactions. As evidenced by synchrotron&#8208;based analysis, in situ spectroscopy and theoretical computations, strong catalyst&#8208;solvent interaction greatly enhances the lean&#8208;electrolyte catalytic activity and battery stability. Benefitting from the strong interaction between solvent and cobalt catalyst, the Li&#8722;S battery achieves stable cycling with only 0.22&#8201;% capacity decay per cycle with a low electrolyte/sulfur mass ratio of 4.2. The lean&#8208;electrolyte battery delivers 79&#8201;% capacity retention compared with the battery with flooded electrolyte, which is the highest among the reported lean&#8208;electrolyte Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Fast Screening for Copper&#8208;Based Bimetallic Electrocatalysts: Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to C2+ Products on Magnesium&#8208;Modified Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using an automatic fast screening platform, a magnesium&#8208;modified copper catalyst has been discovered to be very efficient for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to C2+ compounds. This catalyst, achieving 80&#8201;% C2+ Faradaic efficiency at a current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, stands out from 109 Cu&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts evaluated within only 55&#8197;hours. The modification by magnesium enhances the activation of CO2 and stabilizes Cu+ to facilitate the CO adsorption and C&#8722;C coupling.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 (CO2RR) into high value&#8208;added chemicals is an attractive route to achieve carbon neutrality. However, the development of an efficient catalyst for CO2RR is still largely by trial&#8208;and&#8208;error and is very time&#8208;consuming. Herein, we built an electrocatalyst testing platform featuring a home&#8208;built automatic flow cell to accelerate the discovery of efficient catalysts. A fast screening of 109 Cu&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts in only 55&#8197;h identifies Mg combined with Cu as the best electrocatalyst for CO2 to C2+ products. The thus designed Mg&#8722;Cu catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products up to 80&#8201;% with a current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.77&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Systematic experiments with in situ spectroelectrochemistry analyses show that Mg2+ species stabilize Cu+ sites during CO2RR and promote the CO2 activation, thus enhancing the *CO coverage to promote C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>An Enzymatically Gated Catalytic Hairpin Assembly Delivered by Lipid Nanoparticles for the Tumor&#8208;Specific Activation of Signal Amplification in miRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lipid nanoparticles&#8208;mediated, enzyme&#8208;triggered signal amplification strategy was proposed for precise miRNA imaging both in vitro and in vivo. The combination of switchable catalytic hairpin assembly with controlled in vivo delivery enables tumor&#8208;specific signal amplification with reduced off&#8208;tumor signal.







Abstract
MicroRNA (miRNA) imaging in disease sites is vital to elucidate their role in cancer progression. However, limited tumor specificity remains a major barrier for traditional amplification approaches due to associated background signal leakage. Here, we report a generalizable approach via the combination of enzymatically triggered catalytic hairpin assembly with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)&#8208;based delivery strategy for tumor&#8208;specific activation of signal amplification and therefore sensitive miRNA imaging. The signal amplification is established via engineering of traditional catalytic hairpin assembly with enzymatically activated motifs to achieve triggable miRNA imaging in cancer cells. Furthermore, by the introduction of LNPs to combat biological barriers, we demonstrate that the system enables amplified miRNA imaging in vivo with reduced off&#8208;tumor signal, leading to enhanced tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background contrast compared with traditional methods. This approach that relies on specific triggers and controlled delivery to distinguish miRNA in cancer cells from normal cells should be useful in tumor diagnosis.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Excitonic Networks Directed by DNA Templates as an Efficient Model Light&#8208;Harvesting and Energy Transfer System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional excitonic networks were assembled using wireframe DNA nanostructures as templates to direct the formation of cyanine dye aggregates. The interconnected networks with programmable sizes and geometries present strongly coupled excitonic features and have been shown to mediate long&#8208;range exciton migration up to 100&#215;100&#8197;nm for efficient photon capture and energy transfer.







Abstract
Photosynthetic organisms organize discrete light&#8208;harvesting complexes into large&#8208;scale networks to facilitate efficient light collection and utilization. Inspired by nature, herein, synthetic DNA templates were used to direct the formation of dye aggregates with a cyanine dye, K21, into discrete branched photonic complexes, and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) excitonic networks. The DNA templates ranged from four&#8208;arm DNA tiles, &#8776;10&#8197;nm in each arm, to 2D wireframe DNA origami nanostructures with different geometries and varying dimensions up to 100&#215;100&#8197;nm. These DNA&#8208;templated dye aggregates presented strongly coupled spectral features and delocalized exciton characteristics, enabling efficient photon collection and energy transfer. Compared to the discrete branched photonic systems templated on individual DNA tiles, the interconnected excitonic networks showed approximately a 2&#8208;fold increase in energy transfer efficiency. This bottom&#8208;up assembly strategy paves the way to create 2D excitonic systems with complex geometries and engineered energy pathways.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reconstructed Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Heterojunction for Switchable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

A self&#8208;reconstructed metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) heterojunction is constructed via redox electrochemistry and topology&#8208;guided strategy, and it exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and robust durability.







Abstract
Designing metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based catalysts with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and robust durability simultaneously is highly required yet very challenging due to the limited intrinsic activity and their elusive evolution under harsh OER conditions. Herein, a steady self&#8208;reconstructed MOF heterojunction is constructed via redox electrochemistry and topology&#8208;guided strategy. Thanks to the inhibiting effect from hydrogen bonds of Ni&#8208;BDC&#8208;1 (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid), the obatained MOF heterojunction shows greatly improved OER activity with low overpotential of 225&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, relative to the totally reconstructed Ni&#8208;BDC&#8208;3 (332&#8197;mV). Density function theory calculations reveal that the formed built&#8208;in electric field in the MOF heterojunction remarkably optimizes the ad/desorption free energy of active Ni sites. Moreover, such MOF heterojunction shows superior durability attributed to the shielding effect of the surface&#8208;evolved NiOOH coating.

         <title>Optimal Dihedral Angle in Twisted Donor&#8211;Acceptor Organic Emitters for Maximized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physical origin of the optimal dihedral angle of &#8776;80&#176; in twisted donor&#8211;acceptor organic emitters for maximized TADF is deduced and an effective design strategy for efficient TADF emitters is proposed, which provides help for the molecular design and screening of high&#8208;efficiency TADF materials.







Abstract
The twisted donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) organic formwork with a large dihedral angle (&#952;DA) is usually adopted to narrow the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap for obtaining excellent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, the dependence of overall TADF properties on &#952;DA has not been systematically investigated to this day. Taking new designed CzBP, CzBP&#8208;1M and CzBP&#8208;2M via introducing methyl as investigated models, it is found that (i) with increasing &#952;DA, the charge transfer component in S1 is larger than that in T1 in varying degrees, leading to non&#8208;monotonic spin&#8208;orbit couplings; (ii) the electron&#8208;vibration couplings between S1 and T1 states become the largest when &#952;DA approaching 80&#176;, facilitating phonon&#8208;driven up&#8208;conversion; (iii) the overall TADF rate reaches a peak at &#952;DA&#8776;80&#176;. By this, the TADF on/off switching is realized via methyl moiety for regulating &#952;DA from theoretical prediction to experimental confirmation. Importantly, the &#952;DA near 80&#176; would be a good descriptor for screening excellent D&#8208;A type TADF emitters.

         <title>A Carboranyl Electrolyte Enabling Highly Reversible Sodium Metal Anodes via a &#8220;Fluorine&#8208;Free&#8221; SEI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the pairing of a novel non&#8208;fluorine containing carboranyl electrolyte with pure sodium metal anodes which yields highly reversible, dendrite&#8208;free cell cycling. Solid electrolyte interphase characterization and investigation of sodium metal deposition/stripping processes suggests the electrolyte presented herein is a reliable candidate to enable anode&#8208;free cells.







Abstract
Realization of practical sodium metal batteries (SMBs) is hindered due to lack of compatible electrolyte components, dendrite propagation, and poor understanding of anodic interphasial chemistries. Chemically robust liquid electrolytes that facilitate both favorable sodium metal deposition and a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) are ideal to enable sodium metal and anode&#8208;free cells. Herein we present advanced characterization of a novel fluorine&#8208;free electrolyte utilizing the [HCB11H11]1&#8722; anion. Symmetrical Na cells operated with this electrolyte exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of 0.032&#8197;V at a current density of 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high coulombic efficiency of 99.5&#8201;% in half&#8208;cell configurations. Surface characterization of electrodes post&#8208;operation reveals the absence of dendritic sodium nucleation and a surprisingly stable fluorine&#8208;free SEI. Furthermore, weak ion&#8208;pairing is identified as key towards the successful development of fluorine&#8208;free sodium electrolytes.

         <title>Thiazole Imide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Acceptor Homopolymer with Branched Ethylene Glycol Side Chains for Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>

Acceptor&#8208;acceptor type homopolymer PDTzTI&#8208;TEG bearing ethylene glycol side chains is synthesized and the doped PDTzTI&#8208;TEG exhibits n&#8208;type conductivity up to 34&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 15.7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. These values are far superior to those of analogous acceptor&#8208;donor type copolymers, indicating that PDTzTI&#8208;TEG is a promising material for organic thermoelectrics.







Abstract
n&#8208;Type semiconducting polymers with high thermoelectric performance remain challenging due to the scarcity of molecular design strategy, limiting their applications in organic thermoelectric (OTE) devices. Herein, we provide a new approach to enhance the OTE performance of n&#8208;doped polymers by introducing acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;A) type backbone bearing branched ethylene glycol (EG) side chains. When doped with 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI), the A&#8208;A homopolymer PDTzTI&#8208;TEG exhibits n&#8208;type electrical conductivity (&#963;) up to 34&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor value of 15.7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. The OTE performance of PDTzTI&#8208;TEG is far greater than that of homopolymer PBTI&#8208;TEG (&#963;=0.27&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), indicating that introducing electron&#8208;deficient thiazole units in the backbone further improves the n&#8208;doping efficiency. These results demonstrate that developing A&#8208;A type polymers with EG side chains is an effective strategy to enhance n&#8208;type OTE performance.

         <title>Minimum Information Standards in Chemistry: A Call for Better Research Data Management Practices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic lab notebooks (ELN) and laboratory information systems (LIMS) allow data management and simplification of research and publication. Minimum standards for information management are urgently needed to support chemists with the reporting of their data in a structured manner. The time is ripe to liberate data and make it findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) for all.







Abstract
Research data management (RDM) is needed to assist experimental advances and data collection in the chemical sciences. Many funders require RDM because experiments are often paid for by taxpayers and the resulting data should be deposited sustainably for posterity. However, paper notebooks are still common in laboratories and research data is often stored in proprietary and/or dead&#8208;end file formats without experimental context. Data must mature beyond a mere supplement to a research paper. Electronic lab notebooks (ELN) and laboratory information management systems (LIMS) allow researchers to manage data better and they simplify research and publication. Thus, an agreement is needed on minimum information standards for data handling to support structured approaches to data reporting. As digitalization becomes part of curricular teaching, future generations of digital native chemists will embrace RDM and ELN as an organic part of their research.

&lt;p&gt;Electronic lab notebooks (ELN) and laboratory information systems (LIMS) allow data management and simplification of research and publication. Minimum standards for information management are urgently needed to support chemists with the reporting of their data in a structured manner. The time is ripe to liberate data and make it findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) for all.

State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nickel&#8211;iron oxyhydroxide catalysts suffer from loss of iron under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential. In their Research Article (e202214541), Jaeyoung Lee and co&#8208;workers develop a stable OER electrocatalyst by adding tetraphenylporphyrin protective layers. They accelerate the redeposition of eluted iron onto the electrocatalyst by forming a nonpolar&#8211;polar interface. This not only prolongs the iron population but also the lifetime of the electrocatalyst.

The N&#8722;H bond of NH3 can be cleaved within cavitation bubbles, generated by ultrasonic irradiation at a high frequency, leading to the in&#8197;situ formation of a diimide, which then induces the hydrogenation of alkenes, as reported by Fran&#231;ois J&#233;r&#244;me and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202212719). Advantageously, this technique does not involve any transition metal and releases N2 as a sole coproduct.

         <title>Temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;Responsive Polymeric Photocatalysts for Enhanced Control and Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive photocatalytic materials have emerged that are not only able to efficiently catalyze reactions but can use external stimuli to modulate their physical properties. This technique has been used to control the reactivity of a photocatalytic material turning it on/off. Moreover, photocatalytic materials have been synthesized which can be easily recycled with the use of an external trigger.







Abstract
The emergence of heterogeneous photocatalysis has facilitated redox reactions with high efficiency, without compromising the recyclability of the photocatalyst. Recently, stimuli&#8208;responsive heterogeneous photocatalytic materials have emerged as a powerful synthetic tool, with simple and rapid recovery, as well as an enhanced dynamic control over reactions. Stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers are often inexpensive and easy to produce. They can be switched from an active &#8220;on&#8221; state to an inert &#8220;off&#8221; state in response to external stimuli, allowing the production of photocatalyst with adaptability, recyclability, and orthogonal control on different chemical reactions. Despite this versatility, the application of artificial smart material in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis has not yet been maximized. In this Minireview, we will examine the recent developments of this emerging class of stimuli&#8208;responsive heterogeneous photocatalytic systems. We will discuss the synthesis route of appending photoactive components into different triggerable systems and, in particular, the controlled activation and recovery of the materials.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of heterogeneous photocatalysis has facilitated redox reactions with high efficiency, without compromising the recyclability of the photocatalyst. Recently, stimuli-responsive heterogeneous photocatalytic materials have emerged as a powerful synthetic tool, with simple and rapid recovery, as well as an enhanced dynamic control over reactions. Stimuli-responsive polymers are often inexpensive and easy to produce. They can be switched from an active &#8220;on&#8221; state to an inert &#8220;off&#8221; state in response to external stimuli, allowing the production of photocatalyst with adaptability, recyclability, and orthogonal control on different chemical reactions. Despite this versatility, the application of artificial smart material in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis has not yet been maximized. In this Minireview, we will examine the recent developments of this emerging class of stimuli-responsive heterogeneous photocatalytic systems. We will discuss the synthesis route of appending photoactive components into different triggerable systems and, in particular, the controlled activation and recovery of the materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8211;Air Batteries: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using light to drive slow cathode kinetics has been explored as a promising solution to unlock the high theoretical specific energy of metal&#8211;air batteries. This Review summarizes the current understanding of light&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries, discusses the significant influence of light on battery systems, and identifies existing gaps and future priorities.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;air batteries are considered one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices owing to their ultrahigh theoretical specific energy. However, sluggish cathode kinetics (O2 and CO2 reduction/evolution) result in large overpotentials and low round&#8208;trip efficiencies which seriously hinder their practical applications. Utilizing light to drive slow cathode processes has increasingly becoming a promising solution to this issue. Considering the rapid development and emerging issues of this field, this Review summarizes the current understanding of light&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries in terms of configurations and mechanisms, provides general design strategies and specific examples of photocathodes, systematically discusses the influence of light on batteries, and finally identifies existing gaps and future priorities for the development of practical light&#8208;assisted metal&#8211;air batteries.

Structurally well&#8208;defined gold nanoclusters are promising catalysts, and their molecular nature facilitates the design and controlled synthesis of cluster catalysts. This Minireview summarizes the strategies for constructing active sites and the effects of the ligands on cluster catalysis. The challenges and key future issues regarding catalytic applications of gold nanoclusters are discussed.







Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters provide great opportunities to explore the relationship between the structure and properties of nanogold catalysts. A nanocluster consists of a metal core and a surface ligand shell, and both the core and shell have significant effects on the catalytic properties. Thanks to their precise structures, the active metal site of the clusters can be readily identified and the effects of ligands on catalysis can be disclosed. In this Minireview, we summarize recent advances in catalytic research of gold nanoclusters, emphasizing four strategies for constructing open metal sites, including by post&#8208;treatment, the bulky ligands strategy, the surface geometric mismatch method, and heteroatom doping procedures. We also discuss the effects of ligands on the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of gold cluster catalysts. Finally, we present future challenges relating to gold cluster catalysis.

         <title>Progress in Hydrogen Production Coupled with Electrochemical Oxidation of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically more favorable oxidation reactions of small molecules are widely implemented to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to achieve the highly efficient production of hydrogen. This Minireview systematically surveys the current progress in electro&#8208;oxidation reactions involving diverse molecules, different electrolytes, and novel mechanisms. The challenges and research directions of this area are highlighted.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxidation of small molecules to generate value&#8208;added products has gained enormous interest in recent years because of the advantages of benign operation conditions, high conversion efficiency and selectivity, the absence of external oxidizing agents, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Coupling the electrochemical oxidation of small molecules to replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode in an electrolyzer would simultaneously realize the generation of high&#8208;value chemicals or pollutant degradation and the highly efficient production of hydrogen. This Minireview presents an introduction on small&#8208;molecule choice and design strategies of electrocatalysts as well as recent breakthroughs achieved in the highly efficient production of hydrogen. Finally, challenges and future orientations are highlighted.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Hydrosilylation to Access Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented (SiMOS&#8208;Phos) ligand&#8208;controlled Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of &#8220;silicon&#8208;centered&#8221; racemic hydrosilanes was developed for the highly efficient and enantioselective construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers of benzosiloles (up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 er). This achievement was obtained by using an original synthetic strategy involving dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations.







Abstract
Strategies on the construction of enantiomerically pure silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanes generally relies on desymmetrization of prochiral and symmetric substrates. However, dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations of organosilicon compounds have remained underdeveloped and unforeseen owing to a lack of an effective method for deracemization of the static silicon stereocenters. Here we report the first Rh&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric intramolecular hydrosilylation (DyKAH) with &#8220;silicon&#8208;centered&#8221; racemic hydrosilanes that enables the facile preparation of silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzosiloles in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The special rhodium catalyst controlled by non&#8208;diastereopure&#8208;type mixed phosphine&#8208;phosphoramidite ligand with axial chirality and multiple stereocenters can induce enantioselectivity efficiently in this novel DyKAH reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the amide moiety in chiral ligand plays important role in facilitating the SN2 substitution of chloride ion to realize the chiral inversion of silicon center.

         <title>Thermally Stable Polymer&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Safe Lithium Metal Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high reactivity of lithium metal against electrolytes is tamed by introducing a polymer&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase in situ on the lithium anode. The fluorine&#8208;rich and hydrogen&#8208;free polymer provides both high thermal and electrochemical stability, enhancing the safety and lifespan of lithium&#8208;LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cells. The &#8220;ignition&#8221; temperature of the battery can be increased to 338.0&#8201;&#176;C benefiting from excellent electrolyte design.







Abstract
Serious safety risks caused by the high reactivity of lithium metal against electrolytes severely hamper the practicability of lithium metal batteries. By introducing unique polymerization site and more fluoride substitution, we built an in situ formed polymer&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase upon lithium anode to improve battery safety. The fluorine&#8208;rich and hydrogen&#8208;free polymer exhibits high thermal stability, which effectively reduces the continuous exothermic reaction between electrolyte and anode/cathode. As a result, the critical temperature for thermal safety of 1.0&#8197;Ah lithium&#8208;LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cell can be increased from 143.2&#8201;&#176;C to 174.2&#8201;&#176;C. The more dangerous &#8220;ignition&#8221; point of lithium metal batteries, the starting temperature of battery thermal runaway, has been dramatically raised from 240.0&#8201;&#176;C to 338.0&#8201;&#176;C. This work affords novel strategies upon electrolyte design, aiming to pave the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.

As a result, the critical temperature for thermal safety of 1.0&#8197;Ah lithium-LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell can be increased from 143.2&#8201;&#176;C to 174.2&#8201;&#176;C. The more dangerous &#8220;ignition&#8221; point of lithium metal batteries, the starting temperature of battery thermal runaway, has been dramatically raised from 240.0&#8201;&#176;C to 338.0&#8201;&#176;C. This work affords novel strategies upon electrolyte design, aiming to pave the way for high-energy-density and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Lead&#8208;Tin Bromide with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid lead&#8208;tin bromides, (RR/SS&#8208;C6N2H16)2Pb0.968Sn0.032Br6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, shows not only strong self&#8208;trapped exciton emissions with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) but also intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals with a dissymmetry factor glum of &#177;3.0&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides with perfect host&#8208;guest structures are promising candidates to construct circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials. However, it still remains challenging to obtain 0D chiral metal halides with simultaneously strong CPL and high photoluminescence quantum yield. Here, a new enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid lead&#8208;tin bromides, (RR/SS&#8208;C6N2H16)2Pb0.968Sn0.032Br6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O), is reported. The R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O compounds not only show intriguing self&#8208;trapped exciton emissions with near&#8208;unity quantum yield, but also present intense CPL with a dissymmetry factor glum of &#177;3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. Such CPL activities originate from the asymmetric [SnBr6]4&#8722; luminophores in R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, due to the induced structural chirality by the organic ligands via N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, CPL emissions with tunable colors from R/S&#8208;PbSnBr&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and dehydrated compounds are reversibly observed, which extends their chiroptical applications.

         <title>Sonochemically&#8208;Induced Reduction of Alkenes to Alkanes with Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonia is used as a hydrogen source for the reduction of alkenes to alkanes. The originality stems from the use of cavitation bubbles that act as &#8220;microreactors&#8221; to break the N&#8722;H bond of NH3. As a result, this protocol does not involve any catalyst and it releases nitrogen (and partly hydrogen) as a sole co&#8208;product.







Abstract
With the progressive defossilization of our industry, hydrogen (H2) has been identified as a central molecule to store renewable electricity. In this context, ammonia (NH3) is now rapidly emerging as a promising hydrogen carrier for the future. This game change indirectly impacts the field of fine chemistry where hydrogenation reactions are widely deployed. In particular, the possibility of performing hydrogenation reactions using ammonia directly instead of hydrogen has become highly desirable but it remains a very difficult scientific task, which we address in this communication. Here we show that the N&#8722;H bond of NH3 can be cleaved within cavitation bubbles, generated by ultrasonic irradiation at a high frequency, leading to the in situ formation of a diimide, which then induces the hydrogenation of alkenes. Advantageously, this work does not involve any transition metal and releases N2 as a sole co&#8208;product.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Cyanoboration of Internal Allenes by Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent cyanoboration of internal allenes with B2pin2 and NCTS derivatives has been developed. MeOH was identified as the necessary additive for the regeneration of LCu&#8208;Bpin species. Computational studies revealed that the copper&#8208;mediated allylic cyanation is the regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step, while the MeOH&#8208;assisted transmetalation with B2pin2 is the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent cyanoboration of internal allenes with B2pin2 (bis(pinacolato)diboron) and NCTS (N&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;p&#8208;toluenesulfonamide) derivatives is reported. The &#946;,&#947;&#8208; and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;cyanoborylated products were synthesized with high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. Computational studies revealed that nucleophilic addition of allylcopper or related intermediates on cyanation reagent is the regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step, while transmetalation with B2pin2 is the rate&#8208;determining step. The nucleophilic addition step proceeds via inner&#8208;sphere mechanism in the CuI/P(o&#8208;tol)3 and CuI/Xantphos (P(o&#8208;tol)3=tris(o&#8208;methylphenyl)phosphine, Xantphos=4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) catalytic systems and via outer&#8208;sphere mechanism in the CuII/Xantphos catalytic system, respectively.

         <title>The Single&#8208;Component Flavin Reductase/Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenase AetF is a Versatile Catalyst for Selective Bromination and Iodination of Arenes and Olefins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single component flavin reductase/flavin dependent halogenase AetF catalyzes halogenation of a diverse set of substrates. High site selectivity, activity on relatively unactivated substrates, and high enantioselectivity for atroposelective bromination and bromolactonization was demonstrated. Site&#8208;selective iodination and enantioselective cycloiodoetherification was also possible using AetF.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) natively catalyze selective halogenation of electron rich aromatic and enolate groups. Nearly all FDHs reported to date require a separate flavin reductase to supply them with FADH2, which complicates biocatalysis applications. In this study, we establish that the single component flavin reductase/flavin dependent halogenase AetF catalyzes halogenation of a diverse set of substrates using a commercially available glucose dehydrogenase to drive its halogenase activity. High site selectivity, activity on relatively unactivated substrates, and high enantioselectivity for atroposelective bromination and bromolactonization was demonstrated. Site&#8208;selective iodination and enantioselective cycloiodoetherification was also possible using AetF. The substrate and reaction scope of AetF suggest that it has the potential to greatly improve the utility of biocatalytic halogenation.

Nearly all FDHs reported to date require a separate flavin reductase to supply them with FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which complicates biocatalysis applications. In this study, we establish that the single component flavin reductase/flavin dependent halogenase AetF catalyzes halogenation of a diverse set of substrates using a commercially available glucose dehydrogenase to drive its halogenase activity. High site selectivity, activity on relatively unactivated substrates, and high enantioselectivity for atroposelective bromination and bromolactonization was demonstrated. Site-selective iodination and enantioselective cycloiodoetherification was also possible using AetF. The substrate and reaction scope of AetF suggest that it has the potential to greatly improve the utility of biocatalytic halogenation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Expanded Carbazoles as Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design strategy is introduced for carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM) to facilitate dense assembly and tune the indium tinoxide (ITO) workfunction. Through asymmetric or helical &#960;&#8208;expansion, CbzPh and CbzNaph are obtained as efficient hole&#8208;selective layers (HSL) for inverted perovskite solar cells (PSC). Larger molecular dipoles in CbzPh and CbzNaph can better tune the ITO workfunction, whereas the stronger &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions ensure more ordered and denser SAM assembly.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;derived self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are promising hole&#8208;selective materials for inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, they often possess small dipoles which prohibit them from effectively modulating the workfunction of ITO substrate, limiting the PSC photovoltage. Moreover, their properties can be drastically affected by even subtle structural modifications, undermining the final PSC performance. Here, we designed two carbazole&#8208;derived SAMs, CbzPh and CbzNaph through asymmetric or helical &#960;&#8208;expansion for improved molecular dipole moment and strengthened &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. The helical &#960;&#8208;expanded CbzNaph has the largest dipole, forming densely packed and ordered monolayer, facilitated by the highly ordered assembly observed in its &#960;&#8208;scaffold's single crystal. These synergistically modulate the perovskite crystallization atop and tune the ITO workfunction. Consequently, the champion PSC employing CbzNaph showed an excellent 24.1&#8201;% efficiency and improved stability.

         <title>Synthesis of Alternating Polyisocyanate Copolymers by Anionic Polymerization for Mimicking Amphiphilic Helical Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural similarity is demonstrated (see picture) between amphiphilic helical peptides (left) and amphiphilic alternating polyisocyanate copolymer (right). Phase segregation along the long axis is shown in orange and blue, represented by a Janus portrait. Hydrophobic moieties are denoted by orange while hydrophilic cations are denoted by blue with a plus sign.







Abstract
The amphiphilic conformation of &#945;&#8208;helical peptides has important biological functions, such as ion transport, antifreeze, and innate immunity, which can be mimicked by alternating polyisocyanate copolymers. We synthesized poly(allyl isocyanate&#8208;alt&#8208;(S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzyl isocyanate (P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)) and ammonium&#8208;containing P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC) (N&#8208;P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)), ensuring the amphiphilic helical conformation. The benzyl group of SMBIC plays an important role in alternating copolymerization with its steric and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects, while AIC provides an alkene group capable of introducing a customized functional group. The P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC) with predominantly alternating sequence was acquired at fSMBIC/fAIC=8 with a controlled molecular weight and narrow dispersity. N&#8208;P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC)s were synthesized from thiol&#8208;ene radical addition with P(AIC&#8208;alt&#8208;SMBIC).

         <dc:description>
A fused benzo&#8208;aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;[5&#8208;6&#8208;5] tetracycle was concisely constructed via Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization with readily available anilines and 3&#8208;butenoic acid. Five chemical bonds and a fused tricycle were formed in one step. This strategy offers an option for synthesizing the common core of natural products martinelline, martinellic acid, seneciobipyrrolidine and incargranine&#8197;B. Experimental and computational studies shed light on the mechanism.







Abstract
A novel and expedient cascade strategy has been demonstrated for the synthesis of fused benzo&#8208;aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;[5&#8208;6&#8208;5] tetracycles in high yields and diastereoselectivities (up to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). The strategy was fulfilled through palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative convergent assembly of functionally divergent anilines and 3&#8208;butenoic acid with five chemical bonds constructed. Coupled with control experiments and deuterium labelled studies, DFT calculations were performed for the proposed mechanism. The utility of the illustrated strategy is emphasized by gram&#8208;scale syntheses, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and the transformation to a key core of natural products such as martinellic acid and seneciobipyrrolidine.

         <title>A Flexible Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Constructed from a Tetrabenzaldehyde with a Carbazole N&#8722;H Binding Site for the Highly Selective Recognition and Separation of Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining tetrabenzaldeyde for hydrogen bonding interactions, a carbazole N&#8722;H site for the specific recognition of small molecules, and a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A building molecule for solvent&#8208;dependent chromic properties has led to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;2. This combination has enabled the separation of an acetone/methanol mixture to be readily visualized.







Abstract
Rational design of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with multiple functionalities is highly sought after but challenging. Herein, we report a multifunctional HOF (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;2) built from 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzaldehyde molecule with tetrabenzaldeyde for their H bonding interactions and carbazole N&#8722;H site for its specific recognition of small molecules. The Lewis acid N&#8722;H sites allow HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;2 facilely separate acetone from its mixture with another solvent like methanol with smaller pKa value. The donor (D)&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A) aromatic nature of the organic building molecule endows this HOF with solvent dependent luminescent/chromic properties, so the column acetone/methanol separation on HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;2 can be readily visualized.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Uranium Complexes with a Pendant Borane Lewis Acid and 1,2&#8208;Insertion of CO into a U&#8722;N Bond</title>

         <dc:description>
Reactions between the highly strained uranacycle I with various boranes afford unprecedented uranium complexes bearing either a pendant borate or a pendant borane Lewis acid. The latter promotes the 1,2&#8208;insertion of CO into a UIV&#8208;N bond.







Abstract
In this contribution, we illustrate uranium complexes bearing a pendant borate (i.e. 1 and 2) or a pendant borane (i.e. 3 and 4) moiety via reaction of the highly strained uranacycle I with various 3&#8208;coordinate boranes. Complexes 3 and 4 represent the first examples of uranium complexes with a pendant borane Lewis acid. Moreover, complex 3 was capable of activation of CO, delivering a new CO activation mode, and an abnormal CO 1,2&#8208;insertion pathway into a U&#8722;N bond. The importance of the pendant borane moiety was confirmed by the controlled experiments.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Michael Acceptors to Penetrate Cells: Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake with Tetrel&#8208;Centered Exchange Cascades, Assisted by Halogen&#8208;Bonding Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduced as the first explicitly tetrel&#8208;centered cascade exchangers, Michael acceptors are shown to enable and inhibit thiol&#8208;mediated uptake, generate distinct patterns in heatmaps to decode uptake circuitry, integrate novel halogen&#8208;bonding switches, deliver proteins to the cytosol, and break, as dimers, records for uptake inhibition related to drug discovery.







Abstract
Chalcogen&#8208;centered cascade exchange chemistry is increasingly understood to account for thiol&#8208;mediated uptake, that is, the ability of reversibly thiol&#8208;reactive agents to penetrate cells. Here, reversible Michael acceptors are shown to enable and inhibit thiol&#8208;mediated uptake, including the cytosolic delivery of proteins. Dynamic cyano&#8208;cinnamate dimers rival the best chalcogen&#8208;centered inhibitors. Patterns generated in inhibition heatmaps reveal contributions from halogen&#8208;bonding switches that occur independent from the thyroid transporter MCT8. The uniqueness of these patterns supports that the entry of tetrel&#8208;centered exchangers into cells differs from chalcogen&#8208;centered systems. These results expand the chemical space of thiol&#8208;mediated uptake and support the existence of a universal exchange network to bring matter into cells, abiding to be decoded for drug delivery and drug discovery in the broadest sense.

         <title>On&#8208;off&#8208;on Control of Molecular Inversion Symmetry via Multi&#8208;stage Protonation: Elucidating Vibronic Laporte Rule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Laporte selection rule dictates that inversion&#8208;symmetric molecules have alternately forbidden one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon electronic transitions, although in reality, vibronic interactions often interfere with applying this principle. Using single&#8208; and double&#8208;protonation to break and reconstitute inversion symmetry of a single chromophore, we can model these vibronic interactions, and demonstrate two&#8208;photon absorption switching via the Laporte rule.







Abstract
The Laporte rule dictates that one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption spectra of inversion&#8208;symmetric molecules should display alternatively forbidden electronic transitions; however, for organic fluorophores, drawing clear distinction between the symmetric&#8208; and non&#8208;inversion symmetric two&#8208;photon spectra is often obscured due to prevalent vibronic interactions. We take advantage of consecutive single&#8208; and double&#8208;protonation to break and then reconstitute inversion symmetry in a nominally symmetric diketopyrrolopyrrole, causing large changes in two&#8208;photon absorption. By performing detailed one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon titration experiments, with supporting quantum&#8208;chemical model calculations, we explain how certain low&#8208;frequency vibrational modes may lead to apparent deviations from the strict Laporte rule. As a result, the system may be indeed considered as an on&#8208;off&#8208;on inversion symmetry switch, opening new avenues for two&#8208;photon sensing applications.

         <title>Hydrogen Drives Part of the Reverse Krebs Cycle under Metal or Meteorite Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen is a geological reducing agent that powers the metabolisms of modern organisms and potentially also powered the metabolism of the last universal common ancestor to all extant life. It is shown that catalytic amounts of transition metals or small amounts of powdered meteorites allow hydrogen to drive a key sequence of the reverse Krebs cycle under mild aqueous non&#8208;enzymatic conditions potentially relevant to the emergence of metabolic networks.







Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) is a geological source of reducing electrons that is thought to have powered the metabolism of the last universal common ancestor to all extant life, and that is still metabolized by various modern organisms. It has been suggested that H2 drove a geochemical analogue of some or all of the reverse Krebs cycle at the emergence of the metabolic network, catalyzed by metals, but this has yet to be demonstrated experimentally. Herein, we show that three consecutive steps of the reverse Krebs cycle, converting oxaloacetate into succinate, can be driven without enzymes and in one&#8208;pot by H2 as the reducing agent under mild conditions compatible with biological chemistry. Low catalytic amounts of nickel (10&#8211;20&#8197;mol&#8201;%) or platinum group metals (0.1&#8211;1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) or even small amounts of ground meteorites were found to promote the reductive chemistry at temperatures between 5 and 60&#8201;&#176;C and over a wide pH range, including pH&#8197;7. These results lend additional support to the hypothesis that geologically produced hydrogen and metal catalysts could have initiated early metabolic networks.

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Alkene Metathesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 51, December 19, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of alkene metathesis to catalytically control stereogenic axes by traceless arene formation is reported. Key to the process is a selective conversion of stereodynamic trienes by a chiral molybdenum catalyst, providing configurationally&#8208;stable atropisomers under mild conditions in excellent yields with up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 e.r.







Abstract
Alkene metathesis catalyzed by enantiopure metal alkylidene complexes enables exceptionally versatile strategies to products with configurationally&#8208;defined stereocenters. Desymmetrization processes thereby provide reliable stereoselective routes to aliphatic structures, while the differentiation of aromatic stereogenic units remained an outstanding challenge. Herein, we describe the feasibility of alkene metathesis to catalytically control stereogenic axes by traceless arene formation. Stereodynamic trienes are selectively converted into corresponding binaphthalene atropisomers upon exposure to a chiral molybdenum catalyst. Remarkably, stereoselective arene&#8208;forming metathesis allows enantioselectivities of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 e.r. and excellent yields. As the disconnection of each bond of an aromatic target is retrosynthetically conceivable, it is anticipated that forging arenes by means of stereoselective metathesis will enable versatile approaches for the synthesis of a broad range of molecular topologies with precisely defined configuration.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Epoxidation and Aziridination of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes via Palladium Catalyzed &#963;&#8208;Bond Nucleopalladation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of preparative methods for the synthesis of four&#8208;membered carbocycles is gaining increasing importance due to the widespread utility of cyclic compounds in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report the development of a new methodology for the production of spirocyclic epoxides and aziridines containing a cyclobutane motif. In a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot process, a bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl sulfoxide is lithiated and added to a ketone, aldehyde or imine, and the resulting intermediate is cross&#8208;coupled with an aryl triflate through C&#8211;C &#963;&#8208;bond alkoxy&#8208; or aminopalladation with concomitant epoxide or aziridine formation. After careful optimization, a remarkably efficient reaction was conceived that tolerated a broad variety of both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. Lastly, through several high yielding ring&#8208;opening reactions, we demonstrated the excellent applicability of the products as modular building blocks for the introduction of three&#8208;dimensional structures into target molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stable Solid Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Battery with Electronically Conductive Fillers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic conduction in solid&#8208;polymer electrolytes is generally not desired, which causes leakage of electrons or energy loss, and the electronically conductive domains at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces can lead to continuous decomposition of electrolytes and shorting issues. However, it is noticed in this work that in an insulating matrix, the conductive domains at certain aspects could also have positive effects on the electrolyte performance with proper control. This work evaluates the limitation and benefits of electronically conductive domains in a solid&#8208;polymer electrolyte system and discusses the approach to improve the electrolyte physicochemical properties with densified local electric field distribution, enhanced bulk dielectric property, and charge transfer. By deliberately introducing the conductive domains in a regular solid&#8208;polymer electrolyte, stable cycle life, low overpotential, and promising full cell performance could be achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Achievements, Challenges, and Perspectives on Nitrogen Electrochemistry for Carbon&#8208;Neutral Energy Technologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unrestrained anthropogenic activities have severely disrupted the global natural nitrogen cycle, causing numerous energy and environmental issues. Electrocatalytic nitrogen transformation is a feasible and promising strategy for achieving a sustainable circular nitrogen economy. These processes can realize renewable energy storage and conversion, restore the global nitrogen balance, and remediate environmental crises via multiple reactions. Here, the minireview integrates three essential nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds (i.e., N2, NH3, and NO3&#8211;) and four feasible electrochemical reactions, including the nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR), nitrogen oxidation reaction (N2OR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), and ammonia oxidation reaction (NH3OR). We provide a concise perspective on an artificial nitrogen cycle through these clean electrochemical reactions. Additionally, this minireview highlights the underlying mechanistic relationships between different nitrogen reactions, demonstrating fundamental connections to the associated clean energy technologies and a sustainable nitrogen&#8208;based economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Bioassay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay is developed here which allows imaging and direct quantification of single biomolecules. Imaging single biomolecules is realized by localizing the electrochemiluminescence events of the labeled molecules. Such an imaging system allows mapping the spatial distribution of biomolecules with electrochemiluminescence and contains quantitative single&#8208;molecule insights. We further quantify biomolecules by spatiotemporally merging the repeated reactions at one molecule site and then counting the clustered molecules. The proposed single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay is used to detect carcinoembryonic antigen, showing a limit of detection of 67 attomole&#160;concentration which is 10, 000 times better than conventional electrochemiluminescence bioassays. This spatial resolution and sensitivity enable single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay a new toolbox for both specific bioimaging and ultrasensitive quantitative analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Delocalized Mixed&#8208;Valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 Complex: Strong Cu&#8208;Cu Interaction and Fast Electron Self&#8208;Exchange Rate Despite Large Structural Changes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A flexible macrocyclic ligand with two tridentate {CNC} compartments can host two Cu ions in reversibly interconvertible states, CuICuI (1) and mixed&#8208;valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 (2). They were characterized by XRD and multiple spectroscopic methods, including EPR, UV&#8208;Vis absorption and MCD, in combination with TD&#8208;DFT and CASSCF calculations. 2 features a short Cu&#8943;Cu distance (~2.5 &#197;; compared to ~4.0 &#197; in 1) and a very high delocalization energy of 13000 cm&#8208;1, comparable to the mixed&#8208;valent state of the biological CuA site. Electron self&#8208;exchange between 1 and 2 is rapid despite large structural reorganization, and is proposed to proceed via a sequential mechanism involving an active conformer of 1, viz. 1&#8217;; the latter has been characterized by XRD. Such electron transfer (ET) process is reminiscent of the conformationally gated ET proposed for biological systems. This redox couple is a unique pair of flexible dicopper complexes, achieving fast electron self&#8208;exchange closely related to the function of the CuA site.</dc:description>

         <title>Superlattice&#8208;based Plasmonic Catalysis: Concentrating Light at the Nanoscale to Drive Efficient Nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Fixation at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmonic catalysis promises green ammonia synthesis but is limited by the need of co&#8208;catalysts and poor performances due to weak electromagnetic field enhancement. Here, we use two&#8208;dimensional plasmonic superlattices with dense electromagnetic hotspots to boost ambient nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photoconversion without needing co&#8208;catalyst. By organizing Ag octahedra into a square superlattice to concentrate light, the ammonia formation is enhanced by ~15&#8208;fold and 4&#8208;fold over hexagonal superlattice and disorganized array, respectively. Our unique catalyst achieves superior ammonia formation rate and apparent quantum yield up to ~15&#8208;fold and ~103&#8208;fold, respectively, better than traditional designs. Mechanistic investigations reveal the abundance of intense plasmonic hotspots is crucial to promote hot electron generation and transfer for nitrogen reduction. Our work offers valuable insights to design electromagnetically hot plasmonic catalysts for diverse chemical and energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Enantioselective Addition of a Silicon Nucleophile to 3&#8208;Substituted 2H&#8208;Azirines Using an Si&#8211;B Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3&#8208;Substituted 2H&#8208;azirines can be considered strained cyclic ketimines, and highly enantioselective addition reactions of silicon nucleophiles to either acyclic or cyclic ketimines have been elusive so far. The present work closes this gap for those azirines by means of a copper&#8208;catalyzed silylation using a silyl boronic ester as a latent silicon nucleophile. The resulting C&#8208;silylated, unprotected (N&#8211;H) aziridines are obtained in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities and can be further converted into valuable compounds with hardly any erosion of the enantiomeric excess.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Bimetallic Cooperativity Through a Hydrogen Bonding Spacer in CO2&#160;Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At the core of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) active site two metal ions together with hydrogen bonding scheme from amino acids orchestrate the interconversion between CO2&#160;and CO. We have designed a molecular catalyst implementing a bimetallic iron complex with an embarked second coordination sphere with multi&#8208;point hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. We found that, when immobilized on carbon paper electrode, the dinuclear catalyst enhances up to four fold the heterogeneous CO2&#160;reduction to CO in water with an improved selectivity and stability compared to the mononuclear analogue. Interestingly, quasi&#8208;identical catalytic performances are obtained when one of the two iron centers was replaced by a redox inactive Zn metal, questioning the cooperative action of the two metals. Snapshots of X&#8208;ray structures indicate that the two metalloporphyrin units tethered by a urea group is a good compromise between rigidity and flexibility to accommodate CO2&#160;capture, activation, and reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Melt&#8208;Quenched Luminescent Glass of an Organic&#8208;Inorganic Manganese Halide as a Large&#8208;Area Scintillator for Radiation Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glass is a group of materials with appealing qualities, including simplicity in fabrication, durability, and high transparency, and they play a crucial role in the optics field. In this paper, a new organic&#8208;inorganic metal halide luminescent glass exhibiting &gt;78% transmittance at 550&#8208;800 nm range together with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 28.5% is reported through a low&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;quenched approach of pre&#8208;synthesized (HTPP)2MnBr4 (HTPP = hexyltriphenylphosphonium) single crystal. Temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, polarizing microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were combined to investigate the glass&#8208;crystalline interconversion process, revealing the disordered nature of the glassy state. Benefiting from the transparent nature, (HTPP)2MnBr4 glass yields an outstanding spatial resolution of 10 lp/mm for X&#8208;ray imaging. The superb optical properties and facility of large&#8208;scale fabrication distinguish the organic&#8208;inorganic metal halide glass as a highly promising class of materials for optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Profiling the Heme&#8208;Binding Proteomes of Bacteria Using Chemical Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heme is a cofactor with myriad roles and essential to almost all living organisms. Beyond classical gas transport and catalytic functions, heme is increasingly appreciated as a tightly controlled signalling molecule regulating protein expression. However, heme acquisition, biosynthesis and regulation is poorly understood beyond a few model organisms, and the heme&#8208;binding proteome has not been fully characterised in bacteria. Yet as heme homeostasis is critical for bacterial survival, heme&#8208;binding proteins are promising drug targets. Herein we report a chemical proteomics method for global profiling of heme&#8208;binding proteins in live cells for the first time. Employing a panel of heme&#8208;based clickable and photoaffinity probes enabled the profiling of 32&#8208;54% of the known heme&#8208;binding proteomes in Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. This simple&#8208;to&#8208;implement profiling strategy could be interchangeably applied to different cell types and systems and fuel future research into heme biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled construction of heteroleptic [Pd2(LA)2(LB)(LC)]4+ cages: A facile approach for site&#8208;selective endo&#8208;functionalization of supramolecular cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of supramolecular structures with internal functionalities is a promising approach to build enzyme&#8208;like cavities.&#160;The endo&#8208;functionalized [Pd12L24] and [Pd2L4] coordination cages represent the most successful systems in this regard. However, these systems mainly contain one type of endo&#8208;moieties. We herein provide a solution for controlled endo&#8208;functionalization of [Pd2L4] cages. Site&#8208;selective introduction of the endo&#8208;functional group was achieved via the formation of heteroleptic [Pd2(LA)2(LB)(LC)] cages. Using two orthogonal steric control elements is the key for the selective formation of the hetero&#8208;assemblies. We demonstrated the construction of two hetero&#8208;cages with a single internal functional group as well as a hetero&#8208;cage with two distinct endohedral functionalities.&#160;The endo&#8208;functionalized hetero&#8208;cages bound sulfonate guests with fast&#8208;exchange dynamic. This strategy provides a new solution for controlled endo&#8208;functionalization of supramolecular cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Operation of Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries in Air Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a green route for large&#8208;scale energy storage, aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are attracting extensive attention. However, most of the reported AORFBs were operated in an inert atmosphere. Herein, we clarify this issue by using the reported AORFB&#160;(i.e., 3, 3&#8217;&#8208;(9, 10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;methylbutanoicacid) (DPivOHAQ)//Ferrocyanide) as an example. We demonstrate that the dissolved O2 can oxidize the discharged DPivOHAQ in anolyte, leading to capacity&#8208;imbalance between anolyte and catholyte. Therefore, this cell shows continuous capacity fading when operated in an air atmosphere. We propose a simple strategy for this challenge, in which the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in catholyte is employed to balance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in anolyte. When using the Ni(OH)2&#8208;modifed carbon felt (CF) as a current collector for catholyte, this cell shows an excellent stability in air atmosphere because the Ni(OH)2&#8208;induced OER capacity in catholyte exactly balances the ORR capacity in anolyte. Such O2&#8208;balance strategy facilitates AORFBs&#8217; practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Control of the Scholl Reaction: Selective Synthesis of Spiro vs Helical Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scholl oxidation has become an essential reaction in the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of molecular nanographenes. Herein, we described a Scholl reaction controlled by the electronic effects on the starting substrate (1a,b). Anthracene&#8208;based polyphenylenes lead to spironanographenes under Scholl conditions. In contrast, an electron&#8208;deficient anthracene substrate affords a helically arranged molecular nanographene formed by two orthogonal dibenzo[fg,ij]phenanthro&#8208;[9,10,1,2,3&#8208;pqrst]pentaphene (DBPP) moieties linked through an octafluoroanthracene core. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations predict that electronic effects control either the first formation of spirocycles and subsequent Scholl reaction to form spironanographene&#160;2, or the expected dehydrogenation reaction leading solely to the helical nanographene&#160;3. The crystal structures of four of the new spiro compounds (syn2,&#160;syn9,anti9and&#160;syn10) were solved by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The photophysical properties of the new molecular nanographene&#160;3&#160;reveal a remarkable dual fluorescent emission.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step Approach for Constructing High Density Single&#8208;atom Catalysts toward Overall Water Splitting at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing highly active, durable, and cost&#8208;effective catalysts is urgent for green hydrogen production. Herein, high density Pt (24 atoms nm  &#8208;2  ) and Ir (32 atoms nm  &#8208;2  ) single atoms anchored on Co(OH)  2  were successfully constructed by a facile one&#8208;step approach. Remarkably, Pt  1  /Co(OH)  2  and Ir  1  /Co(OH)  2  only afforded 4 and 178 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, closing to the world record level. Moreover, assembled Pt  1  /Co(OH)  2  // Ir  1  /Co(OH)  2  system showed mass activity of 4.9 A mg  noble metal  &#8208;1  at 2.0 V in flowing alkali water electrolyzer, which is 316.1 times higher than that of Pt/C // IrO  2  . Mechanism studies revealed reconstructed Ir&#8208;O  6  single atoms and remodeled Pt triple&#8208;atom sites largely enhance the occupancy of Ir&#8208;O bonding orbitals and improve the occupation of Pt&#8208;H antibonding orbital, respectively, contributing to the formation of O&#8208;O bond and the desorption of hydrogen. This one&#8208;step approach was also generalized to fabricate other 20 kinds of single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Lasing from a Microcavity Filled with Achiral Single&#8208;Crystalline Microribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic circularly polarized (CP) lasers have received increasing attention due to their future photoelectric applications. Here, we demonstrate a CP laser from a pure organic crystal&#8208;filled microcavity without any chiral molecules or chiral structures. Benefited from the giant anisotropy and excellent laser gain of organic crystals, optical Rashba&#8208;Dresselhaus spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect can be induced and is conductive to the CP laser in such microcavities. The maximum dissymmetry factor of the CP lasing with opposite helicities reached, is as high as 1.2. Our strategy may provide a new idea for the design of CP lasers towards future 3D laser displays, information storage and other fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Bidirectional Tandem Electrocatalysis Manipulated Sulfur Speciation Pathway for High&#8208;Capacity and Stable Na&#8208;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish polysulfide redox kinetics and the uncontrollable sulfur speciation pathway, leading to serious shuttling effect and high activation barrier associated with sulfur cathode. We describe here the use of core&#8208;shell structured composite matrixes containing abundant catalytic sites for nearly fully reversible cycling of sulfur cathodes for Na&#8208;S batteries. The bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis provide successive reversible conversion of both long&#8208; and short&#8208;chain polysulfides, whereas Fe2O3 accelerates Na2S8/Na2S6 to Na2S4 conversion and the redox&#8208;active Fe(CN)64&#8208;&#8208;doped polypyrrole shell catalyzes Na2S4 reduction to Na2S. The electrochemically reactive Na2S can be readily charged back to sulfur with minimal overpotential. Simultaneously, stable cycling of Na&#8208;S pouch cell with a high reversible capacity of 696 mAh g&#8208;1 is also demonstrated. The bidirectional confined tandem catalysis renders the manipulation of sulfur redox electrochemistry for practical Na&#8208;S cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Didepside Formation by the Nonreducing Polyketide Synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera Requires Interaction of Starter Acyl Transferase and Thioesterase Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Orsellinic acid (OA) derivatives are produced by filamentous fungi using nonreducing polyketide synthases (nrPKSs). The chain&#8208;releasing thioesterase (TE) domains of such nrPKSs were proposed to also catalyze dimerization to yield didepsides such as lecanoric acid. Here, we use combinatorial domain exchanges, domain dissections and reconstitutions to reveal that the TE domain of the lecanoric acid synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera must collaborate with the starter acyl transferase (SAT) domain from the same nrPKS. We show that artificial SAT&#8208;TE fusion proteins are highly effective catalysts and reprogram ketide homologation chassi to form didepsides. We also demonstrate that dissected SAT and TE domains of Preu6 physically interact, and SAT and TE domains of OA&#8208;synthesizing nrPKSs may co&#8208;evolve. Our work highlights an unexpected domain&#8208;domain interaction in nrPKSs that must be considered upon combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural didepsides, depsidones, and diphenyl ethers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Michael additions are highly useful in organic synthesis and are commonly accomplished using organocatalysts. However, the corresponding biocatalytic Michael additions are rare and typically lack synthetically useful substrate scopes and suffer from low stereoselectivity. Here we report a biocatalytic nitro&#8208;Michael addition, catalyzed by NahE, that proceeds with low catalyst loading at room temperature in moderate to excellent enantioselectivity and high yields. A series of &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes reacted with pyruvate in the presence of NahE to give, after oxidative decarboxylation, &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#947;nitrobutyric acids in up to 99% isolated yield without need for chromatography, providing a simple preparative&#8208;scale route to chiral GABA analogues. This reaction represents the first example of an aldolase displaying promiscuous Michaelase activity and opens the use of nitroalkenes in place aldehydes as substrates for aldolases.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Self&#8208;assembly of Gold(I) Complexes by Multiple Kinetic Aggregation States with Nonlinear Optical and Waveguide Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of multiple kinetic aggregation states (Aggs) into the self&#8208;assembly pathway could bring complexity and flexibility to the self&#8208;assemblies, which is difficult to realize due to the delicate equilibria established among different Aggs bonded by weak noncovalent interactions. Here, we describe a series of chiral and achiral d10 Au(I) bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, NHC) complexes, and the achiral complex could undergo self&#8208;assembly with multiple kinetic Aggs. Generation of multiple kinetic Aggs was realized by applying chiral or achiral seeds exhibiting large differences in elongation temperatures for their respective cooperative self&#8208;assembly processes. We further showed that the chiral Au(I) self&#8208;assemblies having non&#8208;centrosymmetric packing forms exhibit nonlinear optical response of second harmonic generation (SHG), while the SHG signal is absent in the achiral analogue. The crystalline achiral Au(I) self&#8208;assemblies could function as optical waveguides with strong emission polarization.</dc:description>

The crystalline achiral Au(I) self-assemblies could function as optical waveguides with strong emission polarization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Increased Surface Density of States at the Fermi Level for Electron Transport Across Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fermi&#8217;s golden rule, a remarkable concept for the transition probability involving continuous states, is applicable to the interfacial electron&#8208;transporting efficiency via correlation with the surface density of states (SDOS).&#160; Yet, this concept has not been reported to tailor single&#8208;molecule junctions where gold is an overwhelmingly popular electrode material due to its superior amenability in regenerating molecular junctions.&#160; At the Fermi level, however, the SDOS of gold is small due to its fully filled d&#8208;shell.&#160; To increase the electron&#8208;transport efficiency, herein, gold electrodes are modified by a monolayer of platinum or palladium that bears partially filled d&#8208;shells and exhibits significant SDOS at the Fermi energy.&#160; An increase by 2&#8722;30 fold is found for single&#8208;molecule conductance of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hexanes bridged via common headgroups.&#160; The improved junction conductance is attributed to the electrode self&#8208;energy which involves a stronger coupling with the molecule and a larger SDOS participated by d&#8208;electrons at the electrode&#8208;molecule interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Polyoxoniobate&#8208;Based Inorganic Molecular Tweezers: Metal Recognitions, Ion&#8208;Exchange Interactions and Mechanism Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports the interesting and unique cation&#8208;exchange behaviors of the first indium&#8208;bridged purely inorganic 3D framework based on high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxoniobates as building units. Each nanoscale polyoxoniobate features a fascinating near&#8208;icosahedral core&#8208;shell structure with six pairs of unique inorganic &#8216;molecular tweezers&#8217; that have changable opening for binding different metal cations via ion&#8208;exchanges and exhibit unusual selective metal&#8208;uptake behaviors. Further, the material has high chemical stability so that can undergo single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal metal&#8208;exchange processes to produce a dozen new crystals with high crystallinity. Based on these crystals and time&#8208;dependent metal&#8208;exchange experiments, we can visually reveal the detailed metal&#8208;exchange interactions and mechanisms of the material at the atomic precision level. This work demonstrates a rare systematic and atomic&#8208;level study on the ion&#8208;exchange properties of nanoclusters, which is of significance for the exploration of cluster based ion&#8208;exchange materials that are still to be developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Room Temperature Incorporation of Arsenic Atoms into the Germanium (001) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Germanium has emerged as an exceptionally promising material for spintronics and quantum information applications, with significant fundamental advantages over silicon. However, efforts to create atomic&#8208;scale devices using donor atoms as qubits have largely focussed on phosphorus in silicon. Positioning phosphorus in silicon with atomic&#8208;scale precision requires a thermal incorporation anneal, but the low success rate for this step has been shown to be a fundamental limitation prohibiting the scale&#8208;up to large&#8208;scale devices. Here, we present a comprehensive study of arsine (AsH3  ) on the germanium (001) surface. We show that, unlike any previously studied dopant precursor on silicon or germanium, arsenic atoms fully incorporate into substitutional surface lattice sites at room temperature. Our results pave the way for the next generation of atomic&#8208;scale donor devices combining the superior electronic properties of germanium with the enhanced properties of arsine/germanium chemistry that promises scale&#8208;up to large numbers of deterministically&#8208;placed qubits.</dc:description>

         <title>A Shuttle&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Cu&#8722;Li Battery Based on a Sandwich&#8208;Structured Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost Cu&#8722;Li batteries leveraging Cu cathode dissolution/deposition have been hindered by electrolyte related issues, including Cu crossover, low conductivity, etc. Here the authors design a sandwich solid&#8208;state electrolyte by sandwiching a Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 pellet with two deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent gels to address these issues. The as&#8208;prepared solid&#8208;state Cu&#8722;Li battery exhibits significantly improved cyclability and practical energy density.







Abstract
Cu&#8722;Li batteries leveraging the two&#8208;electron redox property of Cu can offer high energy density and low cost. However, Cu&#8722;Li batteries are plagued by limited solubility and a shuttle effect of Cu ions in traditional electrolytes, which leads to low energy density and poor cycling stability. In this work, we rationally design a solid&#8208;state sandwich electrolyte for solid&#8208;state Cu&#8722;Li batteries, in which a deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent gel with high Cu&#8208;ion solubility is devised as a Cu&#8208;ion reservoir while a ceramic Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 interlayer is used to block Cu&#8208;ion crossover. Because of the high ionic conductivity (0.55&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), wide electrochemical window (&gt;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), and high Cu ion solubility of solid&#8208;state sandwich electrolyte, a solid&#8208;state Cu&#8722;Li battery demonstrates a high energy density of 1&#8201;485&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgCu&#8722;1and long&#8208;term cyclability with 97&#8201;% capacity retention over 120 cycles. The present study lays the groundwork for future research into low&#8208;cost solid&#8208;state Cu&#8722;Li batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Cu&#8722;Li batteries leveraging the two-electron redox property of Cu can offer high energy density and low cost. However, Cu&#8722;Li batteries are plagued by limited solubility and a shuttle effect of Cu ions in traditional electrolytes, which leads to low energy density and poor cycling stability. In this work, we rationally design a solid-state sandwich electrolyte for solid-state Cu&#8722;Li batteries, in which a deep-eutectic-solvent gel with high Cu-ion solubility is devised as a Cu-ion reservoir while a ceramic Li&lt;sub&gt;1.4&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interlayer is used to block Cu-ion crossover. Because of the high ionic conductivity (0.55&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8201;&#176;C), wide electrochemical window (&amp;gt;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li), and high Cu ion solubility of solid-state sandwich electrolyte, a solid-state Cu&#8722;Li battery demonstrates a high energy density of 1&#8201;485&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sub&gt;Cu&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;and long-term cyclability with 97&#8201;% capacity retention over 120 cycles. The present study lays the groundwork for future research into low-cost solid-state Cu&#8722;Li batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction of Na+ within a {Mg2Na2} Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of a low oxidation state {Mg2Na2} assembly with basic molecules that are less prone to reduction than the sodium cation itself induces the complete extrusion of the elemental alkali metal.







Abstract
Ionic compounds containing sodium cations are notable for their stability and resistance to redox reactivity unless highly reducing electrical potentials are applied. Here we report that treatment of a low oxidation state {Mg2Na2} species with non&#8208;reducible organic bases induces the spontaneous and completely selective extrusion of sodium metal and oxidation of the MgI centers to the more conventional MgII state. Although these processes are also characterized by a structural reorganisation of the initially chelated diamide spectator ligand, computational quantum chemical studies indicate that intramolecular electron transfer is abetted by the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO) of the {Mg2Na2} ensemble, which arise exclusively from the 3s valence atomic orbitals of the constituent sodium and magnesium atoms.

         <title>A Dynamic Supramolecular H&#8208;bonding Network with Orthogonally Tunable Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic synergy strategy provides a novel example of supramolecular dual&#8208;tunable clusteroluminescence. The unique &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation endows materials with efficient luminescence as well as mechanical adaptivity and robustness. Moreover, dual dynamic polymeric networks provide an ideal platform for the orthogonal regulation of clusteroluminescence and chemical closed&#8208;loop recycling.







Abstract
Enabling dynamically tunable emissive systems offers opportunities for constructing smart materials. Clusteroluminescence, as unconventional luminescence, has attracted increasing attention in both fundamental and applied sciences. Herein, we report a supramolecular poly(disulfides) network with tunable clusteroluminescence. The reticular H&#8208;bonds synergize the rigidity and mobility of dynamic networks, and endow the resulting materials with mechanical adaptivity and robustness, simultaneously enabling efficient clusteroluminescence and phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K. Orthogonally tunable luminescence are achieved in two manners, i.e., slow backbone disulfide exchange and fast side&#8208;chain metal coordination. Further exploration of the reprocessability and chemical closed&#8208;loop recycling of intrinsic dynamic networks for sustainable materials is feasible. We foresee that the synergistic strategy of dynamic chemistry offers a novel pathway and potential opportunities for smart emissive materials.

         <title>Balancing Activity and Stability in Spinel Cobalt Oxides through Geometrical Sites Occupation towards Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through tunning geometrical sites occupation, (Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs with Mnoct, Nioct, Nitet shows excellent OER activity. The Ni/Mn substitution modulates the normal surface states of CoCo2O4 from oxygen&#8208;excess to oxygen&#8208;deficient and thus leading to the decoupled proton&#8208;electron transfer to reconstruct a more stable surface. The optimal balance between the electroactivity and stability ensures a remarkable OER performance.







Abstract
Designing active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are vitally important to various energy conversion devices. Herein, we introduce elements Ni and Mn into (Co)tet(Co2)octO4 nanosheets (NSs) at fixed geometrical sites, including Mnoct, Nioct, and Nitet, to optimize the initial geometrical structure and modulate the CoCo2O4 surface from oxygen&#8208;excess to oxygen&#8208;deficiency. The pristine (Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs shows excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 281.6&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, without damaging their initial activity, the activated (Act)&#8208;(Ni,Mn)&#8208;(Co)tet(Co2)octO4 NSs after surface reconstruction exhibit long&#8208;term stability of 100&#8197;h under 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, or even 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The optimal balance between electroactivity and stability leads to remarkable OER performances, providing a pivotal guideline for designing ideal electrocatalysts and inspiring more works to focus on the dynamic change of each occupation site component.

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregates Formed by NaCl Treatment of Aza&#8208;Coating Heptamethine Cyanines and Their Application to Monitoring Salt Stress of Plants and Promoting Photothermal Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two J&#8208;aggregates formed by NaCl treatment of aza&#8208;coating hepetamine cyanines act as functional fluorescent probes for monitoring salt stress of plants and promoting photothermal therapy of tumors.







Abstract
The cationic nature of heptamethine cyanines gives them the capacity to form aggregates with salts by electrostatic interactions. In this work, NaCl promoted J&#8208;aggregate formation of aza&#8208;coating heptamethine cyanines is explored. NaCl can induce the N&#8208;benzyloxycarbonyl Cy&#8208;CO2Bz to assemble into a J&#8208;aggregate having an absorption at 890&#8197;nm. Its excellent fluorescence response to NaCl implies that it has great potential for use as a probe for tracing salt stress in plants. Moreover, NaCl also promotes formation of J&#8208;aggregates from the N&#8208;ethyloxycarbonyl Cy&#8208;CO2Et. The aggregate shows an intense absorption at 910&#8197;nm compared to the monomer which absorbs at 766&#8197;nm. Its J&#8208;aggregated form can serve as a photothermal agent. And the photothermal conversion efficiency is increased from 29.37&#8201;% to 57.59&#8201;%. This effort leads to the development of two applications of new cyanine J&#8208;aggregates including one for tracing salt stress of plants and the other for promoting photothermal therapy of tumors.

         <title>Assessing the Progression of Early Atherosclerosis Mice Using a Fluorescence Nanosensor for the Simultaneous Detection and Imaging of pH and Phosphorylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we constructed a fluorescence nanosensor based on MOFs for the simultaneous detection and imaging of pH and phosphorylation level in mouse models of atherosclerosis. Blood tests and two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging were used to monitor changes of blood pH and phosphate levels at different stages during atherosclerotic plaque formation. The present study provides a new analysis method for the assessment of early atherosclerotic disease.







Abstract
The inflammatory microenvironment involves changes in pH and protein phosphorylation state and is closely related to the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis (AS). Herein, we constructed a dual&#8208;detection fluorescence nanosensor PCN&#8208;NP&#8208;HPZ based on post modification of MOFs, which realized the simultaneous detection and imaging of pH and phosphorylation through the pH&#8208;sensitive group piperazine and the ZrIV node of the MOFs. The sensors were used to monitor changes in blood pH and phosphate levels at different time stages during atherosclerotic plaque formation. Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging was also performed in the vascular endothelium. Blood tests combined with two&#8208;photon fluorescence images indicated that in the early stage of AS, blood and tissue pH levels were lower than that of the normal mice, while phosphate and tissue phosphorylation levels were higher than that of the normal mice. The present study provides a new analysis method for the assessment of early atherosclerotic disease.

     alt="Assessing the Progression of Early Atherosclerosis Mice Using a Fluorescence Nanosensor for the Simultaneous Detection and Imaging of pH and Phosphorylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we constructed a fluorescence nanosensor based on MOFs for the simultaneous detection and imaging of pH and phosphorylation level in mouse models of atherosclerosis. Blood tests and two-photon fluorescence imaging were used to monitor changes of blood pH and phosphate levels at different stages during atherosclerotic plaque formation. The present study provides a new analysis method for the assessment of early atherosclerotic disease.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inflammatory microenvironment involves changes in pH and protein phosphorylation state and is closely related to the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis (AS). Herein, we constructed a dual-detection fluorescence nanosensor PCN-NP-HPZ based on post modification of MOFs, which realized the simultaneous detection and imaging of pH and phosphorylation through the pH-sensitive group piperazine and the Zr&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; node of the MOFs. The sensors were used to monitor changes in blood pH and phosphate levels at different time stages during atherosclerotic plaque formation. Two-photon fluorescence imaging was also performed in the vascular endothelium. Blood tests combined with two-photon fluorescence images indicated that in the early stage of AS, blood and tissue pH levels were lower than that of the normal mice, while phosphate and tissue phosphorylation levels were higher than that of the normal mice. The present study provides a new analysis method for the assessment of early atherosclerotic disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Zinc Anode with 96&#8201;% Utilization Rate Enabled by Solvation Structure Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of sulfolane forms a new solvation structure of Zn2+ ions in aqueous electrolytes, which significantly inhibits the side reactions of the Zn anode and realizes a stable Zn anode with high areal capacity and high utilization rate.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZBs) show promises for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is generally low due to side reactions in the aqueous electrolyte caused by the active water molecules. Here, we design a novel solvation structure in the electrolyte by introduction of sulfolane (SL). Theoretical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and experimental tests show that SL remodels the primary solvation shell of Zn2+, which significantly reduces the side reactions of Zn anode and achieves high ZUR under large capacities. Specifically, the symmetric and asymmetric cells could achieve a maximum of &#8764;96&#8201;% ZUR at an areal capacity of 24&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In a ZUR of &#8764;67&#8201;%, the developed Zn&#8722;V2O5 full cell can be stably cycled for 500&#8197;cycles with an energy density of 180&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and Zn&#8208;AC capacitor is stable for 5000&#8197;cycles. This electrolyte structural engineering strategy provides new insight into achieving high ZUR of Zn anodes for high performance AZBs.

         <title>Piezocatalytic Techniques in Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides a summary of recent developments in piezocatalytic techniques for environmental remediation. The application of the piezoelectric effect, classification of piezoelectric materials, and piezocatalytic techniques for environmental remediation are discussed. Urgent problems and prospects of piezocatalytic techniques are also presented.







Abstract
As a consequence of rapid industrialization throughout the world, various environmental pollutants have begun to accumulate in water, air, and soil. This endangers the ecological environment of the earth, and environmental remediation has become an immediate priority. Among various environmental remediation techniques, piezocatalytic techniques, which uniquely take advantage of the piezoelectric effect, have attracted much attention. Piezoelectric effects allow pollutant degradation directly, while also enhancing photocatalysis by reducing the recombination of photogenerated carriers. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive summary of recent developments in piezocatalytic techniques for environmental remediation. The origin of the piezoelectric effect as well as classification of piezoelectric materials and their application in environmental remediation are systematically summarized. We also analyze the potential underlying mechanisms. Finally, urgent problems and the future development of piezocatalytic techniques are discussed.

         <title>Taming Chiral Quaternary Stereocenters via Remote H&#8208;Bonding Stereoinduction in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed (3+2) Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric (3+2) cycloadditions of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropenes bearing two different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were reported. Various chiral five&#8208;membered oxa&#8208; and aza&#8208;heterocycles were produced, and good yields and high stereoselectivities were obtained. The key to the success of this reaction is the remote stereoinduction through H&#8208;bonding from chiral ligands.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening transformations of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropanes enable the rapid assembly of complex molecules. However, the enantioselective formation of chiral quaternary stereocenters using substrates bearing two different acceptors remains a challenge. Herein, we describe the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (3+2) cycloaddition of vinyl cyclopropanes bearing two different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, a subset of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes. The key to the success of this reaction is the remote stereoinduction through hydrogen bond from chiral ligands, which thereby addressed the aforementioned challenge. A variety of chiral five&#8208;membered heterocycles were produced in good yields and with high stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% yields, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er and &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations, including control experiments and theoretical calculations, revealed the origin of the stereoselectivity and the importance of H&#8208;bonding in stereocontrol.

         <title>(SCp)Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Satoh&#8211;Miura Reaction for Building&#8208;up Axial Chirality: Counteranion&#8208;Directed Switching of Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction enabled by a chiral tri&#8208;substituted SCpRh(III)&#8208;catalyst is described. The desired axially chiral products can be afforded in moderate to excellent yields (up to 85&#8201;%) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% ee). Meanwhile, DFT calculations provide rationales behind this unique phenomenon of counteranion&#8208;directed switching of the pathways in C&#8722;H activation reactions.







Abstract
Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction is an important method for extending &#960;&#8208;systems by forging multi&#8208;substituted benzene rings via double aryl C&#8722;H activation and annulation with alkynes. However, the development of highly enantioselective Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction remains rather challenging. Herein, we report an asymmetric Satoh&#8211;Miura reaction between 1&#8208;aryl benzo[h]isoquinolines and internal alkynes enabled by a SCpRh&#8208;catalyst. Judiciously choosing the counteranion of the Rh&#8208;catalyst is crucial for the desired reactivity over the competitive formation of azoniahelicenes. Detailed mechanistic studies support the proposal of counteranion&#8208;directed switching of reaction pathways in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Anthracene&#8208;Fused Oligo&#8208;BODIPYs: A New Class of &#960;&#8208;Extended NIR&#8208;Absorbing Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AuI&#8208;catalyzed cyclization has been used to prepare a series of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated anthracene&#8208;fused oligo&#8208;BODIPYs. The size and shape of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton determines the unique features of the compounds&#8212;such as their face&#8208;to&#8208;face supramolecular organization, NIR absorption and fluorescence as well as strong electron accepting character.







Abstract
Large &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are key in the area of molecular materials. Herein, we prepare via AuI&#8208;catalyzed cyclization a series of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated anthracene&#8208;fused oligo&#8208;BODIPYs. Their structural and optoelectronic properties were studied by several techniques, ranging from X&#8208;ray, UV/Vis, and cyclic voltammetry to transient absorption spectroscopy. As a complement, their electronic structures were explored by means of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Depending on the size and shape of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton, unique features&#8212;such as face&#8208;to&#8208;face supramolecular organization, NIR absorption and fluorescence as well as strong electron accepting character&#8212;were noted. All in all, the aforementioned features render them valuable for technological applications.

&lt;p&gt;Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed cyclization has been used to prepare a series of fully &#960;-conjugated anthracene-fused oligo-BODIPYs. The size and shape of the &#960;-conjugated skeleton determines the unique features of the compounds&#8212;such as their face-to-face supramolecular organization, NIR absorption and fluorescence as well as strong electron accepting character.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large &#960;-conjugated systems are key in the area of molecular materials. Herein, we prepare via Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed cyclization a series of fully &#960;-conjugated anthracene-fused oligo-BODIPYs. Their structural and optoelectronic properties were studied by several techniques, ranging from X-ray, UV/Vis, and cyclic voltammetry to transient absorption spectroscopy. As a complement, their electronic structures were explored by means of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Depending on the size and shape of the &#960;-conjugated skeleton, unique features&#8212;such as face-to-face supramolecular organization, NIR absorption and fluorescence as well as strong electron accepting character&#8212;were noted. All in all, the aforementioned features render them valuable for technological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoselective Decarboxylative Protonation Enabled by Cooperative Earth&#8208;Abundant Element Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining simple iron and thiol catalysts allows carboxylic acids to be directly converted to C&#8722;H bonds under visible light irradiation. The cocatalytic system exhibits a wide scope, is scalable, and preliminary mechanistic studies suggest it functions via a tandem ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)/Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) mechanism.







Abstract
Decarboxylative protonation is a general deletion tactic to replace polar carboxylic acid groups with hydrogen or its isotope. Current methods rely on the pre&#8208;activation of acids, non&#8208;sustainable hydrogen sources, and/or expensive/highly oxidizing photocatalysts, presenting challenges to their wide adoption. Here we show that a cooperative iron/thiol catalyst system can readily achieve this transformation, hydrodecarboxylating a wide range of activated and unactivated carboxylic acids and overcoming scope limitations in previous direct methods. The reaction is readily scaled in batch configuration and can be directly performed in deuterated solvent to afford high yields of d&#8208;incorporated products with excellent isotope incorporation efficiency; characteristics not attainable in previous photocatalyzed approaches. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a radical mechanism and kinetic results of unactivated acids (KIE=1) are consistent with a light&#8208;limited reaction.

         <title>Polyphosphinoborane Block Copolymer Synthesis Using Catalytic Reversible Chain&#8208;Transfer Dehydropolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic block copolymers of polyphosphinoboranes, [H2BPPhH]110&#8208;b&#8208;[H2BP(n&#8208;hexyl)H]11, have been prepared by a mechanism&#8208;led strategy of the catalytic reversible chain transfer dehydropolymerization of precursor monomers, H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PRH2 (R=Ph, h&#8208;hexyl). These self&#8208;assemble in THF:hexane solutions to form nanostructured rod&#8208;like micelles, the morphology of which can be controlled by solvent polarity.







Abstract
An amphiphilic block copolymer of polyphosphinoborane has been prepared by a mechanism&#8208;led strategy of the sequential catalytic dehydropolymerization of precursor monomers, H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PRH2 (R=Ph, n&#8208;hexyl), using the simple pre&#8208;catalyst [Rh(Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2)2]Cl. Speciation, mechanism and polymer chain growth studies support a step&#8208;growth process where reversible chain transfer occurs, i.e. H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PRH2/oligomer/polymer can all coordinate with, and be activated by, the catalyst. Block copolymer [H2BPPhH]110&#8208;b&#8208;[H2BP(n&#8208;hexyl)H]11 can be synthesized and self&#8208;assembles in solution to form either rod&#8208;like micelles or vesicles depending on solvent polarity.

RhCl3&#8208;catalyzed peri&#8208;selective C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;substituted naphthalenes is developed to access chalcogen&#8208;embedded anthanthrenes.

The transformation of p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type semiconductors is realized via the S&#8208;atom oxidation of PTT, and the resulting PTT&#8208;O4 shows electron transport with a mobility of 0.022&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Disclosed herein is a RhCl3&#8208;catalyzed peri&#8208;selective C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;substituted naphthalenes, which provides a highly efficient and streamlined approach to chalcogen&#8208;embedded anthanthrenes from readily available starting materials. Introducing O, S, and Se into the anthanthrene skeleton leads to gradually increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distances but significantly enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlaps with the growth of the hetero&#8208;atom radius. Moderate &#960;&#8211;&#960; distance, overlap area, and intermolecular S&#8722;S interactions endow S&#8208;embedded anthanthrene (PTT) with excellent 2D charge&#8208;transport properties. Moreover, the transformation of p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type S&#8208;embedded anthanthrenes is realized for the first time via the S&#8208;atom oxidation from PTT to PTT&#8208;O4. In organic field&#8208;effect transistor devices, PTT derivatives exhibit hole transport with mobilities up to 1.1&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, while PTT&#8208;O4 shows electron transport with a mobility of 0.022&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>The Role of Cytochrome&#8197;P450 AbyV in the Final Stages of Abyssomicin&#8197;C Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme AbyV catalyses a key epoxidation in the final stages of the biosynthesis of the spirotetronate antibiotic abyssomicin&#8197;C. Combining structural and computational data with a 13C labelling strategy was found to be a powerful approach to interrogate the biotransformation and determine the precise function of the enzyme.







Abstract
Abyssomicin&#8197;C and its atropisomer are potent inhibitors of bacterial folate metabolism. They possess complex polycyclic structures, and their biosynthesis has been shown to involve several unusual enzymatic transformations. Using a combination of synthesis and in vitro assays we reveal that AbyV, a cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme from the aby gene cluster, catalyses a key late&#8208;stage epoxidation required for the installation of the characteristic ether&#8208;bridged core of abyssomicin&#8197;C. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of AbyV has been determined, which in combination with molecular dynamics simulations provides a structural framework for our functional data. This work demonstrates the power of combining selective carbon&#8208;13 labelling with NMR spectroscopy as a sensitive tool to interrogate enzyme&#8208;catalysed reactions in vitro with no need for purification.

         <title>Identification of Cyclohexadienyl Hydrides as Intermediates in Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Arene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The insertion of arenes into metal hydride bonds has been proposed a key step in the catalytic hydrogenation of arenes. Using phosphino(imino)pyridine complexes of molybdenum, the selective insertion of benzene into Mo&#8208;hydride bonds has been observed. The isolated molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydrides are active precatalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene and release cyclohexadiene upon addition of carbon monoxide.







Abstract
Treatment of phosphino(imino)pyridine (PIP) molybdenum cyclooctadiene (COD) complexes [(PIP)Mo(COD)] with dihydrogen in the presence of benzene selectively furnished the molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydrides [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)], which are precatalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)] arises from a rarely observed insertion of benzene into a molybdenum&#8208;hydride bond, a key step in the molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed homogeneous hydrogenation of arenes. The reaction with toluene afforded a single isomer of the corresponding molybdenum cyclohexadienyl hydride while para&#8208;xylene predominantly formed the molybdenum &#951;6&#8208;arene complex with the insertion product being a minor component. Addition of carbon monoxide to a cyclohexane&#8208;d12 solution of [(PIP)MoH(&#951;5&#8208;C6H7)] liberated cyclohexadiene, providing experimental support for a higher kinetic barrier for the subsequent steps en route to cycloalkanes.

         <title>A Highly Compatible Phototrophic Community for Carbon&#8208;Negative Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly compatible phototrophic community (HCPC) was developed through the integration of a CO2 sequestration module and a super&#8208;coupled module, V. natriegens. Based on the HCPC platform, various chemicals could be directly synthesized from CO2, enabling the overall release of &#8722;22.27 to &#8722;606.59&#8197;kgCO2e&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in the end products. This study provides design guidance for photosynthetic communities and new opportunities for carbon&#8208;negative production.







Abstract
CO2 sequestration engineering is promising for carbon&#8208;negative biosynthesis, and artificial communities can solve more complex problems than monocultures. However, obtaining an ideal photosynthetic community is still a great challenge. Herein, we describe the development of a highly compatible photosynthetic community (HCPC) by integrating a sucrose&#8208;producing CO2 sequestration module and a super&#8208;coupled module. The cyanobacteria CO2 sequestration module was obtained using stepwise metabolic engineering and then coupled with the efficient sucrose utilization module Vibrio natriegens. Integrated omics analysis indicated that enhanced photosynthetic electron transport and extracellular vesicles promote intercellular communication. Additionally, the HCPC was used to channel CO2 into valuable chemicals, enabling the overall release of &#8722;22.27 to &#8722;606.59&#8197;kgCO2e&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in the end products. This novel light&#8208;driven community could facilitate circular economic implementation in the future.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalizations: Divergent Synthesis of Indole[a]&#8208; and [b]&#8208;Fused Polycycles
</title>

         <dc:description>
The exposure of (alkylphenyl)ethynyl substituted phenyl azides to JohnPhosAu(I) catalysts leads to the divergent synthesis of indole&#8208;fused polycycles via N&#8208; or C&#8208;cyclization facilitated via benzyl to &#945;&#8208;imino gold(I) carbene 1,5&#8208;hydride shift. The chemoselectivity depends on the counter&#8208;anion, the reactivity of the carbene, and the attached alkyl groups at the benzylic position.







Abstract
Phenyl azides substituted by an (alkylphenyl)ethynyl group facilitate benzylic sp3(C&#8722;H) functionalization in the presence of a JohnPhosAu catalyst, resulting in indole&#8208;fused tetra&#8208; and pentacycles via divergent N&#8208; or C&#8208;cyclization. The chemoselectivity is influenced depending on the counter&#8208;anion, the electron density of the &#945;&#8208;imino gold(I) carbene, and the alkyl groups stabilizing the benzylic carbocation originating from a 1,5&#8208;hydride shift. An isotopic labeling experiment demonstrates the involvement of an indolylgold(I) species resulting from a tautomerization that is much faster than the deauration. The formation of a benzylic sp3(C&#8722;H) functionalization leading to an indole&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered ring is also demonstrated.

         <title>Rational Design of a Facially Coordinating P,N,N Ligand for Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn catalyst has been rationally redesigned to repel sp3hybridised substituents while attracting sp2 substituents, and hence enable enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic ketones. DFT calculations enable a robust prediction of the level of enantiocontrol across a range of substrates.







Abstract
DFT calculations on the full catalytic cycle for manganese catalysed enantioselective hydrogenation of a selection of ketones have been carried out at the PBE0&#8208;D3PCM//RI&#8208;BP86PCM level. Mn complexes of an enantiomerically pure chiral P,N,N ligand have been found to be most reactive when adopting a facial coordination mode. The use of a new ligand with an ortho&#8208;substituted dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine motif has been calculated to completely transform the levels of enantioselectivity possible for the hydrogenation of cyclic ketones relative to the first&#8208;generation Mn catalysts. In silico evaluation of substrates has been used to identify those likely to be reduced with high enantiomer ratios (er), and others that would exhibit less selectivity; good agreements were then found in experiments. Various cyclic ketones and some acetophenone derivatives were hydrogenated with er's up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1.

&#8220;Fungal tree&#8221;&#8208;like hetero&#8208;structured AgNWs@BNNS fillers and thermally conductive AgNWs@BNNS/ANF composite films with integrated capabilities of superior Joule heating, thermal conductivity and mechanical properties for next&#8208;generation versatile applications of energy conversion, 5G electronic devices and artificial intelligence, etc.







Abstract
Thermal conduction for electronic equipment has grown in importance in light of the burgeoning of 5G communication. It is imperatively desired to design highly thermally conductive fillers and polymer composite films with prominent Joule heating characteristics and extensive mechanical properties. In this work, &#8220;solvothermal &amp; in situ growth&#8221; method is carried out to prepare &#8220;Fungal tree&#8221;&#8208;like hetero&#8208;structured silver nanowires@boron nitride nanosheet (AgNWs@BNNS) thermally conductive fillers. The thermally conductive AgNWs@BNNS/ANF composite films are obtained by the method of &#8220;suction filtration self&#8208;assembly and hot&#8208;pressing&#8221;. When the mass fraction of AgNWs@BNNS is 50&#8197;wt%, AgNWs@BNNS/ANF composite film presents the optimal thermal conductivity coefficient of 9.44&#8197;W/(m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K) and excellent tensile strength of 136.6&#8197;MPa, good temperature&#8208;voltage response characteristics, superior electrical stability and reliability, which promise a wide application potential in 5G electronic devices.

         <title>Surface Water as an Initial Proton Source for the Electrochemical CO Reduction Reaction on Copper Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreduction of CO on Cu single&#8208;crystal surfaces was investigated with in situ electrochemical shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) and density functional theory (DFT). Direct spectroscopic evidence for surface *CO, Cu&#8722;Oad, and Cu&#8722;OHad species was observed and confirmed with isotopic experiments. Surface *H2O is the dominant proton source for the initial protonation steps in alkaline electrolytes (pH=13).







Abstract
We have employed in situ electrochemical shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the CO reduction reaction (CORR) on Cu single&#8208;crystal surfaces under various conditions. Coadsorbed and structure&#8208;/potential&#8208;dependent surface species, including *CO, Cu&#8722;Oad, and Cu&#8722;OHad, were identified using electrochemical spectroscopy and isotope labeling. The relative abundance of *OH follows a &#8220;volcano&#8221; trend with applied potentials in aqueous solutions, which is yet absent in absolute alcoholic solutions. Combined with DFT calculations, we propose that the surface H2O can serve as a strong proton donor for the first protonation step in both the C1 and C2 pathways of CORR at various applied potentials in alkaline electrolytes, leaving adsorbed *OH on the surface. This work provides fresh insights into the initial protonation steps and identity of key interfacial intermediates formed during CORR on Cu surfaces.

         <title>Maximum Impact of Ionic Strength on Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction Rates Induced by a Zeolite Microporous Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confined hydronium ions in zeolite create an intraporous ionic environment, which increases acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction rates in a volcanic pattern at both saturated and low concentrations of substrates in the pores.







Abstract
The intracrystalline ionic environment in microporous zeolite can remarkably modify the excess chemical potential of adsorbed reactants and transition states, thereby influencing the catalytic turnover rates. However, a limit of the rate enhancement for aqueous&#8208;phase dehydration of alcohols appears to exist for zeolites with high ionic strength. The origin of such limitation has been hypothesized to be caused by the spatial constraints in the pores via, e.g., size exclusion effects. It is demonstrated here that the increase in turnover rate as well as the formation of a maximum and the rate drop are intrinsic consequences of the increasingly dense ionic environment in zeolite. The molecularly sized confines of zeolite create a unique ionic environment that monotonically favors the formation of alcohol&#8208;hydronium ion complexes in the micropores. The zeolite microporous environment determines the kinetics of catalytic steps and tailors the impact of ionic strength on catalytic rates.

         <title>Structural Influence of Lone Pairs in GeP2N4, a Germanium(II) Nitridophosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the discovery of the first germanium(II) nitridophosphate, GeP2N4, we present a way to use the stereochemical influence of lone pairs to modify crystal structures. This approach could be applied to other literature&#8208;known nitridophosphates by cation exchange, altering the crystal structures and thus further increase their already widespread properties and field of application.







Abstract
Owing to their widespread properties, nitridophosphates are of high interest in current research. Explorative high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature investigations yielded various compounds with stoichiometry MP2N4 (M=Be, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mn, Cd), which are discussed as ultra&#8208;hard or luminescent materials, when doped with Eu2+. Herein, we report the first germanium nitridophosphate, GeP2N4, synthesized from Ge3N4 and P3N5 at 6&#8197;GPa and 800&#8201;&#176;C. The structure was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and further characterized by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, IR and NMR spectroscopy. The highly condensed network of PN4&#8208;tetrahedra shows a strong structural divergence to other MP2N4 compounds, which is attributed to the stereochemical influence of the lone pair of Ge2+. Thus, the formal exchange of alkaline earth cations with Ge2+ may open access to various compounds with literature&#8208;known stoichiometry, however, new structures and properties.

         <title>Integrating Green Chemistry into Chemistry Education</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Give your chemistry classroom a green overhaul with resources from the American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute, Beyond Benign, and the Center for Green Chemistry &amp; Green Engineering at Yale. Many green chemistry online resources, journals, and textbooks for classroom and laboratory are available. Urgent adoption of these resources is needed.







Abstract
Full integration of green chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum is a necessity to prepare our students for a sustainable future. We discuss the reasons for the need to change the curriculum, the institutions in North America, Europe, and Asia that are leading the way towards integration with classroom resources, and the published textbooks that are currently available for both classroom and laboratory. We plead for more time for hard&#8208;pressed college professors to revamp the curriculum, and for these efforts to be valued. We feel compelled by the urgency of this need to implore the chemistry education community to participate in these efforts now.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Containing Passivation Layer via Surface Chelation for Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minimizing surface defect is vital to further improve power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed a passivator trifluoroacetamidine (TFA) to suppress CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx film defects. The amidine group of TFA can strongly chelate onto the perovskite surface to suppress the iodide vacancy, strengthened by additional hydrogen bonds. Moreover, three fluorine atoms allow strong intermolecular connection via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus constructing a robust shield against moisture. The TFA&#8208;treated PSCs exhibit remarkably suppressed recombination, yielding the record PCEs of 21.35% and 17.21% for 0.09 cm2 and 1.0 cm2 device areas, both of which are the highest for all&#8208;inorganic PSCs so far. The device also achieves a PCE of 39.78% under indoor illumination, the highest for all&#8208;inorganic indoor photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, TFA greatly improves device ambient stability by preserving 93% of the initial PCE after 960 h.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing conjugated small molecules (CSM) with intense NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8208;1700 nm) absorption for phototheranostic is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge due to a lack of reliable design guidelines. This study reports a high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II CSM for phototheranostic by tailoring molecular planarity. A series of CSM show bathochromic absorption extended to the NIR&#8208;II region upon the increasing thiophene number, but an excessive number of thiophene results in decreased NIR&#8208;IIa (1300&#8208;1400 nm) brightness and photothermal effects. Further introduction of terminal nonconjugated alkyl chain can enhance NIR&#8208;II absorption coefficient, NIR&#8208;IIa brightness, and photothermal effects. Mechanism studies ascribe this overall enhancement to molecular planarity stemming from the collective contribution of donor/side&#8208;chain engineering. This finding directs the design of NIR&#8208;II CSM by rational manipulating molecular planarity to perform 1064 nm mediated phototheranostic at high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Solid Electrolyte Interfaces towards Homogeneous Na Deposition: Theoretical Guidelines for Electrolyte Additives and Superior High&#8208;Rate Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic Na is a promising metal anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Nevertheless, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and uncontrollable Na dendrite growth lead to disastrous short circuit and poor cycle life. Through phase field and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, we first predict that the sodium bromide (NaBr) with the lowest Na ion diffusion energy barrier among sodium halogen compounds (NaX, X = F, Cl, Br, I) is the ideal SEI composition to induce the spherical Na deposition for suppressing dendrite growth. Then, 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzene (1,2&#8208;DBB) additive is introduced into the common fluoroethylene carbonate&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte (the corresponding SEI has high mechanical stability) to construct a desirable NaBr&#8208;rich stable SEI layer. When the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell utilizes the electrolyte with 1,2&#8208;DBB additive, an extraordinary capacity retention of 94% is achieved after 2000 cycles at a high rate of 10 C. This study provides a design philosophy for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal anode and can be expanded to other metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradable high density polyethylene&#8208;like material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel polyester material generated from readily available biobased 1,18&#8208;octadecanedicarboxylic acid and ethylene glycol possesses a polyethylene&#8208;like solid&#8208;state structure and also tensile properties similar to high density polyethylene (HDPE). Despite its crystallinity, high melting point (Tm = 96&#160;&#176;C) and hydrophobic nature, polyester&#8208;2,18 is subject to rapid and complete hydrolytic degradation in in vitro assays with isolated naturally occurring enzymes. Under industrial composting conditions (ISO standard 14855&#8208;1) the material is biodegraded with mineralization above 95&#160;% within two months. Reference studies with polyester&#8209;18,18 (Tm = 99 &#176;C) reveal a strong impact of the nature of the diol repeating unit on degradation rates, possibly related to the density of ester groups in the amorphous phase</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating Oxidation State and Surface Ligand Motifs with the Selectivity of CO2 Photoreduction to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design for non&#8208;Cu&#8208;based catalysts with the function of producing C2+ products requires systematic knowledge of the intrinsic connection between the surface state as well as the catalytic activity and selectivity. In this work, photochemical in&#8208;situ spectral surface characteristic technique combined with the first principle calculations (DFT) were applied to investigate the relationships among the composition of surface states, coordinated motifs, and catalytic selectivity of the titanium oxynitride catalyst. By adopting the process of CO2 photoreduction, we found that C2 product selectivity is positively correlated with the surface Ti2+/Ti3+ ratio while the surface oxidation state is regulated and controlled by coordinated motifs of N&#8208;Ti&#8208;O/V[O], which can reduce the potential dimerization energy barriers of *CO&#8208;CO* and promote the spontaneous formation of the subsequent *CO&#8208;CH2* intermediate. On the contrary, relatively high or low N/O coordination ratios will cause imbalance of coordination motifs in reducing surface states and abate the hydrogenation barriers of the methoxy group, thus facilitating methane formation. Such phenomenon provides a new design perspective and by such, researchers make a step close to the accurate production of photo&#8208;transformed CO2 products.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;time Observation of Macroscopic Helical Morphologies under OM: A Curious Case of &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking Driven Molecular Self&#8208;assembly of an Organic Gelator Devoid of Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular assemblies such as tubules/helix/double helix/helical tape etc. usually belong to submicron size domain preventing direct observation of their formation under OM. These assemblies in their chiral&#8208;pure form are important materials for potential applications. Herein, we report a rare phenomenon wherein a small organic molecule &#8208; a benzonitrile derivative of terpyridine ((4&#8208;CNPhe)4PyTerp) was able to produce intriguing macroscopic helical morphologies of &#956;M length scale in its supramolecular gel form in pure DMSO. Formation of such self&#8208;assembled structures could easily be monitored/maneuvered with under OM. Both optical and SEM/TEM&#160;techniques revealed that they were crystalline, stable under acidic vapour (6N HCl), completely destroyed under strong acidic vapour (12N HCl) which could be brought back to its original state by scavenging the protons under ammonia vapour. These properties appear to be unique to the title compound as the other related derivatives (see Figure 1) failed to display such assembly structures. SXRD studies of all the compounds including the title compound revealed that weak interactions such as &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking played crucial roles in the formation of such morphologies displayed by ((4&#8208;CNPhe)4PyTerp). Molecular Dynamic simulation studies revealed that optimal values of dielectric constant of the gelling solvent (DMSO) and of the gelator&#8208;solvent interaction strength are required to achieve a balance aggregation behaviour in order to form such open gel&#8208;network structures. Interestingly, DMSO gel of the title compound in its paper strip quoted form could be exploited in sensing application of an environmentally hazardous anion namely dichromate by fluorescence quenching. The results presented herein not only provide rare opportunities to experience real time observation of the formation of such macroscopic assemblies but also afford molecular level insights of the mechanism of formation of such assembly structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Transmembrane Transport of Exogenous Lithium Ions through Rationally Designed Supramolecular Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium ions have been applied in the clinic in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. In this work, we report artificial supramolecular lithium channels built by using pore&#8208;containing small aromatic molecules. Through adjusting lumen size and coordination numbers, we discover that one of supramolecular channels shows unprecedented transmembrane transport property for exogenous lithium ions with a Li+/Na+&#160;selectivity ratio of 23.0, which is in the same level with that of natural Na+channels. Furthermore, four coordination sites inside channels are found to be the basic requirement for ion transport function. Importantly, this artificial lithium channel displays very low transport activity for physiological Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+&#160;ions. Highly selective Li+channel may become an important tool for studying physiological role of intracellular lithium ions, especially in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Oral and Transdermal Protein Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein and peptide drugs are predominantly administered by injection to achieve high bioavailability, but this greatly compromises patient compliance. Oral and transdermal drug delivery with minimal invasiveness and high adherence represent attractive alternatives to injection administration. However, oral and transdermal administration of bioactive proteins must overcome biological barriers, namely the gastrointestinal and skin barriers, respectively. The rapid development of new materials and technologies promises to address these physiological obstacles. This review provides an overview of the latest advances in oral and transdermal protein delivery, including chemical strategies, synthetic nanoparticles, medical microdevices, and biomimetic systems for oral administration, as well as chemical enhancers, physical approaches, and microneedles in transdermal delivery. We also discuss challenges and future perspectives of the field with a focus on innovation and translation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoenzymatic Strategy for&#160; Radical&#8208;mediated Stereoselective Hydroalkylation with Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene insertion reactions initiated with diazo compounds have been widely used to develop unnatural enzymatic reactions. However, the alternative functionalization of diazo compounds in enzymatic processes has been unexploited. Herein, we developed a photoenzymatic strategy for the radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydroalkylation with diazo compounds. This method generates carbon&#8208;centered radicals via an ene&#8208;reductase catalyzed photoinduced electron transfer process from diazo compounds, enabling the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds in good yields and stereoselectivities. This work further expands the reaction patterns in photo&#8208;biocatalysis and offers a new approach to solving the selectivity challenges of radical&#8208;mediated reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Positioning of Metal Ions to Stabilize Open Tin Sites in Beta Zeolite for Catalytic Conversion of Sugars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Via hydrothermal synthesis of Sn&#8208;Al gels, mild dealumination and ion exchange, a bimetallic Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta catalyst was prepared which can convert glucose to methyl lactate (MLA) and methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG) in methanol at yields of 71.2% and 10.2%, respectively. Results from solid&#8208;state MAS NMR, XPS, TEM, spectroscopic analysis, probe&#8208;TPD, and DFT calculations conclusively reveal that the openness of the Sn sites, such as by the formation of [(SiO)3&#8208;Sn&#8208;OH] entities, is governed by an adjacent metal cation such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+. This relies on the low structure&#8208;defective pore channel, provided by the current synthesis scheme, and the specific silica hydroxyl anchor point is associated with the incorporation of Sn for additional and precise metal ion localization. The presence of metal cations significantly improved the catalytic performance of Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta for glucose isomerization and conversion to MLA of sugar compared with Sn&#8208;Beta.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Photo&#8208;Crosslinking and Photo&#8208;Sensitizing Properties for Synthetic Fluorescent Protein Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike previous works reporting on their fluorescence applications, this work discovered that fluorescence protein chromophore analogs can undergo triplet excited state, enabling photo&#8208;crosslinking and photo&#8208;sensitizing chemistries. Exploration of these synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores resulted in photo&#8208;crosslinkers for biomolecules, photo&#8208;catalysts for organic reactions, and photosensitizers for chromophore&#8208;assisted light inactivation and photodynamic therapies.







Abstract
Synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores have been reported for their singlet state fluorescence properties and applications in bioimaging, but rarely for the triplet state chemistries. Herein, we enabled their photo&#8208;sensitizing and photo&#8208;crosslinking properties through rational modulations. Extension of molecular conjugation and introduction of heavy atoms promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species. Unlike other photosensitizers, these chromophores selectively photo&#8208;crosslinked aggregated proteins and uncovered the interactome profiles. We also exemplified their general applications in chromophore&#8208;assisted light inactivation, photodynamic therapy and photo induced polymerization. Theoretical calculation, pathway analysis and transient absorption spectroscopy provided mechanistic insights for this triplet state chemistry. Overall, this work expands the function and application of synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores by enabling their triplet excited state properties.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Nanoconfinement Effect on Nanoreactor via Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoconfinement in mesoporous nanoarchitectures could dramatically change molecular transport and reaction kinetics during electrochemical process. A molecular&#8208;level understanding of nanoconfinement and mass transport is critical for the applications, but a proper route to study it is lacking. Herein, we develop a single nanoreactor electrochemiluminescence (SNECL) microscopy based on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle to directly visualize in situ nanoconfinement&#8208;enhanced electrochemical reactions at the single molecule level. Meanwhile, mass transport capability of single nanoreactor, reflected as long decay time and recovery ability, is monitored and simulated with a high spatial resolution. The nanoconfinement effects in our system also enable imaging single proteins on cellular membrane. Our SNECL approach may pave the way to decipher the nanoconfinement effects during electrochemical process, and build bridges between mesoporous nanoarchitectures and potential electrochemical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoinduced, Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction for the Stereoselective Assembly of C&#8208;Linked Glycosides and Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyst mediated the union of glycosyl halides and redox&#8208;active derivatives of carboxylic acids and amines to deliver C&#8208;alkyl glycosides diastereoselectively under photoinduced conditions. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction of glycosyl nickel species with alkyl radicals generated by visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted fragmentation of EDA complexes is amenable to the late&#8208;stage glycosylation of complex bioactive molecules and oligopeptides.







Abstract
C&#8208;Alkyl glycosides and glycoproteins exist in natural products and are prized for their role as carbohydrate mimics in drug design. However, a practical strategy that merges glycosyl donors with readily accessible reagents, derived from abundant carboxylic acid and amine feedstocks, is yet to be conceived. Herein, we show that a nickel catalyst promotes C&#8722;C coupling between glycosyl halides and aliphatic acids or primary amines (converted into redox&#8208;active electrophiles in one step), in the presence of Hantzsch ester and LiI (or Et3N) under blue LED illumination to deliver C&#8208;alkyl glycosides with high diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies support the photoinduced formation of alkyl radicals that react with a glycosyl nickel species generated in situ to facilitate cross&#8208;coupling. Through this manifold, innate CO2H and NH2 motifs embedded within amino acids and oligopeptides are selectively capped and functionalized to afford glycopeptide conjugates through late&#8208;stage glycosylation.

         <title>Aptamer Inhibits Tumor Growth by Leveraging Cellular Proteasomal Degradation System to Degrade c&#8208;Met in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new mechanism where aptamer leverages cellular proteasomal degradation system to degrade protein for cancer treatment. A DNA aptamer binds to extracellular domain of mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;Met), and induces c&#8208;Met phosphorylation at Y1003 and Y1349. The phosphorylation of Y1003 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B&#8208;lineage lymphoma (c&#8208;cbl), which causes c&#8208;Met ubiquitination and degradation in proteasome.







Abstract
Current action mechanisms for aptamer&#8208;based therapeutics depend on occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology to mediate protein functions. We report a new mechanism where aptamers leverage cellular proteasomal degradation system to degrade proteins for cancer treatment. A DNA aptamer (hereinafter referred to as c&#8208;Met&#8208;Ap) binds to the extracellular domain of mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;Met) and selectively induces c&#8208;Met phosphorylation at Y1003 and Y1349. The phosphorylation of Y1003 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B&#8208;lineage lymphoma, causing c&#8208;Met ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Furthermore, c&#8208;Met&#8208;Ap can induce a decrease in the heterodimeric partner proteins of c&#8208;Met and the downstream effector proteins in the c&#8208;Met signal axis, effectively inhibiting tumor growth in A549 tumor&#8208;bearing BALB/c mice. Our study uncovers a novel, actionable mechanism for aptamer therapeutics and opens a new avenue for developing highly efficient anticancer drugs.

         <title>Ordered Macro/Microporous Ionic Organic Framework for Efficient Separation of Toxic Pollutants from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charged ordered macro&#8208;micro hierarchical porous organic framework with grafted viologen units is synthesized by a solid&#8208;state acid&#8208;vapor assisted synthetic strategy. The material demonstrates faster diffusion of analytes and ultrafast adsorption potency toward a wider range of organic&#8208;inorganic toxic pollutants from water.







Abstract
In case of pollutant segregation, fast mass diffusion is a fundamental criterion in order to achieve improved performance. The rapid mass transport through porous materials can be achieved by availing large open pores followed by easy and complete accessibility of functional sites. Inducing macroporosity into such materials could serve as ideal solution providing access to large macropores that offer unhindered transport of analyte and full exposure to interactive sites. Moreover, the challenge to configure the ionic&#8208;functionality with macroporosity could emerge as an unparalleled avenue toward pollutants separation. Herein, we strategized a synthetic protocol for construction of a positively charged hierarchically&#8208;porous ordered interconnected macro&#8208;structure of organic framework where the size and number of macropores can easily be tuned. The ordered macropores with strong electrostatic interaction synergistically exhibited ultrafast removal efficiency towards various toxic pollutants.

         <title>Stereoselective Chiral Molecular Carbon Imides Featuring 12&#8208;Fold [5]helicenes Around Four Cores
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular carbon imide featuring 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes around four cores has been constructed using perylene diimide units. The structure exhibits high stereoselectivity and chirality, good solubility, and stability. Although there are four possible pairs of enantiomers with D3 symmetry, the results verify that the obtained structure belongs to the one having the lowest energy. The enantiomers can also be separated by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase.







Abstract
Despite the great progress in research on molecular carbons containing multiple helicenes around one core, realizing the stereoselectivity of carbons containing multiple helicenes around more cores is still a great challenge. Herein, molecular carbon C204 featuring 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes around four cores was successfully constructed by using nine perylene diimide (PDI) units, and exhibits good solubility and stability. Despite 256 possible stereoisomers caused by the 12&#8208;fold [5]helicenes, we only obtained one pair of enantiomers with D3 symmetry. There are four possible pairs of enantiomers with D3 symmetry, namely 7A, 7B, 7C and 7D. Theoretical and experimental results verify that the obtained structure belongs to 7C, which has the lowest energy. The enantiomers can also be separated by chiral HPLC. These results suggest that choosing PDIs as building blocks can not only improve the solubility and stability but also realize the stereoselectivity and chirality of molecular carbons.

         <title>Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode in a Dilute Aqueous Electrolyte Enabled by a pH Buffer Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive, NH4H2PO4, is proposed to regulate uniform zinc deposition and to suppress side reactions in a dilute aqueous electrolyte. Due to the pH buffer chemistry of NH4+ and (H2PO4)&#8722; and the &#8220;shielding effect&#8221; of NH4+, promoted Coulombic efficiencies and lifespans of Zn based symmetric/asymmetric cells can be achieved.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries have drawn increasing attention due to the intrinsic safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness and high energy density. However, parasitic reactions and non&#8208;uniform dendrite growth on the Zn anode side impede their application. Herein, a multifunctional additive, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NHP), is introduced to regulate uniform zinc deposition and to suppress side reactions. The results show that the NH4+ tends to be preferably absorbed on the Zn surface to form a &#8220;shielding effect&#8221; and blocks the direct contact of water with Zn. Moreover, NH4+ and (H2PO4)&#8722; jointly maintain pH values of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Consequently, the NHP additive enables highly reversible Zn plating/stripping behaviors in Zn//Zn and Zn//Cu cells. Furthermore, the electrochemical performances of Zn//MnO2 full cells and Zn//active carbon (AC) capacitors are improved. This work provides an efficient and general strategy for modifying Zn plating/stripping behaviors and suppressing side reactions in mild aqueous electrolyte.

         <title>Doping/Alloying Pathways to Lead&#8208;Free Halide Perovskites with Ultimate Photoluminescence Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites emit broadband visible photoluminescence originating from self&#8208;trapped excitonic states. Introduction of &#8220;alien&#8221; metals via doping or alloying into perovskite matrices often results in a dramatic enhancement of both light absorbance and emission. Mechanisms, challenges, and applications of these phenomena constitute the topic of the present Minireview.







Abstract
Tailored modifications of halide lead&#8208;free perovskites (LFPs) via doping/alloying with metal cations have been recognized as a promising pathway to highly efficient inorganic phosphors with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of up to 100&#8201;%. Such materials typically display selective sensitivity to UV light, a broad PL range, and long PL lifetimes as well as a unique compositional variability and stability&#8212;an ideal combination for many light&#8208;harvesting applications. This Minireview presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in doped LFPs, focusing on the reports published mostly in the last two to three years. We discuss the factors determining the efficiency and spectral parameters of the broadband PL of doped LFPs depending on the dopant and host matrix, both in micro&#8208; and nanocrystalline states, address the most relevant challenges this rapidly developing research area is facing, and outline the most promising concepts for further progress in this field.

         <title>Communication and Cross&#8208;Regulation between Chemically Fueled Sender and Receiver Reaction Networks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chemical&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven non&#8208;equilibrium DNA&#8208;based enzymatic reaction networks have been coupled with a RNA transcription system to achieve cross&#8208;regulation and feedback between each other. This approach gives different types of signal outputs, including repression, promotion, repression&#8208;recovery, and promotion&#8208;stop.







Abstract
Nature connects multiple fuel&#8208;driven chemical/enzymatic reaction networks (CRNs/ERNs) via cross&#8208;regulation to hierarchically control biofunctions for a tailored adaption in complex sensory landscapes. Herein, we introduce a facile example of communication and cross&#8208;regulation among two fuel&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;based ERNs regulated by a concatenated RNA transcription regulator. ERN1 (&#8220;sender&#8221;) is designed for the fuel&#8208;driven promoter formation for T7 RNA polymerase, which activates RNA transcription. The produced RNA can deactivate or activate DNA in ERN2 (&#8220;receiver&#8221;) by toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, leading to a communication between two ERNs. The RNA from ERN1 can repress or promote the fuel&#8208;driven state of ERN2; ERN2 in turn feedbacks to regulate the lifetime of ERN1. Furthermore, the incorporation of RNase H allows for RNA degradation and enables the autonomous recovery of ERN2. We believe that concatenation of multiple CRNs/ERNs provides a basis for the design of more elaborate autonomous regulatory mechanisms in systems chemistry and synthetic biology.

         <dc:description>
The covalent modification of graphene supported on a surface makes it possible to control the graphene reactivity, tailor its electronic properties, and immobilize active molecules. Based on a critical comparison of the different chemical routes, this Review provides up&#8208;to&#8208;date guidelines for working with chemically modified 2D materials on a surface.







Abstract
In the last decade, the use of graphene supported on solid surfaces has broadened its scope and applications, and graphene has acquire a promising role as a major component of high&#8208;performance electronic devices. In this context, the chemical modification of graphene has become essential. In particular, covalent modification offers key benefits, including controllability, stability, and the facility to be integrated into manufacturing operations. In this Review, we critically comment on the latest advances in the covalent modification of supported graphene on substrates. We analyze the different chemical modifications with special attention to radical reactions. In this context, we review the latest achievements in reactivity control, tailoring electronic properties, and introducing active functionalities. Finally, we extended our analysis to other emerging 2D materials supported on surfaces, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal oxides, and elemental analogs of graphene.

         <title>Skeleton&#8208;Reorganizing Coupling Reactions of Cycloheptatriene and Cycloalkenones with Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual catalytic coupling reaction of cycloheptatriene and cycloalkenones with amines proceeds through a skeleton&#8208;reorganization process for the selective synthesis of fused 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reactions proceed through a retro&#8208;Mannich&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening and a subsequent intramolecular Povarov process.







Abstract
Skeletal reorganization reactions have emerged as an intriguing tool for converting readily available compounds into complicated molecules inaccessible by traditional methods. Herein, we report a unique skeleton&#8208;reorganizing coupling reaction of cycloheptatriene and cycloalkenones with amines. In the presence of Rh/acid catalysis, cycloheptatriene can selectively couple with anilines to deliver fused 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline products. Mechanistic studies indicate that the retro&#8208;Mannich type ring&#8208;opening and subsequent intramolecular Povarov reaction account for the ring reorganization. Our mechanistic studies also revealed that skeleton&#8208;reorganizing amination between anilines and cycloalkenones can be achieved with acid. The synthetic utilization of this skeleton&#8208;reorganizing coupling reaction was showcased with a gram&#8208;scale reaction, synthetic derivatizations, and the late&#8208;stage modification of commercial drugs.

         <title>An Antitumor Dual&#8208;Responsive Host&#8208;Guest Supramolecular Polymer Based on Hypoxia&#8208;Cleavable Azocalix[4]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A host&#8211;guest dual&#8208;response supramolecular polymer was prepared based on a dimeric hypoxia&#8208;responsive azocalixrene and GSH&#8208;cleavable CPT dimer (D&#8208;CPT), which further self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles and exhibits excellent antitumor therapy performance.







Abstract
The exploitation of specific guests which can respond to external stimuli is the main approach for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers (SPs) based on host&#8211;guest interactions. Most functional guests, however, fail to manifest stimuli&#8208;responses. Herein, a hypoxia&#8208;responsive dimeric azocalixarene (D&#8208;SAC4A) with outstanding hosting properties was used as the macrocyclic building block for the preparation of host stimuli&#8208;responsive SPs. Since azocalixarenes can also be compatible with stimuli&#8208;responsive guests, an antitumor drug, camptothecin (CPT), was chosen and linked via a disulfide&#8208;containing linker to afford a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive ditropic guest (D&#8208;CPT). A unique dual&#8208;responsive SP was obtained by 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixing of D&#8208;SAC4A and D&#8208;CPT in water, which further assembled into SP nanoparticles (DSPNs). DSPNs displayed outstanding stability against dilution and biological interferants, as well as precise CPT&#8208;release under GSH and hypoxia conditions. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the good biosafety and tumor&#8208;suppressive effects of DSPNs.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Upgrading to Triethanolamine by Bromine&#8208;Assisted C2H4 Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CO2 upgrading strategy was developed by using Br&#8208;assisted C2H4 oxidation, which exploits the preferential adsorption of *Br over *OH on metal phthalocyanine electrocatalysts. The C2H4 oxidation was further coupled with the nitrite reduction to form triethanolamine. Using two electrolysis cells in tandem, the capability of electrochemical fixation of CO2 and nitrite ions into triethanolamine at ambient conditions was demonstrated.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is a promising approach for converting this greenhouse gas into value&#8208;added chemicals, while the capability of producing products with longer carbon chains (Cn&gt;3) is limited. Herein, we demonstrate the Br&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of ethylene (C2H4), a major CO2 electroreduction product, into 2&#8208;bromoethanol by electro&#8208;generated bromine on metal phthalocyanine catalysts. Due to the preferential formation of Br2 over *O or Cl2 to activate the C=C bond, a high partial current density of producing 2&#8208;bromoethanol (46.6&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2) was obtained with 87.2&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency. Further coupling with the electrocatalytic nitrite reduction to ammonia at the cathode allowed the production of triethanolamine with six carbon atoms. Moreover, by coupling a CO2 electrolysis cell for in situ C2H4 generation and a C2H4 oxidation/nitrite reduction cell, the capability of upgrading of CO2 and nitrite into triethanolamine was demonstrated.

         <title>A Nanocomposite of Bismuth Clusters and Bi2O2CO3 Sheets for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst derived from Bi2S3 is very powerful for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid, achieving a current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% and a single&#8208;pass formate yield of 67&#8201;%. The active catalyst is composed of Bi nanoclusters on Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets and the interfacial Bi site plays a pivotal role.







Abstract
The renewable&#8208;electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to formic acid would contribute to establishing a carbon&#8208;neutral society. The current catalyst suffers from limited activity and stability under high selectivity and the ambiguous nature of active sites. Herein, we report a powerful Bi2S3&#8208;derived catalyst that demonstrates a current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% at &#8722;0.95&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The energy conversion efficiency and single&#8208;pass yield of formate reach 80&#8201;% and 67&#8201;%, respectively, and the durability reaches 100&#8197;h at an industrial&#8208;relevant current density. Pure formic acid with a concentration of 3.5&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 has been produced continuously. Our operando spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal the dynamic evolution of the catalyst into a nanocomposite composed of Bi0 clusters and Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets and the pivotal role of Bi0&#8722;Bi2O2CO3 interface in CO2 activation and conversion.

         <title>Umpolung Asymmetric 1,5&#8208;Conjugate Addition via Palladium Hydride Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional umpolung protocol was demonstrated for novel 1,5&#8208;conjugate additions via palladium hydride catalyst. Three catalytic systems including 1,5&#8208;addition cascade with inter&#8208; and intramolecular [3+2] cyclization and migratory 1,5&#8208;addition were established via palladium or palladium/organo&#8208;cocatalysis.







Abstract
Electronically matched nucleophilic 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition has been well studied and widely applied in synthetic areas. In contrast, nucleophilic 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition represents an electronically forbidden process and is considered unfeasible. Here, we describe modular protocols for 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition reactions via palladium hydride catalysis. Both palladium and synergistic Pd/organocatalyst systems are developed to catalyze 1,5&#8208;conjugate reaction, followed by inter&#8208; or intramolecular [3+2] cyclization. A migratory 1,5&#8208;addition protocol is established to corroborate the feasibility of this umpolung concept. The 1,5&#8208;addition products are conveniently transformed into a series of privileged enantioenriched motifs, including polysubstituted tetrahydrofuran, dihydrofuran, cyclopropane, cyclobutane, azetidine, oxetane, thietane, spirocycle and bridged rings. Preliminary mechanistic studies corroborate the involvement of palladium hydride catalysis.

         <title>A Multifunctional Polymer as an Interfacial Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multifunctional polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide), was designed and utilized to synergistically passivate the under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+ and anchor the I&#8208; of the [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedron on the surface of a perovskite film. This passivation leads to an enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12 to 1.22&#8197;V and improved stability in solar cell devices, with the device maintaining 95&#8201;% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 1000&#8197;h of maximum power point tracking. Additionally, a large&#8208;area solar cell device was fabricated using this approach, achieving a PCE of 20.64&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;cation defects and halogen&#8208;anion defects in perovskite films are critical to the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a random polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide) (PMMA&#8208;AM), was synthesized to serve as an interfacial passivation layer for synergistically passivating the under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+ and anchor the I&#8208; of the [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedron. Additionally, the interfacial PMMA&#8208;AM passivation layer cannot be destroyed during the hole transport layer deposition because of its low solubility in chlorobenzene. This passivation leads to an enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12 to 1.22&#8197;V and improved stability in solar cell devices, with the device maintaining 95&#8201;% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 1000&#8197;h of maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Mutability&#8208;Landscape&#8208;Guided Engineering of l&#8208;Threonine Aldolase Revealing the Prelog Rule in Mediating Diastereoselectivity of C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Prelog rule in l&#8208;threonine aldolase holds that when the C&#945; anion of PLP&#8208;Gly attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of the aldehyde from the re&#8208;face, the (2S,3S)&#8208;configured product is formed, whereas attack from the si&#8208;face forms the (2S,3R)&#8208;configured product. Guided by this rule, mutants of LTA with improved diastereoselectivity of 99.2&#8201;%syn and 97.4&#8201;%anti were obtained.







Abstract
l&#8208;threonine aldolase (LTA) catalyzes C&#8722;C bond synthesis with moderate diastereoselectivity. In this study, with LTA from Cellulosilyticum sp (CpLTA) as an object, a mutability landscape was first constructed by performing saturation mutagenesis at substrate access tunnel amino acids. The combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test/iterative saturation mutation (CAST/ISM) strategy was then used to tune diastereoselectivity. As a result, the diastereoselectivity of mutant H305L/Y8H/V143R was improved from 37.2&#8201;%syn to 99.4&#8201;%syn. Furthermore, the diastereoselectivity of mutant H305Y/Y8I/W307E was inverted to 97.2&#8201;%anti. Based on insight provided by molecular dynamics simulations and coevolution analysis, the Prelog rule was employed to illustrate the diastereoselectivity regulation mechanism of LTA, holding that the asymmetric formation of the C&#8722;C bond was caused by electrons attacking the carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate aldehyde from the re or si face. The study would be useful to expand LTA applications and guide engineering of other C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes.

         <title>Selecting Better Biocatalysts by Complementing Recoded Bacteria
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in vivo selection strategy is presented, in which bacteria addicted to non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are complemented by enzymes that can yield these building blocks from synthetic precursors. As growth rates under selective conditions correlate with enzyme activities, serial passaging elicited better biocatalysts from populations harboring enzyme libraries. The platform was used to improve the activity of carbamoylases for ncAA&#8208;precursors.







Abstract
In vivo selections are powerful tools for the directed evolution of enzymes. However, the need to link enzymatic activity to cellular survival makes selections for enzymes that do not fulfill a metabolic function challenging. Here, we present an in vivo selection strategy that leverages recoded organisms addicted to non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) to evolve biocatalysts that can provide these building blocks from synthetic precursors. We exemplify our platform by engineering carbamoylases that display catalytic efficiencies more than five orders of magnitude higher than those observed for the wild&#8208;type enzyme for ncAA&#8208;precursors. As growth rates of bacteria under selective conditions correlate with enzymatic activities, we were able to elicit improved variants from populations by performing serial passaging. By requiring minimal human intervention and no specialized equipment, we surmise that our strategy will become a versatile tool for the in vivo directed evolution of diverse biocatalysts.

         <title>Highly Efficient Organosulfur and Lithium&#8208;Metal Hosts Enabled by C@Fe3N Sponge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C@Fe3N with both lithiophilic property and catalytic feature can simultaneously address the growth of dendritic Li in the anode and intermediates shuttling from the cathode. These synergistic effect of C@Fe3N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1&#8201;000 cycles in a Li&#8208;organosulfur full cell with practically necessary parameters.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;organosulfur (Li&#8208;OS) batteries, despite possessing high theoretical specific capacity, encounter a few practical challenges, including unsatisfactory lifespan and low active material utilization under realistic conditions. Here, diisoropyl xanthogen polysulfide (DIXPS) has been selected as a model organosulfur compound to investigate the practical feasibility of Li&#8208;OS batteries under realistic conditions. A well&#8208;designed freestanding carbon sponge decorated with Fe3N nanoparticles (C@Fe3N) is introduced into the Li&#8208;OS cells as a scaffold for both Li and DIXPS. The lithiophilic property of the C@Fe3N host guides uniform lithium deposition at the anode, and the catalysis of the DIXPS conversion reaction promotes the kinetics at the cathode. Impressively, the synergistic effect of C@Fe3N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1&#8201;000 cycles in a Li&#8208;OS full cell under realistic conditions.

&lt;p&gt;C@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N with both lithiophilic property and catalytic feature can simultaneously address the growth of dendritic Li in the anode and intermediates shuttling from the cathode. These synergistic effect of C@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1&#8201;000 cycles in a Li-organosulfur full cell with practically necessary parameters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium-organosulfur (Li-OS) batteries, despite possessing high theoretical specific capacity, encounter a few practical challenges, including unsatisfactory lifespan and low active material utilization under realistic conditions. Here, diisoropyl xanthogen polysulfide (DIXPS) has been selected as a model organosulfur compound to investigate the practical feasibility of Li-OS batteries under realistic conditions. A well-designed freestanding carbon sponge decorated with Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N nanoparticles (C@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N) is introduced into the Li-OS cells as a scaffold for both Li and DIXPS. The lithiophilic property of the C@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N host guides uniform lithium deposition at the anode, and the catalysis of the DIXPS conversion reaction promotes the kinetics at the cathode. Impressively, the synergistic effect of C@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N leads to an extremely stable cycling performance over 1&#8201;000 cycles in a Li-OS full cell under realistic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Based TREM2 Inhibitor Suppresses Tumors by Remodeling the Immunosuppressive Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum complex OPA shows a potent chemoimmunotherapeutic effect on tumors by impeding DNA replication and inhibiting triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells&#8208;2 (TREM2). OPA promotes the polarization of macrophages from immunosuppressive M2 to tumoricidal M1 phenotype, and stimulates dendritic, cytotoxic T, and natural killer cells to restrain cancer cells. By transforming the tumor microenvironment, OPA overcomes the tumor resistance to platinum drugs.







Abstract
Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells&#8208;2 (TREM2) is a key pro&#8208;tumorigenic marker of tumor&#8208;infiltrating macrophages, showing potent immunosuppressive activity in tumor microenvironment. A platinum(IV) complex OPA derived from oxaliplatin (OP) and artesunate (ART) exhibited direct cytotoxicity against human colon cancer cells and immunomodulatory activity to inhibit TREM2 on macrophages in vitro and vivo. Furthermore, OPA deterred the tumor growth in mouse models bearing MC38 colorectal tumor by reducing the number of CD206+ and CX3CR1+ immunosuppressive macrophages; it also promoted the expansion and infiltration of immunostimulatory dendritic, cytotoxic T, and natural killer cells. OPA is the first small&#8208;molecular TREM2 inhibitor capable of relieving immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhancing chemical anticancer efficiency of a platinum drug, thus showing typical characteristics of a chemoimmunotherapeutic agent.

         <title>Bioconjugation via Hetero&#8208;Selective Clamping of Two Different Amines with ortho&#8208;Phthalaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple ortho&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent enables a facile and broadly applicable bioconjugation strategy via hetero&#8208;selective clamping of two different endogenous amino handles such as &#1013;&#8208;NH2 of lysine and &#945;&#8208;NH2 of &#945;&#8208;amino acids without any pre&#8208;functionalization.







Abstract
Amino groups are common in both natural and synthetic compounds and offer a very attractive class of endogenous handles for bioconjugation. However, the ability to differentiate two types of amino groups and join them with high hetero&#8208;selectivity and efficiency in a complex setting remains elusive. Herein, we report a new method for bioconjugation via one&#8208;pot chemoselective clamping of two different amine nucleophiles using a simple ortho&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent. Various &#945;&#8208;amino acids, aryl amines, and secondary amines can be crosslinked to the &#1013;&#8208;amino side chain of lysine on peptides or proteins with high efficiency and hetero&#8208;selectivity. This method offers a simple and powerful means to crosslink small molecule drugs, imaging probes, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, and even virus particles without any pre&#8208;functionalization.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Cyclisation Reaction for the Synthesis of Highly&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydroquinolines and Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild one&#8208;pot condensation/light&#8208;mediated cyclisation reaction leading to a diverse range of densely functionalised tetrahydroquinoline and quinoline products is described, proceeding via divergent electrocyclisation and photoredox pathways, respectively. Thorough exploration of the reaction substrate scope, reaction intermediates and mechanistic pathways uncover the key driving forces for the observed reactivity and stereochemistry.







Abstract
Condensation of 2&#8208;vinylanilines and conjugated aldehydes followed by an efficient light&#8208;mediated cyclisation selectively yields either substituted tetrahydroquinolines with typically high dr, or in the presence of an iridium photocatalyst the synthesis of quinoline derivatives is demonstrated. These atom economical processes require mild conditions, with the substrate scope demonstrating excellent site selectivity and functional group tolerance, including azaarene&#8208;bearing substrates. A thorough experimental mechanistic investigation explores multiple pathways and the key role that imine and iminium intermediates play in the absorption of visible light to generate reactive excited states. The synthetic utility of the reactions is demonstrated on gram scale quantities in both batch and flow, alongside further manipulation of the medicinally relevant products.

         <title>Reversible Dihydrogen Activation and Catalytic H/D Exchange with Group 10 Heterometallic Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a hexagonal planar palladium complex with a [PdMg3H3] core with H2 is reversible and leads to the formation of a new [PdMg2H4] tetrahydride species. DFT calculations support a mechanism for H2 activation involving a ligand&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to Pd. These findings were exploited to develop a catalytic protocol for H/D exchange into magnesium hydride and zinc hydride bonds.







Abstract
Reaction of a hexagonal planar palladium complex featuring a [PdMg3H3] core with H2 is reversible and leads to the formation of a new [PdMg2H4] tetrahydride species alongside an equivalent of a magnesium hydride co&#8208;product [MgH]. While the reversibility of this process prevented isolation of [PdMg2H4], analogous [PtMg2H4] and [PtZn2H4] complexes could be isolated and characterised through independent syntheses. Computational analysis (DFT, AIM, NCIPlot) of the bonding in a series of heterometallic tetrahydride compounds (Ni&#8211;Pt; Mg and Zn) suggests that these complexes are best described as square planar with marginal metal&#8208;metal interactions; the strength of which increases slightly as group 10 is descended and increases from Mg to Zn. DFT calculations support a mechanism for H2 activation involving a ligand&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to Pd. These findings were exploited to develop a catalytic protocol for H/D exchange into magnesium hydride and zinc hydride bonds.

         <title>Ru3(CO)12&#8208;Catalyzed Modular Assembly of Hemilabile Ligands by C&#8211;H Activation of Phosphines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hemilabile ligands have been applied extensively in transition metal catalysis, but preparations of these molecules typically require multistep synthesis. Here, modular assembly of diverse phosphine&#8208;amide ligands, including related axially chiral compounds, is first reported through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation of phosphines with isocyanate directed by phosphorus(III) atoms. High reactivity and regioselectivity can be obtained by using a Ru3(CO)12 catalyst with an MPAA ligand. This transformation significantly expands the pool of phosphine&#8208;amide ligands, some of which have shown excellent efficiency for asymmetric catalysis. More broadly, the discovery constitutes a proof of principle for facile construction of hemilabile ligands directly from the parent monodentate phosphines by C&#8211;H activation with ideal atom, step and redox economy. Several dinuclear ruthenium complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealing the key mechanistic features of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>ZnF2&#8208;Riched Inorganic/Organic Hybrid SEI: in&#8208;situ&#8208;Chemical Construction and Performance&#8208;Improving Mechanism for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncontrolled dendrites growth and serious parasitic reactions in aqueous electrolytes, greatly hinder the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery. On the basis of in&#8208;situ&#8208;chemical construction and performance&#8208;improving mechanism, multifunctional fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is introduced into aqueous electrolyte to construct a high&#8208;quality and ZnF2&#8208;riched inorganic/organic hybrid SEI (ZHS) layer on Zn metal anode (ZMA) surface. Notably, FEC additive can regulate the solvated structure of Zn2+ to reduce H2O molecules reactivity. Additionally, the ZHS layer with strong Zn2+ affinity can avoid dendrites formation and hinder the direct contact between the electrolyte and anode. Therefore, the dendrites growth, Zn corrosion, and H2 evolution reaction on ZMA in FEC&#8208;included ZnSO4 electrolyte are highly suppressed. Thus, ZMA in such electrolyte realize a long cycle life over 1000 h and deliver a stable coulombic efficiency of 99.1% after 500 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Pyrazolines and Pyrazoles via [3+2] Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrazolines and pyrazoles are common and important motifs of pharmaceutical agents and agrochemicals. Herein, the first electrochemical approach for their direct synthesis from easily accessible hydrazones and dipolarophiles up to decagram scale is presented. The application of a biphasic system (aqueous/organic) even allows for the conversion of highly sensitive alkenes, wherein inexpensive sodium iodide is employed in a dual role as supporting electrolyte and mediator. In addition, mechanistic insight into the reaction is given by the isolation of key step intermediates. The relevance of the presented reaction is underlined by the synthesis of commercial herbicide safener mefenpyr&#8208;diethyl in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Curvature Dominated Guest&#8208;Induced Nonequilibrium Deformations of Single Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;300 Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the guest&#8208;induced dynamic deformation process of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is vitally important to further increase their stimulus&#8208;response performances. Here we report on the dark&#8208;field microscopic (DFM) imaging approach to in situ monitor the guest&#8208;induced deformation evolution of individual COF&#8208;300 crystals in real time. We observe not only transient and nonequilibrium intermediate deformation states but also local surface curvature&#8208;driven diverse adsorption behaviours of single COF&#8208;300 particles for dichloromethane (DCM), undergoing one, two, and multiple expansion&#8208;contraction deformations as well as contraction&#8208;to&#8208;expansion transition. The surface curvature&#8208;dominated deformations are ascribed to the significant differences in the adsorption capacity for DCM at the curved tip and flat side regions, in which DCM can be adsorbed preferentially by curved tip regions of COF&#8208;300.</dc:description>

         <title>Overall Carbon&#8208;neutral Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 in Molten Salts using a Liquid Metal Sn Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An overall carbon&#8208;neutral CO2 electroreduction requires enhanced conversion efficiency and intensified functionality of CO2&#8208;derived products to balance the carbon footprint from CO2 electroreduction against fixed CO2. A liquid Sn cathode is herein introduced into electrochemical reduction of CO2 in molten salts to fabricate core&#8211;shell Sn&#8211;C spheres (Sn@C). An in&#8208;situ generated Li2SnO3/C directs a self&#8208;template formation of Sn@C. Benefitting from the accelerated reaction kinetics from the liquid Sn cathode and the core&#8211;shell structure of Sn@C, a CO2&#8208;fixation current efficiency higher than 84% and a high reversible lithium&#8208;storage capacity of Sn@C are achieved. The versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by other low melting point metals, such as Zn and Bi. This process integrates energy&#8208;efficient CO2 conversion and template&#8208;free fabrication of value&#8208;added metal&#8211;carbon, achieving an overall carbon&#8208;neutral electrochemical reduction of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Harvesting Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks with Gigantic Al24 Units and their Deconstruction into Molecular Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the vast Al&#8208;oxo molecular cluster chemistry, Al&#8208;based building units for metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) construction are limited in structural diversity and complexity. Synthesis of single crystalline MOFs based on this &#8220;hard&#8221; metal is further complicated by the poor reversibility of the Al&#8211;organic coordination linkages. Here, a strategy to employ two kinds of linkages with distinct strength&#8212;strong Al&#8722;carboxylate linkage and weak Cu&#8722;pyrazol N linkage&#8212;gives FDM&#8208;91 (FDM = Fudan Materials) with gigantic Al24&#8208;based units. After replacing the weak moieties with organic linkers post&#8208;synthetically, two new stable MOFs with exceptional water harvesting capacity (up to 0.53 g g&#8208;1) and outstanding cycling performance are developed. Linkage&#8208;selective dissociation of FDM&#8208;91 further leads to the isolation of the Al24 molecular clusters. The versatile chemistry performed here to reinforce or deconstruct MOFs provides a new way to make important extended and discrete structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanostructured Heterogeneous Catalysts for Bioorthogonal Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal chemistry has inspired a new subarea of artificial chemistry providing a powerful tool to perform novel biocompatible chemospecific reactions in living systems. Complying with the premise that they do not interfere with biological functions, bioorthogonal reactions are increasingly applied in biomedical research, particularly with respect to genetic encoding systems, fluorogenic reactions for bioimaging, or cancer therapy. This review compiles recent advances in the use of heterogeneous catalysts for bioorthogonal reactions. The synthetic strategies of Pd, Au, and Cu&#8208;based materials, their applicability in the activation of caged fluorophores and prodrugs, and the possibilities of using external stimuli to release therapeutic substances within a specific location of a diseased tissue are discussed. Finally, we highlight frontiers in the field, identifying challenges, and propose directions for future development in this emerging field.</dc:description>

         <title>sn&#8208;1&#160;Specificity of Lysophosphatidylcholine Acyltransferase&#8208;1 Revealed by a Mass Spectrometry&#8208;based Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase&#8208;1 (LPCAT1) plays a critical role in the remodeling of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in cellular lipidome. However, evidence is scarce regarding its&#160;sn&#8208;selectivity, viz. the preference of assembling acyl&#8208;Coenzyme A (CoA) at the C1 or C2&#8208;hydroxyl on a glycerol backbone because of difficulty to quantify the thus&#8208;formed PC&#160;sn&#8208;isomers. We have established a multiplexed assay to measure both&#160;sn&#8208; and acyl&#8208;chain selectivity of LPCAT1 toward a mixture of acyl&#8208;CoAs by integrating isomer&#8208;resolving tandem mass spectrometry. Our findings reveal that LPCAT1 shows exclusive&#160;sn&#8208;1 specificity regardless of the identity of acyl&#8208;CoAs. We further confirm that elevated PC 18:1/16:0 relative to its&#160;sn&#8208;isomer results from an increased expression of LPCAT1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue as compared to normal liver tissue. MS imaging via desorption electrospray ionization of PC 18:1/16:0 thus enables&#160;visualization&#160;of HCC margins in human liver tissue at a molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Dilution Analysis Facilitates Aptamer Binding Characterization at the&#160;Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell&#8208;specific aptamers offer a powerful tool to study membrane receptors at the single&#8208;molecule level. Most target receptors of aptamers are highly expressed on the cell surface, but difficult to analyze in situ because of dense distribution and fast velocity. Therefore, we herein propose a random sampling&#8208;based analysis strategy termed ligand dilution analysis (LDA) for easily implemented aptamer&#8208;based receptor study. Receptor density on the cell surface can be calculated based on a regression model. By using a synergistic ligand dilution design, colocalization and differentiation of aptamer and monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding on a single receptor can be realized. Once this is accomplished, precise binding site and detailed aptamer&#8208;receptor binding mode can be further determined using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The ligand dilution strategy also sets the stage for an aptamer&#8208;based dynamics analysis of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional motion and fluctuation of highly expressed receptors on the live cell membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;Dissolved Isostructural Polyoxovanadates to Construct Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We explored a co&#8208;dissolved strategy to embed mono&#8208;dispersed Pt center into V2O5 support via dissolving [PtV9O28]7&#8208; into [V10O28]6&#8208; aqueous solution. The uniform dispersion of [PtV9O28]7&#8208; in [V10O28]6&#8208; solution allows [PtV9O28]7&#8208; to be surrounded by [V10O28]6&#8208; clusters via a freeze&#8208;drying process. The V centers in both [PtV9O28]7&#8208; and [V10O28]6&#8208; were converted into V2O5 via a calcination process to stabilize Pt center. These double separations can effectively prevent the Pt center agglomeration during the high&#8208;temperature conversion process, and achieve 100% utilization of Pt in [PtV9O28]7&#8208;. The resulting Pt&#8208;V2O5 single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts exhibit a CH4 yield of 247.6 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, 25 times higher than that of Pt nanoparticle on the V2O5 support, which was accompanied by the lactic acid photooxidation to form pyruvic acid. Systematical investigations on this unambiguous structure demonstrate an important role of Pt&#8208;O atomic pair synergy for highly efficient CO2 photoreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphology Optimization of the Photoactive Layer through Crystallinity and Miscibility Regulation for High&#8208;performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On the premise of strongly crystalline materials involved, it is a challenge to control the phase separation of bulk&#8208;heterojunction donor/acceptor active layer to fabricate high&#8208;performance polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we develop a molecular design strategy of the third component to synthesize three guest materials (namely BTPT, BTP&#8208;Th, and BTP&#8208;2Th) to address this issue. We investigate and reveal the effect of crystallinity and miscibility of the third component in controlling the phase separation of Y6&#8208;derivatives&#8208;based blend film. As a result, a remarkable power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 18.53% is obtained in the ternary PSC based on PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6 with BTP&#8208;Th as the third component, which is a significant improvement with regard to the efficiency of 17.22% for the control binary device. Our study offers a molecular design strategy to develop a third component for building ternary PSCs in terms of crystallinity and miscibility regulation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A gold nanocluster Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 (PNP = 2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)pyridine, SR = 4&#8208;MeOPhS) consisting of an icosahedral Au13 kernel, two Au2CdS6 staple motifs, and two PNP pincer ligands has been designed, synthesized and well characterized. This cadmium and PNP pincer ligand co&#8208;modified gold nanocluster showed high catalytic efficiency in the KA2 reaction, featuring high TON, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope as well as catalyst recyclability. Comparison of the catalytic performance between Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 and the structurally similar single cadmium (or PNP) modified gold nanoclusters demonstrates that the co&#8208;existence of the cadmium and PNP on the surface is crucial for the high catalytic activity of the gold nanocluster. This work would be enlightening for developing efficient catalysts for cascade reactions&#160;and discovering the catalytic potential of metal nanoclusters in organic transformations.</dc:description>
