      <title>Isotope Effects in Plasmonic Photosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The photoexcitation of plasmonic nanoparticles has been shown to drive multi&#8208;step, multi&#8208;carrier transformations like the conversion of CO2  to hydrocarbons. But for such plasmon&#8208;driven chemistry to be precisely understood and modeled, the critical photo&#8208;initiation step in the reaction cascade must be identified. We meet this goal by measuring H/D and  12C/13C kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) in plasmonic photosynthesis. In particular, we find that the substitution of H2O with D2O slows hydrocarbon production by a factor of 5&#8211;8. This primary H/D KIE leads to the inference that hole&#8208;driven scission of the O&#8211;H bond in H2O is a critical, limiting step in plasmonic photosynthesis. This study advances mechanistic understanding of light&#8208;driven chemical reactions on plasmonic nanoparticles.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Due to their unique properties, fluorinated scaffolds are pivotal compounds in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials science. Over the last years, the development of versatile strategies for the selective synthesis of fluorinated molecules by direct C&#8208;H bond functionalization has attracted a lot of attention.

      <title>Tailoring Crystal Facets of Metal&#8211;Organic Layers to Enhance Photocatalytic Activity for CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>It is common that different crystal facets in metal and metal oxide nanocrystals display different catalytic performances, whereas such phenomena have been rarely documented in   metal&#8211;organic frameworks  (MOFs). Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that a nickel metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL)  exposing rich  (100) crystal facets  (  Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;100  ) shows a much higher photocatalytic CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO activity than the one exposing rich (  010  ) crystal facets (  Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;010  ) and its  bulky counterpart (bulky Ni&#8208;MOF  ),  with a catalytic activity up to 2.5 and 4.6 times  more active than Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;010 and bulky Ni&#8208;MOF, respectively. Theoretical studies reveal that the two coordination&#8208;unsaturated Ni(II) ions  with a close distance of 3.50  &#197; on the surface of Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;100  enables synergistic catalysis  , leading to more favorable energetics in CO  2  reduction than that of Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;010.</dc:description>

      <title>A Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded yet Hydrophobic Porous Molecular Crystal for Molecular&#8208;Sieving&#8208;like Separation of Butane and Isobutane</title>
      <dc:description>Porous molecular crystals sustained by hydrogen bonds and/or weaker connections are an intriguing type of adsorbents, but they hardly demonstrate efficient adsorptive separation becuase of poor structural robustness and tailorability. Here, we report a porous molecular crystal based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic dinuclear Ag(I) complex, which exhibits exceptional hydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 134  o  , high chemical stability in water at pH 2&#8210;13. The seemingly rigid adsorbent shows pore&#8208;opening or nonporous&#8208;to&#8208;porous type butane adsorption isotherm and complete exclusion of isobutane, indicating potential molecular sieving. Quantitative column breakthrough experiments show slight co&#8208;adsorption of isobutane with an experimental butane/isobutane selectivity of 23, and isobutane can be purified more efficiently than for butane.  In&#8208;situ  powder/single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational simulations reveal that a trivial guest&#8208;induced structural transformation play&#160;critical roles.</dc:description>

      <title>MOF&#8208;Mediated Fabrication of Porous 3&#8208;D Superstructure of Carbon Nanosheets Decorated with Ultrafine Cobalt Phosphide Nanoparticles for Efficient Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Superstructures have attracted great interest owing to their potential applications in chemistry and material science. Herein, we report, for the first time, the scalable preparation of a porous nickel foam&#8208;templated superstructure of carbon nanosheets decorated with ultrafine cobalt phosphide nanoparticles. Uniform two&#8208;dimensional (2&#8208;D) Co&#8208;MOF nanosheets (Co&#8208;MNS) grow on nickel foam, followed by a MOF&#8208;mediated tandem (carbonization/phosphidation) pyrolysis. The resulted superstructure exhibits a porous 3&#8208;D interconnected network with well&#8208;arranging 2&#8208;D carbon nanosheets on it, in which ultrafine cobalt phosphide nanoparticles are tightly immobilized. A single piece of this superstructure can be directly used as self&#8208;supported electrodes for electrocatalysis without any binders. Taking advantages of this &#8220;one&#8208;piece&#8221; porous superstructure with excellent transport properties of mass and electrons, and catalytically active cobalt phosphide nanoparticles with ultrasmall size (3&#8208;4 nm), it exhibits excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activities for OER, HER, and ORR, achieving great performances in water splitting and Zn&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Superstructures have attracted great interest owing to their potential applications in chemistry and material science. Herein, we report, for the first time, the scalable preparation of a porous nickel foam&#8208;templated superstructure of carbon nanosheets decorated with ultrafine cobalt phosphide nanoparticles. Uniform two&#8208;dimensional (2&#8208;D) Co&#8208;MOF nanosheets (Co&#8208;MNS) grow on nickel foam, followed by a MOF&#8208;mediated tandem (carbonization/phosphidation) pyrolysis. The resulted superstructure exhibits a porous 3&#8208;D interconnected network with well&#8208;arranging 2&#8208;D carbon nanosheets on it, in which ultrafine cobalt phosphide nanoparticles are tightly immobilized. A single piece of this superstructure can be directly used as self&#8208;supported electrodes for electrocatalysis without any binders. Taking advantages of this &#8220;one&#8208;piece&#8221; porous superstructure with excellent transport properties of mass and electrons, and catalytically active cobalt phosphide nanoparticles with ultrasmall size (3&#8208;4 nm), it exhibits excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activities for OER, HER, and ORR, achieving great performances in water splitting and Zn&#8208;air batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Unveiling the Promotion of Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Chalcogenate on the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pre&#8208;electrocatalysts, and will in situ transform into metal oxyhydroxides under OER condition. However, the role of chalcogen is not fully elucidated after oxidation and severe leaching. Here we present the vital promotion of surface&#8208;adsorbed chalcogenates on the OER activity. Taking NiSe  2  as an example, in situ Raman spectroscopy revealed the oxidation of Se&#8208;Se to selenites (SeO  3  2&#8208;  ) then to selenates (SeO  4  2&#8208;  ). Combining the severe Se leaching and the strong signal of selenates, it is assumed that the selenates are rich on the surface and play significant roles. As expected, adding selenites to the electrolyte of Ni(OH)  2  dramatically enhance the OER activity. And sulfates also exhibit the similar effect, suggesting the promotion of surface&#8208;adsorbed chalcogenates on OER is universal. Our findings offer unique insight into the transformation mechanism of materials during electrolysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Silver Single&#160;Atom in&#160;Carbon Nitride Catalyst for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#160;atom catalysts (SACs) with the maximized metal atom efficiency have sparked great attention. However, it is challenging to obtain SACs with high metal loading, high catalytic activity,&#160;and good stability.&#160;Herein,&#160;we demonstrate a new strategy to develop a highly active and stable Ag single atom in&#160;carbon nitride (Ag&#8208;N2C2/CN) catalyst&#160;with a&#160;unique coordination. The Ag atomic dispersion and Ag&#8208;N2C2 configuration&#160;have been identified by aberration&#8208;correction high&#8208;angle&#8208;annular&#8208;dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy&#160;(AC&#8208;HAADF&#8208;STEM)&#160;and extended X&#8208;ray absorption. Experiments&#160;and DFT&#160;calculations further verify that Ag&#8208;N2C2 can reduce the H2 evolution barrier, expand the light absorption&#160;range, and improve the charge transfer of CN. As a result, the Ag&#8208;N2C2/CN catalyst exhibits&#160;much better H2 evolution&#160;activity than&#160;the N&#8208;coordinated Ag single atom in&#160;CN&#160;(Ag&#8208;N4/CN),&#160;and is even superior to the Pt nanoparticle&#8208;loaded&#160;CN (PtNP/CN).

      <title>Incorporating Transition Metal Phosphides into Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proven to be an excellent platform in photocatalysis. However, to suppress the  electron&#8208;hole  recombination, the Pt cocatalyst is usually inevitable, especially in photocatalytic H  2  production, which greatly limits the practical application.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proven to be an excellent platform in photocatalysis. However, to suppress the  electron&#8208;hole  recombination, the Pt cocatalyst is usually inevitable, especially in photocatalytic H  2  production, which greatly limits the practical application. Herein, for the first time, the monodisperse, small&#8208;size and noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free transitional metal phosphides (TMPs, e.g., Ni  2  P, Ni  12  P  5  ), are incorporated into a representative MOF, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , for photocatalytic H  2  production.

      <title>Multispecific Platinum(IV) Complex Deters Breast Cancer via Interposing Inflammation and Immunosuppression as an Inhibitor of COX&#8208;2 and PD&#8208;L1</title>
      <dc:description>Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies in women and often accompanied by inflammatory processes. Cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) plays a vital role in the progression of BC, correlating with the expression of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Overexpression of PD&#8208;L1 contributes to the immune escape of cancer cells, and its blockade would stimulate anticancer immunity. Two multispecific platinum(IV) complexes DNP and NP were prepared using non&#8208;steroidal antiinflammatory drug naproxen (NPX) as axial ligand(s) to inhibit the BC cells. DNP exhibited high cytotoxicity and antiinflammatory properties superior over NP, cisplatin and NPX; moreover, it displayed potent antitumor activity and almost no general toxicity in mice bearing triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mechanistic studies revealed that DNP could downregulate the expression of COX&#8208;2 and PD&#8208;L1  in vitro  and  vivo  , inhibit the secretion of prostaglandin, reduce the expression of BC&#8208;associated protein BRD4 and phosphorylation of extracellular signal&#8208;regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2), and block the oncogene c&#8208;Myc in BC cells. These findings demonstrate that DNP is capable of intervening in inflammatory, immune, and metastatic processes of BC, thus presenting a new mechanism of action for anticancer platinum(IV) complexes. The multispecificity offers a special superiority for DNP to treat TNBC by combining chemotherapy and immunotherapy in one molecule.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovering the elusive global minimum in a ternary chiral cluster: rotational spectra of propylene oxide trimer</title>
      <dc:description>The chirality controlled conformational landscape of the trimer of propylene oxide (PO), a prototypical chiral molecule, was investigated using rotational spectroscopy and a range of theoretical tools for conformational searches and for evaluating vibrational contributions to effective structures. Two sets of homochiral (PO)  3  transitions were assigned and the associated conformers identified with theoretical support. One set of heterochiral (PO)  3  transitions was assigned, but  no  structures generated by one of  the latest, advanced conformational search codes  could account for them. With the aid of a Python program, the carbon atom backbone and then the heterochiral (PO)  3  structure were generated using the  13  C isotopic data measured in natural abundance. Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental rotational constants and relative dipole moment components of all three conformers was achieved, especially by applying vibrational corrections to the rotational constants.</dc:description>

      <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergence in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation and Hydroalkenylation of Alkenyl Carboxylic Acids</title>
      <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation of unactivated alkenyl carboxylic acids is reported, whereby the ligand environment around the metal center dictates the regiochemical outcome. Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization products are obtained under mild ligand&#8208;free conditions, with up to 99% yield and &gt;20:1 selectivity. Alternatively, anti&#8208;Markovnikov products can be accessed with a novel 4,4&#8208;disubstituted Pyrox ligand in excellent yield and &gt;20:1 selectivity. Both electronic and steric effects on the ligand contribute to the high yield and selectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest a change in the turnover&#8208;limiting and selectivity&#8208;determining step induced by the optimal ligand. DFT calculations reveal that in the anti&#8208;Markovnikov pathway, repulsion between the ligand and the alkyl group is minimized (by virtue of it being 1&#176; versus 2&#176;) in the rate&#8208; and regioselectivity&#8208;determining transmetalation transition state.</dc:description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities in the Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Interlocked Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>Several strategies have been successfully utilized so far in order to obtain a wide range of interlocked molecules. However, some interlocked compounds are still not obtained directly and/or efficiently from non&#8208;interlocked components because the requisites for self&#8208;assembly cannot be always enforced. To circumvent such a synthetic problem, the strategy that consists in synthesizing an isolable and storable interlocked building block in a step that precedes its modifications is an appealing chemical route to more sophisticated interlocked molecules. Synthetic opportunities and challenges are closely linked to the fact that the mechanical bond might tremendously affect the reactivity of a function of the encircled axle, while the interlocked architecture need to be preserved during the synthesis. Hence, the mechanical bond plays a fundamental role in the strategy employed. This review focuses on the challenging post&#8208;synthetic modifications of interlocked molecules, sometimes through the cleavage of the axle&#8217;s main chain, and always with the conservation of the mechanical bond.</dc:description>

      <title>Membrane Chemistry Tunes the Structure of a Peptide Transporter</title>
      <dc:description>
Membrane transporters need to cycle through different conformations in order to perform function. Using state of the art smFRET tools, H. Hofmann, C. L&#246;w et&#8197;al. reveal in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202008226) that the dynamics and conformational variety of a peptide transporter is sensitively regulated by the lipid environment. Analyses in different lipid compositions highlight the influence of the lipid head&#8208;group while artificial detergents trap the transporter in a single conformation.

      <title>Hollow Carbon Sphere Nanoreactors Loaded with PdCu Nanoparticles: Void&#8208;Confinement Effects in Liquid&#8208;Phase Hydrogenations</title>
      <dc:description>
A general strategy to synthesize a pair of differently loaded hollow nanoreactors (PdCu@HCS and PdCu/HCS) is reported by J. Liu, G.&#8208;H. Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202007297). The confinement effect of hollow nanoreactors in liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation is investigated in a two&#8208;chamber reactor. The results contribute to a clear understanding of the confinement effects of hollow nanoreactors.

Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200729710.1002/anie.202007297&lt;/a&gt;). The confinement effect of hollow nanoreactors in liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation is investigated in a two&#8208;chamber reactor. The results contribute to a clear understanding of the confinement effects of hollow nanoreactors.

      <dc:description>
The co&#8208;existence of high&#8208;density open metal sites and electronegative sites in confined ultramicropores is a big challenge. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202009446), D.

Here, we introduce a new strategy for transferring modular reconfigurable DNA nanostructures from 2D to 3D.

      <dc:description>Supramolecular polymer co&#8208;assembly is a useful approach to modulate peptide nanostructures. However, the co&#8208;assembly scenario where one of the peptide building blocks simultaneously forms a hydrogel is yet to be studied. Herein, we investigated the co&#8208;assembly formation of a minimalistic dipeptide, diphenylalanine (FF), and Fmoc&#8208;diphenylalanine (FmocFF) within the 3D fibrous matrix of FmocFF hydrogel. The overlapping peptide sequence between the two building blocks leads to their co&#8208;assembly within the gel state modulating the nature of the FF crystals. Consequently, we observe the formation of branched microcrystalline aggregates with an atypical curvature, in contrast to the FF assemblies obtained from aqueous solution. Using optical microscopy, we demonstrate the sigmoidal kinetic growth profile of these aggregates. Microfluidics and ToF&#8208;SIMS experiments reveal the presence of co&#8208;assembled structures of FF and FmocFF in the crystalline aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulation was further used to decipher the mechanism of co&#8208;assembly formation.

      <title>Cell Death Mediated by Pyroptosis Pathway with the Help of Nanotechnology: New Prospects for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Pyroptosis, a unique form of programmed cell death (PCD) characterized by DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, cellular swelling with big bubbles and cell content leakage, has been proven to have close relationships with human diseases, such as inflammatory diseases and malignant tumors. Since a new gasdermin&#8208;D (GSDMD) protein was identified in 2015, various strategies have been developed to induce pyroptosis for cancer therapy, including ions, small molecular drugs and nanomaterials. Although there are a number of reviews about the pyroptosis mechanism, the summary covering the recent progresses of nanomedicines utilized in pyroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy has not been presented. Therefore, it is urgent to fill this gap and light up future directions for using such a powerful tool to fight against cancer. In this Minireview, the recent progresses of cancer treatment based on pyroptosis induced by nanoparticles will be described in detail, the design highlights and the therapeutic advantages are emphasized, and finally future perspectives on this emerging area are proposed.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Over the past few years, conductive coordination polymers (CPs) have received emerging attention as subjects in fundamental research or as prospective candidates for a wide range of applications because of their inherent structural and functional diversity and modularity. Several successful approaches have been used to construct CPs with high conductivity.

Herein, taking advantage of the non&#8208;innocent nature of benzenehexathiol (BHT) ligand and the rich coordination capability of cooper(I) ions, two novel electrically conductive CPs (Cu  x  C  6  S  6  , x = 4 or 5.5) derived from the same organic linker and metal node (copper(I)) have been synthesized and studied. These two Cu  x  C  6  S  6  s materials display not only high electrical conductivity but also feature tunable structural topology and electronic structure. The high conductivity of this material originates from the presence of necessary charge transport pathways that facilitate conductivity within the material but more interestingly, offers control of the Fermi level through modulation of the oxidation level of the non&#8208;innocent redox&#8208;active ligand. As a result, both Cu  4  C  6  S  6  and Cu  5.5  C  6  S  6  act as degenerate semiconductors with desirable band structures that make Cu  5.5  C  6  S  6  a potential candidate as a p&#8208;type thermoelectric material with a ZT value of 0.12 at 390 K, a record&#8208;breaking performance for p&#8208;type CPs.

      <title>Expeditious Total Synthesis of Hemiasterlin via a Convergent Multi&#8208;component Strategy and Its Use in Targeted Cancer Therapeutics</title>
      <dc:description>Hemiasterlin is an anti&#8208;mitotic marine natural product with reported sub&#8208;nanomolar potency against several cancer cell lines. Herein, we describe an expeditious total synthesis of hemiasterlin featuring a four&#8208;component Ugi reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) as the key step. The convergent synthetic strategy enabled rapid access to taltobulin (HTI&#8208;286), a similarly potent synthetic analogue. This short synthetic sequence enabled investigation of both hemiasterlin and taltobulin as cytotoxic payloads in antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). These novel ADCs displayed sub&#8208;nanomolar cytotoxicity against HER2&#8208;expressing cancer cells, while showing no activity against antigen&#8208;negative cells. This study demonstrates an improved synthetic route to a highly valuable natural product, facilitating further investigation of hemiasterlin and its analogues as a potential payload in targeted therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Interfacial structure of water as a new descriptor of hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Driven by the persisting poor understanding of the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Pt in alkaline media, a direct correlation of the interfacial water structure and activity is still yet to be established. Here, we first demonstrated a strong dependence of the proton donor structure on the HER activity and pH. The structure of the first layer evolutes from the proton acceptors to the donors with increasing pH. In the base, the reactivity of the interfacial water varied with their structure, and the activation energies of water dissociation increased in the sequence: the dangling O&#8211;H bonds &lt; the trihedrally coordinated water &lt; the tetrahedrally coordinated water. Moreover, optimizing the adsorption of H and OH intermediate can re&#8208;orient the interfacial water molecules with their H atoms pointing towards the electrode surface, thereby enhancing the kinetics of HER. Our results clarified the dynamic role of the water structure at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface during HER and the design of highly efficient HER catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Chromophore&#8208;assisted proximity labeling of DNA reveals chromosomal organization in living cells</title>
      <dc:description>The spatial arrangement of chromosome within the nucleus is intimately linked to genome function and gene expression regulation. Existing genome&#8208;wide mapping methods to study chromosome organization often rely on chemically crosslinking DNA with protein baits, which raises concerns of introducing artefacts during cellular fixation. Herein, we developed a novel proximity&#8208;dependent DNA labeling method based on the chromophore&#8208;assisted nucleobase photooxidation. By genetically targeting a photosensitizer protein to specific subnuclear locations, we achieved blue light&#8208;activated labeling of local DNA with a bioorthogonal functional handle, which allowed subsequent affinity purification and sequence identification via next&#8208;generation sequencing. When applied to the nuclear lamina in human embryonic kidney 293T cells, our method revealed lamina&#8208;associated domains (LADs) that cover 37.6% of the genome. These LADs overlap with heterochromatin hallmarks including histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and are depleted with CpG islands. This simple labeling method avoids the harsh treatment of chemical crosslinking and is generally applicable for the genome&#8208;wide high&#8208;resolution mapping of the spatial chromosome organization in living cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultrastable perovskite&#8208;zeolite composite enabled by encapsulation and in situ passivation</title>
      <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites have been widely applied in optoelectronic fields, but their poor stability hinders their actual applications. Here, a perovskite&#8208;zeolite composite was synthesized via  in situ  growth in air based on aluminophosphate AlPO&#8208;5 zeolite crystals and perovskite nanocrystals. The zeolite matrix provides quantum confinement for perovskite nanocrystals achieving efficient green emission, and passivates the defects of perovskite by H&#8208;bonding interaction leading to longer lifetime compare to bulk perovskite film. Furthermore, the AlPO&#8208;5 zeolite also acts as protection shield and enables ultrahigh stability of perovskite nanocrystals under 150&#186;C heat stress, under 15&#8208;month long&#8208;term ambient exposure, and even in water for more than 2 weeks, respectively. The strategy of  in situ  passivation and encapsulation for the perovskite@AlPO&#8208;5 composite has been demonstrated universal from MA&#8208;based to Cs&#8208;based perovskites. Benefited from the high stability and photoluminescence performance, the composite exhibits great potential to be virtually applied in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and backlight displays.</dc:description>

      <title>An Ester&#8208;substituted Semiconducting Polymer with Efficient Nonradiative Decay Enhances NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Performance for Monitoring of Tumor Growth</title>
      <dc:description>Photoacoustic&#160;agents have been of vital importance for improving the imaging contrast and reliability against self&#8208;interference from endogenous substances. Herein, we synthesized a series of thiadiazoloquinoxaline (TQ)&#8208;based semiconducting polymers (SPs) with a broad absorption covering from NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II regions. Among them, the excited s&#8208;BDT&#8208;TQE, a repeating unit of SPs, shows a large dihedral angle and narrow adiabatic energy as well as low radiative decay, attributing to its strongly electron&#8208;deficient ester&#8208;substituted TQ&#8208;segment. In addition, its more vigorous molecular motions trigger a higher reorganization energy that further yields an efficient photoinduced nonradiative decay, which has been carefully examined and understood by theoretical calculation. Thus, BDT&#8208;TQE SP&#8208;cored nanoparticles with twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) feature exhibit a high NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion efficiency (61.6%) and preferable photoacoustic tracking of  in situ  hepatic tumor growth for more than 20 days. This study highlights a unique strategy for constructing efficient NIR&#8208;II PA agents  via  TICT&#8208;enhanced PNRD effect, further advancing their applications for  in vivo  bioimaging.</dc:description>

      <title>Stable Co&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Free BiVO4 Photoanodes with Passivated Surface States for Photocorrosion Inhibition</title>
      <dc:description>Improving the charge transport and reducing the bulk/surface recombination are useful for improving the activity and stability of BiVO  4  for water oxidation. Here we for the first time demonstrate that the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of BiVO  4  can be significantly improved using the potentiostatically photo&#8208;polarized test. The co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free BiVO  4  photoanode achieves a record&#8208;high photocurrent of 4.60 mA cm  &#8722;2  at 1.23 V  RHE  with an outstanding onset potential of 0.23 V  RHE  in borate buffer without a sacrificial agent under AM 1.5G illumination. The most striking character is that the photoanode exhibits a strong &#8220;self&#8208;healing&#8221; property on photostability over 100 h under intermittent test. The synergistic effects of the generated oxygen vacancies and the passivated surface states at the semiconductor&#8208;electrolyte interface by the potentiostatically photo&#8208;polarized test reduces the substantial carrier recombination, and enhances the water oxidation kinetics, further inhibiting the photocorrosion.</dc:description>

The co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free BiVO  4  photoanode achieves a record&#8208;high photocurrent of 4.60 mA cm  &#8722;2  at 1.23 V  RHE  with an outstanding onset potential of 0.23 V  RHE  in borate buffer without a sacrificial agent under AM 1.5G illumination. The most striking character is that the photoanode exhibits a strong &#8220;self&#8208;healing&#8221; property on photostability over 100 h under intermittent test. The synergistic effects of the generated oxygen vacancies and the passivated surface states at the semiconductor&#8208;electrolyte interface by the potentiostatically photo&#8208;polarized test reduces the substantial carrier recombination, and enhances the water oxidation kinetics, further inhibiting the photocorrosion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Regioselective C&#8211;H Functionalization of Heteroarene N&#8208;Oxides Enabled by a Traceless Nucleophile</title>
      <dc:description>Although N&#8208;alkenoxyheteroarenium salts have been widely used as umpoled synthons with nucleophilic (hetero)arenes, the use of electron&#8208;poor heteroarenes has remained unexplored. To overcome the inherent electron deficiency of quinolinium salts, a traceless nucleophile&#8208;triggered strategy was designed, wherein the quinolinium segment is converted to a transiently activated intermediate, thereby allowing simultaneous C8&#8208;functionalization of quinolines at room temperature. Experimental and computational studies support the traceless operation of a nucleophile, which enables the previously inaccessible transformation of N&#8208;alkenoxyheteroarenium salts. Remarkably, the generality of this strategy has been further demonstrated by broad applications in the regioselective C&#8211;H functionalization of other electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes such as phenanthridine, isoquinoline, and pyridine N&#8208;oxides, offering a practical tool for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex biorelevant molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Switching the Photoluminescence and Electrochemiluminescence of Liposoluble Porphyrin in Aqueous Phase by Molecular Regulation</title>
      <dc:description>A facile molecular structure regulation strategy was exploited to potentially transform the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) chromophore of lipsoluble porphyrin to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active in aqueous phase. By peripheral decoration of 5&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin (ATPP) with inherent AIE active tetraphenylethene (TPE), a versatile AIEgenic porphyrin derivative (ATPP&#8208;TPE) was obtained, which greatly abolishes the detrimental &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and thus surmounts the notorious ACQ effect of ATPP in aqueous phase. The photoluminescence of ATPP&#8208;TPE is 4.5&#8208;fold stronger than ATPP at aggregation state. Moreover, an unequivocal aggregation induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) of ATPP&#8208;TPE was found seriously dependent on its aggregation property in aqueous solution with efficiency of 34%, which is 6 times higher than pure ATPP. The versatility of this molecular structure modulation strategy along with the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation in this work provides direction to guide for applying liposoluble porphyrins in aqueous phase by designs of synthetic porphyrin AIEgens.</dc:description>

Moreover, the uDGNPs&#8208;functionalized scaffolds (agarose gel) can serve as general wound dressings for healing burnt infections.

      <title>Enhancing CO2 Electroreduction to Methane with Cobalt Phthalocyanine and Zinc&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon Tandem Catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Developing copper&#8208;free catalysts for CO  2  conversion into hydrocarbons and oxygenates is highly desirable for electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR). Herein, we report a cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) and zinc&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C) tandem catalyst for CO  2  RR to CH  4  . This tandem catalyst shows more than 100 times  enhancement in CH  4  /CO production rate ratio  compared with CoPc or Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C alone. Density functional theory calculations and electrochemical CO reduction reaction results suggest that CO  2  is firstly reduced into CO over CoPc and then CO diffuses onto Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C for further conversion into CH  4  over Zn&#8208;N  4  site, decoupling complicated CO  2  RR pathway on single active site into a two&#8208;step tandem reaction. Moreover, mechanistic analysis indicates that CoPc not only generates CO but also enhances the availability of *H over adjacent N sites in Zn&#8208;N  4  , which is the key to achieve the high CH  4  production rate and understand intriguing electrocatalytic behavior distinctive to copper&#8208;based tandem catalysts.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Metal allyl species are versatile intermediates in a number of coupling reactions. However, Rh(III) &#960;&#8208;allyls have been rarely elaborated in the context of asymmetric C&#8208;H functionalization.

The reaction proceeds via a C&#8208;H activation, alkenyl to allyl rearrangement, and nucleophilic cyclization cascade. The mechanistic details of the [4+1] annulation of N&#8208;methoxybenzamide and an 1,3&#8208;enyne have been elucidated by a combination of experimental and computational methods. DFT studies indicate that following the C&#8208;H activation and alkyne insertion, a Rh(III) alkenyl intermediate undergoes &#948;&#8208;hydrogen elimination of the allylic C&#8208;H via a six&#8208;membered ring transition state to produce a Rh(III) enallene hydride intermediate.

      <title>1D Coordination &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Polymers with Distinct Structures Defined by the Choice of the Transition Metal: Towards a New Class of Antiaromatic Macrocycles</title>
      <dc:description>Recently &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymers have received a lot of attention due to their unique material properties, although synthesis of long and defect free polymers remains challenging. Here we introduce a novel on&#8208;surface synthesis of coordination polymers with quinoidal ligand under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions, which enables formation of flexible coordination polymers with lengths up to hundreds of nanometers. Moreover, this procedure allows the incorporation of different transition metal atoms tuning their coordination between four and two&#8208;fold. Remarkably, the two&#8208;fold coordination mode revealed the formation of wires constituted by (electronically) independent 12&#8208;membered antiaromatic macrocycles linked together through two C&#8208;C single bonds.</dc:description>

Remarkably, the two&#8208;fold coordination mode revealed the formation of wires constituted by (electronically) independent 12&#8208;membered antiaromatic macrocycles linked together through two C&#8208;C single bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Design and Atroposelective Construction of IAN analogues via Organocatalytic Asymmetric Heteroannulation of Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>The organocatalytic atroposelective strategy for accessing enantioenriched axially chiral IAN analogues was developed for the first time.

      <title>Overcoming Symmetry Mismatch in Vaccine Nanoassembly via Spontaneous Amidation</title>
      <dc:description>Matching of symmetry at interfaces is a fundamental obstacle in molecular assembly. Virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) are important platforms to generate vaccines against pathogenic threats including Covid&#8208;19. However, symmetry mismatch between multimeric antigens and VLP subunits can prohibit vaccine nanoassembly. Here we explore spontaneous amidation to establish principles for coupling VLPs to diverse antigen symmetries. SpyTag003/SpyCatcher003&#8208;mediated decoration enabled efficient VLP conjugation and extreme thermal resilience. Many people showed pre&#8208;existing antibodies to SpyTag:SpyCatcher, but decreased antibodies against 003 variants. We coupled efficiently to the computationally&#8208;designed VLP, built from twenty trimers, not only monomers (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) but also cyclic dimers (Newcastle Disease Virus or Lyme disease), trimers (Influenza Hemagglutinins), and tetramers (Influenza Neuraminidases). Even small antigens with dihedral symmetry could be displayed. For the global challenge of Influenza, Spy&#8208;display enabled powerful induction of neutralizing antibodies to trimeric and tetrameric antigens. SpyCatcher003 conjugation is compatible with nanodisplay of diverse symmetries, towards generation of potent vaccines.</dc:description>

      <title>An Electrochromic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Film</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) possess merits such as high porosity, tunable structure, facile modification, and easy regeneration, which, however, have yet to be brought into play for exploring new functional HOF materials. In this study, an electrochromic HOF film was first time reported. The electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method applied here generated a transparent film at room temperature in merely 2 minutes, being facile, efficient, low&#8208;cost, and applicable to other HOFs. The resulted film exhibits reversible electrochromic property with the advantages of long cycle life (&gt;500 cycles). More strikingly, such an all&#8208;organic film can be easily regenerated (through rinsing with DMF and re&#8208;deposition) and shows tunable electrochromic behavior (via low&#8208;cost post&#8208;synthetic modification) capable of successive color changes, which is hardly achieved by conventional electrochromic materials. With the above&#8208;mentioned advantages, an electrochromic device is manufactured to further demonstrate its application potential.

      <title>Direct&#8208;Space Structure Determination of Covalent Organic Frameworks from 3D Electron Diffraction Data</title>
      <dc:description>Structure determination of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at atomic precision is a bottle&#8208;neck that hinders the development of COF chemistry. Although three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D&#8208;ED) data has been used to solve structures of sub&#8208;micrometre sized COFs, successful structure solution is not guaranteed as the data resolution is usually low. Herein, we demonstrate that  the direct&#8208;space strategy for structure solution, implemented using a genetic algorithm (GA), is a successful approach for structure determination of COF&#8208;300 from 3D&#8208;ED data.  Structural models with different geometric constraints were considered in the GA calculations, with successful structure solution achieved from room&#8208;temperature 3D&#8208;ED data with resolution as low as  ca  . 3.78 &#197;. The generality of this strategy is further verified for different phases of COF&#8208;300. This study demonstrates a viable strategy for structure solution of COF materials from 3D&#8208;ED data of limited resolution, which may facilitate the discovery of new COF materials in the future.</dc:description>

      <title>A multiple chirality switching device for spatial light modulators</title>
      <dc:description>A new and simple strategy towards electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven multiple chirality switching device has been designed by combining a newly synthesized base&#8208;responsive chiroptical polymer switch (  R&#8208;FLMA  ) and p&#8208;benzoquinone (  p&#8208;BQ  ) via proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. And the semi&#8208;solid device of  R&#8208;FLMA  has been fabricated successfully. Clear and stable triple chirality states (silence, positive, negative) of this device in visible band can be regulated reversibly (&gt;1,000 cycles) by adjusting voltage programs. In addition, such chiral switching phenomena are also accompanied by apparent changes of color and fluorescence. More importantly, the potential application of this device for the spatial light modulator has also been demonstrated.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new and simple strategy towards electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven multiple chirality switching device has been designed by combining a newly synthesized base&#8208;responsive chiroptical polymer switch (  R&#8208;FLMA  ) and p&#8208;benzoquinone (  p&#8208;BQ  ) via proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. And the semi&#8208;solid device of  R&#8208;FLMA  has been fabricated successfully. Clear and stable triple chirality states (silence, positive, negative) of this device in visible band can be regulated reversibly (&amp;gt;1,000 cycles) by adjusting voltage programs. In addition, such chiral switching phenomena are also accompanied by apparent changes of color and fluorescence. More importantly, the potential application of this device for the spatial light modulator has also been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Nikolay Zelinsky (1861&#8211;1953): Mendeleev's Protege, a Brilliant Scientist, and the Top Soviet Chemist of the Stalin Era</title>
      <dc:description>
Nikolay Zelinsky was one of the leading chemists worldwide at the beginning of the 20th century. He discovered four reactions that bear his name and his work formed the basis for the petrochemical industry in the Soviet Union. This Essay looks back at his achievements and sets the historical context.







Abstract
This Essay outlines the life path and scientific achievements of Nikolai Zelinsky to testify to his contributions to organic chemistry, catalysis, and petrochemistry. His legacy includes four name reactions (the Hell&#8211;Volhard&#8211;Zelinsky reaction, 1887; the Zelinsky&#8211;Stadnikov reaction, 1906; Zelinsky irreversible catalysis, 1911; the Zelinsky&#8211;Kazansky acetylene trimerization, 1924), pioneering contributions to the main oil&#8208;refining processes (thermal cracking, catalytic cracking, hydrodesulfurization, reforming, and oxidative regeneration of coked catalysts), the coal gas mask, Pd/C and other supported catalysts, and a very large scientific school.

      <title>Fe3+&#8208;Driven Assembly of Catalase&#8208;Like Supramolecular Photosensitizing Nanozymes for Combating Hypoxic Tumor</title>
      <dc:description>A facile approach to assemble catalase&#8208;like photosensitizing nanozymes with a self&#8208;oxygen&#8208;supplying ability was developed. The process involved Fe  3+  &#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)&#8208;protected amino acids. By adding a zinc(II) phthalocyanine&#8208;based photosensitizer (ZnPc) and the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) inhibitor acriflavine (ACF) during the Fe  3+  &#8208;promoted self&#8208;assembly of Fmoc&#8208;protected cysteine (Fmoc&#8208;Cys), the nanovesicles Fmoc&#8208;Cys/Fe@Pc and Fmoc&#8208;Cys/Fe@Pc/ACF were prepared, which could be disassembled intracellularly. The released Fe  3+  could catalyze the transformation of H  2  O  2  enriched in cancer cells to oxygen efficiently, thereby ameliorating the hypoxic condition and promoting the photosensitizing activity of the released ZnPc. With an additional therapeutic component, Fmoc&#8208;Cys/Fe@Pc/ACF exhibited higher in vitro and in vivo photodynamic activities than Fmoc&#8208;Cys/Fe@Pc, demonstrating the synergistic effect of ZnPc and ACF.</dc:description>

      <title>Impact of Ethylene on Efficiency and Stereocontrol in Olefin Metathesis : When to Add It, When to Remove It, and When to Avoid It</title>
      <dc:description>E    thylene is the byproduct of olefin metathesis reactions that involve one or more terminal alkenes. Ethylene&#8217;s volatility is one reason why many cross&#8208;metathesis or ring&#8208;closing metathesis processes, which are reversible transformations, are efficient. However, because ethylene can be converted to a methylidene complex, which is a highly reactive but relatively unstable species, its concentration can impact olefin metathesis in other ways. In some cases, introducing excess ethylene can increase reaction rate owing to faster catalyst initiation. Ethylene and a derived methylidene complex can also advantageously inhibit substrate or product homocoupling, and/or divert a less selective pathway. In other instances, a methylidene&#8217;s low stability and high activity may lead to erosion of efficiency and/or kinetic selectivity, making it preferable that ethylene is removed while being generated. If methylidene decomposition is so fast that there is little or no product formation, it is best that ethylene and methylidene complex formation is avoided altogether. This is accomplished by the use of di&#8208; or trisubstituted alkenes in stereoretentive processes, which includes adopting methylene capping strategy. Here, we analyze the different scenarios through which ethylene and the involvement of methylidene complexes can be manipulated and managed so that an olefin metathesis reaction may occur more efficiently and/or more stereoselectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Control of surface barriers in mass transfer to modulate methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins reaction over SAPO&#8208;34 zeolites</title>
      <dc:description>Mass transfer of guest molecules has great impact on the applications of nanoporous crystalline materials and particularly the shape selective catalysis over zeolites. Control of mass transfer to alter reaction over zeolites, however, remains an open challenge. Recent studies show that, in addition to intracrystalline diffusion, surface barriers represent another transport mechanism which may dominate the overall mass transport rate in zeolites. Here, we demonstrate the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction can be modulated by&#160;regulating surface permeability in SAPO&#8208;34 zeolites with improved chemical liquid deposition and acid etching. Our results explicitly show the reduction of surface barriers can prolong catalyst lifetime and promote light olefins selectivity, which opens a potential avenue for improving reaction performance by controlling the mass transport of guest molecules in zeolite catalysis.</dc:description>
