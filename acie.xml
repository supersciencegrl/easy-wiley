         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioconvergent Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Etherification of Phenols by Allylation to Access Chiral C(sp3)&#8211;O Allyl Aryl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent allylation of phenols under nickel catalysis with an &#945;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;regioisomeric mixture of racemic silylated/germylated allylic chlorides is reported. The silyl/germyl group governs the regioselectivity, and the transformation affords enantiomerically enriched unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl aryl ethers with great regiocontrol in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, no nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8211;O bond activation is observed at room temperature. The synthetic value of these densely functionalized silicon&#8208;containing building blocks is demonstrated in a series of chemoselective transformations, including a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement for the construction of an &#945;&#8208;chiral silane.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of Multiple Sites Boosts Anti&#8208;Poisoning Hydrogen Electrooxidation Reaction with Ultrasmall (Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V Ternary Intermetallic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;contracted Pt&#8722;Rh sites in sub&#8208;3&#8197;nm intermetallics are highly active in the oxidation of hydrogen and have a good poisoning tolerance thanks to the presence of compressive strained Pt and dual&#8208;functional effects.







Abstract
Promoting the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity and poisoning tolerance of electrocatalysts is crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of hydrogen&#8208;oxygen fuel cell. However, it is severely hindered by the scaling relations among different intermediates. Herein, lattice&#8208;contracted Pt&#8722;Rh in ultrasmall ternary L12&#8208;(Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V intermetallic nanoparticles (~2.2&#8197;nm) were fabricated to promote the HOR performances through an oxides self&#8208;confined growth strategy. The prepared (Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V displayed 5.5/3.7&#8197;times promotion in HOR mass/specific activity than Pt/C in pure H2 and dramatically limited activity attenuation in 1000&#8197;ppm CO/H2 mixture. In situ Raman spectra tracked the superior anti&#8208;CO* capability as a result of compressive strained Pt, and the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing species was promoted due to the dual&#8208;functional effect. Further assisted by density functional theory calculations, both the adsorption of H* and CO* on (Pt0.9Rh0.1)3V were reduced compared with that of Pt due to lattice contraction, while the adsorption of OH* was enhanced by introducing oxyphilic Rh sites. This work provides an effective tactic to stimulate the electrocatalytic performances by optimizing the adsorption of different intermediates severally.

         <title>Improving Miscibility of Polymer Donor and Polymer Acceptor by Reducing Chain Entanglement for Realizing 18.64&#8201;% Efficiency All Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer acceptors with BDD units have been developed with large internal space and pronounced steric hindrance, mitigating the entanglements between adjacent polymer chains and increasing the miscibility of polymer donor and polymer acceptor, thus achieving high efficiencies of 17.50&#8201;% and 18.64&#8201;% in binary and ternary blend all&#8208;polymer solar cells.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells have experienced rapid development in recent years by the emergence of polymerized small molecular acceptors (PSMAs). However, the strong chain entanglements of polymer donors (PDs) and polymer acceptors (PAs) decrease the miscibility of the resulting polymer mixtures, making it challenging to optimize the blend morphology. Herein, we designed three PAs, namely PBTPICm&#8208;BDD, PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBTPICF&#8208;BDD, by smartly using a BDD unit as the polymerized unit to copolymerize with different Y&#8208;typed non&#8208;fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs), thus achieving a certain degree of distortion and giving the polymer system enough internal space to reduce the entanglements of the polymer chains. Such effects increase the chances of the PD being interspersed into the acceptor material, which improve the solubility between the PD and PA. The PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBTPICF&#8208;BDD displayed better miscibility with PBQx&#8208;TCl, leading to a well optimized morphology. As a result, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 17.50&#8201;% and 17.17&#8201;% were achieved for PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8201;:&#8201;PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD and PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8201;:&#8201;PBTPICF&#8208;BDD devices, respectively. With the addition of PYFT&#8208;o as the third component into PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8201;:&#8201;PBTPIC&#947;&#8208;BDD blend to further extend the absorption spectral coverage and finely tune microstructures of the blend morphology, a remarkable PCE of 18.64&#8201;% was realized finally.

         <title>High Photoinitiating Efficiency of Benzothioxanthene&#8208;Based Oxime Esters in Photopolymerization via Photocleavage and/or Single Electron Transfer under Visible Light and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Good light absorption property facilitates an efficient photopolymerization reaction. In this work, six different benzothioxanthene&#8208;based oxime esters (BTXIOXEs) demonstrate their efficient photoinitiating performances under visible light and sunlight, following photocleavage and/or single electron transfer processes, which offers a strategy for developing novel oxime ester&#8208;based photoinitiators under visible light and sunlight.







Abstract
In this work, six benzothioxanthene&#8208;based oxime esters were employed as photoinitiators for photopolymerization under visible light (LED) and sunlight. Their abilities to behave as Type&#8197;I photoinitiators by mean of a photocleavage mechanism of oxime esters but also in multicomponent photoinitiating systems with an iodonium salt (through an electron transfer mechanism) were both explored with the different structures. Due to their broad absorption spectra tailing up 600&#8197;nm, photoinitiating properties of the benzothioxanthene&#8208;based oxime esters were systematically tested under excitation with low&#8208;intensity LED light at wavelengths of 405&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm. Additionally, parallel to the polymerization tests done under artificial light, the different benzothioxanthene&#8208;based oxime esters were also investigated as solar photoinitiators and displayed a high reactivity in France (Western Europe) even in winter conditions. For the best candidates i.e. the most reactive structures, direct laser write experiments were carried out, evidencing the interest of these structures.

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Structures of Anchor Sites to Achieve Zero&#8208;Valence Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Advanced Hydrogenation</title>

Doping boron atoms with lower electronegativity into g&#8208;C3N4 can substantially change the local electronic structures at metal anchor sites to achieve zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal&#8208;support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4d orbitals for high hydrogenation activity.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have recently become highly attractive for selective hydrogenation reactions owing to their remarkably high selectivity. However, compared to their nanoparticle counterparts, atomically dispersed metal atoms in SACs often show inferior activity and are prone to aggregate under reaction conditions. Here, by theoretical calculations, we show that tuning the local electronic structures of metal anchor sites on g&#8208;C3N4 by doping B atoms (BCN) with relatively lower electronegativity allows achieving zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal&#8208;support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4d orbitals for high activity in H2 activation. The precise synthesis of Pd SACs on BCN supports with varied B contents substantiated the theoretical prediction. A zero&#8208;valence Pd1/BCN SAC was achieved on a BCN support with a relatively low B content. It exhibited much higher stability in a H2 reducing environment, and more strikingly, a hydrogenation activity, approximately 10 and 34&#8197;times greater than those high&#8208;valence Pd1/g&#8208;C3N4 and Pd1/BCN with a high B content, respectively.

         <title>Interfacial Ir&#8208;V Direct Metal Bonding Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Activity in Vanadium Oxides Supported Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different interfacial bonds are ingeniously constructed to explore the regulating mechanism of the interfacial environment on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), where V2O3 supported Ir catalyst (Ir&#8208;V2O3) with Ir&#8208;V bonding achieves the superior activity due to the accelerated RDS by the electrons injection from V to Ir.







Abstract
Tuning the interfacial structure of metal oxide substrates is an essential strategy to induce electronic structure reconstruction of supported catalysts, which is of great importance in optimizing their catalytic activities. Herein, vanadium oxides&#8208;supported Ir catalysts (Ir&#8208;V2O3, Ir&#8208;VO2, and Ir&#8208;V2O5) with different interfacial bonding environments (Ir&#8208;V, Ir&#8208;Obri, and Ir&#8208;O, respectively) were investigated for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The regulating mechanism of the influence of different interfacial bonding environments on HER activity was investigated by both experimental results and computational evidence. Benefiting from the unique advantages of interfacial Ir&#8208;V direct metal bonds in Ir&#8208;V2O3, including enhanced electron transfer and electron donation ability, an optimized HER performance can be obtained with lowest overpotentials of 16 and 26&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high mass activities of 11.24 and 6.66&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1, and turnover frequency values of 11.20 and 6.63&#8197;s&#8722;1, in acidic and alkaline conditions respectively. Furthermore, the assembled Ir&#8208;V2O3||RuO2 anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer requires only 1.92&#8197;V to achieve a high current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and realizes long&#8208;term stability. This study provides essential insights into the regulating mechanism of interfacial chemical bonding in electrocatalysts and offers a new pathway to design noble metal catalysts for different applications.

         <dc:description>
This essay tackles challenges in polymer electrolytes for RMBs, introducing a novel strategy: anion modification and &#8220;thiol&#8208;ene&#8221; click chemistry. The resulting polymer electrolyte exhibits enhanced mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, tMg2+, compatibility with Mg anode and stable performance under wide temperature range. Comprehensive analysis deepens understanding of inner interactions in electrolyte, paving the way for future advancements.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes play a crucial role in advancing rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) owing to their exceptional characteristics, including high flexibility, superior interface compatibility, broad electrochemical stability window, and enhanced safety features. Despite these advantages, research in this domain remains nascent, plagued by single preparation approaches and challenges associated with the compatibility between polymer electrolytes and Mg metal anode. In this study, we present a novel synthesis strategy to fabricate a glycerol &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diallyl ether&#8208;3,6&#8208;dioxa&#8208;1,8&#8208;octanedithiol&#8208;based composite gel polymer electrolyte supported by glass fiber substrate (GDT@GF CGPE) through anion modification and thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry polymerization. The developed route exhibits novelty and high efficiency, leading to the production of GDT@GF CGPEs featuring exceptional mechanical properties, heightened ionic conductivity, elevated Mg2+ transference number, and commendable compatibility with Mg anode. The assembled modified Mo6S8||GDT@GF||Mg cells exhibit outstanding performance across a wide temperature range and address critical safety concerns, showcasing the potential for applications under extreme conditions. Our innovative preparation strategy offers a promising avenue for the advancement of polymer electrolytes in high&#8208;performance rechargeable magnesium batteries, while also opens up possibilities for future large&#8208;scale applications and the development of flexible electronic devices.

         <title>A Double Twisted Nanographene with a Contorted Pyrene Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implementation of four [6]helical edges around a pyrene core gave a double twisted nanographene with red emission. Despite containing four helical motifs, the actual chiral origin was found to be the contorted pyrene core, achieving absorption/emission dissymmetry factors of up to an order of 10&#8722;3. The corresponding radical cation exhibits intense near&#8208;infrared absorption and circular dichroism tailing to 1600&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The mature synthetic methodologies enable us to rationally design and produce chiral nanographenes (NGs), most of which consist of multiple helical motifs. However, inherent chirality originating from twisted geometry has just emerged to be employed in chiral NGs. Herein, we report a red&#8208;emissive chiral NG constituted of orthogonally arranged two&#8208;fold twisted &#960;&#8208;skeletons at a contorted pyrene core which contributes to optical transitions of S0&#8594;S1 and vice versa. The thus&#8208;obtained NG exhibited a robustness on its redox properties through 2e&#8722; uptake/release. The chemical oxidation generated stable radical cation whose absorption covers near&#8208;infrared I and II regions. Overall, the contorted pyrene core governs electronic nature of the chiral NG. The twist operation on NGs would be, therefore, a design strategy to alter conventional chirality induction on NGs.

         <title>Molecule Engineering of Sugar Derivatives as Electrolyte Additives for Deep&#8208;Reversible Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule additives with &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups exhibit strong adsorption onto zinc anode surfaces and chelate with Zn2+, forming a H2O&#8208;poor inner Helmholtz plane, which effectively suppresses side reactions and promotes (002) facets&#8208;oriented deposition, enhancing reversibility at a high 92&#8201;% depth of discharge and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.89&#8201;%, resulting in low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.3 in full aqueous batteries.







Abstract
The cycling performance of zinc&#8208;ion batteries is greatly affected by dendrite formation and side reactions on zinc anode, particularly in scenarios involving high depth of discharge (DOD) and low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratios in full cells. Herein, drawing upon principles of host&#8211;guest interaction chemistry, we investigate the impact of molecular structure of electrolyte additives, specifically the &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups, on the zinc negative electrode through molecular design. Our findings reveal that molecules containing these groups exhibit strong adsorption onto zinc anode surfaces and chelate with Zn2+, forming a H2O&#8208;poor inner Helmholtz plane. This effectively suppresses side reactions and promotes dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition of exposed (002) facets, enhancing stability and reversibility of an average coulombic efficiency of 99.89&#8201;% with the introduction of Lactobionic acid (LA) additive. Under harsh conditions of 92&#8201;% DOD, Zn//Zn cells exhibit stable cycling at challenging current densities of 15&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Even at a low N/P ratio of 1.3, Zn//NH4V4O10 full cells with LA electrolyte exhibit high&#8208;capacity retention of 73&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles, significantly surpassing that of the blank electrolyte. Moreover, in a conversion type Zn//Br static battery with a high areal capacity (~5&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2), LA electrolyte sustains an improved cycling stability of 700&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Reversible Modulation of Plasmonic Coupling of Gold Nanoparticles Confined within Swellable Polymer Colloidal Spheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic modulation of plasmonic coupling is achieved using gold nanoparticles embedded in crosslinked polymer colloidal spheres. The swelling and deswelling of these polymer spheres in response to pH and temperature changes enable the assembly and disassembly of the gold nanoparticles, altering their plasmonic coupling and allowing reversible color switching.







Abstract
Dynamic optical modulation in response to stimuli provides exciting opportunities for designing novel sensing, actuating, and authentication devices. Here, we demonstrate that the reversible swelling and deswelling of crosslinked polymer colloidal spheres in response to pH and temperature changes can be utilized to drive the assembly and disassembly of the embedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), inducing their plasmonic coupling and decoupling and, correspondingly, color changes. The multi&#8208;responsive colloids are created by depositing a monolayer of AuNPs on the surface of resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) nanospheres, then overcoating them with an additional RF layer, followed by a seeded growth process to enlarge the AuNPs and reduce their interparticle separation to induce significant plasmonic coupling. This configuration facilitates dynamic modulation of plasmonic coupling through the reversible swelling/deswelling of the polymer spheres in response to pH and temperature changes. The rapid and repeatable transitions between coupled and decoupled plasmonic states of AuNPs enable reversible color switching when the polymer spheres are in colloidal form or embedded in hydrogel substrates. Furthermore, leveraging the photothermal effect and stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic coupling of the embedded AuNPs enables the construction of hybrid hydrogel films featuring switchable anticounterfeiting patterns, showcasing the versatility and potential of this multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic system.

         <title>Multifunctional TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs Networks as Sulfur/Lithium Host for High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs conductive network has been designed to serve as a sulfur/Li host of LSBs, whose multicomponent heterostructure facilitated maximum exposure of active sites, thereby enhancing adsorption and catalytic activity. These superior features of TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs effectively suppressed the shuttling of soluble LiPSs and accelerated their conversions, as well as expedited the nucleation/decomposition of solid Li2S and reduced uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
The inevitable shuttling and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) as well as the uncontrolled growth of Li dendrites have strongly limited the practical applications of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). To address these issues, we have innovatively constructed the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) encapsulated Co nanoparticles in situ grown on TiN&#8208;MXene nanosheets, denoted as TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs, which could serve simultaneously as both sulfur/Li host to kill &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; to (1) efficiently capture soluble LiPSs and expedite their redox conversion, (2) accelerate nucleation/decomposition of solid Li2S, and (3) induce homogeneous Li deposition. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs/S cathode with a sulfur loading of 2.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 could show a high reversible specific capacity of 1129.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.1&#8197;C, and ultralong cycle life over 1000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;C. More importantly, it even achieves a high areal capacity of 6.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 50 cycles under a sulfur loading as high as 8.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low E/S ratio of 5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. Besides, TiN&#8208;MXene&#8208;Co@CNTs as Li host could deliver a stable Li plating/striping behavior over 1000&#8197;h.

         <title>Structural Mapping of Protein Aggregates in Live Cells Modeling Huntington's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of live Mid&#8208;infrared Photothermal (MIP) Imaging to study protein aggregates in a S. cerevisiae model of Huntington's Disease. MIP enables to distinguish structurally different partitions of aggregates of the protein huntingtin, by scanning across the aggregate and analyzing their MIP amide I band. We revealed that huntingtin aggregates are organized in a &#946;&#8208;sheet rich amyloid core and a shell composed of &#945;&#8208;helical proteins.







Abstract
While protein aggregation is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, acquiring structural information on protein aggregates inside live cells remains challenging. Traditional microscopy does not provide structural information on protein systems. Routinely used fluorescent protein tags, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), might perturb native structures. Here, we report a counter&#8208;propagating mid&#8208;infrared photothermal imaging approach enabling mapping of secondary structure of protein aggregates in live cells modeling Huntington's disease. By comparing mid&#8208;infrared photothermal spectra of label&#8208;free and GFP&#8208;tagged huntingtin inclusions, we demonstrate that GFP fusions indeed perturb the secondary structure of aggregates. By implementing spectra with small spatial step for dissecting spectral features within sub&#8208;micrometer distances, we reveal that huntingtin inclusions partition into a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich core and a &#593;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich shell. We further demonstrate that this structural partition exists only in cells with the [RNQ+] prion state, while [rnq&#8722;] cells only carry smaller &#946;&#8208;rich non&#8208;toxic aggregates. Collectively, our methodology has the potential to unveil detailed structural information on protein assemblies in live cells, enabling high&#8208;throughput structural screenings of macromolecular assemblies.

         <title>Interfacial Stabilization by Prelithiated Trithiocyanuric Acid as an Organic Additive in Sulfide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile bulk functionalization of Li6PS5Cl with prelithiated trithiocyanuric acid is introduced as an organic additive strategy to stabilize the interfaces in sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. This approach improves electrochemical performance markedly due to the formation of a highly stable Li2S deficient and Li3P&#8208;rich interface with Li metal anode.







Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) with a lithium metal anode (LMA) is a promising candidate to surpass conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their inherent safety against fire hazards and potential to achieve a higher energy density.

     alt="Interfacial Stabilization by Prelithiated Trithiocyanuric Acid as an Organic Additive in Sulfide-Based All-Solid-State Lithium Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facile bulk functionalization of Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl with prelithiated trithiocyanuric acid is introduced as an organic additive strategy to stabilize the interfaces in sulfide-based all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. This approach improves electrochemical performance markedly due to the formation of a highly stable Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S deficient and Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P-rich interface with Li metal anode.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfide-based all-solid-state battery (ASSB) with a lithium metal anode (LMA) is a promising candidate to surpass conventional Li-ion batteries owing to their inherent safety against fire hazards and potential to achieve a higher energy density. However, the narrow electrochemical stability window and chemical reactivity of the sulfide solid electrolyte towards the LMA results in interfacial degradation and poor electrochemical performance. In this direction, we introduce an organic additive approach, that is the mixing of prelithiated trithiocyanuric acid, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TCA, with Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, to establish a stable interface while preserving high ionic conductivity. Including 2.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TCA alleviates the decomposition of the electrolyte on the lithium metal interface, decreasing the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S content in the solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) thus forming a more stable interface. In Li|Li symmetric cells, this strategy enables a rise in the critical current density from 1.0 to 1.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and stable cycling for over 750&#8197;hours at a high current density of 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast&#8208;Healing Glassy Hyperbranched Plastics Capable of Restoring 26.4&#8197;MPa Tensile Strength within One Minute at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing glassy polyurethane (UGPU) consists of hyperbranched acyclic heterochains and multiple hydrogen bond arrays is demonstrated. It exhibits high modulus up to 2.5&#8197;GPa, but can restore 26.4&#8197;MPa of tensile strength within 1&#8197;min at room temperature. This ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing is attribute to the high mobility of branched terminal moieties and &#8220;water bridge&#8221; effect.







Abstract
The growing concern regarding widespread plastic pollution has propelled the development of sustainable self&#8208;healing plastics. Although considerable efforts have been dedicated to fabricating self&#8208;healing plastics, achieving rapid healing at room temperature is extremely challenging. Herein, we have developed an ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing glassy polyurethane (UGPU) by designing a hyperbranched molecular structure with a high density of multiple hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) on compliant acyclic heterochains and introducing trace water to form water bridge across the fractured surfaces. The compliant acyclic heterochains allow the dense multiple hydrogen bonds to form a frozen network, enabling tensile strength of up to 70&#8197;MPa and storage modulus of 2.5&#8197;GPa. The hyperbranched structure can drive the reorganization of the H&#8208;bonding network through the high mobility of the branched chains and terminals, thereby leading to self&#8208;healing ability at room temperature. Intriguingly, the presence of trace water vapor facilitates the formation of activated layers and the rearrangement of networks across the fractured UGPU sections, thereby enabling ultra&#8208;fast self&#8208;healing at room temperature. Consequently, the restored tensile strength after healing for 1 minute achieves a historic&#8208;record of 26.4&#8197;MPa. Furthermore, the high transparency (&gt;90&#8201;%) and ultra&#8208;fast healing property of UGPU make it an excellent candidate for advanced optical and structural materials.

         <title>Enhancing Ionic Selectivity and Osmotic Energy by Using an Ultrathin Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;Based Heterogeneous Membrane with Trilayered Continuous Porous Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a significantly promoted selectivity and blue energy harvesting performance by a novel nanoarchitectured design of a heterogeneous membrane with a trilayered pore structure of large geometry gradient from angstrom&#8208;scale to nano&#8208;scale to sub&#8208;microscale, which is composed of an ultrathin zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 MOF and a highly aligned branched alumina nanochannel membrane.







Abstract
Designing a nanofluidic membrane with high selectivity and fast ion transport property is the key towards high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. However, most of reported membranes can produce power density less than commercial benchmark (5&#8197;W/m2), due to the imbalance between ion selectivity and permeability. Here, we report a novel nanoarchitectured design of a heterogeneous membrane with an ultrathin and dense zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer and a highly aligned and interconnected branched alumina nanochannel membrane. The design leads to a continuous trilayered pore structure of large geometry gradient in the sequence from angstrom&#8208;scale to nano&#8208;scale to sub&#8208;microscale, which enables the enhanced directional ion transport, and the angstrom&#8208;sized (~6.6&#8211;7&#8197;&#197;) UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 windows render the membrane with high ion selectivity. Consequently, the novel heterogeneous membrane can achieve a high&#8208;performance power of ~8&#8197;W/m2 by mixing synthetic seawater and river water. The power density can be largely upgraded to an ultrahigh ~17.1&#8197;W/m2 along with ~48.5&#8201;% conversion efficiency at a 50&#8208;fold KCl gradient. This work not only presents a new membrane design approach but also showcases the great potential of employing the zirconium&#8208;based MOF channels as ion&#8208;channel&#8208;mimetic membranes for highly efficient blue energy harvesting.

         <title>Spin Symmetry Breaking&#8208;Induced Hubbard Gap Near&#8208;Closure in N&#8208;Coordinated MnO2 for Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have achieved a functionality breakthrough of &#8220;Hubbard Gap Near&#8208;Closure&#8221; on N&#8208;coordinated MnO2 (TEAMO) with asymmetric spin states, which is marked by the formation of uniform Hubbard bands. This character can play a crucial role in fostering coherent electronic spin transport and enhancing the rapid kinetics of the system.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), however, their performance is hindered by a substantial Hubbard gap, which limits electron transfer and battery cyclability. Addressing this, we introduce a heteroatom coordination approach, using triethanolamine to induce axial N coordination on Mn centers in MnO2, yielding N&#8208;coordinated MnO2 (TEAMO). This approach leverages the change of electronegativity disparity between Mn and ligands (O and N) to disrupt spin symmetry and augment spin polarization. This enhancement leads to the closure of the Hubbard gap, primarily driven by the intensified occupancy of the Mn eg orbitals. The resultant TEAMO exhibit a significant increase in storage capacity, reaching 351&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Our findings suggest a viable strategy for optimizing the electronic structure of TMO cathodes, enhancing the potential of ZIBs in energy storage technology.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (XOFs) Based on N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N Bonds: Robust Organic Networks Constructed by Fragile Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable bromine(I)&#8208;bridged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks have been constructed based on sensitive [N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N]+ halogen bonds. The frameworks XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF4/OTf displayed excellent chemical and thermal stabilities and maintained their stable two&#8208;dimensional framework structures in various organic solvents as well as in aqueous environments across a wide pH range (3&#8211;12).







Abstract
Organic frameworks face a trade&#8208;off between the framework stability and the bond dynamics, which necessitates the development of innovative linkages that can generate stable frameworks without hindering efficient synthesis. Although iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs) have been developed, constructing XOFs based on bromine(I) is desirable yet challenging due to the high sensitivity of bromine(I) species. In this work, we present the inaugural construction of stable bromine(I)&#8208;bridged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF4/OTf, based on sensitive [N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N]+ halogen bonds. The formation of XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF4/OTf was monitored by 1H NMR, XPS, IR, SEM, TEM, HR&#8208;TEM, SEAD. Their framework structures were established by the results from PXRD, theoretical simulations and SAXS. More importantly, XOF(Br) displayed excellent chemical and thermal stabilities. They exhibited stable two&#8208;dimensional framework structures in various organic solvents and aqueous media, even over a wide pH range (pH 3&#8211;12), while the corresponding model compounds BrPy2BF4/OTf decomposed quickly even in the presence of minimal water. Furthermore, the influence of the counterions were investigated by replacing BF4 with OTf, which improved the stability of XOF(Br). This characteristic enabled XOF(Br) to serve as an efficient oxidizing reagent in aqueous environments, in contrast with the sensitivity of BrPy2BF4/OTf, which performed well only in organic media. This study not only deepens our fundamental understanding of organic frameworks but also opens new avenues for the development and application of multifunctional XOFs.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Embedding Strategy for Short&#8208;Range Charge Transfer Excited States and Efficient Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An example of heterocyclic&#8208;based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter is developed using the nitrogen&#8208;embedding strategy. The reported MR&#8208;TADF emitters exhibit deep&#8208;blue emission with narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum of 13&#8197;nm. High external quantum efficiency of 27.7&#8201;% and nearly BT.2020 blue chromaticity coordinates were achieved.







Abstract
The development of deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) featuring high efficiency and narrowband emission is of great importance for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays with wide color gamut. Herein, based on the nitrogen&#8208;embedding strategy for modifying the short range charge transfer excited state energies of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, we introduce one or two nitrogen atoms into the central benzene ring of a versatile boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton. This approach resulted in the stabilization of the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels and the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and thus systematic hypsochromic shifts and narrowing spectra. In toluene solution, two heterocyclic&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF molecules, Py&#8208;BN and Pm&#8208;BN, exhibit deep&#8208;blue emissions with high photoluminescence quantum yields of 93&#8201;% and 94&#8201;%, and narrow full width at half maximum of 14 and 13&#8197;nm, respectively. A deep&#8208;blue hyperfluorescent OLED based on Py&#8208;BN exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency of 27.7&#8201;% and desired color purity with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.150, 0.052). These results demonstrate the significant potential for the development of deep blue narrowband MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

Herein, based on the nitrogen-embedding strategy for modifying the short range charge transfer excited state energies of multi-resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, we introduce one or two nitrogen atoms into the central benzene ring of a versatile boron-embedded 1,3-bis(carbazol-9-yl)benzene skeleton. This approach resulted in the stabilization of the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels and the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and thus systematic hypsochromic shifts and narrowing spectra.

         <title>Superionic Conduction in K3SbS4 Enabled by Cl&#8208;Modified Anion Lattice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cl&#8208;modified anion lattice in K3SbS4 enhances K+ transport. The anion&#8208;diversified K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 0.32&#8197;mS/cm at room temperature, with a low activation energy of 0.26&#8197;eV. This achievement represents the highest reported conductivity among non&#8208;oxide&#8208;based potassium&#8208;ion conductors to date.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium batteries emerge as promising alternatives to lithium batteries, leveraging their high natural abundance and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Developing potassium solid electrolytes (SEs) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity is critical for realizing efficient potassium batteries. In this study, we present the synthesis of K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47, showcasing a room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 0.32&#8197;mS/cm and a low activation energy of 0.26&#8197;eV. This represents an increase of over two orders of magnitude compared to the parent compound K3SbS4, marking the highest reported ionic conductivity for non&#8208;oxide potassium SEs. Solid&#8208;state 39K magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning nuclear magnetic resonance on K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 reveals an increased population of mobile K+ ions with fast dynamics. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations further confirm a delocalized K+ density and significantly enhanced K+ diffusion. This work demonstrates diversification of the anion sublattice as an effective approach to enhance ion transport and highlights K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 as a promising SE for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium batteries.

         <title>Aggregative Luminescence from CsPbBr3 Perovskite Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CsPbBr3 precursors show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) character, which originates from the polybromide plumbous that is formed through the coordination of Lewis bases (solvent molecules) to the lead metal center. The aggregative luminescence from perovskite precursors can be regulated by changing the solvent and precursor ratio.







Abstract
Understanding the properties of the precursor can provide deeper insight into the crystallization and nucleation mechanisms of perovskites, which is vital for the solution&#8208;process device performance. Herein, we conducted a detailed investigation into the photophysics properties of CsPbBr3 precursors in a broad concentration and various solvents. The precursor transformed from the solution state into the colloidal state and exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission character as the concentration increased. The aggregative luminescence from the precursors originates from the polybromide plumbous that is formed through the coordination of solvent molecules to the lead metal center. Two adducts with monodentate (PbBr2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;solvent) and bidentate (PbBr2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2solvent) ligands can be obtained, accompanied by emission with photoluminescence at 610 and 565&#8197;nm, respectively. Furthermore, the aggregative luminescence intensity and color could be regulated by changing the solvent and precursor ratio. Besides, we discussed the difference between the molecular aggregate in the organic system and the ionic aggregate in the inorganic system: the ionic aggregate is composed of solvated ions rather than individual molecules as in organic systems, which could possess properties that ions do not have. The fluorescence that is sensitive to Pb2+ coordination reported here could be applied to screen perovskite additives and judge the precursor aging.

         <title>Using MXene as a Chemically Induced Initiator to Construct High&#8208;Performance Cathodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Taking inspiration from polymer electrolyte engineering, we have developed a new in situ induced growth strategy and elaborated on its corresponding principles of induced chemistry. In the in situ growth strategy, MXene provides the heterogeneous nucleation site and can be regarded as an initiator for the induced crystal growth. 







Abstract
MXene usually exhibits weak pseudo&#8208;capacitance behavior in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, which cannot provide sufficient reversible capacity, resulting in the decline of overall capacity when used as the cathode materials. Taking inspiration from polymer electrolyte engineering, we have conceptualized an in situ induced growth strategy based on MXene materials. Herein, 5.25&#8201;% MXene was introduced into the nucleation and growth process of vanadium oxide (HVO), providing the heterogeneous nucleation site and serving as an initiator to regulate the morphology and structural of vanadium oxide (T&#8208;HVO). The resulted materials can significantly improve the capacity and rate performance of zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The growth mechanism of T&#8208;HVO was demonstrated by both characterizations and DFT simulations, and the improved performance was systematically investigated through a series of in situ experiments related to dynamic analysis steps. Finally, the evaluation and comparison of various defect introduction strategies revealed the efficient, safety, and high production output characteristics of the in situ induced growth strategy. This work proposes the concept of in situ induced growth strategy and discloses the induced chemical mechanism of MXene materials, which will aid the understanding, development, and application of cathode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Pattern&#8208;Matched Polymer Ligands Toward Near&#8208;Perfect Synergistic Passivation for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Br/Cl Mixed Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
The inter&#8208;functional group spacing of polymer ligands is crucial for enhancing their interaction and passivation effects with perovskite nanocrystals. In this study, we demonstrate that alternating copolymers with a inter&#8208;functional group spacing of four carbon atoms exhibit nearly perfect matching with the ion distribution on the surface of CsPbBrxCl3&#8208;x, resulting in excellent performance and prolonged lifetime of pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emmiting diodes.







Abstract
Mixed Br/Cl perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) exhibit bright pure&#8208;blue emission benefiting for fulfilling the Rec. 2100 standard. However, phase segregation remains a significant challenge that severely affects the stability and emission spectrum of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Here, we demonstrate the optimization of the spacing between polydentate functional groups of polymer ligands to match the surface pattern of CsPbBr1.8Cl1.2 PeNCs, resulting in effective synergistic passivation effect and significant improvements in PeLED performances. The block and alternating copolymers with different inter&#8208;functional group spacing are facilely synthesized as ligands for PeNCs. Surprisingly, block copolymers with a higher functional group density do not match PeNCs, while alternating copolymers enable efficient PeNCs with the high photoluminescence intensity, low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate and high exciton binding energy. Density functional theory calculations clearly confirm the almost perfect match between alternating copolymers and PeNCs. Finally, pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs are achieved with the emission at 467&#8197;nm and Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.131, 0.071), high external quantum efficiency (9.1&#8201;%) and record spectral and operational stabilities (~80&#8197;mins) in mixed&#8208;halide PeLEDs. Overall, this study contributes to designing the polymer ligands and promoting the development of high&#8208;performance and stable pure&#8208;color PeLEDs towards display applications.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Activated Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Fluorescence and SERS Dynamic&#8208;Reversible Probes for Long&#8208;Term Assessment of Osteoarthritis In Vivo</title>

A temperature&#8208;activated ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and SERS bimodal imaging nanoprobe based on thermosensitive pNIPAm&#8208;co&#8208;AAm&#8208;co&#8208;PAA&#8208;IR&#8208;1061 and nanoporous core&#8208;satellite gold nanostructures (DCNP@Si@AuNSP) was developed to realize long&#8208;term monitoring of temperature changes in vivo. The FL1150/FL1550 and S1528/S2226 values of the nanoprobe exhibited a reversible conversion with temperature, enabling long&#8208;term and accurate monitoring of dynamic temperature variations during the onset and treatment of arthritis in rats.







Abstract
The abnormal fluctuation of temperature in vivo usually reflects the progression of inflammatory diseases. Noninvasive, real&#8208;time, and accurate monitoring and imaging of temperature variation in vivo is advantageous for guiding the early diagnosis and treatment of disease, but it remains difficult to achieve. Herein, we developed a temperature&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II FL) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobe for long&#8208;term monitoring of temperature changes in rat arthritis and timely assessment of the status of osteoarthritis. The thermosensitive polymer bearing NIR&#8208;II FL dye was grafted onto the surface of nanoporous core&#8208;satellite gold nanostructures to form the nanoprobe, wherein the nanoprobe contains NIR&#8208;II FL and Raman reference signals that are independent of temperature change. The ratiometric FL1150/FL1550 and S1528/S2226 values of the nanoprobe exhibited a reversible conversion with temperature changes. The nanoprobe accurately distinguishes the temperature variations in the inflamed joint versus the normal joint in vivo by ratiometric FL and SERS imaging, allowing for an accurate diagnosis of inflammation. Meanwhile, it can continuously monitor fluctuations in temperature over an extended period during the onset and treatment of inflammation. The tested temperature change trend could be used as an indicator for early diagnosis of inflammation and real&#8208;time evaluation of therapeutic effects.

Au&#8208;oxygen vacancy&#8208;Zr3+ complex sites proved to be efficient and selective catalytic sites for ethanol dehydrogenation by facilitating ethanol dissociation/adsorption, ethoxy activation, and product desorption.







Abstract
Developing a desirable ethanol dehydrogenation process necessitates a highly efficient and selective catalyst with low cost. Herein, we show that the &#8220;complex active site&#8221; consisting of atomically dispersed Au atoms with the neighboring oxygen vacancies (Vo) and undercoordinated cation on oxide supports can be prepared and display unique catalytic properties for ethanol dehydrogenation. The &#8220;complex active site&#8221; Au&#8722;Vo&#8722;Zr3+ on Au1/ZrO2 exhibits the highest H2 production rate, with above 37,964&#8197;mol H2 per mol Au per hour (385&#8197;g&#8201;H2&#8201;

&#8201;h&#8722;1) at 350&#8201;&#176;C, which is 3.32, 2.94 and 15.0&#8197;times higher than Au1/CeO2, Au1/TiO2, and Au1/Al2O3, respectively. Combining experimental and theoretical studies, we demonstrate the structural sensitivity of these complex sites by assessing their selectivity and activity in ethanol dehydrogenation. Our study sheds new light on the design and development of cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient catalysts for ethanol dehydrogenation. Fundamentally, atomic&#8208;level catalyst design by colocalizing catalytically active metal atoms forming a structure&#8208;sensitive &#8220;complex site&#8221;, is a crucial way to advance from heterogeneous catalysis to molecular catalysis. Our study advanced the understanding of the structure sensitivity of the active site in atomically dispersed catalysts.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Desulfurization in Air through Improved Photogenerated Carriers Separation in MOF MIL101/Carbon Dots&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4 Nanocomposites</title>

The MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4 composites were designed by a thermal polymerization&#8208;hydrothermal strategy with efficient carrier migration pathways. The Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunction played a significant role in facilitating photogenerated charge transfer, enhancing substrate adsorption capability, and decreasing the activation energies of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which were crucial factors in the photocatalytic desulfurization reaction of the catalyst system. Moreover, the high concentration of photogenerated electrons and holes facilitated the production of more ROS (&#8901;O2, &#8901;OH, h+), thereby enhancing photocatalytic oxidative desulfurization.







Abstract
The extensive industrial applications of fuel oil, a critical strategic resource, are accompanied by significant environmental and health concerns due to the presence of sulfur&#8208;containing compounds in its composition, which result in hazardous combustion waste. Extensive research has been conducted to develop technologies for low&#8208;vulcanization fuel production to address this issue. Consequently, the investigation of catalysts for environmentally friendly and safe photocatalytic desulfurization becomes imperative. To that end, we have designed efficient MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/CQDs@g&#8208;C3N4 (MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts with high carrier separation and mobility through a thermal polymerization&#8208;hydrothermal strategy. The high concentration of photogenerated carriers facilitates the activation of oxygen and H2O2, leading to increased production of ROS (&#8901;O2&#8722;, &#8901;OH, h+), thereby enhancing the photocatalytic desulfurization (PODS). Additionally, DFT (Density functional theory) calculations were utilized to determine the electron migration pathways of the catalysts and adsorption energies of DBT (dibenzothiophene). Moreover, Gibbs free energy calculations indicated that MIL101/CDs&#8208;C3N4 exhibited the lowest activation energy for oxygen and H2O2. The mechanism of photocatalytic desulfurization was proposed through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental studies. This study provides guidance for the development of MOF&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme systems and their practical application in desulfurization processes.

         <title>A High&#8208;Mobility n&#8208;Type Noncovalently&#8208;Fused&#8208;Ring Polymer for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type conjugated polymer pDFSe with noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring acceptor triad and axisymmetric donor is synthesized to show increased rigidity and reduced lamellar ordering, which can simultaneously achieve excellent electron transport (6.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and doping efficiency. Upon n&#8208;doping, pDFSe shows excellent thermoelectric performance with electrical conductivity of 62.6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 133.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers are emerging as competitive candidates for organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). However, to make the device truly pervasive, both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conjugated polymers are essential. Despite great efforts, no n&#8208;type equivalents to the p&#8208;type benchmark PEDOT:PSS exist to date mainly due to the low electrical conductivity (&#963;). Herein, a near&#8208;amorphous n&#8208;type conjugated polymer, namely pDFSe, is reported with high &#963; by achieving the synergy between charge transport and doping efficiency. The polymer pDFSe is synthesized based on an acceptor&#8208;triad moiety of diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;difluorobenzoselenadiazole&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole (DFSe), which has the noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring structure to reinforce the backbone rigidity. Furthermore, an axisymmetric thiophene&#8208;selenophene&#8208;thiophene donor is introduced, which enables the formation of near&#8208;amorphous microstructures. The above merits ensure good doping efficiency without scarifying efficient intrachain charge&#8208;carrier transport. Thus, pDFSe&#8208;based n&#8208;type transistors exhibit high electron mobility up to 6.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, much higher than its reference polymer pDSe without the noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring structure (0.77&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Further upon n&#8208;doping, pDFSe demonstrates excellent &#963; of 62.6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and maximum power factor of 133.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, which are among the highest values reported for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type polymers. The results demonstrate the great potential of near&#8208;amorphous n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring structure for the next&#8208;generation OTEs.

         <title>Elucidating the Discrepancy between the Intrinsic Structural Instability and the Apparent Catalytic Steadiness of M&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atom M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts with intrinsic thermodynamically structural instability under OER potential would experience unconventional structure reconstruction. The initial stable Ni&#8722;N coordination is easily broken in the presence of adsorbed OH*, leading to favorable formation of Ni&#8722;O coordination. The formed Ni&#8722;O works stably as the real active center for OER catalysis in alkaline but unstably in acid, which clearly explains the internal conflict between structural and catalytic stability.







Abstract
Despite the widespread investigations on the M&#8208;N&#8208;C type single atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an internal conflict between its intrinsic thermodynamically structural instability and apparent catalytic steadiness has long been ignored. Clearly unfolding this contradiction is necessary and meaningful for understanding the real structure&#8208;property relation of SACs. Herein, by using the well&#8208;designed pH&#8208;dependent metal leaching experiments and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, an unconventional structure reconstruction of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst during OER process was observed. Combining with density functional theory calculations, the initial Ni&#8722;N coordination is easily broken in the presence of adsorbed OH*, leading to favorable formation of Ni&#8722;O coordination. The formed Ni&#8722;O works stably as the real active center for OER catalysis in alkaline media but unstably in acid, which clearly explains the existing conflict. Unveiling the internal contradiction between structural instability and catalytic steadiness provides valuable insights for rational design of single atom OER catalysts.

         <title>Heat&#8208;Resistant Carbon&#8208;Coated Potassium Magnesium Hexacyanoferrate Nanoplates for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

(100) plane&#8208;oriented K2Mg[Fe(CN)6] nanoplates with low [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and high crystallinity achieve thermostability up to 550&#8201;&#176;C, surface carbon coating, and crystal water eliminating. The obtained K2Mg[Fe(CN)6]/C nanoplates manifest high working voltage, superior rate capability and ultralong cyclic life over 15000&#8197;cycles as a cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) on account of their low cost and high energy density. However, the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;remove [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and crystal water lead to structural instability and capacity deterioration as well as the stereotype of poor thermostability of conventional HCFs. Herein, we report (100) face&#8208;oriented potassium magnesium hexacyanoferrate (KMgHCF) nanoplates with low [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and high crystallinity, enabling thermostability up to 550&#8201;&#176;C, high&#8208;temperature carbon coating and crystal water elimination. The as&#8208;obtained KMgHCF/C nanoplates exhibit superior potassium storage properties, including a large reversible capacity of 84.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, a high voltage plateau of 3.87&#8197;V, excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance over 15000&#8197;cycles and high rate capability at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The unprecedented cycling stability of KMgHCF/C is attributed to the synergistic effect of a highly reversible two&#8208;phase reaction, low [Fe(CN)6] vacancies and no crystal water, a specially exposed steady (100) surface, and a protective carbon coating. This work provides a new material selection and modification strategy for the practical application of HCFs in PIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Metal hexacyanoferrates (HCFs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) on account of their low cost and high energy density. However, the difficult-to-remove [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] vacancies and crystal water lead to structural instability and capacity deterioration as well as the stereotype of poor thermostability of conventional HCFs. Herein, we report (100) face-oriented potassium magnesium hexacyanoferrate (KMgHCF) nanoplates with low [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] vacancies and high crystallinity, enabling thermostability up to 550&#8201;&#176;C, high-temperature carbon coating and crystal water elimination. The as-obtained KMgHCF/C nanoplates exhibit superior potassium storage properties, including a large reversible capacity of 84.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a high voltage plateau of 3.87&#8197;V, excellent long-term cycling performance over 15000&#8197;cycles and high rate capability at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The unprecedented cycling stability of KMgHCF/C is attributed to the synergistic effect of a highly reversible two-phase reaction, low [Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] vacancies and no crystal water, a specially exposed steady (100) surface, and a protective carbon coating. This work provides a new material selection and modification strategy for the practical application of HCFs in PIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metastable Supramolecular Assembly of Simple Monomers Enabled by Confinement: Towards Aqueous Phase Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metastable supramolecular assembly (SA) with aqueous phase room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is achieved by the confinement space of layered double hydroxide (LDH). The LDH energy trap can overcome the energy barrier of monomer ordered assembly and strengthen the intermolecular interaction, providing the prerequisite for the existence of metastable SA and appearance of aqueous phase RTP.







Abstract
The application of supramolecular assembly (SA) with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in aqueous phase has the potential to revolutionize numerous fields. However, using simple molecules with crystalline RTP to construct SA with aqueous phase RTP is hardly possible from the standpoint of forces. The reason lies in that the transition from crystal to SA involves a structure transformation from highly stable to more dynamic state, leading to increased non&#8208;radiative deactivation pathways and silent RTP signal. Here, with the benefit of the confinement from the layered double hydroxide (LDH), various simple molecules (benzene derivatives) can successfully form metastable SA with aqueous phase RTP. The maximum of RTP lifetime and efficiency can reach 654.87&#8197;ms and 5.02&#8201;%, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal the LDH energy trap can strengthen the intermolecular interaction, providing the prerequisite for the existence of metastable SA and appearance of aqueous phase RTP. The universality of this strategy will usher exploration into other multifunctional monomer, facilitating the development of SAs with aqueous phase RTP.

         <title>Enantioselective Relay Coupling of Perfluoroalkyl and Vinylogous Ketyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe an enantioselective radical relay coupling catalyzed by a chiral bifuncational NHC. This approach gives easy access to chiral carboxylate derivatives with sterically hindered sp3 carbon branches. An unconventional syn&#8208;syn conformation of the squaramide motif was found critical in the stereocontrol through hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Chiral carboxylic acids and their derivatives are highly valuable structural motifs in the fields of asymmetric synthesis and medicinal chemistry. However, the introduction of a sterically demanding sidechain to the &#946;&#8208;carbon, such as an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center, remains a significant challenge in classical polar processes. Recently, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) mediated coupling reactions involving persistent ketyl radicals have emerged as a promising strategy to assemble highly crowded carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Nevertheless, achieving enantioselectivity in these reactions remains highly challenging. In this work, we report our recent progress in controlling enantioselectivity for relay coupling of perfluoroalkyl and persistent vinylogous ketyl radicals. We developed a chiral bifunctional NHC&#8208;squaramide catalyst that achieves high facial selectivity in a critical bond&#8208;forming event involving the coupling of a congested tertiary carbon radical and vinylogous ketyl radical. Chiral carboxylates bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center at the &#946;&#8208;position can be prepared in good yield and excellent enantiomeric excess. Results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiments indicate that the N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl squaramide motif adopts an unusual syn&#8208;syn conformation, enabling hydrogen bonding interactions with the enolate oxygen, thereby rigidifying the overall conformation of the transition state.

         <title>Efficient C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Oxidation on Perovskite Quantum Dots Based on Ce&#8208;Oxygen Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ce ion doping increases the density of the lowest exciton state (X1 in CBM) of perovskite quantum dots, and Ce&#8208;oxygen affinity induces the formation of midgap states (MSs) involving oxygen. Under light excitation, the relaxation process of excitons to oxygen molecules is accelerated, resulting in the formation of a large number of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and thus drives the generation of high value&#8208;added chemicals.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have shown attractive prospects in the field of visible photocatalysis, especially in the synthesis of high value&#8208;added chemicals. However, under aerobic conditions, the stable operation of QD catalysts has been limited by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photoexcitation, especially superoxide species O2&#8901;&#8722;. Here, we propose a strategy of Ce3+ doping in perovskite QDs to guide superoxide species for photocatalytic oxidation reactions. In C(sp3)&#8722;H bond oxidation of hydrocarbons, superoxide species were rapidly generated and efficiently utilized on the surface of perovskite QDs, which achieves the stable operation of the catalytic system and obtains a high product conversion rate (15.3&#8197;mmol/g/h for benzaldehydes). The mechanism studies show that the strong Ce&#8208;oxygen affinity accelerates the relaxation process of photoinduced exciton transfer to superoxide species and inhibits the radiative recombination pathway. This work provides a new idea of utilizing oxygen species on perovskite surface and broadens the design strategy of high&#8208;performance QD photocatalysts.

         <title>Introducing a &#960;&#8208;Skeleton Perpendicular to the Central Methylene Carbon in Alkanediamides: Design of Supramolecular Polymers with an Offset &#960;&#8208;Stacking Arrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymers with an offset &#960;&#8208;stacked arrangement were formed by introducing a four&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton perpendicularly onto the central methylene carbon atom of heptanediamide derivatives. The introduction of chiral alkyl chains at both termini of the heptanediamide further enables supramolecular polymerization of a five&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton with offset &#960;&#8208;stacking and effective chiral exciton coupling in the aggregated state.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly behavior of a heptanediamide derivative that contains a four&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton on its central methylene carbon atom has been examined. This molecule, which also contains two octyl chains, gelated the nonpolar solvent methylcyclohexane through the formation of fibrous nanostructures with hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks through a cooperative nucleation&#8211;elongation process. The supramolecular polymerization is accompanied by bathochromic shifts of both the absorption and fluorescence bands while maintaining a fluorescence quantum yield comparable to that of the monomeric state. Theoretical calculations provided an energetically stable structure, in which the &#960;&#8208;skeletons are stacked with an offset of more than 8.0&#8197;&#197;, replicating the experimentally observed absorption change due to exciton coupling. Moreover, a slow transition with an inversion of the chiral arrangement of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moieties was induced by replacing the octyl chains with chiral alkyl chains. Our molecular&#8208;design strategy was further applied to a five&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton, which also forms an offset &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangement and exhibits more effective chiral exciton coupling in the aggregated state.

         <title>A Unique Wide&#8208;Spacing Fence&#8208;Type Superstructure for Robust High&#8208;Voltage O3&#8208;Type Sodium Layered Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fence&#8208;type superstructure with wide d&#8208;spacing in O3&#8208;type layered material was proposed. The fence&#8208;type superstructure effectively inhibits the formation of vacancy clusters and mitigates the irreversible oxygen loss at a high voltage of 4.4&#8197;V. This material with fence&#8208;type superstructure displays outstanding cycling performance with a capacity retention of 85.8&#8201;% and a voltage retention of 98.5&#8201;% after 200 cycles.







Abstract
Enhancing the energy density of layered oxide cathode materials is of great significance for realizing high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries and promoting their commercial application. Lattice oxygen redox at high voltage usually enables a high capacity and energy density. But the structural degradation, severe voltage decay, and the resultant poor cycling performance caused by irreversible oxygen release seriously restrict the practical application. Herein we introduce a novel fence&#8208;type superstructure (2a&#215;3a type supercell) into O3&#8208;type layered cathode material Na0.9Li0.1Ni0.3Mn0.3Ti0.3O2 and achieve a stable cycling performance at a high voltage of 4.4&#8197;V. The fence&#8208;type superstructure effectively inhibits the formation of the vacancy clusters resulting from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Li migration and in&#8208;plane transition metal migration at high voltage due to the wide d&#8208;spacing, thereby significantly reducing the irreversible release of lattice oxygen and greatly stabilizing the crystal structure. The cathode exhibits a high energy density of 545&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, a high rate capability (112.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C) and a high cycling stability (85.8&#8201;%@200 cycles with a high initial capacity of 148.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C) accompanied by negligible voltage attenuation (98.5&#8201;%@200 cycles). This strategy provides a distinct spacing effect of superstructure to design stable high&#8208;voltage layered cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Highly Active Oxidation Catalysts through Confining Pd Clusters on CeO2 Nano&#8208;Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>

Synthesis approach towards rational tailoring the threshold of cluster formation in noble metal&#8208;ceria catalysts using CeO2 islands finely distributed on Al2O3 support. The spatial separation of CeO2 entities prevents highly active Pd clusters from redispersion and strong sintering during CO oxidation reaction.







Abstract
CeO2&#8208;supported noble metal clusters are attractive catalytic materials for several applications. However, their atomic dispersion under oxidizing reaction conditions often leads to catalyst deactivation. In this study, the noble metal cluster formation threshold is rationally adjusted by using a mixed CeO2&#8208;Al2O3 support. The preferential location of Pd on CeO2 islands leads to a high local surface noble metal concentration and promotes the in situ formation of small Pd clusters at a rather low noble metal loading (0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;%), which are shown to be the active species for CO conversion at low temperatures. As elucidated by complementary in situ/operando techniques, the spatial separation of CeO2 islands on Al2O3 confines the mobility of Pd, preventing the full redispersion or the formation of larger noble metal particles and maintaining a high CO oxidation activity at low temperatures. In a broader perspective, this approach to more efficiently use the noble metal can be transferred to further systems and reactions in heterogeneous catalysis.

Abstract
The concepts of sustainability and sustainable chemistry have attracted increasing attention in recent years, being of great importance to the younger generation. In this Viewpoint Article, we share how early&#8208;career chemists can contribute to the sustainable transformation of their discipline. We identify ways in which they can engage to catalyse action for change. This article does not attempt to answer questions about the most promising or pressing areas driving research and chemical innovation in the context of sustainability. Instead, we want to inspire and engage early&#8208;career chemists in pursuing sustainable actions by showcasing opportunities in education, outreach and policymaking, research culture and publishing, while highlighting existing challenges and the complexity of the topic. We want to empower early&#8208;career chemists by providing resources and ideas for engagement for a sustainable future globally. While the article focuses on students and early&#8208;career chemists, it provides insights to further stimulate the engagement of scientists from diverse backgrounds.

Twist operation on nanographenes induces inherent chirality which differs from the conventional axial or helical chirality. Yoshifumi Hashikawa, Fenghua Bai, Chaolumen et&#8197;al. studied a chiral nanographene with a two&#8208;fold twisted geometry in their Research Article (e202406927). The contorted pyrene as a central core of the nanographene significantly governs overall electronic nature leading to facile chemical oxidation, red emissivity, high quantum yield, and even chiroptical properties.

Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are attractive for selective hydrogenation reactions for their high selectivity, yet they often show inferior activity and are prone to aggregate under reaction conditions. In their Research Article (e202406262), Junling Lu et&#8197;al. report that the tuning of the local electronic structures of anchor sites on g&#8208;C3N4 by doping of boron atoms with low electronegativity allows achieving zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with remarkably improved hydrogenation activity and stability.

Pd on ceria , an important catalytic system for various oxidation reactions, is studied for CO oxidation in a Research Article (e202408511) by Jan&#8208;Dierk Grunwaldt et&#8197;al. The image depicts the new concept of bringing the noble metal in contact with a strongly interacting nano&#8208;island (i.e. ceria) on alumina to 1) facilitate the formation of the active clusters, 2) hinder their redispersion into single atoms, while 3) preventing strong sintering of Pd due to the spatial separation of the CeO2 islands.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cracking of non&#8208;Biodegradable Plastics to Chemicals and Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a Chinese legend, Yu successfully tamed the flood for agricultural irrigation by regulating the riverway rather than blocking the flow of water. From flood to treasure, this philosophy inspires excellent strategies for the valorization of non&#8208;degradable plastics. Photocatalytic cracking as an emerging approach to abstract the carbon atom resource recently reported is discussed and summarized in this review.







Abstract
Plastic pollution is worsening the living conditions on Earth, primarily due to the toxicity and stability of non&#8208;biodegradable plastics (NBPs). Photocatalytic cracking of NBPs is emerging as a promising way to cleave inert C&#8722;C bonds and abstract the carbon atoms from these wastes into valuable chemicals and fuels. However, controlling these processes is a huge challenge, ascribed to the complicated reactions of various NBPs. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the CO2 and carbon&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated photocatalytic cracking of NBPs, with an emphasis on the pivotal intermediates. The CO2&#8208;mediated cracking proceeded with indiscriminate C&#8722;H/C&#8722;C bond cleavage of NBPs and tandem photoreduction of CO2, while carbon&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated cracking was realized by the prior activation of C&#8722;H bonds for selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage of NBPs. Catalytic generation and conversion of different intermediates greatly depend on the kinds of active species and the structure of photocatalysts under irradiation. Meanwhile, the fate of a specific intermediate is compared with small molecule activation to reveal the key problems in the cracking of NBPs. Finally, the challenges and potential directions are discussed to improve the overall efficiency in the photocatalytic cracking of NBPs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent, one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers can be programmably obtained through chirality&#8208;assisted&#8208;synthesis (CAS) using synergically non&#8208;planar chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated synthons and ladder polymer chemistry.







Abstract
In the last decades, chemists have developed methods to synthesize helical molecular architectures using a combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. Very recently, the new class of completely covalent, one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers has vigorously emerged. Such polymers can be rationally and programmably obtained through an approach guided by the principles of chirality&#8208;assisted&#8208;synthesis (CAS) and making use synergically of two disciplines that have so far rarely interacted: non&#8208;planar chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated synthons and ladder polymer chemistry. The precise programmability of the 3D structure and new mechanical and chiroptical properties will lead to potential applications in areas such as enantiorecognition, catalysis, spintronics and chiral&#8208;related optoelectronics. This minireview examines the emerging field of one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers, analyzing their synthesis, applications, and limitations.

         <title>A Coppoborylene Stabilized by Multicenter Covalent Bonding and Its Amphoteric Reactivity to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;stabilized coppoborylene that was mass&#8208;isolated and spectroscopically characterized in the gas phase has a pseudo T&#8208;shaped structure and features classical borylene reactivity to CO. It evidences the potential feasibility of stabilizing amphoteric borylenes by an unprecedented multicenter covalent bond rather than the well&#8208;documented coordination tactics.







Abstract
A cationic copper&#8208;stabilized coppoborylene was prepared and structurally characterized via infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This structure exemplifies a new class of borylenes stabilized by three&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron metal&#8208;boron&#8208;metal covalent bonding interaction, displaying exceptional &#963;&#8208;acidity and unparalleled &#960;&#8208;donor capability for CO activation that outperforms all of the known transition metal cations and is comparable or even superior to the documented base&#8208;trapped borylenes. Its neutral form represents a monovalent boron compound with a strongly reactive amphoteric boron center built on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;boron bonds, which inspires the design and synthesis of new members of the borylene family.

         <title>Confined Growth of Highly Ordered Metal Atomic Arrays for Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the selective and efficient growth of highly ordered cobalt&#8208;iridium atoms on sp&#8208;hybridized graphdiyne by step&#8208;by&#8208;step anchoring of the metal atoms under ambient conditions. Such a well&#8208;designed system of the bimetallic atoms with high&#8208;density shows much better oxygen evolution reaction activity and stability than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art IrO2 catalysts in alkaline simulated seawater.







Abstract
Metal atom catalysts have been among the most important research objects due to their specific physical and chemical properties. However, precise control of the anchoring of metal atoms is still challenging to achieve. Cobalt and iridium atomic arrays formed sequentially ordered stable arrays in graphdiyne (GDY) triangular cavities depending on their intrinsic chemical properties and interactions. The success of this method was attributed to multifunctional integration of GDY, enabling selective growth from one to several atoms and various atomic densities. The bimetallic atom arrays show several advantages resulting from reducibility of acetylene bonds, space limiting effect, incomplete charge transfer between GDY and metal atoms, and sp&#8208;C hybridized triple bond skeleton. This well&#8208;designed system exhibits unprecedented oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a mass activity of 2.6&#8197;A&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 at a low overpotential of 300&#8197;mV, which is 216.6&#8197;times higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art IrO2 catalyst, and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>A Strong Supramolecular Mechanophore with Controlled Mechanical Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong yet controlled supramolecular mechanophore based on cucurbit[7]uril is developed through the use of charge&#8211;dipole repulsion. It exhibits a high mechanical strength of ~700&#8197;pN in the &#8722;COO&#8722; state, comparable with weak covalent bonds. This mechanical locking can be gradually tuned off by transitioning to the &#8722;COOH state, reaching a minimum value of ~150&#8197;pN.







Abstract
Supramolecular mechanophores typically exhibit much lower mechanical strengths than covalent counterparts, with strengths usually around 100&#8197;pN, which is significantly lower than the nN&#8208;scale strength of covalent bonds. Inspired by the slow dissociation kinetics of the cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])&#8211;hexanoate&#8208;isoquinoline (HIQ) complex, we discovered that charge&#8211;dipole repulsion can be utilized to create strong supramolecular mechanophores. When activated at its &#8722;COO&#8722; state, the CB[7]&#8722;HIQ complex exhibits a high mechanical strength of ~700&#8197;pN, comparable to weak covalent bonds such as Au&#8722;S bonds or thiol&#8211;maleimide adducts. The strength of the CB[7]&#8722;HIQ complex can also be tuned with pH in a gradual manner, with a minimum value of ~150&#8197;pN at its &#8722;COOH state, similar to an ordinary supramolecular conjugate. This research may pave the way for the development of supramolecular architectures that combine the advantages of covalent and supramolecular systems.

         <title>Enantioselective Dearomatization of Pyridinium Salts by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C4&#8208;Selective Addition of Silicon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C4&#8208;selective addition of soft copper&#8208;based silicon nucleophiles to pyridinium triflates allows for their enantioselective deraromatization in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (see scheme; (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE=1,2&#8208;bis[(2R,5R)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholan&#8208;1&#8208;yl]ethane). The thus&#8208;formed &#945;&#8208;chiral silyl unit can be further used to control the stereoselectivity in subsequent transformations.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed C4&#8208;selective addition of silicon nucleophiles released from an Si&#8722;B reagent to prochiral pyridinium triflates is reported. The dearomatization proceeds with excellent enantioselectivity using Cu(CH3CN)4PF6 as the precatalyst and (R,R)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE (1,2&#8208;bis[(2R,5R)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholan&#8208;1&#8208;yl]ethane) as the chiral ligand. A carbonyl group at C3 is required for this, likely acting a weak donor group to preorganize and direct the nucleophilic attack towards C4. The resulting 4&#8208;silylated 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines can be further converted into functionalized piperidine derivatives.

         <title>Microtiter Plate Immobilization Screening for Prototyping Heterogeneous Enzyme Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microliter plate screening method has been developed to determine the consensus immobilization protocol for the heterogenization of multi&#8208;enzymatic reaction cascades. The optimal immobilization strategy leading to the most active and stable heterogeneous biocatalysts was determined through an activity and stability assay, as demonstrated for an immobilized four&#8208;enzyme system to transform vinyl acetate into (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutyric acid.







Abstract
Immobilization is a key enabling technology in applied biocatalysis that facilitates the separation, recovery, and reuse of heterogeneous biocatalysts. However, finding a consensus immobilization protocol for several enzymes forming a multi&#8208;enzyme system is extremely difficult and relies on a combinatorial trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Herein, we describe a protocol in which 17 different carriers functionalized with different reactive groups are tested in a 96&#8208;well microtiter plate to screen up to 21 immobilization protocols for up to 18 enzymes. This screening includes an activity and stability assay to select the optimal immobilization chemistry to achieve the most active and stable heterogeneous biocatalysts. The information retrieved from the screening can be rationalized using a Python&#8208;based application CapiPy. Finally, through scoring the screening results, we find the consensus immobilization protocol to assemble an immobilized four&#8208;enzyme system to transform vinyl acetate into (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutyric acid. This methodology opens a path to speed up the prototyping of immobilized multi&#8208;enzyme pathways for chemical manufacturing.

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;Nonadjacent Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters Enabled by Pd/Cu&#8208;Cocatalyzed Asymmetric Heck Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereodivergent construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent tetrasubstituted stereocenters enabled by a Pd/Cu&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric Heck cascade reaction has been developed. An array of highly functionalized chiral molecules bearing two privileged scaffolds, oxindoles and &#945;&#8208;amino acids, were smoothly prepared. Notably, all four stereoisomers of the desired products were obtained through orthogonal permutations of two chiral metal catalysts.







Abstract
The construction of chiral motifs containing nonadjacent stereocenters in an enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner has long been a challenging task in synthetic chemistry, especially with respect to their stereodivergent synthesis. Herein, we describe a protocol that enables the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent tetrasubstituted stereocenters through a Pd/Cu&#8208;cocatalyzed Heck cascade reaction. Notably, a C=C bond relay strategy involving the shift of the &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate was successfully applied in the asymmetric construction of 1,7&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. The current method allows for the efficient preparation of chiral molecules bearing two privileged scaffolds, oxindoles and non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, with good functional group tolerance. The full complement of the four stereoisomers of products bearing 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters could be readily accessed by a simple combination of two chiral metal catalysts with different enantiomers.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Induced Interstitial Effects Drive Water Oxidation on Ordered Ir&#8722;B Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The B&#8208;induced interstitial effects in intermetallic IrB1.1 balance the acidic water oxidation activity and stability and leads to a good operation in proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers.







Abstract
Interstitial filling of light atoms strongly affects the electronic structure and adsorption properties of the parent catalyst due to ligand and ensemble effects. Different from the conventional doping and surface modification, constructing ordered intermetallic structures is more promising to overcome the dissolution and reconstruction of active sites through strong interactions generated by atomic periodic arrangement, achieving joint improvement in catalytic activity and stability. However, for tightly arranged metal lattices, such as iridium (Ir), obtaining ordered filling atoms and further unveiling their interstitial effects are still limited by highly activated processes. Herein, we report a high&#8208;temperature molten salt assisted strategy to form the intermetallic Ir&#8722;B compounds (IrB1.1) with ordered filling by light boron (B) atoms. The B residing in the interstitial lattice of Ir constitutes favorable adsorption surfaces through a donor&#8208;acceptor architecture, which has an optimal free energy uphill in rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in enhanced activity. Meanwhile, the strong coupling of Ir&#8722;B structural units suppresses the demetallation and reconstruction behavior of Ir, ensuring catalytic stability. Such B&#8208;induced interstitial effects endow IrB1.1 with higher OER performance than commercial IrO2, which is further validated in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs).

         <title>Phase Engineering of High&#8208;Entropy Alloy for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeCuNiAlTi high entropy alloy with uniform intermetallic nanoparticles shows enhanced electrochemical performance of nitrate reduction to ammonia in terms of NH3 yield (0.52&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and FE (95.23&#8201;%) due to increased electrochemical active surface area and charge transfer efficiency. Density functional theory calculations confirm the multi&#8208;site including Fe, Co and Ni catalysis with the lowest energy barrier on Co sites for nitrate reduction.







Abstract
Directly electrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) is an efficient and environmentally friendly technology for ammonia (NH3) production but is challenged by highly selective electrocatalysts. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with unique properties are attractive materials in catalysis, particularly for multi&#8208;step reactions. Herein, we first reported the application of HEA (FeCoNiAlTi) for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 (NRA). The bulk HEA is active for NRA but limited by the unsatisfied NH3 yield of 0.36&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.66&#8201;%. Through an effective phase engineering strategy, uniform intermetallic nanoparticles are introduced on the bulk HEA to increase electrochemical active surface area and charge transfer efficiency. The resulting nanostructured HEA (n&#8208;HEA) delivers enhanced electrochemical NRA performance in terms of NH3 yield (0.52&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and FE (95.23&#8201;%). Further experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the multi&#8208;active sites (Fe, Co, and Ni) dominated electrocatalysis for NRA over the n&#8208;HEA. Notably, the typical Co sites exhibit the lowest energy barrier for NRA with *NH2 to *NH3as the rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Unveiling Dynamic Structure and Bond Evolutions in BiOIO3 Photocatalysts during CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>

The combination of operando X&#8208;ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy has been conducted to correlate dynamic structure and bond evolutions with CO2 reduction activity on BiOIO3 photocatalysts.







Abstract
We have established a correlation between photocatalytic activity and dynamic structure/bond evolutions of BiOIO3&#8208;based photocatalysts during CO2 reduction by combining operando X&#8208;ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy. More specifically, the selective photo&#8208;deposition of PtOx species on BiOIO3 (010) facets could effectively promote the electron enrichment on Bi active sites of (100) facets for facilitating the adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, leading to the formation of Bi sites with high oxidation state and the shrink of crystalline structures. With introducing light irradiation to drive CO2 reduction, the Bi active sites with high oxidation states transformed into normal Bi3+ state, accompanying with the expansion of crystalline structures. Owing to the dynamic structure, bond, and chemical&#8208;state evolutions, a significant improvement of photocatalytic activity for CO evolution has been achieved on PtOx&#8208;BiOIO3 (195.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1), much higher than the pristine (61.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) as well as metal&#8208;Pt decorated BiOIO3 (70.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) samples. This work provides new insights to correlate the intrinsically dynamic structure/bond evolutions with CO2 reduction activity, which may help to guide future photocatalyst design.

&lt;p&gt;The combination of operando X-ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy has been conducted to correlate dynamic structure and bond evolutions with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity on BiOIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have established a correlation between photocatalytic activity and dynamic structure/bond evolutions of BiOIO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based photocatalysts during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction by combining operando X-ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy.

         <title>Dearomative Intramolecular meta&#8208;Thermocycloadditions of Benzene Rings via Wheland Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
meta&#8208;Thermocycloadditions of benzene rings was realized for the first time. Distinct to the meta&#8208;photocycloadditions, this reaction was proposed to proceed via [4&#960;+2&#960;] cycloadditions of Wheland intermediates from the electrophilic dearomatization of benzene rings. A broad spectrum of readily available C(sp2)&#8208;rich aniline&#8208;tethered enynes were transformed into C(sp3)&#8208;rich 3D complex polycyclic architectures simply by stirring in TFA.







Abstract
Dearomative cycloadditions are powerful synthetic transformations utilizing aromatic compounds for cycloaddition reactions. They have been extensively applied to the synthesis of biologically relevant compounds not only because of the complexity generated from simplicity but also the atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. For the most studied yet challenging benzene ring systems, ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;cycloadditions have been realized both photochemically and thermally, while the meta&#8208;cycloadditions are still limited to the photochemical processes tracing back to the 1960s. Herein, we for the first time realized the thermal cycloadditions of benzene rings with alkenes in a meta fashion via Wheland intermediates. A broad spectrum of readily available C(sp2)&#8208;rich aniline&#8208;tethered enynes were transformed into C(sp3)&#8208;rich 3D complex polycyclic architectures simply by stirring in TFA. Moreover, the reaction could be performed in gram&#8208;scales and the products could be diversely elaborated.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of a Mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer Carbodicarbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer carbodicarbene ligand was synthesized through reaction of a Fischer carbene complex with an N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefin. Subsequent transmetallations allow ligand transfer to different metal complexes, including RhCl(CO)2 (see graphic).







Abstract
Carbodicarbenes are strong C&#8208;donor ligands, which have found numerous applications in organometallic and main group element chemistry. Herein, we report a structurally distinct carbodicarbene ligand, which is formed by dinitrogenative coupling of a Fischer carbene complex with an N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefin. The resulting carbonyl complex serves as a stable source for the mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer carbodicarbene ligand. Facile ligand transfer reactions were demonstrated to occur with gold(I), copper(I), palladium(II), and rhodium(I) complexes.

         <title>XAT&#8208;Catalysis for Intramolecular Biaryl Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic, XAT mediated Smiles&#8208;Truce biaryl synthesis is described. The reaction uses mild methods to generate and chemoselectively harness capricious aryl radicals, efficiently furnishing valuable biaryl products. The reaction utilises a simple yet underexplored amide linker, which enables a challenging formal C&#8722;N arylation of anilines.







Abstract
Radical ipso&#8208;substitution offers an alternative to organometallic approaches for biaryl synthesis, but usually requires stoichiometric reagents such as tributyltin hydride. Here, we demonstrate that visible light photoredox catalysis can be used for ipso&#8208;biaryl synthesis, via a halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) regime. Using amide substrates that promote ipso&#8208; over unwanted ortho&#8208;addition, we demonstrate smooth biaryl formation with no constraint on the electronic character of the migrating arene ring. The photoreaction can be combined in one operation to achieve a formal arylation of the inert aniline C&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Accelerated Screening of Alternative DNA Base&#8208;Organic Molecule&#8208;Base Architectures via Integrated Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collaborative protocol of fast theoretical simulation and convenient experimental validation was developed for large&#8208;scale screening of alternative DNA base&#8208;organic molecule&#8208;base architectures beyond Watson&#8211;Crick pairs, thereby expanding molecule&#8208;mediated non&#8208;classical DNA self&#8208;assembly structures.







Abstract
Organic molecule&#8208;mediated noncanonical DNA self&#8208;assembly expands the standard DNA base&#8208;pairing alphabets. However, only a very limited number of small molecules have been recognized as mediators because of the tedious and complicated experiments like crystallization and microscopy imaging. Here we present an integrative screening protocol incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) for fast theoretical simulation and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for convenient experimental validation. Melamine, the molecule that was confirmed mediating noncanonical DNA base&#8208;pairing, and 38 other candidate molecules were applied to demonstrate the feasibility of this protocol. We successfully identified seven stable noncanonical DNA duplex structures, and another eight novel structures with sub&#8208;stability. In addition, we discovered that hairpins at both ends can significantly stabilize the noncanonical DNA structures, providing a guideline to design small organic molecule&#8208;incorporated DNA structures. Such an efficient screening protocol will accelerate the design of alternative DNA&#8208;molecule architectures beyond Watson&#8211;Crick pairs. Considering the wide range of potential mediators, it will also facilitate applications such as noncovalent, highly dense loading of drug molecules in DNA&#8208;based delivery system and probe design for sensitive detection of certain molecules.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Pure Covalent Tubes Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

         <dc:description>
We synthesized four chiral molecular tubes by condensing enantiomerically pure trans&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine with luminescent tetraformyl precursors. Within the framework of these tubes, the stereochirality of the bisamino building blocks was transferred and amplified, leading to planar chirality of the tubes. These tubes thus demonstrate a promising approach to CPL&#8208;active materials.







Abstract
Here, we successfully synthesized four structurally analogous, self&#8208;assembled chiral molecular tubes with relatively high yields. This achievement involved the condensation of six equivalents of enantiomerically pure trans&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine (trans&#8208;CHDA) and three equivalents of the corresponding tetraformyl precursor. Each precursor was equipped with a luminescent linker terminated by two m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. Even though these tetraformyl precursors are barely soluble in almost all organic solvents, the molecular tubes are highly soluble in nonpolar solvents such as chloroform, allowing us to fully characterize them in solution. The stereo&#8208;chirality of the chiral bisamino building blocks endows the frameworks of molecular tubes with planar chirality. As a consequence, all of these molecular tubes exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with relatively large dissymmetry values |glum| up to 7&#215;10&#8722;3, providing an efficient method for synthesizing CPL&#8208;active materials.

         <title>Redox Synergy: Enhancing Gas Sensing Stability in 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Balancing Metal Node and Ligand Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox innocent zinc metal center&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOF, Zn3(HHTQ)2, with ligand&#8208;centered sensing active sites has been developed for NO2 sensing, which demonstrates excellent cycling stability and high selectivity without compromising the coordination bonds.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates in gas sensing, owing to their tunable porous structure and conductivity. Nevertheless, the reported gas sensing mechanisms heavily relied on electron transfer between metal nodes and gas molecules. Normally, the strong interaction between the metal sites and target gas molecule would result poor recovery and thus bad recycling property. Herein, we propose a redox synergy strategy to overcome this issue by balancing the reactivity of metal sites and ligands. A 2D c&#8208;MOF, Zn3(HHTQ)2, was prepared for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensing, which was constructed from active ligands (hexahydroxyltricycloquinazoline, HHTQ) and inactive transition&#8208;metal ions (Zn2+). Substantial characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that by utilizing only the redox interactions between ligands and NO2, not only high sensitivity and selectivity, but also excellent cycling stability in NO2 sensing could be achieved. In contrast, control experiments employing isostructural 2D c&#8208;MOFs with Cu/Ni metal nodes exhibited irreversible NO2 sensing. Our current work provides a new design strategy for gas sensing materials, emphasizing harnessing the redox activity of only ligands to enhance the stability of MOF sensing materials.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,n&#8208;remote aminoacetoxylation of cis&#8208;alkenes has been developed using PhI(OAc)2 as an oxidant, providing the acetoxylated lactams with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. The sterically hindered pyridine&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) L3 with a tert&#8208;butyl group in oxazoline ring and propyl group in C6 position of pyridinyl is vital for the reaction, where the former is good for asymmetric aminopalladation step and the latter for the chain walking process. The enantioenriched lactam products were proven to be good building blocks for the synthesis of azabicycles.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Sulfinamidines via Asymmetric Nitrogen Transfer from N&#8722;H Oxaziridines to Sulfenamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein is reported an enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamidines by electrophilic amination of sulfenamides with enantiopure N&#8722;H oxaziridines. The enantioenriched sulfinamidines show remarkable chemical and configurational stability against high temperature, acids, and bases in non&#8208;aqueous solution. One&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamides is further demonstrated by employing enantiopure N&#8722;H oxaziridine reagents.







Abstract
Sulfinamidines are promising aza&#8208;SIV chiral building blocks in asymmetric synthesis and drug discovery. However, no report has documented their enantioselective synthesis. Here we present an enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamidines via electrophilic amination of sulfenamides using an enantiopure N&#8722;H oxaziridine. The resulting enantiomerically enriched primary sulfinamidines are configurationally stable at 90&#8201;&#176;C in solution and show remarkable stability against organic acids and bases under non&#8208;aqueous conditions. We also demonstrate a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamides using N&#8722;H oxaziridine reagents.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopentenes by (3+2) Annulation via a 2&#8208;Carbon Phosphonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylphosphonium intermediates, commonly accessed from ynoates, undergo normal and reverse polarity couplings. Herein we exploit &#946;&#8208;iodoenoates as alternatives to ynoates. As a consequence, we have been able to develop an enantioselective approach to cyclopentenes via &#945; (3+2) annulation. In addition to delivering a new approach to cyclopentenes this is the first general enantioselective annulation exploiting this intermediate.







Abstract
Herein we report a catalytic enantioselective (3+2) annulation, in which a vinyl phosphonium intermediate serves as the 2&#8208;carbon component. The reaction involves an &#945;&#8208;umpolung &#946;&#8208;umpolung coupling sequence, enabled by &#946;&#8208;haloacrylates and chiral enantioenriched phosphepine catalysts. The reaction shows good generality, providing access to an array of cyclopentenes, with mechanistic studies supporting stereospecific formation of the vinyl phosphonium intermediate which, then undergoes annulation with turn over limiting catalyst elimination. Beyond defining a new approach to cyclopentenes, these studies demonstrate that &#946;&#8208;haloacrylates can replace ynoates in reaction designs that require exclusive umpolung coupling at the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions.

         <title>Formation, Structure and Reactivity of a Beryllium(0) Complex with Mg&#948;+&#8722;Be&#948;&#8722; Bond Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging low&#8208;valent MgI and BeI chemistry, a unique complex with a Mg&#8722;Be bond was isolated and structurally characterized. Formally a MgII&#8722;Be0 complex, the bond is significantly polarized Mg&#948;+&#8722;Be&#948;&#8722;. Despite this polarity, the complex is thermally stable and only reacts with polar unsaturated C=O, C=S or N=N bonds.







Abstract
Attempts to create a novel Mg&#8722;Be bond by reaction of [(DIPePBDI*)MgNa]2 with Be[N(SiMe3)2]2 failed; DIPePBDI*=HC[(tBu)C=N(DIPeP)]2, DIPeP=2,6&#8208;Et2C&#8208;phenyl. Even at elevated temperatures, no conversion was observed. This is likely caused by strong steric shielding of the Be center. A similar reaction with the more open Cp*BeCl gave in quantitative yield (DIPePBDI*)MgBeCp* (1). The crystal structure shows a Mg&#8722;Be bond of 2.469(4)&#8197;&#197;. Homolytic cleavage of the Mg&#8722;Be bond requires &#916;H=69.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (cf. CpBe&#8722;BeCp 69.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and (DIPPBDI)Mg&#8722;Mg(DIPPBDI) 55.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Natural&#8208;Population&#8208;Analysis (NPA) shows fragment charges: (DIPePBDI*)Mg +0.27/BeCp* &#8722;0.27. The very low NPA charge on Be (+0.62) compared to Mg (+1.21) and the strongly upfield 9Be NMR signal at &#8722;23.7&#8197;ppm are in line with considerable electron density on Be and the formal oxidation state assignment of MgII&#8722;Be0. Despite this Mg&#948;+&#8722;Be&#948;&#8722; polarity, 1 is extremely thermally stable and unreactive towards H2, CO, N2, cyclohexene and carbodiimide. It reacted with benzophenone, azobenzene, phenyl acetylene, CO2 and CS2. Reaction with 1&#8208;adamantyl azide led to reductive coupling and formation of an N6&#8208;chain. The azide reagent also inserted in the Cp*&#8722;Be bond. The inertness of 1 is likely due to bulky ligands protecting the Mg&#8722;Be unit.

         <title>Artificial Channels Based on Bottlebrush Polymers: Enhanced Ion Transport Through Polymer Topology Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottlebrush polymers can be used to mimic natural ion channels when functionalized with ion&#8208;binding urea groups. The unique topology of these polymer channels enables efficient and selective ion transport across lipid bilayers, highlighting the importance of topology control in designing polymer&#8208;based ion transport systems.







Abstract
Synthetic structures mimicking the transport function of natural ion channel proteins have a wide range of applications, including therapeutic treatments, separation membranes, sensing, and biotechnologies. However, the development of polymer&#8208;based artificial channels has been hampered due to the limitation on available models. In this study, we demonstrate the great potential of bottlebrush polymers as accessible and versatile molecular scaffolds for developing efficient artificial ion channels. Adopting the bottlebrush configuration enhanced ion transport activity of the channels compared to their linear analogs. Matching the structure of lipid bilayers, the bottlebrush channel with a hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic triblock architecture exhibited the highest activity among the series. Functionalized with urea groups, these channels displayed high anion selectivity. Additionally, we illustrated that the transport properties could be fine&#8208;tuned by modifying the chemistry of ion binding sites. This work not only highlights the importance of polymer topology control in channel design, but also reveals the great potential for further developing bottlebrush channels with customized features and diverse functionalities.

Structural degradation of M&#8208;N&#8208;C (M=Co, Ni, and Fe) single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) used as cathode materials at industrial&#8208;grade current density during long&#8208;term reduction is demonstrated. Both M&#8208;N and N&#8208;C are broken, resulting in the dissolution of N and the formation of M&#8208;containing core&#8211;shell nanoparticles, thus greatly affecting the electrocatalytic performances.







Abstract
M&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrode materials for many electro&#8208;reduction reactions. However, their stability is far from practical applications, and their deactivation mechanism has been rarely investigated. Herein, we demonstrate the structural degradation of M&#8208;N&#8208;C (M=Co, Ni, and Fe) at industrial&#8208;grade current density for long&#8208;term electro&#8208;reduction. Both M&#8208;N and N&#8208;C bonds are broken, resulting in the gradual hydrogenation and dissolution of N in the form of ammonia. The residual M is finally converted to M&#8208;containing core&#8211;shell nanoparticles after sequential dissolution, redeposition, and electro&#8208;reduction. The destruction of the M&#8208;N&#8208;C structure and the formation of nanoparticles greatly affect the electrocatalytic performance. Our work highlights the structural degradation and deactivation mechanism of M&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;type SACs under strong reductive conditions and provides useful information for inspiring researchers to develop new strategies to improve the electrocatalytic stability of similar types of materials.

         <title>Development of an Organic Emitter Exhibiting Reverse Intersystem Crossing Faster than Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inverted singlet&#8208;triplet excited states (iST) molecule, A6AP&#8208;Cz, based on asymmetric hexa&#8208;azaphenalene was designed. A6AP&#8208;Cz showed the extremely short lifetime of delayed fluorescence (&#964;DF) of 54&#8197;ns. Moreover, the reverse intersystem crossing (rate constant of RISC: kRISC=1.9&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1) was faster than ISC (rate constant of ISC: kISC=1.0&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1) due to the negative energy gap between lowest excited singlet and triplet states (&#916;EST).







Abstract
In thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), acceleration of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and suppression of intersystem crossing (ISC) are demanded to shorten a lifetime of triplet excitons. As a system realizing RISC faster than ISC, inverted singlet&#8208;triplet excited states (iST) with a negative energy difference (&#916;EST) between the lowest excited singlet and the lowest triplet states have been gathering much attention recently. Here, we have focused on an asymmetric hexa&#8208;azaphenalene (A6AP) core to obtain a new insight into iST. Based on A6AP, we have newly designed A6AP&#8208;Cz with the calculated &#916;EST of &#8722;44&#8197;meV. The experimental studies of a synthesized A6AP&#8208;Cz revealed that the lifetime of delayed fluorescence (&#964;DF) was only 54&#8197;ns, which was the shortest among all organic materials. The rate constant of RISC (kRISC=1.9&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1) was greater than that of ISC (kISC=1.0&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1). The negative &#916;EST of A6AP&#8208;Cz was experimentally confirmed from 1) the kRISC and kISC (&#8722;45&#8197;meV) and 2) the temperature&#8208;dependent &#964;DF. 3) The onsets of fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra at 77&#8197;K also supported the evidence of negative &#916;EST (&#8722;73&#8197;meV). This study demonstrated the potential of A6AP as an iST core for the first time.

&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)-based organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), acceleration of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and suppression of intersystem crossing (ISC) are demanded to shorten a lifetime of triplet excitons. As a system realizing RISC faster than ISC, inverted singlet-triplet excited states (iST) with a negative energy difference (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;) between the lowest excited singlet and the lowest triplet states have been gathering much attention recently. Here, we have focused on an asymmetric hexa-azaphenalene (A6AP) core to obtain a new insight into iST. Based on A6AP, we have newly designed &lt;b&gt;A6AP-Cz&lt;/b&gt; with the calculated &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; of &#8722;44&#8197;meV. The experimental studies of a synthesized &lt;b&gt;A6AP-Cz&lt;/b&gt; revealed that the lifetime of delayed fluorescence (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;DF&lt;/sub&gt;) was only 54&#8197;ns, which was the shortest among all organic materials. The rate constant of RISC (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt;=1.9&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) was greater than that of ISC (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ISC&lt;/sub&gt;=1.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The negative &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; of &lt;b&gt;A6AP-Cz&lt;/b&gt; was experimentally confirmed from 1) the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ISC&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8722;45&#8197;meV) and 2) the temperature-dependent &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;DF&lt;/sub&gt;. 3) The onsets of fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra at 77&#8197;K also supported the evidence of negative &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8722;73&#8197;meV). This study demonstrated the potential of A6AP as an iST core for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting External Quantum Efficiency to 12.0&#8201;% of an Ultraviolet OLED by Engineering the Horizontal Dipole Orientation of a Hot Exciton Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linear D&#8211;A&#8211;D triad UV emitter, namely CDFDB, which possesses high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) property. Thanks to its integrated narrowband UV emission, good hot exciton conversion capability and large horizontal dipole ratio, the CDFDB&#8208;based UV OLED can emit highly efficient near UV EL at 398&#8197;nm (CIEx,y: 0.161, 0.040) with a maximum EQE of 12.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
Currently, much research effort has been devoted to improving the exciton utilization efficiency and narrowing the emission spectra of ultraviolet (UV) fluorophores for organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) applications, while almost no attention has been paid to optimizing their light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Here, we developed a linear donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) triad, namely CDFDB, which possesses high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) property. Thanks to its integrated narrowband UV photoluminescence (PL) (&#955;PL: 397&#8197;nm; FWHM: 48&#8197;nm), moderate PL quantum yield (&#981;PL: 72&#8201;%, Tol), good triplet hot exciton (HE) conversion capability, and large horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;//: 92&#8201;%), the OLEDs based on CDFDB not only can emit UV electroluminescence with relatively good color purity (&#955;EL: 398&#8197;nm; CIEx,y: 0.161, 0.040), but also show a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 12.0&#8201;%. This study highlights the important role of horizontal dipole orientation engineering in the molecular design of HE UV&#8208;OLED fluorophores.

Abstract
We report a photochemical method for the semipinacol rearrangement of unactivated allylic alcohols. Aliphatic as well as aromatic groups participate as migrating groups, yielding a variety of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and is compatible with ethers, esters, halides, nitriles, carbamates, and substituted arenes. The operationally simple and fully catalytic conditions prescribe 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst, 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% Co&#8208;salen, and 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% lutidinium triflate and, importantly, display reactivity complementary to procedures employing Br&#248;nsted acid. We showcase the utility of the protocol in late&#8208;stage drug diversifications.

         <title>A Merger of Relay Catalysis with Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Enables Enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 35, August 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective arylation of unactivated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bond of primary alcohols was achieved under mild conditions by constructing a cooperative system merging relay catalysis with dynamic kinetic resolution of transient aryl aldehyde intermediates, demonstrating new opportunities in multicatalysis to execute otherwise challenging transformations.







Abstract
The conceptual merger of relay catalysis with dynamic kinetic resolution strategy is reported to enable regio&#8208; and enantioselective C(sp3)&#8208;H bond arylation of aliphatic alcohols, forming enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols typically with &gt;90&#8201;:&#8201;10 enantiomeric ratios (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er) and 36&#8211;74&#8201;% yields. The starting materials bearing neighbouring stereogenic centres can be converted to either diastereomer of the &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohol products, with &gt;85&#8201;:&#8201;15 diastereomeric ratios determined by the catalysts. The reactions occur under mild conditions, ensuring broad compatibility, and involve readily available aryl bromides, an inorganic base, and commercial Ru&#8208; and Pd&#8208;complexes. Mechanistic experiments support the envisioned mechanism of the transformation occurring through a network of regio&#8208; and stereoselective processes operated by a coherent Ru/Pd&#8208;dual catalytic system.

         <title>Organometallic Polymer Constructed by Active Fe&#8208;C12N8 Centers for Boosting Sodium&#8208;ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;metal coordination materials with rich structural diversity are considered as promising electrode materials for rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the electrochemical performance can be constrained by the limited number of active sites and structural instability under the discharge/charge process. Herein, organometallic polymer microspheres (Fe&#8208;PDA&#8208;220) with a unique d&#8208;&#960; conjugated structure was designed and successfully constructed through a simple synchronous polymerization and coordination reactions. Polymerization of phenylenediamine was initiated by Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions generated synchronously during the polymerization integrated with poly&#8208;aminoquinone chains to form Fe&#8208;C12N8 active centers. Used as electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the distinctive Fe&#8208;C bond significantly boosts the structural stability, and the &#960;&#8208;d conjugation system could facilitate electron transfer. A high reversible capacity of 345 mAh g&#8208;1 was delivered at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and a capacity of 106 mAh g&#8208;1 was maintained even after discharged/charged at 1.0 A g&#8208;1 for 5000 cycles, outperforming most reported coordination materials. Spectroscopic and electronic analyses revealed that a two&#8208;electron reaction occurred per active unit, accompanied by the reversible redox evolution of the C=N groups and Fe ions during&#160; sodiation/desodiation. This work provides a promising and efficient strategy for boosting the electrochemical performance of organic electrode materials by the design of organometallic polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Durable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Multifunctional Additives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverted perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (P/O TSCs) suffer from poor long&#8208;term device stability due to halide segregation in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites, which hinders their practical deployment. Therefore, developing all&#8208;inorganic WBG perovskites for incorporation into P/O TSCs is a promising strategy because of their superior stability under continuous illumination. However, these inorganic WBG perovskites also face some critical issues, including rapid crystallization, phase instability, and large energy loss, etc. To tackle these issues, two multifunctional additives based on 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (AQS) are developed to regulate the perovskite crystallization by mediating the intermediate phases and suppress the halide segregation through the redox&#8208;shuttle effect. By coupling with organic cations having the desirable functional groups and dipole moments, these additives can effectively passivate the defects and adjust the alignment of interface energy levels. Consequently, a record Voc approaching 1.3 V with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.59% could be achieved in a 1.78 eV bandgap single&#8208;junction inverted all&#8208;inorganic PSC. More importantly, the P/O TSC derived from this cell demonstrates a T90 lifetime of 1000 h under continuous operation, presenting the most stable P/O TSCs reported so far.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Memristors Based on Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Obtained by Using a Protonation Modification Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are garnering substantial interest in resistive random&#8208;access memory, attributed to their superior crystallinity, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and modifiable molecular structures. However, the development of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based memristors impeded by challenges such as low conjugation degree of imine bonds and poor electron delocalization ability. Herein, we report a protonation strategy to modify the imine bonds of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs. This modification significantly enhances the electron delocalization capability of imine bonds, lowers the energy barriers for electron injection from electrodes, and stabilizes the conductive charge transfer state, thus markedly improving device performance. The protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;BPy and COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT thin films&#8208;based memristors show remarkable device performance with a high ON/OFF current ratio of 105, a low driving voltage, and outstanding endurance exceeding 600 and 1300 cycles, respectively, which is nearly twice the durability of analogous non&#8208;protonated COFs&#8208;based memristors. Notably, the protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT&#8208;based memristor exhibit the highest number of cycles reported at present. This work not only unprecedentedly enhances the performance of COF&#8208;based memristors, but also provides a universal and promising approach for the molecular design and potential application of D&#8208;A type imine&#8208;linked COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hofmann Clathrates: A &#8220;Blue Box&#8221; Approach to Modulate Spin&#8208;Crossover Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hofmann coordination polymers (CPs) with cationic ligands provide an innovative strategy for recognizing p&#8208;electron&#8208;rich aromatic molecules &#8211; similar to the &#8220;little blue box&#8221;. In this study, we demonstrate that hydroquinone molecules can be incorporated into these coordination polymers when redox&#8208;active bipyridinium derivatives are used as axial ligands. The insertion leads to a significant structural modification, resulting in a shift of the spin transition by 150 K and an approximate 23% increase in volume, caused by the strong donor&#8208;acceptor p&#8208;p stacking interaction formed between the ligands and the guest molecule. These findings have been confirmed through temperature&#8208;dependent single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements and optical reflectivity measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Thienyltriazine Triamides: Thickness Insensitive Interlayer Materials Featuring Fine&#8208;tuned Optoelectronic and Aggregation Characters for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel class of thienyltriazine triamides (TTTAs) was facile synthesized and firstly used as cathode interlayers (CILs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). By utilizing different aromatic arms and pendant polar groups, their optoelectronic properties and aggregation behaviors were effectively modulated. The combination of thienyltriazine (TT) core, naphthylamide arm and imidazole pendant group endows TT&#8208;N&#8208;M with suitable energy levels, intensified work function tunability, higher conductivity, and well&#8208;balanced crystallinity and film&#8208;forming ability, boosting both the performance and stability of OSCs significantly. Remarkably, the solar cell efficiency remains stable at around 90% of the optimal efficiency even as the interlayer thickness varied from 5 to 95 nm, demonstrating its insensitivity to thickness. Moreover, TT&#8208;N&#8208;M exhibits compatibility with various active layer systems, achieving a maximum efficiency of 19.60% for single&#8208;junction solar cell. Its exceptional tolerance to thickness fluctuations and performance establishes a new benchmark for multi&#8208;armed CIL&#8208;based OSCs, also positioning them among the most high&#8208;performing CIL materials documented thus far.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A novel class of thienyltriazine triamides (TTTAs) was facile synthesized and firstly used as cathode interlayers (CILs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). By utilizing different aromatic arms and pendant polar groups, their optoelectronic properties and aggregation behaviors were effectively modulated. The combination of thienyltriazine (TT) core, naphthylamide arm and imidazole pendant group endows TT-N-M with suitable energy levels, intensified work function tunability, higher conductivity, and well-balanced crystallinity and film-forming ability, boosting both the performance and stability of OSCs significantly. Remarkably, the solar cell efficiency remains stable at around 90% of the optimal efficiency even as the interlayer thickness varied from 5 to 95 nm, demonstrating its insensitivity to thickness. Moreover, TT-N-M exhibits compatibility with various active layer systems, achieving a maximum efficiency of 19.60% for single-junction solar cell. Its exceptional tolerance to thickness fluctuations and performance establishes a new benchmark for multi-armed CIL-based OSCs, also positioning them among the most high-performing CIL materials documented thus far. This work not only broadens the scope of CIL materials for OSCs but also offers deep insights into design strategies and structure-properties relationships, being beneficial for the future development of more efficient CIL materials for organic optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synchronously Improved Multiple Afterglow and Phosphorescence Efficiencies in 0D Hybrid Zinc Halides with Ultrahigh Anti&#8208;Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides have been emerged as room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, but synchronous optimization of multiple phosphorescence performance in one structural platform remains less resolved, and stable RTP activity in aqueous medium is also unrealized due to serious instability toward water and oxygen. Herein, we demonstrated a photophysical tuning strategy in a new 0D hybrid zinc halide family of (BTPP)2ZnX4 (BTPP = benzyltriphenylphosphonium, X = Cl and Br). Infrequently, the delicate combination of organic and inorganic species enables this family to display multiple ultralong green afterglow and efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) associated cyan phosphorescence. Compared with inert luminescence of [BTPP]+ cation, incorporation of anionic [ZnX4]2&#8208; effectively enhance the spin&#8211;orbit coupling effect, which significantly boosts the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 30.66% and 54.62% for afterglow and phosphorescence, respectively. Synchronously, the corresponding luminescence lifetime extend to 143.94 ms and 0.308 &#956;s surpassing the indiscernible phosphorescence of [BTPP]X salt. More importantly, this halide family presents robust RTP emission with nearly unattenuated PLQY in water and harsh condition (acid and basic aqueous solution) over half a year. The highly efficient integrated afterglow and STE phosphorescence as well as ultrahigh aqueous state RTP realize multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications in wide chemical environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond Single&#8208;Cycle Autonomous Molecular Machines: Light&#8208;Powered Shuttling in a Multi&#8208;Cycle Reaction Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomolecular machines autonomously convert energy into functions, driving systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium. This energy conversion is achieved by leveraging complex, kinetically asymmetric chemical reaction networks that are challenging to characterize precisely. In contrast, all known synthetic molecular systems in which kinetic asymmetry has been quantified are well described by simple single&#8208;cycle networks. Here, we report on a unique light&#8208;driven [2]rotaxane that enables the autonomous operation of a synthetic molecular machine with a multi&#8208;cycle chemical reaction network. Unlike all prior systems, the present one exploits a photoactive macrocycle, which features a different photoreactivity depending on the binding sites at which it resides. Furthermore, E to Z isomerization reverses the relative affinity of the macrocycle for two binding sites on the axle, resulting in a multi&#8208;cycle network. Building on the most recent theoretical advancements, this work quantifies kinetic asymmetry in a multi&#8208;cycle network for the first time. Our findings represent the simplest rotaxane capable of autonomous shuttling developed so far and offer a general strategy to generate and quantify kinetic asymmetry beyond single&#8208;cycle systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Catalytic SEAr H/D Exchange of Arenes with D2O: Metal&#8208;Free Deuteration of Natural Complexes and Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic metal&#8208;free approach for the H/D exchange in aromatic compounds using D2O as the terminal deuterating reagent has been developed. This metal&#8208;free protocol employs a triaryl carbenium as the mediator and showcases a wide applicability in the late&#8208;stage deuteration of various natural products and small&#8208;molecule drugs. Gram&#8208;scale deuteration was successfully demonstrated with &#946;&#8208;Estradiol, highlighting the method's practicability. Detailed mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, unveiled the essential role of in&#8208;situ generated acidic species in this electrophilic aromatic substitution process. This newly developed method offers a sustainable and versatile alternative to traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange techniques, addressing challenges such as the use of expensive metals, impurity formation, and the necessity for residual metal removal from the final products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nitroreductase&#8208;activatable Metabolic Reporter for Covalent Labeling of Pathological Hypoxic Cells in Tumorigenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aberrant hypoxic stress will initiate a cascade of pathological consequence observed prominently in tumorigenesis. Understanding of hypoxia&#8217;s role in tumorigenesis is &#160;highly essential for developing effective therapeutics, which necessitates reliable tools to specifically distinguish hypoxic tumor cells (or tissues) and correlate their dynamics with the status of disease in complex living settings for precise theranostics. So far, disparate hypoxia&#8208;responsive probe molecules and prodrugs were designed via chemical or enzymatic reactions, yet their capability in real&#8208;time reporting pathogenesis&#160;development is often compromised due to unrestricted diffusion and less selectivity towards the environmental responsiveness. Herein we&#160;present an oxygen&#8208;insensitive nitroreductase (NTR)&#8208;activatable glycan metabolic reporter (pNB&#8208;ManNAz) capable of covalently labeling hypoxic tumor cells and tissues. Under pathophysiological hypoxic environments, the caged non&#8208;metabolizable precursor pNB&#8208;ManNAz exhibited unique responsiveness to cellular NTR,&#160;culminating in structural self&#8208;immolation and the resultant ManNAz could incorporate onto cell surface glycoproteins, thereby facilitating fluorescence labeling via bioorthogonal chemistry. This NTR&#8208;responsive metabolic reporter demonstrated broad applicability for multicellular&#160;hypoxia labeling, particularly in the dynamic&#160;monitoring of orthotopic tumorigenesis and targeted tumor phototherapy in vivo. We anticipate that this approach holds promise for investigating hypoxia&#8208;related pathological progression,&#160;offering valuable insights for accurate diagnosis and treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioconvergent and Site&#8208;Selective Etherification of Carbohydrate Polyols through Chiral Copper Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Going beyond currently reported two electron transformations that formed the core backdrop of asymmetric catalytic site&#8208;selective carbohydrate polyol functionalizations, we herein report a seminal demonstration of an enantioconvergent copper catalyzed site&#8208;selective etherification of minimally protected saccharides through a single&#8208;electron radical pathway. Further, this strategy paves a rare strategy, through which a carboxamide scaffold that is present in some glycomimetics of pharmacological relevance, can be selectively introduced. In light of the burgeoning interest in chiral radical catalysis, and the virtual absence of such stereocontrol broadly in carbohydrate synthesis, our strategy showcased the unknown capability of chiral radical copper catalysis as a contemporary tool to address the formidable site&#8208;selectivity challenge on a remarkable palette of naturally occurring saccharides. When reducing sugars were employed, a further dynamic kinetic resolution type glycosylation can be activated by the catalytic system to selectively generate the challenging &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides.</dc:description>

         <title>Potent and Protease Resistant Azapeptide Agonists of the GLP&#8208;1 and GIP Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The gut&#8208;derived peptide hormones glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 (GLP&#8208;1) and glucose&#8208;dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) play important physiological roles. Stabilized agonists of the GLP&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R) and the GIP receptor (GIPR) for the management of diabetes and obesity have generated widespread enthusiasm and have become blockbuster drugs. These therapeutics are refractory to the action of dipeptidyl peptidase&#8208;4 (DPP4), that catalyzes rapid removal of the two N&#8208;terminal residues of the native peptides, in turn severely diminishing their activity profiles.&#160; Here we report that a single atom change from carbon to nitrogen in the backbone of the entire peptide make them refractory to DPP4 action while still retaining full potency and efficacy at their respective receptors.&#160; This was accomplished by use of aza&#8208;amino acids, that are bioisosteric replacements for a&#8208;amino acids that perturb the structural backbone and local side chain conformations.&#160; Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that aza&#8208;amino acid can populate the same conformational space that GLP&#8208;1 adopts when bound to the GLP&#8208;1R. The insertion of an aza&#8208;amino acid at the second position from the N&#8208;terminus in semaglutide and in a dual agonist of GLP&#8208;1R and GIPR further demonstrates its capability as a viable alternative to current DPP4 resistance strategies while offering additional structural variety.</dc:description>

These therapeutics are refractory to the action of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), that catalyzes rapid removal of the two N-terminal residues of the native peptides, in turn severely diminishing their activity profiles.&#160; Here we report that a single atom change from carbon to nitrogen in the backbone of the entire peptide make them refractory to DPP4 action while still retaining full potency and efficacy at their respective receptors.&#160; This was accomplished by use of aza-amino acids, that are bioisosteric replacements for a-amino acids that perturb the structural backbone and local side chain conformations.&#160; Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that aza-amino acid can populate the same conformational space that GLP-1 adopts when bound to the GLP-1R. The insertion of an aza-amino acid at the second position from the N-terminus in semaglutide and in a dual agonist of GLP-1R and GIPR further demonstrates its capability as a viable alternative to current DPP4 resistance strategies while offering additional structural variety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diaminonaphthalene Boronic Acid (DANBA): New Approach for Peroxynitrite Sensing Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is vital for studying their role in brain diseases. Fluorescence probes can distinguish ONOO&#8208; species from other ROS; however, their selectivity toward ONOO&#8208; species depends on the ONOO&#8208; recognition group. Aryl&#8208;boronic acids and esters, which are common ONOO&#8208; recognition groups, are not selective for ONOO&#8208; over H2O2. In this study, we developed a diaminonaphthalene (DAN)&#8208;protected boronic acid as a new ONOO&#8208; recognition group that selectively reacts with ONOO&#8208; over H2O2 and other ROS. Three DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid (DANBA)&#8208;based fluorophores that emit fluorescence over visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions, Cou&#8208;BN, BVP&#8208;BN, and HDM&#8208;BN, and their aryl&#8208;boronic acid&#8208;based counterparts (Cou&#8208;BO, BVP&#8208;BO, and HDM&#8208;BO), were developed. The DANBA&#8208;based probes exhibited enhanced selectivity toward ONOO&#8208; over that of their control group, as well as universality in MTT assays and in vitro experiments with PC12 cells. The NIR&#8208;emissive HDM&#8208;BN was optimized to delineate in vivo ONOO&#8208; levels in mouse brains with Parkinson&#8217;s disease. This DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid belongs to a new generation of recognition groups for developing ONOO&#8208; probes, and this strategy could be extended to other common hydroxyl&#8208;containing dyes to detect ONOO&#8208; levels in complex biological systems and processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by a Fullerene&#8208;Based Hole Transport Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing an efficient modification molecule to mitigate non&#8208;radiative recombination at the NiOx/perovskite interface and improve perovskite quality represents a challenging yet crucial endeavor for achieving high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we synthesized a novel fullerene&#8208;based hole transport molecule, designated as FHTM, by integrating C60 with 12 carbazole&#8208;based moieties, and applied it as a modification molecule at the NiOx/perovskite interface. The in&#8208;situ self&#8208;doping effect, triggered by electron transfer between carbazole&#8208;based moiety and C60 within the FHTM molecule, along with the extended &#960; conjugated moiety of carbazole groups, significantly enhances FHTM&#8217;s hole mobility. Coupled with optimized energy level alignment and enhanced interface interactions, the FHTM significantly enhances hole extraction and transport in corresponding devices. Additionally, the introduced FHTM efficiently promotes homogeneous nucleation of perovskite, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films. These combined improvements led to the FHTM&#8208;based PSCs yielding a champion efficiency of 25.58% (Certified: 25.04%), notably surpassing that of the control device (20.91%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated device maintained 93% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours of maximum power point tracking under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This study highlights the potential of functionalized fullerenes as hole transport materials, opening up new avenues for their application in the field of PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>The First&#8208;in&#8208;class Deubiquitinase&#8208;targeting Chimera Stabilizes and Activates cGAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deubiquitinase&#8208;targeting chimera (DUBTAC) is a promising technology for inducing targeted protein stabilization (TPS). Despite its therapeutic potential, very few proteins have been stabilized by DUBTACs to date. The limited applicability of this technology is likely due to the modest DUBTAC&#8208;induced protein stabilization effect, and the scarcity of effective deubiquitinase ligands that can be harnessed for DUBTAC development. Here, we report the discovery of MS7829 and MS8588, the first&#8208;in&#8208;class DUBTACs of cGAS, a key component of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. While these DUBTACs are based on a cGAS inhibitor, they effectively stabilized cGAS and activated the cGAS/STING/IRF3 signaling. To develop these cGAS DUBTACs, we optimized EN523, an OTUB1 covalent ligand, into an improved ligand, MS5105. We validated MS5105 by generating a MS5105&#8208;based CFTR DUBTAC, which was approximately 10&#8208;fold more effective in stabilizing the &#916;F508&#8208;CFTR mutant protein than the previously reported EN523&#8208;based CFTR DUBTAC. Overall, this work advances the DUBTAC technology for TPS.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Degradable Bottlebrush Polymers Using &#945;&#8208;Lipoic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottlebrush polymers have a variety of useful properties including a high entanglement molecular weight, low Young&#8217;s modulus, and rapid kinetics for self&#8208;assembly. However, the translation of bottlebrushes to real&#8208;world applications is limited by complex, multi&#8208;step synthetic pathways and polymerization reactions that rely on air&#8208;sensitive catalysts. Additionally, most bottlebrushes are non&#8208;degradable. Herein, we report an inexpensive, versatile, and simple approach to synthesize degradable bottlebrush polymers under mild reaction conditions. Our approach relies on the &#8220;grafting&#8208;through&#8221; polymerization of &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA)&#8208;functionalized macromonomers. These macromonomers can be polymerized under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, and due to reversibility of the disulfide bond in LA, the resulting bottlebrush polymers can be depolymerized by cleaving disulfide backbone bonds. Bottlebrushes with various side&#8208;chain chemistries can be prepared through the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers, and the backbone length is governed by the macromonomer molecular weight and solvent polarity. We also demonstrate that LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers can be copolymerized with acrylates to form degradable bottlebrush networks. This work demonstrates the preparation of degradable bottlebrush polymers with a variety of side&#8208;chain chemistries and provides insight into the light&#8208;mediated grafting&#8208;through polymerization of dithiolane&#8208;functionalized macromonomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;swelling Microporous Membrane for High&#8208;capacity and Long&#8208;life Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are gaining popularity due to cost&#8208;effectiveness and ease of manufacturing. However, challenges like polyiodide shuttle effect and Zn dendrite growth hinder their practical application. Here, we report a cation exchange membrane to simultaneously prevent the polyiodide shuttle effect and regulate Zn2+ deposition. Comprised of rigid polymers, this membrane shows superior swelling resistance and ion selectivity compared to commercial Nafion. The resulting Zn&#8211;I2 battery exhibits a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% and low self&#8208;discharge rate of 4.47% after 48 h rest. By directing a uniform Zn2+ flux, the membrane promotes a homogeneous electric field, resulting in a dendrite&#8208;free Zn surface. Moreover, its microporous structure enables pre&#8208;adsorption of additional active materials prior to battery assembly, boosting battery capacity to 287 mA h g&#8211;1 at 0.1 A g&#8211;1. At 2 A g&#8211;1, the battery exhibits a steady running for 10,000 cycles with capacity retention up to 96.1%, demonstrating high durability of the membrane. The practicality of the membrane is validated via a high loading (35 mg cm&#8211;2) pouch cell with impressive cycling stability, paving a way for membrane design towards advanced Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Stone&#8208;For&#8208;Three&#8208;Birds Strategy Using a Fullerene Modifier for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electron extraction from perovskite/C60 interface plays a crucial role in influencing the photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a one&#8208;stone&#8208;for&#8208;three&#8208;birds strategy via employing a novel fullerene derivative bearing triple methyl acrylate groups (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) as a multifunctional interfacial layer to optimize electron extraction at the perovskite/C60 interface. It is found that the C60&#8208;TMA not only passivates surface defects of perovskite via coordination interactions between C=O groups and Pb2+ cations but also bridge electron transfer between perovskite and C60. Moreover, it effectively induces the secondary grain growth of the perovskite film through strong bonding effect, and this phenomenon has never been observed in prior art reports on fullerene related studies. The combination of the above three upgrades enables improved perovskite film quality with increased grain size and enhanced crystallinity. With these advantages, C60&#8208;TMA treated PSC devices exhibit a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.89% than the control devices (23.66%). Besides, C60&#8208;TMA benefits improved thermal stability of PSC devices, retaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after aging at 85 &#176;C for 1200 h, primarily due to the reinforced interfacial interactions and improved perovskite film quality.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;initiated nano&#8208;micelles mediated covalent modification of mRNA for labeling and treatment of tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a promising gene therapy strategy, controllable small molecule&#8208;mRNA covalent modification in tumor cells could be initiated by singlet oxygen (1O2) to complete the modification process. However, in vivo generation of 1O2 is usually dependent on excitation of external light, and the limited light penetration of tissues greatly interferes the development of deep tumor phototherapy. Here, we constructed a tumor&#8208;targeting nano&#8208;micelle for the spontaneous intracellular generation of 1O2 without the need for external light, and inducing a high level of covalent modification of mRNA in tumor cells. Luminal and Ce6 were chemically bonded to produce 1O2 by chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) triggered by high levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor microenvironment. The sufficient 1O2 oxidized the loaded furan to highly reactive dicarbonyl moiety, which underwent cycloaddition reaction with adenine (A), cytosine (C) or guanine (G) on the mRNA for interfering with the tumor cell protein expression, thereby inhibiting tumor progression. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that this self&#8208;initiated gene therapy nano&#8208;micelle could induce covalent modification of mRNA by 1O2 without external light, and the process could be monitored in real time by fluorescence imaging, which provided an effective strategy for RNA&#8208;based tumor gene therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design of Hole Transport Materials to Immobilize Ion Motion for Photostable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poor operational stability is a crucial factor limiting the further application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Organic semiconductor layers can be a powerful means for reinforcing interfaces and inhibiting ion migration. Herein, two hole&#8208;transporting molecules, pDPA&#8208;SFX and mDPA&#8208;SFX, are synthesized with tuned substituent connection sites. The meta&#8208;substituted mDPA&#8208;SFX results in a larger dipole moment, more ordered packing, and better charge mobility than pDPA&#8208;SFX, accompany with strong interface bonding on perovskite surfaces and suppressed ion motion as well. Importantly, mDPA&#8208;SFX&#8208;based PSCs exhibit an efficiency that has significantly increased from 22.5% to 24.8% and a module&#8208;based efficiency of 19.26% with an active area of 12.95 cm2. The corresponding cell retain 94.8% of its initial efficiency at maximum power point tracking (MPPT) after 1,000 h (T95 = 1,000 h). The MPPT T80 lifetime is as long as 2,238 h. This work illustrates that a small degree of structural variation in organic compounds leaves considerable room for developing new HTMs for light stable PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Exhaled Anesthetic Xenon Regeneration by Gas Separation Using a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Sorbent&#8208;Sorbate Induced&#8208;Fit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CUPMOF&#8208;5, an efficient CO2&#8208;specific adsorbent to be used in a closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery process, offers a promising solution to Xenon scarcity in medicine. With exceptional molecular sieving capabilities confirmed via SCXRD and simulations, CUPMOF&#8208;5 achieves an outstanding 99.8&#8201;% Xe recovery rate by dynamic breakthrough experiments, making it ideal for online CO2 removal and Xe recovery in anesthetic circuits.







Abstract
Noble gas xenon (Xe) is an excellent anesthetic gas, but its rarity, high cost and constrained production prohibits wide use in medicine. Here, we have developed a closed&#8208;circuit anesthetic Xe recovery and reusage process with highly effective CO2&#8208;specific adsorbent CUPMOF&#8208;5 that is promising to solve the anesthetic Xe supply problem. CUPMOF&#8208;5 possesses spacious cage cavities interconnected in four directions by confinement throat apertures of ~3.4&#8197;&#197;, which makes it an ideal molecular sieving of CO2 from Xe, O2, N2 with the benchmark selectivity and high uptake capacity of CO2. In situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and computational simulation solidly revealed the vital sieving role of the confined throat and the sorbent&#8208;sorbate induced&#8208;fit strengthening binding interaction to CO2. CUPMOF&#8208;5 can remove 5&#8201;% CO2 even from actual moist exhaled anesthetic gases, and achieves the highest Xe recovery rate (99.8&#8201;%) so far, as verified by breakthrough experiments. This endows CUPMOF&#8208;5 great potential for the on&#8208;line CO2 removal and Xe recovery from anesthetic closed&#8208;circuits.

         <title>Streamlining the Synthesis of Pyridones through Oxidative Amination of Cyclopentenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidative amination process enables the streamlined synthesis of pyridones. Cyclopentenone building blocks undergo silyl enol ether formation, followed by nitrogen atom insertion and aromatisation to yield pyridones. The developed one&#8208;pot reaction is mild, operationally simple, exhibits broad functional group tolerance and complete regioselectivity, and provides facile access to 15N&#8208;labelled targets.







Abstract
Herein we report the development of an oxidative amination process for the streamlined synthesis of pyridones from cyclopentenones. Cyclopentenone building blocks can undergo in situ silyl enol ether formation, followed by the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the carbon skeleton with successive aromatisation to yield pyridones. The reaction sequence is operationally simple, rapid, and carried out in one pot. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits broad functional group tolerance, complete regioselectivity, and is well scalable. The developed method provides facile access to the synthesis of 15N&#8208;labelled targets, industrially relevant pyridone products and their derivatives in a fast and efficient way.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Elucidation of the Luminescence Quenching Mechanism in Highly Efficient Hg2+ and Sulfadiazine Sensing by Ln&#8208;MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent Ln&#8208;MOF NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Tb demonstrated highly selective quenching response toward Hg2+ and sulfadiazine (SDI) at subnanomolar concentrations. The sensing mechanism through Hg2+ chelation was proposed based on SCXRD analysis and the interaction with SDI was revealed using a newly developed approach involving a TD&#8208;DFT based quantification of the charge transfer of a MOF&#8208;analyte supramolecular complex model in the ground and excited states.







Abstract
Heavy metal ions and antibiotic contamination have become a major environmental concern worldwide. The development of efficient recognition strategies of these pollutants at ultra&#8208;low concentrations in aqueous solutions as well as the elucidation of the intrinsic sensing mechanism are challenging tasks. In this work, unique luminescent Ln&#8208;MOF materials (NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Ln) were assembled by rational ligand design. Among them, NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Tb demonstrated highly selective luminescence quenching response toward Hg2+ and sulfadiazine (SDI) at subnanomolar concentrations in less than 7&#8197;s. In addition, a Hg2+ sensing mechanism through chelation was proposed on the basis of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and Hg2+ adsorption study. The interaction mechanism of NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Tb with SDI was revealed using a newly developed approach involving a (TD&#8208;)DFT based quantification of the charge transfer of a MOF&#8208;analyte supramolecular complex model in the ground and excited states. Effect of ultrasonic treatment on the surface morphology important for MOF sensing performance was revealed by gas adsorption experiments. The presented results indicate that NIIC&#8208;3&#8208;Ln is not only an advanced sensing material for the efficient detection of Hg2+ and SDI at ultra&#8208;low concentrations, but also opens up a new approach to study the sensing mechanism at the molecular level at ultra&#8208;low concentrations.

     alt="Experimental and Theoretical Elucidation of the Luminescence Quenching Mechanism in Highly Efficient Hg2+ and Sulfadiazine Sensing by Ln-MOF"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luminescent Ln-MOF &lt;b&gt;NIIC-3-Tb&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated highly selective quenching response toward Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and sulfadiazine (SDI) at subnanomolar concentrations. The sensing mechanism through Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; chelation was proposed based on SCXRD analysis and the interaction with SDI was revealed using a newly developed approach involving a TD-DFT based quantification of the charge transfer of a MOF-analyte supramolecular complex model in the ground and excited states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy metal ions and antibiotic contamination have become a major environmental concern worldwide. The development of efficient recognition strategies of these pollutants at ultra-low concentrations in aqueous solutions as well as the elucidation of the intrinsic sensing mechanism are challenging tasks. In this work, unique luminescent Ln-MOF materials (&lt;b&gt;NIIC-3-Ln&lt;/b&gt;) were assembled by rational ligand design. Among them, &lt;b&gt;NIIC-3-Tb&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated highly selective luminescence quenching response toward Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and sulfadiazine (SDI) at subnanomolar concentrations in less than 7&#8197;s. In addition, a Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensing mechanism through chelation was proposed on the basis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption study. The interaction mechanism of &lt;b&gt;NIIC-3-Tb&lt;/b&gt; with SDI was revealed using a newly developed approach involving a (TD-)DFT based quantification of the charge transfer of a MOF-analyte supramolecular complex model in the ground and excited states. Effect of ultrasonic treatment on the surface morphology important for MOF sensing performance was revealed by gas adsorption experiments. The presented results indicate that &lt;b&gt;NIIC-3-Ln&lt;/b&gt; is not only an advanced sensing material for the efficient detection of Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and SDI at ultra-low concentrations, but also opens up a new approach to study the sensing mechanism at the molecular level at ultra-low concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereodivergent Total Synthesis of Tacaman Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric total synthesis of eight tacaman alkaloids was accomplished. A chemoenzymatic Baeyer&#8211;Villiger reaction was used to produce seven&#8208;membered lactones, establishing a stereogenic center at the C14 position. Acid&#8208;regulated cyclization cascades involving the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction afforded cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;fused tetracyclic cores. DFT calculations indicated that the stereochemistry of this cascade was controlled via hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
This paper describes a concise, asymmetric and stereodivergent total synthesis of tacaman alkaloids. A key step in this synthesis is the biocatalytic Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone, which was developed to produce seven&#8208;membered lactones and establish the required stereochemistry at the C14 position (92&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee, 500&#8197;mg scale). Cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;tetracyclic indoloquinolizidine scaffolds were rapidly synthesized through an acid&#8208;triggered, tunable acyl&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler type cyclization cascade, serving as the pivotal reaction for building the alkaloid skeleton. Computational results revealed that hydrogen bonding was crucial in stabilizing intermediates and inducing different addition reactions during the acyl&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler cyclization cascade. By strategically using these two reactions and the late&#8208;stage diversification of the functionalized indoloquinolizidine core, the asymmetric total syntheses of eight tacaman alkaloids were achieved. This study may potentially advance research related to the medicinal chemistry of tacaman alkaloids.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Layered Membranes with Precisely Controlled Nano&#8208;Confined Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superspreading shear&#8208;flow induces alignment of nanosheets, followed by rapid cross&#8208;linking of nanosheets with metal ions to form precisely controlled nano&#8208;confined channels. Due to the cross&#8208;linking between the metal ions and the nanosheets, the nano&#8208;confined channels exhibit excellent stability in different solutions and ionic sieving performance.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets&#8208;based membranes, which have controlled 2D nano&#8208;confined channels, are highly desirable for molecular/ionic sieving and confined reactions. However, it is still difficult to develop an efficient method to prepare large&#8208;area membranes with high stability, high orientation, and accurately adjustable interlayer spacing. Here, we present a strategy to produce metal ion cross&#8208;linked membranes with precisely controlled 2D nano&#8208;confined channels and high stability in different solutions using superspreading shear&#8208;flow&#8208;induced assembly strategy. For example, membranes based on graphene oxide (GO) exhibit interlayer spacing ranging from 8.0&#177;0.1&#8197;&#197; to 10.3&#177;0.2&#8197;&#197;, with a precision of down to 1&#8197;&#197;. At the same time, the value of the orientation order parameter (f) of GO membranes is up to 0.95 and GO membranes exhibit superb stability in different solutions. The strategy we present, which can be generalized to the preparation of 2D nano&#8208;confined channels based on a variety of 2D materials, will expand the application scope and provide better performances of membranes.

         <title>Selectivity Descriptors of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Aromatics Process over 3&#8208;Dimensional Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts were established in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics reaction over ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11 zeolites via strategically integrating operando UV/Visible spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and controlled catalytic experiments. This work emphasizes the significance of the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity.







Abstract
The zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics (MTA) process is a promising avenue for industrial decarbonization. This process predominantly utilizes 3&#8208;dimensional 10&#8208;member ring (10&#8208;MR) zeolites like ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11, chosen for their confinement effect essential for aromatization. Current research mainly focuses on enhancing selectivity and mitigating catalyst deactivation by modulating zeolites&#8242; physicochemical properties. Despite the potential, the MTA technology is at a low Technology Readiness Level, hindered by mechanistic complexities in achieving the desired selectivity towards liquid aromatics. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes a roadmap for MTA catalysis by strategically combining controlled catalytic experiments with advanced characterization methods (including operando conditions and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy). It identifies the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity. Understanding these selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts is vital, potentially advancing other zeolite&#8208;catalyzed emerging technologies.

         <title>A Functional Switch Between Asperfumene and Fusicoccadiene Synthase and Entrance to Asperfumene Biosynthesis through a Vicinal Deprotonation&#8208;Reprotonation Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diterpene synthase AfAS from Aspergillus fumigatiaffinis produces asperfumene with a novel 6&#8211;5&#8211;5&#8211;5 tetracyclic skeleton. Its cyclisation mechanism was investigated by isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments uncovered residue&#8197;65 as a critical switch for the formation of either asperfumene or structurally simpler diterpenes with a 5&#8211;8&#8211;5 tricyclic skeleton.







Abstract
The diterpene synthase AfAS was identified from Aspergillus fumigatiaffinis. Its amino acid sequence and&#8212;according to a structural model&#8212;active site architecture are highly similar to those of the fusicocca&#8208;2,10(14)&#8208;diene synthase PaFS, but AfAS produces a structurally much more complex diterpene with a novel 6&#8211;5&#8211;5&#8211;5 tetracyclic skeleton called asperfumene. The cyclisation mechanism of AfAS was elucidated through isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The reaction cascade proceeds in its initial steps through similar intermediates as for the PaFS cascade, but then diverges through an unusual vicinal deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation process that triggers a skeletal rearrangement at the entrance to the steps leading to the unique asperfumene skeleton. The structural model revealed only one major difference between the active sites: The PaFS residue&#8197;F65 is substituted by I65 in AfAS. Intriguingly, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments with both diterpene synthases revealed that position 65 serves as a bidirectional functional switch for the biosynthesis of tetracyclic asperfumene versus structurally less complex diterpenes.

         <title>Synthesis of a Metalla[2]catenane, Metallarectangles and Polynuclear Assemblies from Di(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Ligands</title>

The fluorenone&#8208;bridged di&#8208;NHC precursor H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O in CH3CN to give the [2]catenane [Ag4(1)4](PF6)4, which disintegrates in DMF into two metallarectangles [Ag2(1)2](PF6)2. Substitution of the imidazo[1,5a]pyridinium NHC precursors in H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 for imidazolium groups yields di&#8208;NHC precursors H2&#8208;L(PF6)2 which react with Ag2O to yield exclusively metallarectangles of type [Ag2(L)2(PF6)2 with a spacing between the fluorenone planes too small for [2]catenane formation.







Abstract
The 2,7&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;linked bis(6&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinium) salt H2&#8208;1(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O in CH3CN to yield the [2]catenane [Ag4(1)4](PF6)4. The [2]catenane rearranges in DMF to yield two metallamacrocycles [Ag2(1)2](PF6)2. 2,7&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;(imidazolium) salts H2&#8208;L(PF6)2 (L=2&#8201;a, 2&#8201;b) react with Ag2O in CH3CN to yield metallamacrocycles [Ag2(L)2](PF6)2 with interplanar distances between the fluorenone rings too small for [2]catenane formation. Intra&#8208; and intermolecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the fluorenone groups were observed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The strongly kinked 2,7&#8208;fluorenone bridged bis(5&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinium) salt H2&#8208;4(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O to yield [Ag2(4)(CN)](PF6), while the tetranuclear assembly [Ag4(4)2(CO3)](PF6)2 was obtained in the presence of K2CO3.

         <title>Discovery of A G&#8208;Quadruplex Unwinder That Unleashes the Translation of G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Containing mRNA without Inducing DNA Damage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a G4 unwinder, 2&#8242;&#8208;F C3, capable of promoting the unwinding of both DNA and RNA G4 structures. In living cells, 2&#8242;&#8208;F C3 does not induce severe DNA damage at a concentration below 10&#8197;&#956;M, nor does it broadly interfere with G4&#8208;related biological processes. Specially, it can enhance the translation level of G4&#8208;containing mRNA.







Abstract
To explore the mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) mediated diseases, it is crucial to manipulate and intervene in intracellular G4 structures using small molecular tools. While hundreds of G4 stabilizers have been developed, there is a significant gap in the availability of G4 unwinding agents. Here, we propose a strategy to disrupt G&#8208;quadruplexes by forming G&#8722;C hydrogen bonds with chemically modified cytidine trimers. We validated a good G4 unwinder, the 2&#8242;&#8208;F cytidine trimer (2&#8242;&#8208;F C3). 2&#8242;&#8208;F C3 does not inhibit cell growth nor cause severe DNA damage at a concentration below 10&#8197;&#956;M. Moreover, 2&#8242;&#8208;F C3 does not affect gene transcription nor RNA splicing, while it significantly enhances the translation of G4&#8208;containing mRNA and upregulates RNA splicing, RNA processing and cell cycle pathways. The discovery of this G4 unwinder provides a functional tool for the chemical modulation of G4s in living cells.

         <title>A Renal Clearable Nano&#8208;Assembly with F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer Amplified Superoxide Radical and Heat Generation to Overcome Hypoxia Resistance in Phototherapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dyad phthalocyanine&#8208;based nanotheranostic (NanoPcSZ) with boosted superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8208;) and heat generation was developed based on F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer mechanism. Such nanotheranostic can be eliminated through the kidneys and excreted from the body via urine, and ultimately achieving a notable therapeutic effect with high biosafety.







Abstract
Given that type I photosensitizers (PSs) possess a good hypoxic tolerance, developing an innovative tactic to construct type I PSs is crucially important, but remains a challenge. Herein, we present a smart molecular design strategy based on the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism to develop a type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent with an encouraging amplification effect for accurate hypoxic tumor therapy. Of note, benefiting from the FRET effect, the obtained nanostructured type I PDT agent (NanoPcSZ) with boosted light&#8208;harvesting ability not only amplifies superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8208;) production but also promotes heat generation upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. These features facilitate NanoPcSZ to realize excellent phototherapeutic response under both normal and hypoxic environments. As a result, both in vitro and in vivo experiments achieved a remarkable improvement in therapeutic efficacy via the combined effect of photothermal action and type I photoreaction. Notably, NanoPcSZ can be eliminated from organs (including the liver, lung, spleen, and kidney) apart from the tumor site and excreted through urine within 24&#8197;h of its systemic administration. In this way, the potential biotoxicity of drug accumulation can be avoided and the biosafety can be further enhanced.

         <title>Structural Elucidation of a Metagenomic Urethanase and Its Engineering Towards Enhanced Hydrolysis Profiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plastics like polyurethanes (PUs) and polyamides (PAs) largely resist biodegradation. Herein, we report the first crystal structure of the metagenomic urethanase UMG&#8208;SP&#8208;1. Subsequent engineering yielded variants with up to 8&#8208;fold enhanced activity on various urethanes and amides. UMG&#8208;SP&#8208;1 variants partially degraded a model thermoplastic polyester&#8208;PU and nylon&#8197;6, highlighting its applicability for the biodegradation and recycling of PU and PA.







Abstract
While plastics like polyethylene terephthalate can already be degraded efficiently by the activity of hydrolases, other synthetic polymers like polyurethanes (PUs) and polyamides (PAs) largely resist biodegradation. In this study, we solved the first crystal structure of the metagenomic urethanase UMG&#8208;SP&#8208;1, identified highly flexible loop regions to comprise active site residues, and targeted a total of 20 potential hot spots by site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis. Engineering campaigns yielded variants with single mutations, exhibiting almost 3&#8208; and 8&#8208;fold improved activity against highly stable N&#8208;aryl urethane and amide bonds, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated the release of the corresponding monomers from a thermoplastic polyester&#8208;PU and a PA (nylon&#8197;6) by the activity of a single, metagenome&#8208;derived urethanase after short incubation times. Thereby, we expanded the hydrolysis profile of UMG&#8208;SP&#8208;1 beyond the reported low&#8208;molecular weight carbamates. Together, these findings promise advanced strategies for the bio&#8208;based degradation and recycling of plastic materials and waste, aiding efforts to establish a circular economy for synthetic polymers.

         <title>Breakthrough in CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products at Ampere&#8208;Level Enabled by Active Sites Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalyst with three finely&#8208;tuned active sites was created by doping Pd atoms to Cu2O followed by a in situ electroreduction treatment, which can speed up the complex reactions of CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products in high FE and yield of C2+ products at ampere level current density.







Abstract
Efficient production of value&#8208;added chemicals with high selectivity from CO2 electroreduction at industrial&#8208;level current density is highly demanded, yet remains a big challenge. In a recent issue of Angewandte Chemie, Han and colleagues have elegantly increased the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products to over 70&#8201;% at amperes level (1.4&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) by engineering the active sites for the key reactions involved in the CO2 electroreduction. In this study, the highly dispersed Pd atoms have two unique functions: active sites for water dissociation and to induce the electron rearrangement of the surrounding Cu atoms to form new active sites for CO conversion, while the Cu far from Pd are the active sites for efficient CO2 conversion to CO, the synergistic functions of these three active sites result in high FE and yields of C2+ products at industrial&#8208;level current density. This research is a remarkable step forward in the methodology for developing efficient and durable catalysts for CO2 electroreduction and beyond.

         <title>Halogen Tailoring of Platinum Electrocatalyst with High CO Tolerance for Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing platinum halogen (bromine) nanoparticles, and simultaneously bromine bond with sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (PtBr NPs/Br&#8208;GDY) as a model catalyst, we show an electron&#8208;rich structure catalyst introduced by the ligand of bromine to improve the catalytic performance and high CO&#8208;resistant of platinum catalysts during methanol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The catalytic activity of platinum for CO oxidation depends on the interaction of electron donation and back&#8208;donation at the platinum center. Here we demonstrate that the platinum bromine nanoparticles with electron&#8208;rich properties on bromine bonded with sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (PtBr NPs/Br&#8208;GDY), which is formed by bromine ligand and constitutes an electrocatalyst with a high CO&#8208;resistant for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The catalyst showed peak mass activity for MOR as high as 10.4&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1, which is 20.8&#8197;times higher than the 20&#8201;% Pt/C. The catalyst also showed robust long&#8208;term stability with slight current density decay after 100&#8197;hours at 35&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Structural characterization, experimental, and theoretical studies show that the electron donation from bromine makes the surface of platinum catalysts highly electron&#8208;rich, and can strengthen the adsorption of CO as well as enhance &#960; back&#8208;donation of Pt to weaken the C&#8722;O bond to facilitate CO electrooxidation and enhance catalytic performance during MOR. The results highlight the importance of electron&#8208;rich structure among active sites in Pt&#8208;halogen catalysts and provide detailed insights into the new mechanism of CO electrooxidation to overcome CO poisoning at the Pt center on an orbital level.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Cage Framework with High Selectivity and Reversibility in Fullerene Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal porous frameworks were constructed from shape&#8208;persistent molecular cage building blocks and unambiguously characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The resulting framework showed a high fullerene binding capacity, fast binding kinetics, and a high C60/C70 binding selectivity. The host&#8211;guest binding interaction can be turned on and off by treatment with weak acid/base, which enabled the high&#8208;efficiency flow&#8208;separation of fullerene mixtures.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest chemistry, a pivotal branch of supramolecular chemistry, plays an essential role in understanding and constructing complex structures through non&#8208;covalent interactions. Organic molecular cages, characterized by their intrinsic confined cavities, can selectively bind a variety of guest molecules. Their host&#8211;guest chemistry has been well studied in the solution phase, and several attempts have been made to encode well&#8208;defined molecular architectures into solid&#8208;state polymeric materials. However, only limited studies have explored their potential in the solid state, where their lack of robustness and less ordered networks significantly hinder practical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a single&#8208;crystal cage framework and a systematic study of its host&#8211;guest chemistry, spanning from the solution state to the solid state. Our studies reveal that the host&#8211;guest interactions inherent to the cage are successfully maintained in the solid&#8208;state polymeric material. Furthermore, the framework's robustness allows for the guest molecules (fullerene) to be released triggered by an organic acid (trifluoroacetic acid), with subsequent regeneration of the framework through an organic base (triethylamine) treatment. Our findings represent the first synthesis of a robust, single&#8208;crystal cage framework exhibiting highly selective and reversible host&#8211;guest chemistry, thus showing great potential towards molecular separation application.

         <title>[4+1] Heteroannulation to Form 1&#8208;Pyrrolines through Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction of in situ Generated Ynimines: Development and Application in Total Synthesis of Borrecapine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report in this paper a novel Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of polysubstituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines. The reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters 4 with terminal alkynes 5 in the presence of a catalytic amount of Cu(OAc)2 and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biquinoline affords the corresponding 1,6&#8208;enynimines, which undergo a highly stereoselective Alder&#8208;ene reaction to afford 1&#8208;pyrrolines with concomitant generation of a quaternary carbon and a 2&#8208;azadiene motif. It represents an unusual [4+1] heteroannulation reaction wherein terminal alkynes act as a one carbon donor and are 1,1&#8208;difunctionalized. Mechanistic studies suggest that the allylic hydrogen trans to the oxime ester main chain is selectively transferred to the electron&#8208;rich alkyne during the pericyclic reaction. The resulting 1&#8208;pyrrolines undergo facile acid&#8208;catalyzed regioselective Wagner&#8208;Meerwein rearrangement to provide 2H&#8208;pyrroles in excellent yields. The 2H&#8208;pyrroles are also accessible from 4 and 5 in a one&#8208;pot manner without isolation of the 1&#8208;pyrrolines. Leveraging this heteroannulation reaction as a key step, the first total synthesis of borrecapine, a 2,3,3,5&#8208;tetrasubstituted pyrrolidine, is accomplished.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Photoredox/Palladium Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Carboxylation of Racemic Heterobiaryl (Pseudo)Halides with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a synergistic photoredox/palladium catalytic system for the efficient enantioconvergent synthesis of axially chiral esters from racemic heterobiaryl (pseudo)halides (bromides/triflates) with CO2 and alkyl bromides under mild conditions. A wide range of axially chiral esters were obtained in good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Detailed mechanistic studies unveiled that the ratio of photocatalyst and palladium catalyst exhibited significant impact on the chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivities of the reaction. Kinetic studies and control experiments supported the proposed mechanism involving cascade asymmetric carboxylation followed by SN2 substitution. The achievement of high enantioselectivity relies not only on the choice of synergistic metallaphotoredox catalysts but also on the utilization of alkyl bromides, which trap the generated chiral carboxylic anions in situ, thus preventing their immediate racemization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The design of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) using linear and trigonal linkers remains challenging due to the difficulty in achieving a specific non&#8208;planar spatial arrangement with low&#8208;connectivity building units. Here, we report the novel 3D COFs with linear and trigonal linkers, termed TMB&#8208;COFs, exhibiting srs topology. The steric hindrance provides an additional force to alter the torsion angles of peripheral triangular units, guiding the linear unit to connect with the trigonal unit into 3D srs frameworks, rather than the more commonly observed two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hcb structures. Furthermore, we comprehensively examined the hydrogen peroxide photocatalytic production capacity of the TMB&#8208;COFs in comparison with analogous 2D COFs. The experimental results and DFT calculations demonstrate a significant enhancement in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production efficacy through framework regulation. This work emphasizes the steric configuration using low connectivity building units, offering a fresh perspective on the design and application of 3D COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Silylene&#8208;Copper&#8208;Amide Emitters: From Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Dual Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the inaugural instance of NHSi&#8208;coordinated copper amide emitters (2&#8208;5). These complexes exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and singlet&#8208;triplet dual emission in anaerobic conditions. The NHSi&#8208;Cu&#8208;diphenylamide (2) complex demonstrates TADF with a very small &#916;EST gap (0.01 eV), an absolute quantum yield of 11%, a radiative rate of 2.55&#215;105 s&#8208;1, and a short &#964;TADF of 0.45 &#181;s in the solid state. The dual emissive complexes (3&#8208;5) achieve an absolute quantum yield of up to 20% in the solid state with a kISC rate of 1.82&#215;108 s&#8208;1 and exhibit room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with lifetimes up to 9 ms. The gradual decrease in the intensity of the triplet state of complex 3 under controlled oxygen exposure demonstrates its potential for future oxygen&#8208;sensing applications. Complexes 2 and 3 have been further utilized to fabricate converted LEDs, paving the way for future OLED production using newly synthesized NHSi&#8208;Cu&#8208;amides.</dc:description>

         <title>Remarkable Second Harmonic Generation Response in (C5H6NO)+(CH3SO3)&#8722;: Unraveling the Role of Hydrogen Bond in Thermal Driven Nonlinear Optical Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel material (C5H6NO)+(CH3SO3)&#8722; (4HPMS), exhibiting the strongest second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity among all heat&#8208;stimulated nonlinear optical (NLO) switches. We unravel an unprecedently easier breaking of the shorter hydrogen bond and a rare large thermal hysteresis of 50&#8201;&#176;C during the reversible structural phase transition.







Abstract
Heat&#8208;activated second harmonic generation (SHG) switching materials are gaining interest for their ability to switch between SHG on and off states, offering potential in optoelectronic applications. The novel nonlinear optical (NLO) switch, (C5H6NO)+(CH3SO3)&#8722; (4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium methylsulfonate, 4HPMS), is a near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermal driven material with a strong SHG response (3.3 &#215; KDP), making it one of the most potent heat&#8208;stimulated NLO switches. It offers excellent contrast of 13 and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (2.5 &#215; KDP), with reversibility &gt; 5&#8197;cycles. At 73&#8201;&#176;C, 4HPMS transitions from the noncentrosymmetric Pna21 room temperature phase (RTP) to the centrosymmetric P21/c phase, caused by the rotation of the (C5H6NO)+ and (CH3SO3)&#8722; due to partially thermal breaking of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The reverse phase change exhibits a large 50&#8201;&#176;C thermal hysteresis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that (C5H6NO)+ primarily dictates both the SHG coefficient (dij) and birefringence (&#9653;n(Zeiss) = 0.216 vs &#9653;n(cal.) = 0.202 at 546&#8197;nm; &#916;n(Immersion) = 0.210 vs &#9653;n(cal.) = 0.198 at 589.3&#8197;nm), while the band gap (Eg) is influenced synergistically by (C5H6NO)+ and (CH3SO3)&#8722;. Additionally, 4HPMS&#8208;RTP also exhibits mechanochromism upon grinding as well as an aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission in a mixture of acetone and water.

         <title>Navigating Ball Mill Specifications for Theory&#8208;to&#8208;Practice Reproducibility in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rising prospects of mechanochemically assisted syntheses&#160;hold promise for both academia and industry, yet they face challenges in understanding and, therefore, anticipating respective reaction kinetics. Particularly, dependencies based on variations in milling equipment remain little understood and globally overlooked. This study aims to address this issue by identifying critical parameters through kinematic models, facilitating the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across the most prominent mills in laboratory settings, namely planetary and mixer mills. Through a series of selected experiments replicating major classes of organic, organometallic, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, and inorganic reactions from literature, we rationalize the independence of kinematic parameters on reaction kinetics when the accumulated energy criterion is met. As a step forward and to facilitate the practicability of our findings, we provide a freely accessible online tool&#8224;&#160;that allows the calculation of respective energy parameters for different planetary and mixer mills. Our work advances the current understanding of mechanochemistry and lays the foundation for future rational exploration in this rapidly evolving field.</dc:description>

         <title>Horizontal Transport in Ti3C2Tx MXene for Highly Efficient Osmotic Energy Conversion from Saline&#8208;Alkali Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Osmotic energy from the ocean has been thoroughly studied, but that from saline&#8208;alkali lakes is constrained by the ion&#8208;exchange membranes due to the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, stemming from the unfavorable structure of nanoconfined channels, pH tolerance, and chemical stability of the membranes. Inspired by the rapid water transport in xylem conduit structures, we propose a horizontal transport MXene (H&#8208;MXene) with ionic sequential transport nanochannels, designed to endure extreme saline&#8208;alkali conditions while enhancing ion selectivity and permeability. The H&#8208;MXene demonstrates superior ion conductivity of 20.67 S m&#8722;1 in 1 M NaCl solution and a diffusion current density of 308 A m&#8722;2 at a 10&#8208;fold salinity gradient of NaCl solution, significantly outperforming the conventional vertical transport MXene (V&#8208;MXene). Both experimental and simulation studies have confirmed that H&#8208;MXene represents a novel approach to circumventing the permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Moreover, it exhibits efficient ion transport capabilities, addressing the gap in saline&#8208;alkali osmotic power generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Multimode Luminesce Tailoring PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 Organic&#8211;inorganic Hybrid Metal Halide&#160;via Rigid Benzene Ring Induced Local Lattice Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide materials have attracted extensive attention due to their superior optoelectronic properties. However, low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) caused by parity&#8208;forbidden transition hinder their further application in optoelectronic devices. Herein, a novel yellow&#8208;emitting PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 (C7H10N+, PMA+) low&#8208;dimensional OIMHs single crystal with a PLQY as high as 88% was successfully designed and synthesized, originating from the fact that the doping of Sb3+ effectively relaxes the parity&#8208;forbidden transition by strong spin&#8208;orbit (SO) coupling and Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) interaction.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Low dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide materials have attracted extensive attention due to their superior optoelectronic properties. However, low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) caused by parity-forbidden transition hinder their further application in optoelectronic devices. Herein, a novel yellow-emitting PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 (C7H10N+, PMA+) low-dimensional OIMHs single crystal with a PLQY as high as 88% was successfully designed and synthesized, originating from the fact that the doping of Sb3+ effectively relaxes the parity-forbidden transition by strong spin-orbit (SO) coupling and Jahn-Teller (JT) interaction. The as-prepared crystal shows an efficient dual emission peaking 495 and 560 nm at low temperature, which are ascribed to different levels of 3P1 &#8594; 1S0 transitions of Sb3+ in [SbCl6]3&#8211; octahedral caused by JT deformation. Moreover, wide-range luminescence tailoring from cyan to orange can be achieved through adjusting excitation energy and temperature because of flexible [SbCl6]3&#8211; octahedral in the PNIC lattice. Based on a relative stiff lattice environment, the 560 nm yellow emission under 350 nm light excitation exhibits abnormal anti-thermal quenching from 8 to 400 K owing to the suppression of non-radiative transition. The multimode luminescence regulation enriches PMA4Na(In,Sb)Cl8 great potential in the field of optoelectronics such as temperature sensing,&#160; low temperature anti-counterfeiting and WLED applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;term and Continuous Plasmonic Oligonucleotide Monitoring Enabled by Regeneration Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for continuous monitoring of biochemical markers for diagnostic purposes is increasing as it overcomes the limitations of traditional intermittent measurements. This study introduces a method for long&#8208;term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with high temporal resolution. Our method is based on a regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach that ensures rapid reversibility in less than 1 minute, allowing the sensor to fully reset after each measurement. We investigated label&#8208;free and AuNP enhancements for different dynamic ranges and sensitivities, achieving a limit of detection down to pM levels. We developed a regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach for continuous biosensing, optimizing buffer conditions using the Taguchi method to achieve rapid, consistent reversibility, ensuring reliable performance for long&#8208;term monitoring. We detected oligonucleotides in buffered and complex solutions, including undiluted and unfiltered human serum, for up to 100 sampling cycles in a day. Moreover, we showed the long&#8208;term stability of the sensor for monitoring capabilities in buffered solutions and human serum, with minimal signal value drift and excellent sensor reversibility for up to 9 days. Our method opens the door to new prospects in continuous biosensing by providing insights beyond intermittent measurements for numerous analytical and diagnostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomaterials Mediate Cholesterol Depletion for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cholesterol is an essential membrane component, and the metabolites from cholesterol play important biological functions to intricately support cancer progression and dampen immune responses. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the role of cholesterol metabolism regulation on inhibiting tumor growth, remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. In this minireview, we discuss complex cholesterol metabolism in tumors, its important role in cancer progression, and its influences on immune cells in the TME. We provide an overview of recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism. We discuss the design of cholesterol&#8208;altering multifunctional nanomaterials to regulate oxidative stress, modulate immune checkpoints, manipulate mechanical stress responses, and alter cholesterol metabolic pathways. Additionally, we examine the interactions between cholesterol metabolism regulation and established cancer treatments with the aim of identifying efficient strategies to disrupt cholesterol metabolism and synergistic combination therapies for effective cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Rewritable Surface&#8208;Grafted Polymer Brushes with Dynamic Covalent Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface grafting of polymer brushes drastically modifies surface properties, including wettability, compatibility, responsiveness, etc. A broad variety of functionalities can be introduced to the surface via different types of polymers. Bringing together properties of two or more types of polymer brushes to one surface opens up even more possibilities in brush&#8208;modified materials. However, while it is generally feasible to introduce several chemical compositions along the brushes via copolymerization, it is challenging to vary the types of polymer brushes along a surface. Although previous studies have demonstrated binary brushes via orthogonal polymerization techniques or partial deactivation/regrafting, they commonly limit the number of polymer types to two. Here, we propose a strategy to introduce dynamic covalent diketoenamine linkages at the root of polymer brushes. The grafting density could be precisely tuned during surface functionalization. The surface&#8208;anchored polymer brushes were cleaved by the addition of small molecule amines. New polymer brushes can be regrafted from the surface following refunctionalization of exposed sites. The maneuverability allows tuning of the types and densities of the polymer brushes, pointing the way to the preparation of a new generation of well&#8208;defined brush&#8208;modified materials with mixed grafts, with potential applications in the design of smart materials and surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Sieving&#8208;type Electric Double Layer with Hydrogen Bond Interlocking to Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability of aqueous zinc metal batteries is significantly affected by side reactions and dendrite growth on the anode interface, which primarily originate from water and anions. Herein, we introduce a multi H&#8208;bond site additive, 2, 2'&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol (SDE), into an aqueous electrolyte to construct a sieving&#8208;type electric double layer (EDL) by hydrogen bond interlock in order to address these issues. On the one hand, SDE replaces H2O and SO42&#8208; anions that are adsorbed on the zinc anode surface, expelling H2O/SO42&#8208; from the EDL and thereby reducing the content of H2O/SO42&#8208; at the interface. On the other hand, when Zn2+ are de&#8208;solvated at the interface during the plating, the strong hydrogen bond interaction between SDE and H2O/SO42&#8208; can trap H2O/SO42&#8208; from the EDL, further decreasing their content at the interface. This effectively sieves them out of the zinc anode interface and inhibits the side reactions. Moreover, the unique characteristics of trapped SO42&#8208; anions can restrict their diffusion, thereby enhancing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Consequently, utilizing an SDE/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables excellent cycling stability in Zn//Zn symmetrical cells and Zn//MnO2 full cells with lifespans exceeding 3500 h and 2500 cycles respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;inducible Radiomimetic Photosensitizers Selectively Suppress Cancer Cell Proliferation by Damaging DNA through Radical Cation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radiotherapy leverages ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells through direct and indirect effects, and direct effects are considered to play an equal or greater role. Several photosensitizers have been developed to mimic the direct effects of radiotherapy, generating radical cations in DNA models, but none has been applied in cellular studies. Here, we design a radiomimetic photosensitizer, producing DNA radical cations in cells for the first time. To reduce adverse effects, several redox&#8208;inducible precursors are prepared as cancer cells have elevated levels of GSH and H2O2. These precursors respond to GSH or H2O2, releasing the active photosensitizer that captures DNA abasic (AP) sites and generates DNA radical cations upon photolysis, without disrupting the redox state of cells. DNA radical cations migrate freely and are eventually trapped by H2O and O2 to yield DNA lesions, thus triggering DNA damage response. Our study suggests that direct effects of radiotherapy suppress cancer cell proliferation mainly by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, rather than promoting apoptosis. Synergistic effects of the precursor and chemotherapeutic agents are also observed in combination phototherapy. Beyond highlighting an alternative strategy for phototherapy, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study affords a facile cellular platform to study the direct effects of radiotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Active Site Local&#160;Proton Transfer in Porous Organic Polymers for Boosted Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving proton transfer&#160;is vital for electrocatalysis with porous materials.&#160;Although several strategies are reported to assist proton transfer in channels, few studies are dedicated to improving proton transfer at the local environments of active sites in porous materials.&#160;Herein, we report on new Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) with&#160;improved proton transfer&#160;for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By tuning the pore sizes and installing proton relays at Co corrole sites, we designed and synthesized&#160;POP&#8208;2&#8208;OH&#160;with&#160;improved proton transfer both in channels and at local Co active sites. This POP shows remarkable activity for both electrocatalytic ORR with&#160;E1/2&#160;= 0.91 V vs RHE and OER with&#160;h10&#160;= 255 mV. Therefore, this work is significant to present a strategy to improve active site local proton transfer in porous materials and highlight the key role of such structural functionalization in boosting oxygen electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

Therefore, this work is significant to present a strategy to improve active site local proton transfer in porous materials and highlight the key role of such structural functionalization in boosting oxygen electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanomole Scale Screening of Fluorescent RNA&#8208;Methyltransferase Probes Enables the Discovery of METTL1 Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA methylation is a metabolic process validated for its association with various diseases, and thus, RNA methyltransferases (MTases) have become increasingly important in drug discovery. Yet, most frequently utilized RNA MTase assays are limited in their throughput and hamper this rapidly evolving field of medicinal chemistry. In this study, we describe a modular nanomole scale building block system that allowed the identification of tailored fluorescent MTase probes to unlock a broad selection of MTase drug targets for fluorescence&#8208;based binding assays. Probe candidates were initially prepared on a 4 nanomole scale and could be tested directly from crude reaction mixtures to allow rapid probe identification and optimization. Using an alkyne&#8208;azide click late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy and in silico protein databank mining, we established a selection of fluorescent probes suitable for relevant drug targets from the METTL and NSUN families, as well as bacterial and viral MTases. Using this concept, a high&#8208;throughput screening on the unexplored drug target METTL1 discovered three hit compounds with micromolar potency providing a first&#8208;in&#8208;class starting point for METTL1 drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Catalyzed Carbonylative Cross Coupling for Direct Access to Isotopically Labeled Alkyl Aryl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present an effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling for direct access to alkyl aryl ketones from readily accessible redox&#8208;activated tetrachlorophthalimide esters and aryl boronic acids. The methodology, which is run employing only 2.5 equivalents of CO and simple Ni(II) salts as the metal source, exhibits a broad substrate scope under mild condition. Furthermore, this carbonylation chemistry provides an easy switch between isotopologues for stable (13CO) and radioactive (14CO) isotope labeling, allowing its adaptation to the late&#8208;stage isotope labeling of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Based on DFT calculations as well as experimental evidence, a catalytic cycle is proposed involving a carbon&#8208;centered radical formed via nickel(I)&#8208;induced outer&#8208;sphere decarboxylative fragmentation of the redox&#8208;active ester.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Tension Manipulation with Visible Light through Sensitized Disequilibration of Photoswitchable Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azoarene isomerization lies at the heart of numerous applications from catalysis or energy storage to photopharmacology. While efficient switching between their E and Z isomers predominantly relies on UV light, a recent study by Klajn and co&#8208;workers introduced visible light sensitization of E azoarenes and subsequent isomerization as a tool coined disequilibration by sensitization under confinement (DESC) to obtain high yields of the Z isomer. This host&#8208;guest approach is, however, still constrained to minimally substituted azoarenes with limited applicability in advanced molecular systems. Herein, we expand DESC for the assembly of surfactants at the air&#8208;water interface. Leveraging our expertise with photoswitchable amphiphiles, we induce substantial alterations of water&#8217;s surface tension through reversible arylazopyrazole isomerization. After studying the binding of charged surfactants to the host, we find that the surface activity differences upon visible light irradiation for both isomers are comparable to those obtained by UV light excitation. The method is demonstrated on a large concentration range and can be activated using green or red light, depending on the sensitizer chosen. The straightforward implementation of photoswitch sensitization in a complex molecular network showcases how DESC enables the improvement of existing systems and the development of novel applications driven by visible light.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enamines are versatile building blocks for the synthesis of biologically active compounds. Nevertheless, only a limited number of strategies have been reported for preparing trisubstituted enamines in a regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner. Herein, we report a regiocontrolled 6&#8208;endo and 5&#8208;exo tethered carboamination of propargylic alcohols for the synthesis of trisubstituted enamines. High regioselectivity was achieved through fine&#8208;tuning of the amine protecting group during the Pd&#8208;catalyzed carboamination. The introduced trifluoromethylated tether enables further stereoselective functionalizations, such as hydrogenation and fluorination.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Dynamic Carburization of Mo Oxide with Unprecedented High CO Formation Rate in Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ construction of active structure under reaction conditions is highly desired but still remains challenging in many important catalytic processes. Herein, we observe structural evolution of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) into highly active molybdenum carbide (MoCx) during reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Surface oxygen atoms in various Mo&#8208;based catalysts are removed in H2&#8208;containing atmospheres and then carbon atoms can accumulate on surface to form MoCx phase with the RWGS reaction going on, both of which are enhanced by the presence of intercalated H species or Pt&#8208;dopants in MoOx. The structural evolution from MoOx to MoCx is accompanied by enhanced CO2 conversion, which is positively correlated with the surface C/Mo ratio but negatively with the surface O/Mo ratio. As a result, an unprecedented CO formation rate of 7544.6 mmol&#183;gcatal&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 at 600 &#176;C has been achieved over in&#8208;situ carbonized H&#8208;intercalated MoO3 catalyst, which is even higher than those from noble metal catalysts. During 100 h stability test only a minimal deactivation rate of 2.3% is observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Asymmetric Alkene Aminohetarylation with Chiral Sulfoximine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the pivotal role of &#946;&#8208;(het)arylethylamine moiety in bioactive molecules, the direct amino(het)arylation of alkenes occupies a privileged position in the construction of (het)arylethylamine derivatives. Herein we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents which exhibit remarkable efficiency in the challenging asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation reaction, particularly in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control. The chiral reagents can be conveniently accessed in gram scale, and efficiently generate N&#8208;centered radicals under mild photochemical conditions. The transformation proceeds through enantioselective 1,4&#8208;hetaryl migration, ensuring precise chirality transfer from sulfur&#8208; to carbon&#8208;centers, rendering wide applicability to both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes. Furthermore, the method is straightforward to operate and does not require transition metals or photosensitizers, making it an attractive and practical option.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfate Derivatives with Heteroleptic Tetrahedra: New Deep&#8208;ultraviolet Birefringent Materials in which Weak Interactions Modulate Functional Module Ordering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) birefringent materials are urgently needed to facilitate light polarization in deep&#8208;UV lithography. Maximizing anisotropy by regulating the alignment of functional modules is essential for improving the linear optical performance of birefringent materials. In this work, we proposed a strategy to design deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials that achieve functional module ordering via weak interactions. Following this strategy, four compounds CN4H7SO3CF3, CN4H7SO3CH3, C(NH2)3SO3CH3, and C(NH2)3SO3CF3 were identified as high&#8208;performance candidates for deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials. The millimeter&#8208;sized crystals of CN4H7SO3CF3, CN4H7SO3CH3, and C(NH2)3SO3CH3 were grown, and the transmittance spectra show that their cutoff edges are below 200 nm. CN4H7SO3CF3 exhibits the largest birefringence (0.149 @ 546 nm, 0.395 @ 200 nm) in the deep&#8208;UV region among reported sulfates and sulfate derivatives. It reveals that the hydrogen bond can modulate the module ordering of the heteroleptic tetrahedra and planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations, thus greatly enhancing the birefringence. Our study not only discovers new deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials but also provides an upgraded strategy for optimizing optical anisotropy to achieve efficient birefringence.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep-ultraviolet (UV) birefringent materials are urgently needed to facilitate light polarization in deep-UV lithography. Maximizing anisotropy by regulating the alignment of functional modules is essential for improving the linear optical performance of birefringent materials. In this work, we proposed a strategy to design deep-UV birefringent materials that achieve functional module ordering via weak interactions. Following this strategy, four compounds CN4H7SO3CF3, CN4H7SO3CH3, C(NH2)3SO3CH3, and C(NH2)3SO3CF3 were identified as high-performance candidates for deep-UV birefringent materials. The millimeter-sized crystals of CN4H7SO3CF3, CN4H7SO3CH3, and C(NH2)3SO3CH3 were grown, and the transmittance spectra show that their cutoff edges are below 200 nm. CN4H7SO3CF3 exhibits the largest birefringence (0.149 @ 546 nm, 0.395 @ 200 nm) in the deep-UV region among reported sulfates and sulfate derivatives. It reveals that the hydrogen bond can modulate the module ordering of the heteroleptic tetrahedra and planar &#960;-conjugated cations, thus greatly enhancing the birefringence. Our study not only discovers new deep-UV birefringent materials but also provides an upgraded strategy for optimizing optical anisotropy to achieve efficient birefringence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New generation of nanomaterials with organelle&#8208;level precision provide significant promise for targeted attacks on mitochondria, exhibiting remarkable therapeutic potency. Here, we report a novel amphiphilic phenolic polymer (PF) for the mitochondria&#8208;targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT), which can trigger excessive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damages by the synergistic action of oxidative stress and furan&#8208;mediated DNA cross&#8208;linking. Moreover, the phenolic units on PF enable further self&#8208;assembly with Mn2+ via metal&#8208;phenolic coordination to form metal&#8208;phenolic nanomaterial (PFM). We focus on the synergistic activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway by Mn2+ and tumor&#8208;derived mtDNA in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), and subsequently repolarizing M2&#8208;like TAMs to M1 phenotype. We highlight that PFM facilitates the cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;dependent immunity at the organelle level for potent antitumor efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Novel Target DCTPP1 for Colorectal Cancer Therapy with the Natural Small&#8208;molecule Inhibitors Regulating Metabolic Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumours. Identification of new effective drug targets for CRC and exploration of bioactive small&#8208;molecules are clinically urgent. The human dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1) is a newly identified pyrophosphatase regulating the cellular nucleotide pool but remains unexplored as potential target for CRC treatment. Here, twelve unprecedented chemical architectures terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers (1&#8211;12) and their monomers (13&#8211;20) were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27. Compounds 1&#8211;12 represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. A series of assays showed that 2 could repress proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest, apoptotic and autophagic CRC cell death in vitro and in vivo. Clinical cancer samples data revealed that DCTPP1 was a novel target associated with poor survival in CRC. DCTPP1 was also identified as a new target protein of 2. Mechanistically, compound 2 bound to DCTPP1, inhibited its enzymatic activity, intervened with amino acid metabolic reprogramming, and exerted anti&#8208;CRC activity. Our study demonstrates that DCTPP1 was a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diaryl&#8208;substituted vinyl boronates as potent building modules are challenging to synthesize. Herein, we present a convenient strategy based on a gold&#8208;catalyzed Hiyama arylation of (Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(borylvinyl)silanes which are easily accessible by hydroboration of silylalkynes. By exploiting the highly electronegative nature of the Au(III) intermediate (which is accessed by the light&#8208;assisted oxidation with aryl diazonium salts), a selective activation of the silyl group in the presence of the boron moiety is achieved. This opens a route to selectively synthesize diaryl&#8208;substituted vinyl boronates. The reaction shows a broad substrate range, excellent functional group tolerance and perfect chemo&#8208;selectivity. Experimental studies and DFT calculations allowed us to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction, the synthetic potential was demonstrated by downstream transformations providing a facile route to bifunctional phenanthrenes and triaryl&#8208;substituted olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>25.71%&#8208;Efficiency FACsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by A Thiourea&#8208;based Isomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various isomers have been developed to regulate the morphology and reduce defects in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells. To insight the structure&#8208;function&#8208;effect correlations for the isomerization of thiourea derivatives on the performance of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we developed two thiourea derivatives [(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)amino]thiourea (AT) and N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (HB). Supported by experimental and calculated results, it was found that AT can bind with undercoordinated Pb2+ defect through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.818 eV, which is much higher than that from the synergistic interaction between two &#8208;NH&#8208; groups in HB and perovskite (1.015 eV). Moreover, the stronger interaction between AT and Pb2+ regulates the crystallization process of perovskite film to obtain a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with high crystallinity, large grain size, and low defect density. Consequently, the AT&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 device engenders an efficiency of 25.71% (certified as 24.66%), which is greatly higher than control (23.74%) and HB&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 devices (25.05%). The resultant device exhibits a remarkable stability for maintaining 91.0% and 95.2% of its initial efficiency after aging 2000 h in air condition or tracking at maximum power point for 1000 h, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Silica&#8208;Based Zeolites with Three&#8208;Dimensional Systems of Extra&#8208;Large Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials that find a very wide range of applications, which, however, are limited by the size and dimensionality of their pores. Stable silica zeolites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) system of extra&#8208;large pores (ELP, i.e., pores with minimum windows along the diffusion path consisting of more than 12 SiO4/2 tetrahedra, 12R) are in demand for processing larger molecules than zeolites can currently handle. However, they have challenged worldwide synthetic capabilities for more than eight decades. In this review we first present a brief history of the discovery of ELP zeolites. Next, we show that earlier successes of zeolites with 3D ELP were not actually zeolites, but rather interrupted structures with, in addition, a composition that severely detracted from their stability. Finally, we present three new fully connected stable silica&#8208;based 3D ELP zeolites ZEO&#8208;1, ZEO&#8208;3 and ZEO&#8208;5, discuss their preparation methods and stability as well as the clear advantage of their increased porosity in catalysis and adsorption processes involving large molecules. We will discuss peculiar characteristics of their preparation and present two new reaction types giving rise to zeolites (1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation and interchain expansion), highlighting how new synthesis methods can provide materials that would otherwise be unfeasible.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>7&#8208;Azaindole has been integrated as building block with complementary N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonding sites for the synthesis of a tetrahedral molecular tecton, namely tetra(&#945;&#8208;carbolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl)methane, TACM. The self&#8208;assembly of this molecule results in a 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF). This supramolecular structure constitutes a crystalline microporous material with an extraordinary thermal and chemical robustness. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals how the five&#8208;fold catenation of diamonoid systems, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, form an interpenetrated network with monodimensional channels. The structural features of the crystalline material are also observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, the microporosity of the activated TACM&#8208;HOF is characterized by gas sorption (N2, CO2, CH4 and H2) experiments performed at different pressures. A selective adsorption is observed for CO2 uptake and TACM&#8208;HOF also presents a good adsorption capacity for H2 among supramolecular organic frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Alloying Enabled by Active Liquid Metal Filler for Self&#8208;Healing Composite Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid inorganics, known for kinetically inhibiting polymer crystallization and enhancing ionic conductivity, have attracted significant attention in solid polymer electrolytes. However, current composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are still facing challenges in Li metal batteries, falling short of inhibiting severe dendritic growth and resulting in very limited cycling life. This study introduces Ga62.5In21.5Sn16 (Galinstan) liquid metal (LM) as an active liquid alternative to conventional passive solid fillers, aiming at realizing self&#8208;healing protection against dendrite problems. Compared to solid inorganics, for example silica, LM droplets could more significantly reduce polymer crystallinity and enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity due to their liquid nature, especially at temperatures below the polymer melting point. More importantly, LMs are unraveled as dynamic chemical traps, which are capable of blocking and consuming lithium dendrites upon contact via in situ alloying during battery operation and further inhibiting dendritic growth due to the lower deposition energy barrier of the formed Li&#8208;LM alloy. As a proof of concept, by strategically designing an asymmetric CPE with the active LM filling, a solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 battery achieves promising full&#8208;cell functionality with notable rate performance and stable cycle life. This active filler&#8208;mediated self&#8208;healing approach could bring new insights into the battery design in versatile solid&#8208;state systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Dynamic Evolution of Electrolyte Configuration on the Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface by Visualizing (De)Solvation Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte engineering is crucial for improving cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) to enhance the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially at high charging cut&#8208;off voltages. However, typical electrolyte modification strategies always focus on the solvation structure in the bulk region, but consistently neglect the dynamic evolution of electrolyte solvation configuration at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which directly influences the CEI construction. Herein, we reveal an anti&#8208;synergy effect between Li+&#8208;solvation and interfacial electric field by visualizing the dynamic evolution of electrolyte solvation configuration at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which determines the concentration of interfacial solvated&#8208;Li+. The Li+ solvation in the charging process facilitates the construction of a concentrated (Li+&#8208;solvent/anion&#8208;rich) interface and anion&#8208;derived CEI, while the repulsive force derived from interfacial electric field induces the formation of a diluted (solvent&#8208;rich) interface and solvent&#8208;derived CEI. Modifying the electrochemical protocols and electrolyte formulation, we regulate the &#8220;inflection voltage&#8221; arising from the anti&#8208;synergy effect and prolong the lifetime of the concentrated interface, which further improves the functionality of CEI architecture.</dc:description>

However, typical electrolyte modification strategies always focus on the solvation structure in the bulk region, but consistently neglect the dynamic evolution of electrolyte solvation configuration at the cathode-electrolyte interface, which directly influences the CEI construction. Herein, we reveal an anti-synergy effect between Li+-solvation and interfacial electric field by visualizing the dynamic evolution of electrolyte solvation configuration at the cathode-electrolyte interface, which determines the concentration of interfacial solvated-Li+.

         <title>Molecular Iridium Catalyzed Electrochemical Formic Acid Oxidation: Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) is a pivotal model for understanding organic fuel oxidation and advancing sustainable energy technologies. Here, we present mechanistic insights into a novel molecular&#8208;like iridium catalyst (Ir&#8208;N4&#8208;C) for FAOR. Our studies reveal that isolated sites facilitate a preferential dehydrogenation pathway, circumventing catalyst poisoning and exhibiting high inherent activity. In&#8208;situ spectroscopic analyses elucidate that weakly adsorbed intermediates mediate the FAOR and are dynamically regulated by potential&#8208;dependent redox transitions. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate a parallel mechanism involving two key intermediates with distinct pH and potential sensitivities. The rate&#8208;determining step is identified as the adsorption of formate via coupled or sequential proton&#8208;electron transfer, which aligns well with the observed kinetic properties, pH dependence, and hydrogen/deuterium isotope effects in experiments. These findings provide valuable insights into the reaction mechanism of FAOR, advancing our understanding at the molecular level and potentially guiding the design of efficient catalysts for fuel cells and electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Molecular Motions in Ternary Cocrystals for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic photothermal conversion materials hold immense promise for various applications owing to their structural flexibility. Recent research has focused on enhancing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and mitigating radiative transition processes. In this study, we have developed a viable approach to the design of photothermal conversion materials through the construction of ternary organic cocrystals, by introducing a third component as a molecular blocker and motion unit into a binary donor&#8211;acceptor system. Superstructural and photophysical properties of the ternary cocrystals were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. The role of the molecular blocker in radical stabilization and photothermal conversion were demonstrated. Intriguingly, the motions of the entire pyrene molecules in the cocrystal have been observed by variable temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction results. The excellent performance of ternary cocrystal as a photothermal material was validated through efficient NIR&#8208;II photothermal and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation experiments. The efficiency of water evaporation reached 88.7&#160;%, with a corresponding evaporation rate of 1.29&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, representing excellent performance among pure organic small molecular photothermal conversion materials. Our research underscores the introduction of molecular blockers and motion units to stabilize radicals and produce outstanding photothermal conversion materials, offering new pathways for developing efficient and stable photothermal conversion materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Photoactive H&#8208;Bonding EDA Complex Model Drives the Selective Hydrothiolation and Hydroxysulfenylation of Carbonyl Activated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel model of H&#8208;bonding EDA complex was first reported for the modular and selective hydrothiolation and hydroxysulfenylation of carbonyl activated alkenes with diverse thiols under visible light conditions.







Abstract
Excitation of photoactive electron donor&#8722;acceptor (EDA) complexes to generate radical is a promising approach in radical chemistry. In this study, we introduce a new model of H&#8208;bonding EDA complexes for the selective hydrothiolation and hydroxysulfenylation of carbonyl&#8208;activated alkenes with diverse thiols under visible light conditions. The reliability of this H&#8208;bonding EDA complex model has been confirmed by meticulous experimental and theoretical calculations. Mechanistic investigations have revealed the significant influence of the solvent in determining whether the excitation of photoactive H&#8208;bonding EDA complex leads to charge transfer (CT) or energy&#8208;charge transfer (En&#8208;CT), thereby controlling Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. Notably, the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) analysis clearly shows that the excited state of the C=O&#8722;H&#8722;S EDA complex involves closed&#8208;shell partially covalent interactions.

Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glasses, known for their potential in gas separation, optics, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, benefit from the processability of their (supercooled) liquid state. Traditionally, MOF glasses are produced by heating MOF crystals to their melting point and then cooling the liquid MOF to room temperature under an inert atmosphere. While effective, this melt&#8208;quenching technique requires high energy due to the high temperatures involved. It also limits the scope of new material development by restricting the compositional range to only those combinations of metal ions and linkers that are highly thermally stable. An alternative, mechanical milling at room temperature, has demonstrated its capability to transform MOF crystals into amorphous phases. However, the specific conditions under which these amorphous phases exhibit glass&#8208;like behavior remain uncharted. In this study, we explore the mechanochemical amorphization and vitrification of a variety of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) with diverse linkers and different metal ions (Zn2+, Co2+ and Cu2+) at room temperature. Our findings demonstrate that ZIFs capable of melting can be successfully converted into glasses through ball&#8208;milling. Remarkably, some non&#8208;meltable ZIFs can also be vitrified using the ball&#8208;milling technique, as highlighted by the preparation of the first Cu2+&#8208;based ZIF glass.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Copper Dinitrogen Complex Supported by a Weakly Coordinating Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade Synthesis: The copper dinitrogen complex [(&#951;1&#8208;N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (RF=C(CF3)3) with an unprecedentedly high N&#8801;N stretching frequency of 2314&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and a positive charge of +0.10 residing on the terminal N atom is reported. Synthesis proceeded from Ag[Al(ORF)4] in a triple consecutive cascade reaction with CuI excess to obtain pure product without Ag+ contamination. [(&#951;1&#8208;N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] was fully characterized by NMR, vibrational spectroscopy, EDX, XRD and quantum chemical analyses.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and full characterization of the copper dinitrogen complex [(&#951;1&#8208;N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] 2 (RF=C(CF3)3) prepared by a cascade metathesis reaction of Ag[Al(ORF)4] with CuI&#8208;excess in iso&#8208;perfluorohexane (i&#8208;pfh) under N2 atmosphere. Title compound 2 features an extraordinarily high N2 stretching frequency at 2313/2314&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (IR/Raman) and was characterized by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry. Quantum chemical charge displacement analysis based on natural orbitals of chemical valence (CD&#8208;NOCV) indicates that the copper&#8208;dinitrogen interaction is still governed by weak &#960;&#8208;backdonation, but is significantly reduced compared to all literature&#8208;known transition metal dinitrogen complexes.

         <title>A Conductive Binder Based on Mesoscopic Interpenetration with Polysulfides Capturing Skeleton and Redox Intermediates Network for Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous conductive emulsion binder with the sulfonate&#8208;containing hard elastic copolymer core and the conjugate polymer shell capable of forming a bicontinuous mesoscopic interpenetrating network was synthesized. The lithium sulfur battery assembled with this binder has excellent electrochemical performance, especially rate performance and cycling stability.







Abstract
The practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with high theoretical energy density and readily available cathode active materials is hampered by problems such as sulfur insulation, dramatic volume changes, and polysulfide shuttling. The targeted development of novel binders is the most industrialized solution to the problem of sulfur cathodes. Herein, an aqueous conductive emulsion binder with the sulfonate&#8208;containing hard elastic copolymer core and the conjugate polymer shell, which is capable of forming a bicontinuous mesoscopic interpenetrating polymer network, is synthesized and investigated. Not only can the elastic skeleton formed by the copolymer bind the active substance under drastic volume changes, but also the rich ester and cyanide groups in it can effectively capture lithium polysulfide. Meanwhile, the conducting skeleton consisting of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) both provides the additional charge conduction pathways and acts as the redox intermediates, significantly accelerating the kinetic process of lithium polysulfide conversion. Based on the synergistic effect of the above mechanisms, the use of the prepared binder on the sulfur carbon cathode significantly improves the rate performance and cycle stability of lithium sulfur batteries.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances on the different electroreduction applications of metal&#8211;organic framework derived carbon&#8208;supported metal electrocatalysts with customized structure, component, and electron structure are depicted. Thereout, morphology control, component/construction modulation and controlled metal loading strategies are systematically sorted out based on three key components of metal&#8211;organic frameworks, namely metal nodes, ligands and modifiers.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction reactions, as cathodic processes in many energy&#8208;related devices, significantly impact the overall efficiency determined mainly by the performance of electrocatalysts. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) derived carbon&#8208;supported metal materials have become one of star electrocatalysts due to their tunable structure and composition through ligand design and metal screening. However, for different electroreduction reactions, the required active metal species vary in phase component, electronic state, and catalytic center configuration, hence requiring effective customization. From this perspective, this review comprehensively analyzes the structural design principles, metal loading strategies, practical electroreduction performance, and complex catalytic mechanisms, thereby providing insights and guidance for the future rational design of such electroreduction catalysts.

         <title>mRNA Display in Cell Lysates Enables Identification of Cyclic Peptides Targeting the BRD3 Extraterminal Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to perform mRNA display selections against protein targets expressed in mammalian cell lysates has been developed. This approach circumvents the need for purified proteins to be produced, giving access to targets that are aggregation&#8208;prone, contain disordered regions or that require post&#8208;translational modifications.







Abstract
mRNA display is a powerful technology to screen libraries of &gt;1012 cyclic peptides against a protein target, enabling the rapid discovery of high affinity ligands. These cyclic peptides are particularly well suited to challenging protein targets that have been difficult to drug with small molecules. However, target choice can still be limited as screens are typically performed against purified proteins which often demands the use of isolated domains and precludes the use of aggregation&#8208;prone targets. Herein, we report a method to perform mRNA display selections in mammalian cell lysates without the need for prior target purification, vastly expanding the potential target scope of mRNA display. We have applied the methodology to identify low to sub&#8208;nanomolar peptide binders for two targets: a NanoLuc subunit (LgBiT) and full&#8208;length bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 3 (BRD3). Our cyclic peptides for BRD3 were found to bind to the extraterminal (ET) domain of BRD3 and the closely related BRD proteins, BRD2 and BRD4. While many chemical probes exist for the bromodomains of BRD proteins, the ET domain is relatively underexplored, making these peptides valuable additions to the BRD toolbox.

We report an efficient protocol for chiral dihydroisoquinolone&#8208;fused indolines through a cobaltaphotoredox catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation/dearomatization of indoles. Mechanistic studies indicate the excited photocatalyst was quenched by cobalt(II) species in the presence of Salox ligand. The stoichiometric reactions of cobaltacycle intermediate suggest the irradiation of light also play a critical role in the dearomatization step.







Abstract
Photocatalysis holds a pivotal position in modern organic synthesis, capable of inducing novel reactivities under mild and environmentally friendly reaction conditions. However, the merger of photocatalysis and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation as an efficient and sustainable method for the construction of chiral molecules remains elusive and challenging. Herein, we develop a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation reaction enabled by visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis, providing a synergistic catalytic strategy for the asymmetric dearomatization of indoles with high levels of enantioselectivity (96&#8201;% to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies indicate that the excited photocatalyst was quenched by divalent cobalt species in the presence of Salox ligand, leading to the formation of catalytically active chiral Co(III) complex. Moreover, stoichiometric reactions of cobaltacycle intermediate with indole suggest that the irradiation of visible light also play a critical role in the dearomatization step.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of an Improbable Directly Bonded Phosphorene&#8208;Fullerene Heterodimensional Hybrid toward Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorene&#8208;fullerene hybrid with fullerene directly bonded onto the surface (basal plane) of phosphorene via P&#8722;C bonds was theoretically predicted &#8220;improbable&#8221; due to the strong repulsion between phosphorene and neutral fullerene.It is now synthesized by an electrosynthesis method involving C602&#8722; dianion as an intermediate generated by electroreduction of C60, significantly improving the stability and visible light/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates of phosphorene.







Abstract
Phosphorene and fullerene are representative two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nanomaterials respectively, constructing their heterodimensional hybrid not only complements their physiochemical properties but also extends their applications via synergistic interactions. This is however challenging because of their diversities in dimension and chemical reactivity, and theoretical studies predicted that it is improbable to directly bond C60 onto the surface of phosphorene due to their strong repulsion. Here, we develop a facile electrosynthesis method to synthesize the first phosphorene&#8208;fullerene hybrid featuring fullerene surface bonding via P&#8722;C bonds. Few&#8208;layer black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) obtained from electrochemical exfoliation react with C602&#8722; dianion prepared by electroreduction of C60, fulfilling formation of the &#8220;improbable&#8221; phosphorene&#8208;fullerene hybrid (BPNS&#8208;s&#8208;C60). Theoretical results reveal that the energy barrier for formation of [BPNS&#8208;s&#8208;C60]2&#8722; intermediate is significantly decreased by 1.88&#8197;eV, followed by an oxidization reaction to generate neutral BPNS&#8208;s&#8208;C60 hybrid. Surface bonding of C60 molecules not only improves significantly the ambient stability of BPNSs, but also boosts dramatically the visible light and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates, reaching 1466 and 1039&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 respectively, which are both the highest values among all reported BP&#8208;based metal&#8208;free photocatalysts.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Streptamidine and Klebsazolicin Using Biomimetic On&#8208;Resin Ring&#8208;Closing Amidine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile on&#8208;resin ring&#8208;closing amidine formation method was developed to synthesize peptides bearing diketopiperazine derived cyclic amidine structure at the N&#8208;terminus. Natural products streptamidine and klebsazolicin as well as analogues were synthesized by using this method.







Abstract
Diketopiperazine (DKP) derived cyclic amidine structures widely exist in peptide natural products according to the genome mining result. The largely unknown bioactivity and mode of action are partially caused by the poor availability of the compounds via microbiological and chemical approaches. To tackle this challenge, in this work, we have developed the on&#8208;resin ring&#8208;closing amidine formation strategy to synthesize peptides containing N&#8208;terminal DKP derived cyclic amidine structure, in which the 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization mediated by HgCl2 activation of thioamides was the key step. Leveraging from this new strategy, we finished the total syntheses of streptamidine and klebsazolicin. Meanwhile, eleven klebsazolicin analogues were synthesized for its structure&#8211;activity relationship study.

         <title>Unlocking Fast Potassium Ion Kinetics: High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Potassium Dual&#8208;Ion Battery for Operation at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C</title>

A potassium&#8208;based DIBs with superior cycling stability at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C is established by coupling MXenes anode with PTPAN cathode, in which the co&#8208;intercalation behavior of solvated K+ endows MXenes anode with fast K+ kinetics to unlock the outstanding performance of PDIB at ultralow temperatures.







Abstract
Energy storage devices operating at low temperatures are plagued by sluggish kinetics, reduced capacity, and notorious dendritic growth. Herein, novel potassium dual&#8208;ion batteries (PDIBs) capable of superior performance at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, and fabricated by combining MXenes and polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) as the anode and cathode, respectively, are presented. Additionally, the reason for the anomalous kinetics of K+ (faster at low temperature than at room temperature) on the Ti3C2 anode is investigated. Theoretical calculations, crossover experiments, and in situ XRD at room and low temperatures revealed that K+ tends to bind with solvent molecules rather than anions at subzero temperatures, which not only inhibits the participation of PF6&#8722; in the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), but also guarantees co&#8208;intercalation behavior and suppresses undesirable K+ storage. The advantageous properties at low temperatures endow the Ti3C2 anode with fast K+ kinetics to unlock the outstanding performance of PDIB at ultralow temperatures. The PDIBs exhibit superior rate capability and high capacity retention at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. Impressively, after charging&#8208;discharging for 20,000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, the PDIB retained 86.7&#8201;% of its initial capacity. This study reveals the influence of temperatures on MXenes and offers a unique design for dual&#8208;ion batteries operating at ultralow temperatures.

         <title>Alkene Isomerisation Catalysed by a Superbasic Sodium Amide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using superbasic sodium amide NaTMP as a catalyst, isomerisation of alkenes at room temperature under mild condition has been accomplished. Isolation of organometallic intermediates and DFT calculations have revealed the key role on TMP(H), acting as a proton source and facilitatitng the migration of the double bond.







Abstract
Typically catalysed by transition metals, alkene isomerisation is a powerful methodology for preparation of internal olefins. In contrast, the use of more earth abundant main group reagents is limited to activated substrates, requiring high temperatures and excess stoichiometric amounts. Opening a new avenue for progressing this field, here we report applications of bulky sodium amide NaTMP (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) when partnered with tridentate Lewis donor PMDETA (N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine) in catalytic alkene isomerisation of terminal olefins under mild reaction conditions. An array of distinct olefins could successfully be isomerised, including unactivated olefins, allylamines, and allylethers, showing the high activity of this partnership. In&#8208;depth mechanistic insights provided by X&#8208;ray crystallography, real&#8208;time nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) monitoring, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have unveiled the crucial role of in situ&#8208;generated TMP(H) in facilitating efficient isomerisation, and the choice of alkali&#8208;metal. Additionally, theoretical studies shed light on the observed E/Z selectivity, particularly accounting for the selective formation of Z&#8208;vinyl ethers. The versatility of our method is further demonstrated through the isomerisation of unactivated cycloalkenes, which undergo hydrogen isotope exchange to produce deuterated compounds.

Opening a new avenue for progressing this field, here we report applications of bulky sodium amide NaTMP (TMP=2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide) when partnered with tridentate Lewis donor PMDETA (&lt;i&gt;N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8217;&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine) in catalytic alkene isomerisation of terminal olefins under mild reaction conditions. An array of distinct olefins could successfully be isomerised, including unactivated olefins, allylamines, and allylethers, showing the high activity of this partnership. In-depth mechanistic insights provided by X-ray crystallography, real-time nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) monitoring, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have unveiled the crucial role of in situ-generated TMP(H) in facilitating efficient isomerisation, and the choice of alkali-metal. Additionally, theoretical studies shed light on the observed &lt;i&gt;E/Z&lt;/i&gt; selectivity, particularly accounting for the selective formation of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-vinyl ethers. The versatility of our method is further demonstrated through the isomerisation of unactivated cycloalkenes, which undergo hydrogen isotope exchange to produce deuterated compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anodic H2O2 Generation in Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolytes&#8212;Mechanistic Insight from Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local pH measurement reveals that main anion at the interface is HCO3&#8722;, at potentials where H2O2 is preferentially formed, regardless of the bulk electrolyte pH. A Au&#8722;Pt double barrel microelectrode demonstrates that the local HCO3&#8722; concentration is collectively determined by the oxidation current, buffer capacity, and bulk electrolyte pH.







Abstract
For the anodic H2O2 generation, it has been shown that the electrolyte composition can steer the reaction pathway toward increased H2O2 generation. Previous efforts made on composition optimization found that the impact of the molar fraction of carbonate species varies for different anodes, and therefore, controversies remain concerning the reaction pathways as well as the species involved in H2O2 formation. Considering that water oxidation results in the liberation of protons within the anode microenvironment, the corresponding acidification would cause an equilibrium shift between carbonate species, which in turn may modulate the reaction pathway. We determined the changes in the fraction of carbonate species in the vicinity of an anode by performing local pH measurements using a Au nanoelectrode positioned in close proximity to an operating anode by shear&#8208;force scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). It could be confirmed that the main anionic species at the interface is HCO3&#8722;, at potentials where H2O2 is preferentially formed, regardless of the pH value in the bulk. The simultaneous use of a Au&#8722;Pt double barrel microelectrode in generator&#8208;collector SECM measurements demonstrates that the local HCO3&#8722; concentration is collectively determined by the oxidation current, buffer capacity, and bulk pH of the electrolyte.

         <title>Synergistic Electrocatalysis and Spatial Nanoconfinement to Accelerate Sulfur Conversion Kinetics in Aqueous Zn&#8722;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur/nitrogen dual&#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers spatially confined sulfur nanoparticles (S@S,N&#8722;CNF) composite with yolk&#8211;shell sulfur@carbon nanostructure is elaborately fabricated. Benefiting from both the synergistic electrocatalysis and spatial nanoconfinement of S,N&#8722;CNF host, S@S,N&#8722;CNF cathode exhibits reduced energy barrier and accelerated sulfur reduction reaction kinetics enabling highly improved aqueous Zn&#8722;S battery performances.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries based on the conversion&#8208;type sulfur cathodes are promising in energy storage system due to the high theoretical energy density, low cost, and good safety. However, the multi&#8208;electron solid&#8208;state intermediate conversion reaction of sulfur cathodes generally possess sluggish kinetics, which leads to lower discharge voltage and inefficient sulfur utilization, thus suppressing the practical energy density. Herein, sulfur nanoparticles derived from metal&#8211;organic frameworks confined in situ within electrospun fibers derived sulfur and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (S@S,N&#8722;CNF) composite, which possesses yolk&#8211;shell S@C nanostructure, is fabricated through successive sulfidation, pyrolysis, and sulfide oxidation processes, and served as a high&#8208;performance cathode material for Zn&#8722;S battery. The S and N dopants on carbon can collectively catalyse sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) by lowering energy barrier and accelerating kinetics to increase discharge voltage and specific capacity. Meanwhile, the yolk&#8211;shell S@C structure with spatially confined S nanoparticle yolks is beneficial to improve charge transfer and lower activation energy, thus further expediting SRR kinetics. Furthermore, extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that S and N dual&#8208;doping can thermodynamically and dynamically reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step (i.e., the transformation of *ZnS4 into *ZnS2) for the overall SRR, thereby significantly accelerating SRR kinetics.

         <title>Hollow Core&#8208;Shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with Tiny&#8208;Void Space Capable Fast&#8208;Charge and Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
Hollow core&#8211;shell Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny&#8208;void space was synthesized by one&#8208;step spray drying and calcination for the first time due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, ratios, and shrinkage rates between CA and PVP, which ensures high energy density and relieves volume expansion, combining with regulation on Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier by doping Ni to achieve fast charging and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based mixed polyanion phosphate Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries (SIBs) due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. However, its inherent low conductivity and sluggish Na+ diffusion limit fast charge and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage. This study pioneers a scalable synthesis of hollow core&#8211;shelled Na4Fe2.4Ni0.6(PO4)2P2O7 with tiny&#8208;void space (THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni) via a one&#8208;step spray&#8208;drying combined with calcination process due to the different viscosity, coordination ability, molar ratios, and shrinkage rates between citric acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone. This unique structure with interconnected carbon networks ensures rapid electron transport and fast Na+ diffusion, as well as efficient space utilization for relieving volume expansion. Incorporating regulation of lattice structure by doping Ni heteroatom to effectively improve intrinsic electron conductivity and optimize Na+ diffusion path and energy barrier, which achieves fast charge and low&#8208;temperature sodium storage. As a result, THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni exhibits superior rate capability (86.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 25&#8197;C). Notably, THoCS&#8208;0.6Ni demonstrates exceptional cycling stability at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C with a capacity of 43.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2500&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C. This work provides a universal strategy to design the hollow core&#8211;shelled structure with tiny&#8208;void space cathode materials for reversible batteries with fast&#8208;charge and low&#8208;temperature Na&#8208;storage features.

         <title>Full Selectivity Control over the Catalytic Hydrogenation of Nitroaromatics Into Six Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single catalytic system has been developed for the production of six products, namely nitroso, hydroxylamine, azoxy, azo, hydrazo and aniline compounds, from nitroaromatics. Furthermore, a detailed reaction network for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics has been constructed based on systematic investigation into the controlled production of all products and their chemical reactivities via oxygen&#8208;isolated characterisation techniques.







Abstract
A full selectivity control over the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics leads to the production of six possible products, i.e., nitroso, hydroxylamine, azoxy, azo, hydrazo or aniline compounds, which has however not been achieved in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Currently, there is no sufficient evidence to support that the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics with the use of heterogeneous metal catalysts would follow the Haber's mechanistic scheme based on electrochemical reduction. We now demonstrate in this work that it is possible to fully control the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics into their all six products using a single catalytic system under various conditions. Employing SnO2&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles facilitated by the surface coordination of ethylenediamine and vanadium species enabled this unprecedented selectivity control. Through systematic investigation into the controlled production of all products and their chemical reactivities, we have constructed a detailed reaction network for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. Crucially, using oxygen&#8208;isolated characterization techniques is essential for identifying unstable compounds such as nitroso, hydroxylamine, hydrazo compounds. The insights gained from this research offer invaluable guidance for selectively transforming nitroaromatics into a wide array of functional N&#8208;containing compounds, both advancing fundamental understanding and fostering practical applications in various fields.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Polyrotaxane Networks with Collective Motions of Multiple Main&#8208;Chain Mechanical Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the microscopic collective motion of mechanical bonds in Type&#8208;II main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane (PR) backbones and the macroscopic mechanical performance of the resulting PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs) have been investigated. The synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of the PRMINs.







Abstract
Type&#8197;I main&#8208;chain polyrotaxanes (PRs) with multiple wheels threaded onto the axle are widely employed to design slide&#8208;ring materials. However, Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PRs with axles threading into the macrocycles on the polymer backbones have rarely been studied, although they feature special topological structures and dynamic characteristics. Herein, we report the design and preparation of Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs), based on which the relationship between microscopic motion of mechanical bonds on the PRs and macroscopic mechanical performance of materials has been revealed. The representative PRMIN&#8208;2 exhibits a robust feature in tensile tests with high stretchability (1680&#8201;%) and toughness (47.5&#8197;MJ/m3). Moreover, it also has good puncture performance with puncture energy of 22.0&#8197;mJ. Detailed rheological measurements and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation reveal that the embedded multiple [2]rotaxane mechanical bonds on the PR backbones of PRMINs could undergo a synergistic long&#8208;range sliding motion under external force, with the introduction of collective dangling chains into the network. As a result, the synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of PRMINs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Synthesis of Non&#8208;Covalent Crosslinkers while Folding Single&#8208;Chain Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic combinatorial macrocyclic disulfides acted as non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers, adapting to polymer folding. Initially, small macrocycles fold the polymer into a loose state, which then catalysed the formation of larger macrocycles to enhance folding efficiency. Our work deepens the understanding of interplay between adaptive synthesis and dynamic folding, advancing the strategy for replicating protein folding into functional nanoparticles.







Abstract
Peptide folding is a dynamic process driven by non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;linking leading to functional nanostructures for essential biochemical activities. However, replicating this process in synthetic systems is challenging due to the difficulty in mimicking nature&#8216;s real&#8208;time regulation of non&#8208;covalent crosslinking for single&#8208;chain polymer folding. Here, we address this by employing anionic dithiol building blocks to create macrocyclic disulfides as non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers that adapted to the folding process. Initially, small macrocycles facilitated a low degree folding of a polycation. Then, this preorganized structure catalysed the production of larger macrocycles that enhanced the folding conversely. The self&#8208;adaptive synthesis was verified through the encapsulation of an anticancer drug, showing an updated production distribution of non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers and maximizing drug&#8208;loading efficiency against drug&#8208;resistant cancer in vitro. Our research advances the understanding of molecular systems by exploring species evolution via the structural dynamics of polymer folding. Additionally, adaptive synthesis enables controlled, sequential folding of synthetic polymers, with the potential to mimic protein functions.

         <title>Exploring Macroscopic Dipoles of Designed Cyclic Peptide Ordered Assemblies to Harvest Piezoelectric Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric properties of self&#8208;assembled cyclic peptides derived from &#948;&#8208;amino acids have been investigated by exploring their macrodipole. The packing of the cyclic peptides, which show unidirectional hydrogen bonds was found to determine the piezoelectric properties.







Abstract
Crystalline materials exhibiting non&#8208;centrosymmetry and possessing substantial surface dipole moments play a critical role in piezoelectricity. Designing biocompatible self&#8208;assembled materials with these attributes is particularly challenging when compared to inorganic materials and ceramics. In this study, we elucidate the crystal conformations of novel cyclic peptides that exhibit self&#8208;assembly into tubular structures characterized by unidirectional hydrogen bonding and piezoelectric properties. Unlike cyclic peptides derived from alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids, those derived from new &#948;&#8208;amino acids demonstrate the formation of self&#8208;assembled tubes with unidirectional hydrogen bonds. Further, the tightly packed tubular assemblies and higher macrodipole moments result in superior piezoelectric coefficients compared to peptides with lower macrodipole moments. Our findings underscore the potential for designing cyclic peptides with unidirectional hydrogen bonds, thereby paving the way for their application in design of biocompatible piezo&#8208; and ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Development of a Dual&#8208;Factor Activatable Covalent Targeted Photoacoustic Imaging Probe for Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an NCEH1&#8208;targeted covalent photoacoustic imaging probe activated under hypoxia. This probe potently and selectively labels NCEH1, an aggressive tumor associated serine hydrolase, in cells and is also activated under hypoxic conditions. Through covalent labeling and hypoxia activation, this probe offers selective and high&#8208;quality in vivo tumor imaging of aggressive prostate cancer.







Abstract
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging modality in biomedical imaging with superior imaging depth and specificity. However, PAI still has significant limitations, such as the background noise from endogenous chromophores. To overcome these limitations, we developed a covalent activity&#8208;based PAI probe, NOx&#8208;JS013, targeting NCEH1. NCEH1, a highly expressed and activated serine hydrolase in aggressive cancers, has the potential to be employed for the diagnosis of cancers. We show that NOx&#8208;JS013 labels active NCEH1 in live cells with high selectivity relative to other serine hydrolases. NOx&#8208;JS013 also presents its efficacy as a hypoxia&#8208;responsive imaging probe in live cells. Finally, NOx&#8208;JS013 successfully visualizes aggressive prostate cancer tumors in mouse models of PC3, while being negligibly detected in tumors of non&#8208;aggressive LNCaP mouse models. These findings show that NOx&#8208;JS013 has the potential to be used to develop precision PAI reagents for detecting metastatic progression in various cancers.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Poly(ester&#8208;disulfide)s for Potential Alternatives to Engineering Plastic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a representative case study of tough, chemical resistant and closed&#8208;loop recyclable dynamic poly(ester&#8208;disulfide)s of which their highly crosslinking nature was contributed by a synergetic effect of covalent ester&#8208;bond linkages and non&#8208;covalent hydrogen bonding, metal&#8208;ligand coordinations, subsequently endowing the fabricated optical&#8208;transparent materials with excellent mechanical properties, decent chemical resistance and facile closed&#8208;loop recycling capabilities, comparable with engineering polymers.







Abstract
Facile fabrication, low material complexity and closed&#8208;loop recycling are essential for polymer plastics to alter their linear product economy towards a cradle&#8208;to&#8208;cradle one. Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) are one way to achieve that, which intrinsically exhibit decent mechanical properties like the thermosets but could also be easily recycled like the thermoplastics. In this work, we introduce rigid ester structural motifs into dynamic poly(disulfide)s to form a series of dual polymer networks. Owning to the coherence of soft/rigid segments and the reversible sacrificial crosslinking, they exhibit tailorable mechanical properties and good resistance towards different chemicals. Their closed&#8208;loop recycling is achieved via mild solvolysis, maintaining materials&#8217; mechanical integrities. It offers a solution as a sustainable replacement for engineering plastics which are massively under production but hard to be recycled.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One: Plasmonic Janus Heterostructures for Efficient Cooperative Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design of a reduction co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;tipped and oxidation co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;capped Janus heterostructure, which reveals the benefits of efficient interfacial charge separation via transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively, to Au and RuN5 sites for selective organic synthesis and H2 production via photoredox paired reaction coupling.







Abstract
Janus heterostructures consisting of multiple jointed components with distinct properties have gained growing interest in the photoredox catalytic field. Herein, we have developed a facile low&#8208;temperature method to gain anisotropic one&#8208;dimensional Au&#8208;tipped CdS (Au&#8722;CdS) nanorods (NRs), followed by assembling Ru molecular co&#8208;catalyst (RuN5) onto the surface of the NRs. The CdS NRs decorated with plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs) and RuN5 complex harness the virtues of metal&#8208;semiconductor and inorganic&#8208;organic interface, giving directional charge transfer channels, spatially separated reaction sites, and enhanced local electric field distribution. As a result, the Au&#8722;CdS&#8722;RuN5 can act as an efficient dual&#8208;function photocatalyst for simultaneous H2 evolution and valorization of biomass&#8208;derived alcohols. Benefiting from the interfacial charge decoupling and selective chemical bond activation, the optimal all&#8208;in&#8208;one Au&#8722;CdS&#8722;RuN5 heterostructure shows greatly enhanced photoactivity and selectivity as compared to bare CdS NRs, along with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 40.2&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. The structural evolution and working mechanism of the heterostructures are systematically analyzed based on experimental and computational results.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Selenol&#8208;Yne Click (SYC) Reaction Enables Poly(selenoacetal) Covalent Adaptable Network Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing a catalysis&#8208;free selenol&#8208;yne click reaction, we successfully synthesized polymers and dynamic materials. Selenoacetal&#8208;based materials exhibit exceptional reprocessing ability, self&#8208;healing properties, and recycling potential.







Abstract
The emergence of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) based on dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) presents a promising avenue for achieving resource recovery and utilization. In this study, we discovered a dynamic covalent bond called selenacetal, which is obtained through a double click reaction between selenol and activated alkynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the &#916;G for the formation of selenoacetals ranges from 12 to 18&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, suggesting its potential for dynamic reversibility. Dynamic exchange experiments involving small molecules and polymers provide substantial evidence supporting the dynamic exchange properties of selenoacetals. By utilizing this highly efficient click reaction, we successfully synthesized dynamic materials based on selenoacetal with remarkable reprocessing capabilities without any catalysts. These materials exhibit chemical recycling under alkaline conditions, wherein selenoacetal (SA) can decompose into active enone selenide (ES) and diselenides. Reintroducing selenol initiates a renewed reaction with the enone selenide, facilitating material recycling and yielding a newly developed dynamic material exhibiting both photo&#8208; and thermal responsiveness. The results underscore the potential of selenoacetal polymers in terms of recyclability and selective degradation, making them a valuable addition to conventional covalent adaptable networks.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Group Polymer Coating on Zn Anode for High Overall Conversion Efficiency Photorechargeable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) was developed as a functional polymer coating for Zn, enhancing the cycling stability of the Zn anode and accelerating the storage rate of photogenerated charges. This enabled the fabricated photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries to achieve a high overall conversion efficiency of 13.12&#8201;%.







Abstract
The solar&#8208;driven photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries have emerged as a promising power solution for smart electronic devices and equipment. However, the subpar cyclic stability of the Zn anode remains a significant impediment to their practical application. Herein, poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) (PDPTT) was designed as a functional polymer coating of Zn. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDPTT coating not only significantly homogenizes the electric field distribution on the Zn surface, but also promotes the ion&#8208;accessible surface of Zn. With multiple N and C=O groups exhibiting strong adsorption energies, this polymer coating reduces the nucleation overpotential of Zn, alters the diffusion pathway of Zn2+ at the anode interface, and decreases the corrosion current and hydrogen evolution current. Leveraging these advantages, Zn&#8208;PDPTT//Zn&#8208;PDPTT exhibits an exceptionally long cycling time (&#8805;4300&#8197;h, 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Zn&#8208;PDPTT//AC zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors can withstand 50,000 cycles at 5&#8197;A/g. Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits a faster charge storage rate, higher capacity, and excellent cycling stability. Coupling Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO with high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells results in a 13.12&#8201;% overall conversion efficiency for the photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion battery, showcasing significant value in advancing the efficiency and upgrading conversion of renewable energy utilization.

         <title>Tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficiently Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine based covalent organic frameworks were constructed for the first time. They displayed superior H2O2 production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in H2O and O2 under AM&#8197;1.5G through the combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have recently emerged as fascinating scaffolds for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion because of their customizable structures and functionalities. Herein, two tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials (namely COF&#8208;JLU51 and COF&#8208;JLU52) featuring large surface area, high crystallinity, excellent stability and photoelectric properties were designed and constructed for the first time. Remarkably, COF&#8208;JLU51 gave an outstanding H2O2 production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in pure water and O2 under one standard sun light, that higher than its isomorphic COF&#8208;JLU52 and most of the reported metal&#8208;free materials, owing to its superior generation, separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Experimental and theoretical researches prove that the photocatalytic process undergoes a combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction (WOR). Specifically, an ultrahigh yield of 7624.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with apparent quantum yield of 18.2&#8201;% for COF&#8208;JLU52 was achieved in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio of benzyl alcohol and water system. This finding contributes novel, nitrogen&#8208;rich and high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials, and also designate their bright future in photocatalytic solar transformations.

However, the current AEMWEs are restricted by the poor mechanical strength and low OH&#8208; conductivity of AEMs, leading to the low working stability and low current density. Here, we develop a robust AEM with polybiphenylpiperidium network by combining the crosslinking with triazine and the capping with pyridine for advanced AEMWEs. The AEM exhibits an excellent mechanical strength (79.4 MPa), low swelling ratio (19.2 %), persistent alkali stability (&#187; 5,000 hours) and high OH&#8208; conductivity (247.2 mS cm&#8208;1) which achieves the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art AEMs. Importantly, when applied in AEMWEs, the corresponding electrolyzer equipped with commercial nickel iron and nickel molybdenum catalysts obtained a current density of up to 3.0 A cm&#8208;2 at 2 V&#160;and could be stably operated ~430 h at a high current density of 1.6 A cm&#8208;2, which exceeds the most of AEMWEs. Our results suggest that triazine crosslinking and pyridine capping can effectively improve the overall performance of the AEMWEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective diboration of unactivated alkenes with (pin)B&#8722;B(dan)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric diboration of terminal alkenes is well established, and subsequent selective functionalization of the less hindered primary boronic ester is commonly achieved. Conversely, selective functionalization of the sterically less accessible secondary boronic ester remains challenging. An alternative way to control chemoselective functionalization of bis(boron) compounds is by engendering different Lewis acidity to the two boryl moieties, since reactivity would then be dictated by Lewis acidity instead of sterics. We report herein the regio&#8208; and enantioselective Pt&#8208;catalyzed diboration of unactivated alkenes with (pin)B&#8722;B(dan). A broad range of terminal and cyclic alkenes undergo diboration to furnish the differentiable 1,2&#8208;bis(boron) compounds with high levels of regio&#8208; and enantiocontrol, giving access to a wide variety of novel building blocks from a common intermediate. The reaction places the less Lewis acidic B(dan) group at the less hindered position and the resulting 1,2&#8208;bisboryl alkanes undergo selective transformations of the B(pin) group located at the more hindered position. The regioselectivity of diboration has been studied by DFT calculations and is believed to originate from the trans influence, which lowers the activation barrier for formation of the regioisomer that places the weaker electron donor [B(pin) vs B(dan)] opposite the strong electron donor (alkyl group) in the platinum complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling C&#8211;Selective Ring&#8208;Opening of Phosphiranes with Carboxylic Acids and Other Nucleophiles: A Mechanistically&#8208;Driven Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphiranes are weak Lewis bases reacting with only a limited number of electrophiles to produce the corresponding phosphiranium ions. These salts are recognized for their propensity to undergo reactions with oxygen pronucleophiles at the phosphorus site, leading to the formation of phosphine oxide adducts. Building on a thorough mechanistic understanding, we have developed an unprecedented approach that enables the selective reaction of carboxylic acids, and other nucleophiles, at the carbon site of phosphiranes. This method involves the photochemical generation of highly reactive carbenes, which react with 1&#8208;mesitylphosphirane to yield ylides. The latter undergoes a stepwise reaction with carboxylic acids, resulting in the production of the desired phosphines. In addition to DFT calculations, we have successfully isolated and fully characterized the key intermediates involved in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Promiscuity of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase Enables Stereoselective Synthesis of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Tetralones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of biocatalysis, discovering novel reactivity from known enzymes has been a longstanding challenge. Fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) has drawn considerable attention as a promising photoenzyme with potential green chemistry applications; however, its non&#8208;natural reactivity has rarely been exploited to date. Herein we report a non&#8208;natural reductive dehalogenation (deacetoxylation) reactivity of CvFAP inspired by its natural oxidative decarboxylation process, enabling the &#160;stereoselective synthesis of a series of chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted tetralones with high yields (up to 99%) and e.r. values (up to 99:1). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the native photoenzyme catalyzed the reductive dehalogenation via a novel mechanism involving oxidized state (FADox) / semiquinone state (FADsq) redox pair and an electron transfer (ET)/proton transfer (PT) process of radical termination, distinct from the previous reports. To our knowledge, this study represents a new example of CvFAP promiscuity, and thus expands the reactivity repertoire of CvFAP and highlights the versatility of CvFAP in asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>General and Modular Synthesis of Covalent Organic Cages for Efficient Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cage&#8208;type structures based on coordination and dynamic covalent chemistry have the characteristics of facile and efficient preparation but poor stability. Chemically stable organic cages, generally involving fragment coupling and multi&#8208;step reactions, are relatively difficult to synthesize. Herein, we offer a general and modular strategy to customize covalent organic cages with diverse skeletons and sizes. First, one skeleton (S) module with three extension (E) modules and three reaction (R) modules are connected by one&#8208; or two&#8208;step coupling to get the triangular monomer bearing three reaction sites. Then one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8211;Crafts condensation of the monomer and linking module of paraformaldehyde produces the designed organic cages. The cage forming could be regulated by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. The S&#8211;E&#8211;R angles in the monomer is crucial; only 120o (2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) or 60o (2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) angle between S&#8211;E&#8211;R successfully affords the resulting cages. By the rational design of the three modules, a series of organic cages have been constructed. In addition, the host&#8208;guest properties show that the representative cages could strongly encapsulate neutral aromatic diimine guests driven by solvophobic interactions in polar solvents, giving the highest association constant of (2.58 &#177; 0.18) &#215; 105 M&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Growth of One&#8208;Dimensional Blocking Layer to Mitigate Deficient Surface of Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) single crystals are promising for optoelectronic application, but their high surface trap density and associated ion migration hinders device performance and stability. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) perovskites are designed and proposed as blocking layer at the crystal/electrode interface to mitigate the surface issues. As a model system, the interface ion migration in Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 (FA=formamidinium) single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is obviously suppressed, leading to increase of T90 lifetime from 260 to 1000 hours, five times better than previously reported results. Besides, the reduction of surface iodide ion vacancies inhibits nonradiative recombination, thus increasing the efficiency from 22.1% to 23.8%, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;crystal PSCs. Since the deficient crystal surface is a universal and open issue, our strategy is instructive for optimizing diverse single&#8208;crystal perovskite devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;metal sites drive tandem electrocatalytic CO2 to C2+ products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals is a promising route for renowable energy storage and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emission, and production of multicarbon (C2+) products is highly desired. Here, we report a 1.4%Pd&#8208;Cu@CuPz2 comprising of dispersive CuOx and PdO dual nanoclusters embedded in the MOF CuPz2&#160;(Pz&#160;= Pyrazole), which achieves a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FEC2+) of 81.9% and C2+ alcohol FE of 47.5% with remarkable stability when using 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution as electrolyte in a typical H&#8208;cell. Particularly, the FE of alcohol is obviously improved on 1.4%Pd&#8208;Cu@CuPz2 compared to Cu@CuPz2. Theoretical calculations have revealed that&#160;revealed that the enhanced interfacial electron transfer facilitates the adsorption of *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization&#160;on the Cu&#8208;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2. Additionally, the oxophilicity of Pd can stabilize the key intermediate *CH2CHO and promote subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer&#160;more efficiently, confirming that the formation pathway is skew towards *C2H5OH.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals is a promising route for renowable energy storage and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emission, and production of multicarbon (C2+) products is highly desired. Here, we report a 1.4%Pd-Cu@CuPz2 comprising of dispersive CuOx and PdO dual nanoclusters embedded in the MOF CuPz2&#160;(Pz&#160;= Pyrazole), which achieves a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FEC2+) of 81.9% and C2+ alcohol FE of 47.5% with remarkable stability when using 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution as electrolyte in a typical H-cell. Particularly, the FE of alcohol is obviously improved on 1.4%Pd-Cu@CuPz2 compared to Cu@CuPz2. Theoretical calculations have revealed that&#160;revealed that the enhanced interfacial electron transfer facilitates the adsorption of *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization&#160;on the Cu-Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2. Additionally, the oxophilicity of Pd can stabilize the key intermediate *CH2CHO and promote subsequent proton-coupled electron transfer&#160;more efficiently, confirming that the formation pathway is skew towards *C2H5OH. Consequently, the Cu-Pd dual sites&#160;play a synergistic tandem&#160;role in cooperatively improving the selectivity of alcohol and accelerating reductive conversion of CO2 to C2+.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preserving Molecular Tuning for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modifying catalyst surface with small molecular&#8208;additives presents a promising avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic performance. However, challenges arise in preserving the molecular&#8208;additives and maximizing their tuning effect, particularly at high current&#8208;densities. Herein, we develop an effective strategy to preserve the molecular&#8208;additives on electrode surface by applying a thin protective layer. Taking 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an example of a molecular&#8208;additive, the hydrophobic protection layer on top of the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu&#8208;catalyst effectively prevents its leaching during CO2 electroreduction (CO2R). Consequently, the confined DMAP molecules substantially promote the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion at low overpotentials. For instance, at a potential as low as &#8208;0.47 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu exhibits over 80% selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, while the pristine Cu shows only ~35% selectivity for multi&#8208;carbon products. Notably, ethanol appears as the primary product on DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu, with selectivity approaching 50% at a high current density of 400 mA cm&#8722;2. Detailed kinetic analysis, in&#8208;situ spectroscopies, and theoretical calculations indicate that DMAP&#8208;induced electron accumulations on surface Cu&#8208;sites decrease the reaction energy for C&#8208;C coupling. Additionally, the interactions between DMAP and oxygenated intermediates facilitate the ethanol formation pathway in CO2R. Overall, this study showcases an effective strategy to guide future endeavors involving molecular tuning effects.</dc:description>

Consequently, the confined DMAP molecules substantially promote the CO2-to-multicarbon conversion at low overpotentials. For instance, at a potential as low as -0.47 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the DMAP-functionalized Cu exhibits over 80% selectivity towards multi-carbon products, while the pristine Cu shows only ~35% selectivity for multi-carbon products. Notably, ethanol appears as the primary product on DMAP-functionalized Cu, with selectivity approaching 50% at a high current density of 400 mA cm&#8722;2. Detailed kinetic analysis, in-situ spectroscopies, and theoretical calculations indicate that DMAP-induced electron accumulations on surface Cu-sites decrease the reaction energy for C-C coupling.

         <title>Thermoelectric Performance in Triplet&#8722;Ground&#8722;State Polymer Intrinsically Boosted by Enhanced Proquinoidal Characteristic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer thermoelectric materials featuring flexibility, lightness, and bio&#8722;friendliness have been paid increasing attention for waste heat recovery and energy generation. The dominant approach to optimizing the thermoelectric performance of most organic materials is chemical doping, which, however, is not always ideal for practical applications due to its tendency to involve intricate processing procedure and trigger material and device instability. The pursuit of single&#8722;component neutral thermoelectric materials without exogenous doping presents a compelling alternative. In this work,&#160;we designed and synthesized a high&#8722;spin polymer material, PBBT&#8722;TT, by simultaneously employing&#160;thieno[3,4&#8722;b]thiophene&#160;(TbT) and benzo[1,2&#8722;c:4,5&#8722;c&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBT)&#160;units with pronounced proquinoidal characteristics, and its analogue, PBBT&#8722;T. Because of the enhanced quinoidal resonance, increased spin density, and strong intermolecular antiferromagnetic coupling, PBBT&#8722;TT exhibits high intrinsic electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, which&#160;showcases an outstanding power factor of 26.1 &#956;W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2&#160;without doping, surpassing&#160;other neutral organic conjugated polymer and radical conductors. Notably, PBBT&#8722;TT exhibits&#160;remarkable ambient stability, retaining its initial thermoelectric performance over a 120&#8722;day period.&#160;Our finding demonstrates&#160;that modulating the&#160;intermolecular&#160;spin interactions in&#160;open&#8208;shell polymers through the introduction of strong proquinoidal units is an effective strategy for&#160;the development of&#160;doping&#8722;free, intrinsically high&#8722;performance polymer thermoelectric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Carbamazepine Analogs for Non&#8208;Invasive Neuroinhibition In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable derivatives of the antiseizure drug carbamazepine have been developed to inhibit nerve signals locally and on&#8208;demand using light. Two compounds allow controlling hippocampal neuron firing and zebrafish larvae locomotion with light, and Carbadiazocine (right) also offers in vivo analgesic efficacy in a rat model of neuropathic pain and a simple and compelling treatment demonstration with non&#8208;invasive illumination.







Abstract
A problem of systemic pharmacotherapy is off&#8208;target activity, which causes adverse effects. Outstanding examples include neuroinhibitory medications like antiseizure drugs, which are used against epilepsy and neuropathic pain but cause systemic side effects. There is a need of drugs that inhibit nerve signals locally and on&#8208;demand without affecting other regions of the body. Photopharmacology aims to address this problem with light&#8208;activated drugs and localized illumination in the target organ. Here, we have developed photoswitchable derivatives of the widely prescribed antiseizure drug carbamazepine. For that purpose, we expanded our method of ortho azologization of tricyclic drugs to meta/para and to N&#8208;bridged diazocine. Our results validate the concept of ortho cryptoazologs (uniquely exemplified by Carbazopine&#8208;1) and bring to light Carbadiazocine (8), which can be photoswitched between 400&#8211;590&#8197;nm light (using violet LEDs and halogen lamps) and shows good drug&#8208;likeness and predicted safety. Both compounds display photoswitchable activity in vitro and in translucent zebrafish larvae. Carbadiazocine (8) also offers in vivo analgesic efficacy (mechanical and thermal stimuli) in a rat model of neuropathic pain and a simple and compelling treatment demonstration with non&#8208;invasive illumination.

         <title>Photocleavable Protecting Groups Using a Sulfite Self&#8208;Immolative Linker for High Uncaging Quantum Yield and Aqueous Solubility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using light as an external stimulus to control (bio)chemical processes offers many distinct advantages, most importantly it allows for the spatiotemporal control simply through operating the light source. Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are a cornerstone class of compounds that are used to achieve photocontrol over (bio)chemical processes. PPGs are able to release a payload of interest upon light irradiation. The successful application of PPGs hinges on their efficiency of payload release, captured in the uncaging Quantum Yield (QY). Heterolytic PPGs efficiently release low pKa payloads, but their efficiency drops significantly for payloads with higher pKa values, such as alcohols. For this reason, alcohols are usually attached to PPGs via a carbonate linker. The self&#8208;immolative nature of the carbonate linker results in concurrent release of CO2 with the alcohol payload upon irradiation. We introduce herein novel PPGs containing sulfites as self&#8208;immolative linkers for photocaged alcohol payloads, for which we discovered that the release of the alcohol proceeds with higher uncaging QY than an identical payload released from a carbonate&#8208;linked PPG. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncaging of the sulfite&#8208;linked PPGs results in the release of SO2 and show that the sulfite linker improves water solubility as compared to the carbonate based systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Aerodynamically Levitated Droplets as Small&#8208;Scale Chemical Reactors and Liquid Microprinters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplets of various solvents can levitate for days to weeks over the same or another liquid spread over the walls of a rotating vial. Individual or multiple droplets can be levitated, and can be used as &#8220;airware&#8221; reactors or as &#8220;wireless&#8221; chemical printers requiring no external connections to deliver into a reaction mixture fL volumes and pg quantities of reagents.







Abstract
A thin liquid film spread over the inner surface of a rapidly rotating vial creates an aerodynamic cushion on which one or multiple droplets of various liquids can levitate stably for days or even weeks. These levitating droplets can serve as wall&#8208;less (&#8220;airware&#8221;) chemical reactors that can be merged without touching&#8212;by remote impulses&#8212;to initiate reactions or sequences of reactions at scales down to hundreds of nanomoles. Moreover, under external electric fields, the droplets can act as the world's smallest chemical printers, shedding regular trains of pL or even fL microdrops. In one modality, the levitating droplets operate as completely wireless aliquoting/titrating systems delivering pg quantities of reagents into the liquid in the rotating vial; in another modality, they print microdroplet arrays onto target surfaces. The &#8220;airware&#8221;, levitated reactors are inexpensive to set up, remarkably stable to external disturbances and, for printing applications, require operating voltages much lower than in electrospray, electrowetting, or ink jet systems.

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Global Aromaticity of Aza&#8208;Superbenzene and Aza&#8208;Supernaphthalene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraazasuperbenzene (1) and a hexaazasupernaphthalene (2) were synthesized via a facile intermolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reaction. The neutral compounds show localized aromaticity and slow dynamics, but their charged dications, tetracations and hexacations show global aromaticity or anti&#8208;aromaticity with &#960; electrons mainly delocalized along the outmost skeletons.







Abstract
All&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or macrocycles usually display localized aromaticity. On the other hand, incorporation of quinoidal units into the skeleton could lead to effective electron delocalization and global (anti)aromaticity. In this work, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycle 1 and bismacrocycle 2 containing both para&#8208;quinodimethane and triphenylamine units are efficiently synthesized mainly through intermolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reaction. They can be considered as a tetraazasuperbenzene and a hexaazasupernaphthalene, respectively, due to their similar geometry and electronic structures to the benzene and naphthalene. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses reveal a largely planar geometry for both 1 and 2 and variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements disclose slow dynamic processes owing to restricted ring flipping of the phenyl rings. 1 and 2 can be easily oxidized into higher&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state species. NMR and theoretical calculations indicate that 12+ and 14+ show global anti&#8208;aromaticity and aromaticity, respectively, with a dominant 32&#960; and 30&#960; conjugation pathway, while for the bismacrocycle 2, its dication 22+, tetracation 24+ and hexacation 26+ exhibit global aromaticity, antiaromaticity, and aromaticity with a 54&#960;, 52&#960; and 50&#960; conjugation pathway along the outermost backbone, respectively.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Tetrahydroindole Skeletons by Rh&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Homopropargyl Enamides with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic rhodium(I)/axially chiral biaryl bisphosphine complex catalyzes the [2+2+2] cycloaddition of homopropargyl enamides with alkynes at room temperature to construct tetrahydroindole skeletons found in natural alkaloids and pharmaceuticals with high yields and regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. In this cycloaddition, the substituents of the enynes change the ratio of intramolecular and intermolecular rhodacycle formation when using terminal alkynes, varying the ee values of the cycloadducts.







Abstract
We have developed the Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of homopropargyl enamides (tosylamide&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes) with alkynes to construct tetrahydroindole skeletons found in natural alkaloids and pharmaceuticals. This cycloaddition proceeds at room temperature in high yields and regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with a broad substrate scope. The preparative scale reaction followed by substituent conversion on the nitrogen atom and the diastereoselective [4+2] cycloaddition with singlet O2 affords hexahydroindole&#8208;diols bearing three stereogenic centers and variable substituents on the nitrogen. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the substituents of the enynes change the ratio of intramolecular and intermolecular rhodacycle formation when using terminal alkynes, varying the ee values of the cycloadducts.

         <title>Polymer Free Volume&#8208;Controlled Molecular Clock and Emitter for Multicolored Transient Data Display in Advanced Photonic Cryptography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile molecular clock and emitter consisting of pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP and PTF1 has been developed via an &#8220;one stone (rigidity) two birds (clock and emitter)&#8221; strategy. Combining the synergistical responses of both pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP and PTF1 toward the rigidity change of polymer network enables transient data display along with dynamic multicolor fluorescence switching, providing great potential for innovative applications from data security to display.







Abstract
The booming demand on data security has aroused great interest for developing smart materials with temporal display feature and dynamic multicolor fluorescence. However, it remains challenging to implement both features on most responsive molecules. Herein, we construct a polymer free volume&#8208;controlled &#8220;molecular clock and emitter&#8221; via covalently embedding a multi&#8208;stimuli responsive molecular switch (i.e., spiropyran) into a polymer network (i.e., poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate)) with programmable crosslink density and free volume. By the aminolysis of pentafluorophenyl ester with different amount of diamine crosslinkers, pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP networks with controllable crosslink densities are generated, which have different confinement effects on the rate constant of SP/MC isomerization, thus leading to time&#8208;dependent photochromism. In addition, PTF1, a fluorescent probe that is sensitive to polymer rigidity, is introduced to further endow pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP system with phototunable dynamic full&#8208;color emission. Therefore, relying on their synergistical responses to the rigidity of the polymer network, we have successfully developed a versatile molecular clock and emitter via an &#8220;one stone two birds&#8221; manner, which shows time&#8208;dependent data display along with dynamic multicolor fluorescence switching, providing great potential for advanced encryption and anticounterfeiting with a high security level.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Cross&#8208;Electrophile C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling via a NiII Aryl Amido Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective and scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical Cross&#8208;Electrophile (XEC) reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and primary and secondary alkyl halides was achieved via an in situ generated NiII aryl amido intermediate. The NiII aryl amido intermediate stabilizes the NiII&#8211;aryl species to prevent the aryl&#8211;aryl homo&#8208;coupling side reactions and acts as a catalyst to activate the alkyl bromide substrates.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) between aryl halides and alkyl halides is a streamlined approach for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond construction, which is highly valuable in medicinal chemistry. Based on a key NiII aryl amido intermediate, we developed a highly selective and scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical XEC reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and primary and secondary alkyl halides. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that an amine secondary ligand slows down the oxidative addition process of the Ni&#8208;polypyridine catalyst to the aryl bromide and a NiII aryl amido intermediate is formed in situ during the reaction process. The relatively slow oxidative addition is beneficial for enhancing the selectivity of the XEC reaction. The NiII aryl amido intermediate stabilizes the NiII&#8211;aryl species to prevent the aryl&#8211;aryl homo&#8208;coupling side reactions and acts as a catalyst to activate the alkyl bromide substrates. This electrosynthesis system provides a facile, practical, and scalable platform for the formation of (hetero)aryl&#8211;alkyl bonds using standard Ni catalysts under mild conditions. The mechanistic insights from this work could serve as a great foundation for future studies on Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Carbon Superstructure&#8208;Supported Half&#8208;Metallic V2O3 Nanospheres for High&#8208;Efficiency Photorechargeable Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;metallic V2O3 was firstly reported as a dual&#8208;functional photocathode for PZlBs. The half&#8208;metallic V2O3, combined with the three&#8208;dimensional superstructure assembled by carbon nanosheets, established rapid charge transfer networks and robust framework. Consequently, the V2O3@CSs photo cathode delivered record zinc ion storage and photo rechargeable properties. This study offered a promising direction for the capture and storage of solar energy.







Abstract
Photorechargeable zinc ion batteries (PZIBs), which can directly harvest and store solar energy, are promising technologies for the development of a renewable energy society. However, the incompatibility requirement between narrow band gap and wide coverage has raised severe challenges for high&#8208;efficiency dual&#8208;functional photocathodes. Herein, half&#8208;metallic vanadium (III) oxide (V2O3) was first reported as a dual&#8208;functional photocathode for PZIBs. Theoretical and experimental results revealed its unique photoelectrical and zinc ion storage properties for capturing and storing solar energy. To this end, a synergistic protective etching strategy was developed to construct carbon superstructure&#8208;supported V2O3 nanospheres (V2O3@CSs). The half&#8208;metallic characteristics of V2O3, combined with the three&#8208;dimensional superstructure assembled by ultrathin carbon nanosheets, established rapid charge transfer networks and robust framework for efficient and stable solar&#8208;energy storage. Consequently, the V2O3@CSs photocathode delivered record zinc ion storage properties, including a photo&#8208;assisted discharge capacities of 463&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 3000&#8197;cycles. Notably, the PZIBs assembled using V2O3@CSs photocathodes could be photorecharged without an external circuit, exhibiting a high photo conversion efficiency (0.354&#8201;%) and photorecharge voltage (1.0&#8197;V). This study offered a promising direction for the direct capture and storage of solar energy.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Hydrated Eutectic Electrolytes with Diverse Solvation Configurations for All&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of entropy&#8208;driven hydrated eutectic electrolytes (HEE) with abundant solvation configurations are proposed for all&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The diverse and uniform solvation structures distribution enables the HEE possess much higher solvation configurational entropy than conventional aqueous electrolytes, leading to its superior anti&#8208;freezing ability and high thermal stability.







Abstract
Batteries always encounter uncontrollable failure or performance decay under extreme temperature environments, which is largely limited by the properties of electrolytes. Herein, an entropy&#8208;driven hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) with diverse solvation configurations is proposed to expand the operating temperature range of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The HEE possesses over 40 types of Zn2+ solvation structure with uniform distribution, contributing to its much higher solvation configurational entropy compared to the conventional aqueous counterpart (only 6 types). These effectively promote its anti&#8208;freezing ability under ultralow temperatures, with a high ionic conductivity of 0.42&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even at a low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the entropy&#8208;driven property can simultaneously enhance the thermal stability under a high temperature over +140&#8201;&#176;C. Therefore, the HEE can enable full cells stably working over a wide temperature range of &#8722;40~+80&#8201;&#176;C, performing over 1500 cycles with 100&#8201;% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and 1000 cycles with ~72&#8201;% capacity retention at +80&#8201;&#176;C. This inspiring concept of entropy&#8208;driven electrolyte with quantized solvation configurational entropy value has charming potential for designing future special batteries with excellent adaptability towards extreme temperature environments.

         <title>Ln3+ Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence of Chiral Heterometallic Clusters Ln2Ag28</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 0D chiralclusters L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln=Eu/Gd) and 2D chiral cluster&#8208;based frameworks L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D (Ln=Gd) with TADF induced by the coordination of Ln3+ ions were prepared. In the absence of energy transfer between Ln3+ and Ag(I) hetero&#8208;metals, while maintaining &#916;E(S1&#8211;T1) small enough, it can significantly increase k(S1&#8594;S0) and reduce TADF decay time by adjusting the type or number of Ln3+ ions.







Abstract
A series of TADF&#8208;active compounds: 0D chiral Ln&#8722;Ag(I) clusters L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln=Eu/Gd) and 2D chiral Ln&#8722;Ag(I) cluster&#8208;based frameworks L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D (Ln=Gd) has been synthesized. Atomic&#8208;level structural analysis showed that the chiral Ag(I) cluster units {Ag14S12} in L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D and L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D exhibited similar configurations, linked by varying numbers of [Ln(H2O)x]3+ (x=6 for 0D, x=3 for 2D) to form the final target compounds. Temperature&#8208;dependent emission spectra and decay lifetimes measurement demonstrated the presence of TADF in L&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln=Eu/Gd) and L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;2D. Experimentally, the remarkable TADF properties primarily originated from {Ag14S12} moieties in these compounds. Notably, {Ag14S12} in L&#8208;Eu2Ag28&#8208;0D and L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;2D displayed higher promote fluorescence rate and shorter TADF decay times than L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;0D. Combined with theoretical calculations, it was determined that the TADF behaviors of {Ag14S12} cluster units were induced by 4&#8201;f perturbation of Ln3+ ions. Specially, while maintaining &#916;E(S1&#8211;T1) small enough, it can significantly increase k(S1&#8594;S0) and reduce TADF decay time by adjusting the type or number of Ln3+ ions, thus achieving the purpose of improving TADF for cluster&#8208;based luminescent materials.

&lt;b&gt;Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-0D&lt;/b&gt; (Ln=Eu/Gd) and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-2D&lt;/b&gt;. Experimentally, the remarkable TADF properties primarily originated from {Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} moieties in these compounds. Notably, {Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} in &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-0D&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-2D&lt;/b&gt; displayed higher promote fluorescence rate and shorter TADF decay times than &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;-0D&lt;/b&gt;. Combined with theoretical calculations, it was determined that the TADF behaviors of {Ag&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} cluster units were induced by 4&#8201;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; perturbation of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Specially, while maintaining &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) small enough, it can significantly increase &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and reduce TADF decay time by adjusting the type or number of Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, thus achieving the purpose of improving TADF for cluster-based luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking Boundaries: Giant Ultraviolet Birefringence in Dimension&#8208;Reduced Zn&#8208;Based Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using the dimension&#8208;reduction strategy, &#960;&#8208;conjugated p&#8208;C5H5NO (4HP) was introduced into three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ZnCl2, resulting in the design of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) [(4HP)2ZnCl2], with birefringence reaching 160&#8197;times the original value (0.482@546&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Birefringent crystals have essential applications in optical communication areas. Low&#8208;dimensional structures with inherited structural anisotropy are potential systems for investigating birefringent materials with large birefringence. In this work, the zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) [(p&#8208;C5H5NO)2ZnCl2] (1) and [p&#8208;C5H6NO]2[ZnCl4] (2) were obtained by introducing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated p&#8208;C5H5NO (4HP) into the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ZnCl2. Remarkably, 1 exhibits a giant birefringence of 0.482@546&#8197;nm, which is the largest among Zn&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) compounds and 160&#8197;times that of ZnCl2. According to structural and theoretical calculation analyses, the large optical polarizability, high spatial density, ideal distribution of the [(4HP)2ZnCl2]0 cluster, and the low dimension of 1 result in the dramatically increased birefringence compared to ZnCl2. This work will provide a valid route for accelerating the design and synthesis of compounds with excellent birefringence in low&#8208;dimensional systems.

         <title>Asynchronous Ring Opening of Cyclic Carbonate and Glycidyl Ether Induced Phase Evolution Towards Heat&#8208;Free and Rapid&#8208;Bonding Superior Epoxy Adhesive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly&#8208;branched polyurethane capped by cyclic carbonate was reported to perform asynchronous crosslinking with epoxy. The distinctive ring opening kinetics between the cyclic carbonate and epoxide groups, combined with a moderate branching degree, result in unique phase evolution. This process effectively toughens the adhesive and rapidly increases shear strength at room temperature to a level suitable for structural bonding.







Abstract
Structural adhesives that do not require heating are in high demand in the automotive and electronics industries. However, it remains a challenge to develop robust adhesives that rapidly achieve super adhesion near ambient temperature. Herein, a room&#8208;temperature curable, fast&#8208;bonding, and super strong epoxy&#8208;based structural adhesive was designed from the perspective of cross&#8208;scale structure, which lies in threefold pivotal aspects: (i) high branching topology of glycerol carbonate&#8208;capped polyurethane (PUGC) increases the kinetics of the ring&#8208;opening reaction, contributing to fast crosslinking and the formation of abundant urethane and hydroxyl moieties; (ii) asynchronous crosslinking of epoxy and PUGC synergistically induces phase separation of PUGC within the epoxy resin and the resulting PUGC domains surrounded by interpenetrated shell serves to efficiently toughen the matrix; (iii) abundant dynamic hydrogen bonds including urethane and hydroxyl moieties, along with the elastomeric PUGC domains, dissipate energy of shearing force. As a result, the adhesive strength rapidly grows to 16&#8197;MPa within 4&#8197;hours, leveling off to 21&#8197;MPa after 7&#8197;hours, substantially outperforming commercial room&#8208;temperature curable epoxy adhesives. The results of this study could advance the field of high&#8208;performance adhesives and provide valuable insights into designing materials for efficient curing at room temperature.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction Photocatalysts: A Nanohouse Design Improves Photocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanohouse&#8208;like S&#8208;scheme heterjunction photocatalyst is designed via a nanoarchitectonics strategy, exhibiting high photocatalytic nitrite reduction performance with an ammonia production rate of 2454.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 8.02&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm in pure water.







Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) is a promising route for environment remediation and sustainable ammonia synthesis. To design efficient photocatalysts, the recently emerged nanoarchitectonics approach holds great promise. Here, we report a nanohouse&#8208;like S&#8208;scheme heterjunction photocatalyst with high photocatalytic NitRR performance. The nano&#8208;house has a floor of plate&#8208;like metal organic framework&#8208;based photocatalyst (NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125), on which another photocatalyst Co(OH)2 nanosheet is grown while ZIF&#8208;8 hollow cages are also constructed as the surrounding wall/roof. Experimental and simulation results indicate that the positively charged, highly porous and hydrophobic ZIF&#8208;8 wall can modulate the environment in the nanohouse by (i) NO3&#8722; enrichment/NH4+ discharge and (ii) suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. In combination with the enhanced electron&#8208;hole separation and strong redox capability in the NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125@Co(OH)2 S&#8208;scheme heterjunction confined in the nano&#8208;house, the designed photocatalyst delivers an ammonia yield of 2454.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 8.02&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm in pure water. Our work provides new insights into the design principles of advanced photocatalytic NitRR photocatalyst.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Totally Renewable Liquid Crystal Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Programmability and Reconfigurable Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene&#8208;based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN) is reported. The Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN can be programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv&#8208;LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv&#8208;LCNs are still limited to heat&#8208;assisted programming and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene&#8208;based DCv&#8208;LCN with room&#8208;temperature programmability and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene&#8208;containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water&#8208;activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv&#8208;LCN can be simply programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv&#8208;LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid&#8208;solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv&#8208;LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.

&lt;p&gt;A polymer-to-monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene-based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo-DCv-LCN) is reported. The Azo-DCv-LCN can be programmed, upon water-soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light-driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo-DCv-LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed-loop polymer-monomers-polymer recycling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv-LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv-LCNs are still limited to heat-assisted programming and polymer-to-polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene-based DCv-LCN with room-temperature programmability and polymer-to-monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene-containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water-activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv-LCN can be simply programmed, upon water-soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light-driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv-LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid-solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv-LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed-loop polymer-monomers-polymer recycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Paired Electrolysis Enables Reductive Heck Coupling of Unactivated (Hetero)Aryl Halides and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of aryl radicals generated at a carbon cathode from (hetero)aryl halides and protons generated at a carbon anode from H&#252;nig's base enables the efficient anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroarylation of olefins via a paired electrolysis pathway.







Abstract
The formation of carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Among various methods to construct Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bonds, the reductive Heck reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and alkenes stands out due to its potential efficiency and broad substrate availability. However, traditional reductive Heck reactions are limited by the use of precious metal catalysts and/or limited aryl halide and alkene compatibility. Here, we present an electrochemically mediated, metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free reductive Heck reaction that tolerates both unactivated (hetero)aryl halides and diverse alkenes such as vinyl boronates and silanes. Detailed electrochemical and deuterium&#8208;labeling studies support that this transformation likely proceeds through a paired electrolysis pathway, in which acid generated by the oxidation of N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) at the anode intercepts an alkyl carbanion formed after radical&#8208;polar crossover at the cathode. As such, this approach offers a sustainable method for the construction of Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bonds from (hetero)aryl halides and alkenes, paving the way for the development of other electrochemically mediated olefin difunctionalization reactions.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Accelerated Growth of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Layer&#8208;Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we devised a novel approach termed &#8220;key&#8208;cylinder lock mimic&#8221; to fabricate seven staggered stacking Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs). This method leverages ionic liquids as both solvents and mediators, operating under mild conditions. Through meticulous selection, ionic liquids possessing appropriate molecular volumes and symmetric bipolar functional groups were identified as pivotal elements in manifesting the confined interlocking effect and steric hindrance essential for the synthesis of staggered stacking COFs.







Abstract
Layer&#8208;stacking behaviors are crucial for two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) to define their pore structure, physicochemical properties, and functional output. So far, fine control over the stacking mode without complex procedures remains a grand challenge. Herein, we proposed a &#8220;key&#8208;cylinder lock mimic&#8221; strategy to synthesize 2D COFs with a tunable layer&#8208;stacking mode by taking advantage of ionic liquids (ILs). The staggered (AB) stacking (unlocked) COFs were exclusively obtained by incorporating ILs of symmetric polarity and matching molecular size; otherwise, commonly reported eclipsed (AA) stacking (locked) COFs were observed instead. Mechanistic study revealed that AB stacking was induced by a confined interlocking effect (CIE) brought by anions and bulky cations of the ILs inside pores (&#8220;key&#8221; and &#8220;cylinder&#8221;, respectively). Excitingly, this strategy can speed up production rate of crystalline powders (e.g., COF&#8208;TAPT&#8208;Tf@BmimTf2N in merely 30 minutes) under mild reaction conditions. This work highlights the enabling role of ILs to tailor the layer stacking of 2D COFs and promotes further exploration of their stacking mode&#8208;dependant applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Activation and Stereospecific Functionalization of Bis(boronic Esters) Derived from 2&#8208;Alkenes: Construction of Propionates and Other 1,2&#8208;Difunctional Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective catalytic difunctionalization of alkenes can be accomplished by a strategy involving alkene diboration followed by site&#8208;selective activation and copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling of the less&#8208;hindered boronic ester. This process allows a broad array of difunctional chiral products to be produced from simple olefin starting materials.







Abstract
Non&#8208;directed regioselective activation of bis(boronic esters), followed by functionalization, is reported. A bulky activator is shown to selectively activate the less hindered boronic ester enabling it to undergo stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling to a variety of electrophiles. This steric&#8208;based regioselectivity provides a simple and efficient method to prepare highly functionalized, enantiomerically enriched products starting from simple alkenes.

         <title>Highly Stable Perovskite Oxides for Electrocatalytic Acidic NOx&#8722; Reduction Streamlining Ammonia Synthesis from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The continuous production of NH3 is achieved from air and water by coupling the plasma system and MEA electrolyzer. The catalyst's unique acid&#8208;operability streamlines downstream ammonia utilization for direct ammonium salt production and upstream integration with NOx sources.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen oxide ions reduction reaction (NOx&#8722;RR) shows great opportunity for ammonia production under ambient conditions. Yet, performing NOx&#8722;RR in strong acidic conditions remains challenging due to the corrosion effect on the catalyst and competing hydrogen evolution reactions. Here, we demonstrate a stable La1.5Sr0.5Ni0.5Fe0.5O4 perovskite oxide for the NOx&#8722;RR at pH&#8197;0, achieving a Faradaic efficiency for ammonia of approaching 100&#8201;% at a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a H&#8208;type cell. At industrially relevant current density, the NOx&#8722;RR system shows stable cell voltage and Faradaic efficiency for &gt;350&#8197;h in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at pH&#8197;0. By integrating the catalyst in a stacked MEA with a series connection, we have successfully obtained a record&#8208;breaking 2.578&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 NH3 production rate at 20&#8197;A. This catalyst&#8216;s unique acid&#8208;operability streamlines downstream ammonia utilization for direct ammonium salt production and upstream integration with NOx sources. Techno&#8208;economic and lifecycle assessments reveal substantial economic advantages for this ammonia production strategy, even when coupled with a plasma&#8208;based NOx production system, presenting a sustainable complement to the conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch process.

Wet spinning methods are used to 3D&#8208;print gel patterns based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs), with the chemical structure of the LMWG and its ability to generate AuNPs programming the conductivity of the printed pattern.







Abstract
We report the use of wet&#8208;spinning to 3D&#8208;print gels from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs) based on the 1,3&#8201;:&#8201;2,4&#8208;dibenzylidenesorbitol (DBS) scaffold. Gel stripes assembled from DBS&#8208;CONHNH2 and DBS&#8208;COOH are printed, and their conductivities assessed. Printed gels based on DBS&#8208;CONHNH2 can be loaded with Au(III), which is reduced in situ to form embedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The conductivity of these gels increases because of electron transport mediated by the AuNPs, whereas the conductivity of DBS&#8208;COOH, which does not promote AuNP formation, remains lower. We then fabricate multi&#8208;component gel patterns comprised of spatially well&#8208;defined domains of printed DBS&#8208;CONHNH2/AuNP (higher conductivity) and DBS&#8208;COOH (lower conductivity) resulting in soft multi&#8208;domain materials with differential conductivity. Such materials have future prospects in applications such as soft nanoelectronics or tissue engineering.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Rich Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Ce Sites in CeO2 Supported Patchy Atomic&#8208;Layer Pt Enable a Non&#8208;CO Pathway for Efficient Methanol Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
The selective coupling of *CHO and *OH is induced by forming abundant super adjacent *OH intermediates and maximizing edge Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Ce active sites, thereby facilitating a non&#8208;CO pathway. This approach effectively circumvents the generation of *CO intermediates.







Abstract
Rational design of efficient methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) catalyst that undergo non&#8208;CO pathway is essential to resolve the long&#8208;standing poisoning issue. However, it remains a huge challenge due to the rather difficulty in maximizing the non&#8208;CO pathway by the selective coupling between the key *CHO and *OH intermediates. Here, we report a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst of patchy atomic&#8208;layer Pt epitaxial growth on CeO2 nanocube (Pt ALs/CeO2) with maximum electronic metal&#8208;support interaction for enhancing the coupling selectively. The small&#8208;size monolayer material achieves an optimal geometrical distance between edge Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Ce sites and *OH absorbed on CeO2, which well restrains the dehydrogenation of *CHO, resulting in the non&#8208;CO pathway. Meanwhile, the *CHO/*CO intermediate generated at inner Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Ce sites can migrate to edge, inducing the subsequent coupling reaction, thus avoiding poisoning while promoting reaction efficiency. Consequently, Pt ALs/CeO2 exhibits exceptionally catalytic stability with negligible degradation even under 1000&#8197;s pure CO poisoning operation and high mass activity (14.87&#8197;A/mgPt), enabling it one of the best&#8208;performing alkali&#8208;stable MOR catalysts.
