         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrophosphination&#160;of a&#8208;Bromoenals to Prepare Phosphine&#8208;Containing Chiral Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disclosed herein is the first carbene&#8208;organocatalyzed asymmetric addition of phosphine nucleophiles to the in situ generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azolium intermediates. Our reaction enantioselectively constructs carbon&#8208;phosphine bonds and prepares chiral phosphines  with high optical purities. The phosphine products are suitable for transforming to chiral ligands or catalysts with applications in asymmetric catalysis. The diarylalkyl or trialkyl phosphine products from our catalytic reactions, air&#8208;sensitive and reactive in nature, can be trapped (and stored) in their sulfur&#8208;oxidized form for operational simplicities.</dc:description>

         <title>Fire&#8208;retardant, stable&#8208;cycling and high&#8208;safety sodium ion battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The safety of energy storage equipment has always been a stumbling block to the development of battery, and sodium ion battery is no exception. However, as an ultimate solution, the use of non&#8208;flammable electrolyte is susceptible to the side effects, and its poor compatibility with electrode, causing failure of batteries. Here, we report a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte design to achieve high&#8208;performance sodium ion battery, which resolves the dilemma via regulating the solvation structure of electrolyte by hydrogen bonds and optimizing the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. The reported non&#8208;flammable electrolyte allows stable charge&#8208;discharge cycling of both sodium vanadium phosphate@hard carbon and Prussian blue@hard carbon full pouch cell for more than 120 cycles with a capacity retention of &gt; 85% and high cycling Coulombic efficiency (99.7%).</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;ion intercalation and high volumetric capacitance in a two&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;porous coordination polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intercalation is a promising ion sorption mechanism for enhancing the energy density of electrochemical capacitors (ECs) because it offers enhanced access to electrochemical surface area. It requires rapid transport of ions in and out of a host material and it must occur without phase transformation. Materials that fulfil these requirements are rare; those that do, intercalate almost exclusively cations. Herein, we show that Ni  3  (benzenehexathiol) (Ni  3  BHT), a non&#8208;porous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered coordination polymer (CP), intercalates both cations and anions with a variety of charges. Whereas cation intercalation is pseudocapacitive, anions intercalate in a purely capacitive fashion. The excellent EC performance of Ni  3  BHT provides a general basis for investigating similar dual&#8208;ion intercalation mechanisms in the large family of non&#8208;porous 2D CPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of C&#8208;C Axial Chirality via Asymmetric Carbene Insertion into Arene C&#8208;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By using diazonaphthoquinones and anilines as key reagents and through a point&#8208;to&#8208;axis chiral transfer strategy, the atroposelective synthesis via asymmetric C(sp  2  )&#8208;H bond insertion reaction of arenes has been realized under rhodium catalysis, providing the resulting biaryl atropisomers in moderate to excellent yields with good enantiomeric ratios (up to 99:1). Further elaboration indicates this type of axially biaryl scaffold may have promising potentials in developing novel chiral ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated S&#8208;adenosylmethionine as a reagent for enzyme&#8208;catalyzed fluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategic replacement of protons with fluorine atoms or functional groups with fluorine&#8208;containing fragments has proven a powerful strategy to optimize the activity of therapeutic compounds. For this reason, the synthetic chemistry of organofluorides has been the subject of intense development and innovation for many years. By comparison, the literature on fluorine biocatalysis still makes for a slim chapter. In this report we introduce&#160;S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;methionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferases as a new tool for the&#160;production of fluorinated compounds. We demonstrate the ability of halide methyltransferases to form fluorinated SAM (S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;L&#8208;homocysteine) from&#160;S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) is too unstable for isolation, but is accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific methyltransferases for enzyme&#8208;catalyzed fluoromethylation of&#160;small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;component Reaction to 1,4,2&#8208;Diazaborole&#8208;type Heteroarene Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The borane FmesBH  2  reacts in a three&#8208;component reaction with an isonitrile and a small series of organonitriles to give rare examples of the class of dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivatives. In a related way, annulated BN&#8208;indolizine derivatives became conveniently available, as were dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;oxaza&#8208; or thiazaborole derivatives. The nucleophilic framework of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole example allowed for an uncatalyzed acylation reaction. It also served as a 1,3&#8208;dipolar reagent and underwent a [3+2] cycloaddition/[4+2] cycloreversion sequence when treated with methyl propiolate to give the respective pyrrole product. The [3+2] cycloaddition product of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivative with N&#8208;phenylmaleimide was isolated and its heterobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derived structure characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>By using suitable synthetic procedures, we have first isolated the square&#8208;planar organosilver(III) compounds [PPh  4  ][  trans  &#8208;(CF  3  )  2  AgX  2  ] [X&#160;= Cl (  1a  ), Br (  2a  )]. The geometry and stereochemistry of the chloro&#8208;derivative  1a  have been unambiguously established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) methods. Following our calculations on the relative stability of the  cis  &#8208;/  trans  &#8208;[(CF  3  )  2  AgX  2  ]  &#8722;  couples (X&#160;= F, Cl, Br, I), the experimentally obtained compounds  1a  and  2a  appear to be kinetically favoured stereoisomers. They display some tendency to associate an additional X  &#8722;  ligand affording rare five&#8208;coordinate Ag(III) species [(CF  3  )  2  AgX  3  ]  2&#8722;  . Interestingly, compound [PPh  4  ]  2  [(CF  3  )  2  AgBr  3  ] (  3  ) has been identified by SC&#8208;XRD methods as the first Ag(III) derivative with trigonal symmetry in general and trigonal bipyramidal geometry in particular. It is also identified as the first five&#8208;coordinate species with inverted ligand field.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiphase Microreactors Based on Liquid&#8211;Liquid and Gas&#8211;Liquid Dispersions Stabilized by Colloidal Catalytic Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes recent progress in liquid&#8211;liquid and gas&#8211;liquid dispersions stabilized by solid surface&#8208;active colloidal particles (emulsions, foams, bubbles, marbles, bijels) as microreactors. These new systems constitute original platforms for reengineering multiphase reactors towards a higher degree of sustainability.







Abstract
Pickering emulsions, foams, bubbles, and marbles are dispersions of two immiscible liquids or of a liquid and a gas stabilized by surface&#8208;active colloidal particles. These systems can be used for engineering liquid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid microreactors for multiphase reactions. They constitute original platforms for reengineering multiphase reactors towards a higher degree of sustainability. This Review provides a systematic overview on the recent progress of liquid&#8211;liquid and gas&#8211;liquid dispersions stabilized by solid particles as microreactors for engineering eco&#8208;efficient reactions, with emphasis on biobased reagents. Physicochemical driving parameters, challenges, and strategies to (de)stabilize dispersions for product recovery/catalyst recycling are discussed. Advanced concepts such as cascade and continuous flow reactions, compartmentalization of incompatible reagents, and multiscale computational methods for accelerating particle discovery are also addressed.

         <title>Functional Porphyrinic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a New Class of Heterogeneous Halogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Donor Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with an artificial halogen&#8208;bonding pocket can serve as an efficient heterogeneous halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donor catalyst for the Diels&#8211;Alder reactions under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Biomimetic metal&#8208;organic frameworks have attracted great attention as they can be used as bio&#8208;inspired models, allowing us to gain important insights into how large biological molecules function as catalysts. In this work, we report the synthesis and utilization of such a metal&#8208;metalloporphyrin framework (MMPF) that is constructed from a custom&#8208;designed ligand as an efficient halogen bond donor catalyst for Diels&#8211;Alder reactions under ambient conditions. The implementation of fabricated halogen bonding capsule as binding pocket with high&#8208;density C&#8722;Br bonds enabled the use of halogen bonding to facilitate organic transformations in their three&#8208;dimensional cavities. Through combined experimental and computational studies, we showed that the substrate molecules diffuse through the pores of the MMPF, establishing a host&#8208;guest system via the C&#8722;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. The formation of halogen bonds is a plausible explanation for the observed boosted catalytic efficiency in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. Moreover, the unique capability of MMPF highlights new opportunities in using artificial non&#8208;covalent binding pockets as highly tunable and selective catalytic materials.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control over Chemical Assembly in Living Cells by Integration of Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrolysis and Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The idea of using a molecular brake in materials science to precisely control the formation of assemblies in living cells is introduced. A tyrosine protection strategy enables the enzymatic cleavage site to be unmasked selectively by hydrolysis in the acidic environment of the lysosome. Cleavage of the P&#8722;N bond releases phosphotyrosine and enables enzyme&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly inside living cells spatiotemporally.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal control of chemical assembly in living cells remains challenging. We have now developed an efficient and general platform to precisely control the formation of assemblies in living cells. We introduced an O&#8208;[bis(dimethylamino)phosphono]tyrosine protection strategy in the self&#8208;assembly motif as the Trojan horse, whereby the programmed precursors resist hydrolysis by phosphatases on and inside cells because the unmasking of the enzymatic cleavage site occurs selectively in the acidic environment of lysosomes. After demonstrating the multistage self&#8208;assembly processes in&#8197;vitro by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS), cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM), and circular dichroism (CD), we investigated the formation of site&#8208;specific self&#8208;assembly in living cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), LC&#8208;MS, and biological electron microscopy (Bio&#8208;EM). Controlling chemical assembly in living systems spatiotemporally may have applications in supramolecular chemistry, materials science, synthetic biology, and chemical biology.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Fungal Drimane&#8208;Type Sesquiterpene Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is the complete elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpene esters from Aspergillus calidoustus, including the first identified fungal drimenol cyclase. The cluster&#8208;associated acyltransferase is then employed to transfer different lengths of ACP&#8208;activated polyketides, but also very diverse CoA&#8208;esters.







Abstract
Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes exhibit various biological activities and are widely present in eukaryotes. Here, we completely elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of the drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpene esters isolated from Aspergillus calidoustus and we discovered that it involves a drimenol cyclase having the same catalytic function previously only reported in plants. Moreover, since many fungal drimenol derivatives possess a &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone ring, we clarified the functions of the cluster&#8208;associated cytochrome P450 and FAD&#8208;binding oxidoreductase discovering that these two enzymes are solely responsible for the formation of those structures. Furthermore, swapping of the enoyl reductase domain in the identified polyketide synthase led to the production of metabolites containing various polyketide chains with different levels of saturation. These findings have deepened our understanding of how fungi synthesize drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes and the corresponding esters.

         <title>Unraveling Hydrocarbon Pool Boosted Propane Aromatization on Gallium/ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite by Solid&#8208;State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrocarbon pool process is revealed in propane aromatization over Ga/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Cyclopentenyl cations are observed and determined as active intermediates in propane conversion by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The formation of cyclopentenyl cations initiates autocatalysis of propane to aromatics in the induction period. The aromatization process is promoted by hydride transfer between propane and cyclopentenyl cations.







Abstract
Propane aromatization on metal&#8208;modified zeolites provides a promising route to produce valuable chemicals such as benzene, toluene and xylene via non&#8208;petroleum feedstocks. The mechanistic understanding of propane conversion to aromatics is still challenging due to the complexity of the aromatization process. Herein, by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and GC&#8208;MS, it is shown that cyclopentenyl cations are formed as active intermediates during propane aromatization on Ga/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Autocatalysis of propane to aromatics is identified in the induction period. The cyclopentenyl cations serve as key hydrocarbon pool species to co&#8208;catalyze propane conversion and promote aromatics formation, revealing a dominant hydrocarbon pool process in propane aromatization.

         <title>Identifying Reactive Sites and Surface Traps in Chalcopyrite Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroelectrochemical and computational methods are combined to shed light on the promising reactivity of semiconductor chalcopyrites towards hydrogen production via photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. A direct correlation between the PEC response and the chemical nature of the catalytic interface is presented, providing guidelines for engineering the performance of chalcopyrites.







Abstract
Gathering information on the atomic nature of reactive sites and trap states is key to fine tuning catalysis and suppressing deleterious surface voltage losses in photoelectrochemical technologies. Here, spectroelectrochemical and computational methods were combined to investigate a model photocathode from the promising chalcopyrite family: CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2. We found that voltage losses are linked to traps induced by surface Ga and In vacancies, whereas operando Raman spectroscopy revealed that catalysis occurred at Ga, In, and S sites. This study allows establishing a bridge between the chalcopyrite's performance and its surface's chemistry, where avoiding formation of Ga and In vacancies is crucial for achieving high activity.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,2&#8208;Difluorotetrahydrofurans through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal [3+2] cycloaddition of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and vinyl epoxides or vinylethylene carbonates was achieved with a broad substrate scope, low catalyst loading, good yields, and excellent enantioselectivities. The enantioenriched 2,2&#8208;difluorinated tetrahydrofurans were transformed to novel gem&#8208;difluorinated heterocyclic compounds.







Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of 2,2&#8208;difluorinated tetrahydrofurans was accomplished via enantioselective formal [3+2] cycloaddition catalyzed by palladium. The asymmetric reaction between gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and racemic vinyl epoxides or vinylethylene carbonates resulted in the formation of enantioenriched 2,2&#8208;difluorotetrahydrofurans with an enantioselectivity up to 98&#8201;%. Notably, the reaction used the readily available (R)&#8208;BINAP as the ligand at a low loading and yielded a wide variety of difluorinated products in moderate to high yields. Both chiral diastereomers could be obtained in a single sequence.

         <title>Indium&#8208;Catalysed Transfer Hydrogenation for the Reductive Cyclisation of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Enones towards Trisubstituted Furans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
InBr3 is used as functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant catalyst for the transfer hydrogenation from &#947;&#8208;terpinene as H2 surrogate to initiate the cyclisation of 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;substituted enones to trisubstituted furans in good yields. Design of Experiments was used to optimise the reaction conditions with a few experiments to almost quantitative yields and deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments gave valuable mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Indium tribromide catalysed the transfer hydrogenation from dihydroaromatic compounds, such as the commercially available &#947;&#8208;terpinene, to enones, which resulted in the cyclisation to trisubstituted furan derivatives. The reaction was initiated by a Michael addition of a hydride nucleophile to the enone subunit followed by a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted cyclisation and the formation of a furan&#8211;indium intermediate and a Wheland intermediate derived from the dihydroaromatic starting material. The product was formed by protonation from the Wheland complex and replaced the indium tribromide substituent. In addition, a site&#8208;specific deuterium labelling of the dihydroaromatic HD surrogates resulted in site specific labelling of the products and gave useful insights into the reaction mechanism by H&#8211;D scrambling.

         <title>What Makes High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Exceptional Electrocatalysts?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloys offer a huge variety of multielement active sites on a single catalytic surface. This special polyelemental arrangement implies several different fundamental concepts in structure&#8211;activity correlations compared to traditional electrocatalysts, which are summarised and their implications for the possibility to adjust the catalytic properties with different limitations is discussed in detail.







Abstract
The formation of a vast number of different multielement active sites in compositionally complex solid solution materials, often more generally termed high&#8208;entropy alloys, offers new and unique concepts in catalyst design, which mitigate existing limitations and change the view on structure&#8211;activity relations. We discuss these concepts by summarising the currently existing fundamental knowledge and critically assess the chances and limitations of this material class, also highlighting design strategies. A roadmap is proposed, illustrating which of the characteristic concepts could be exploited using which strategy, and which breakthroughs might be possible to guide future research in this highly promising material class for (electro)catalysis.

         <title>A Solvent&#8208;Polarity&#8208;Induced Interface Self&#8208;Assembly Strategy towards Mesoporous Triazine&#8208;Based Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;polarity&#8208;induced interface self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed for the synthesis of mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials. It exhibits precise, tunable pore sizes and pore structures. CO2 molecules can be adsorbed well as a result of the suitable pore sizes and the triazine unit.







Abstract
Triazine&#8208;based materials with porous structure have recently received numerous attentions as a fascinating new class because of their superior potential for various applications. However, it is still a formidable challenge to obtain triazine&#8208;based materials with precise adjustable meso&#8208;scaled pore sizes and controllable pore structures by reported synthesis approaches. Herein, we develop a solvent polarity induced interface self&#8208;assembly strategy to construct mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials. In this method, we employ a mixed solvent system within a suitable range of polarity (0.223&#8804;Lippert&#8211;Mataga parameter (&#916;f) &#8804;0.295) to induce valid self&#8208;assembly of skeleton precursor and surfactant. The as&#8208;prepared mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials possess uniform tunable pore sizes (8.2&#8211;14.0&#8197;nm), high surface areas and ultrahigh nitrogen content (up to 18&#8201;%). Owing to these intriguing advantages, the fabricated mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials as functionalized porous solid absorbents exhibit predominant CO2 adsorption performance and exceptional selectivity for the capture of CO2 over N2.

&lt;p&gt;A solvent-polarity-induced interface self-assembly strategy is proposed for the synthesis of mesoporous triazine-based carbon materials. It exhibits precise, tunable pore sizes and pore structures. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules can be adsorbed well as a result of the suitable pore sizes and the triazine unit.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Composites with Ordered Macropores and Hollow Walls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts with 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous and hollow&#8208;wall structures were successfully fabricated by using ordered macroporous ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 single crystals as precursors. This unique porous structure can greatly enhance mass transfer and accessibility of active sites to boost catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of furfural.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks provide versatile templates for the fabrication of various metal/carbon materials, but most of the derived composites possess only microspores, limiting the accessibility of embedded active sites. Herein, we report the construction of cobalt/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon composites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ordered macroporous and hollow&#8208;wall structure (H&#8208;3DOM&#8208;Co/NC) using a single&#8208;crystal ordered macropore (SOM)&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 as precursor. During the pyrolysis, the interconnected macroporous structure of SOM&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 is mostly preserved, whereas the pore wall achieves a solid&#8208;to&#8208;hollow transformation with Co nanoparticles formed in the hollow walls. The 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous carbon skeleton may effectively promote long&#8208;range mass transfer and the hollow wall can facilitate local accessibility of active sites. This unique structure can greatly boost its catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfural to cyclopentanol, much superior to its counterparts without this well&#8208;designed hierarchically porous structure.

         <title>Selective Benzylic CH&#8208;Borylations by Tandem Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activations are environmentally and economically attractive synthetic strategies for the construction of functional molecules as they obviate the need for pre&#8208;functionalized substrates and minimize waste generation. Great challenges reside in the control of selectivities, the utilization of unbiased hydrocarbons, and the operation of atom&#8208;economical dehydrocoupling mechanisms. An especially mild borylation of benzylic CH bonds was developed with the ligand&#8208;free pre&#8208;catalyst Co[N(SiMe3)2]2 and the bench&#8208;stable and inexpensive borylation reagent B2pin2 that produces H2 as the only by&#8208;product. A full set of kinetic, spectroscopic, and preparative mechanistic studies are indicative of a tandem catalysis mechanism of CH&#8208;borylation and dehydrocoupling via molecular Co(I) catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrastable Cu Catalyst for CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Liquid Fuels by Tuning C&#8722;C Coupling with CuTi Subsurface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Production of multicarbon (C  2+  ) liquid fuels is a challenging task for electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction, mainly limited by the stabilization of reaction intermediates and their subsequent C&#8722;C couplings. In this work, we report a unique catalyst, the coordinatively unsaturated Cu sites on amorphous CuTi alloy (a&#8208;CuTi@Cu) toward electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction to multicarbon (C  2&#8722;4  ) liquid fuels. Remarkably, the electrocatalyst yields ethanol, acetone and n&#8208;butanol as major products with a total C  2&#8722;4  faradaic efficiency of about 49% at &#8722;0.8 V  vs.  reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which can be maintained for at least 3 months. Theoretical simulation together with  in&#8208;situ  characterization reveals that subsurface Ti atoms can increase the electron density of surface Cu sites and enhance the adsorption of *CO intermediate, which in turn reduces the energy barriers required for *CO dimerization and trimerization. This work refreshes the concept that the catalytically inactive element can maneuver the behaviour of catalytic sites in electrocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling from the angle of electron density.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconfigurable Two&#8208;Dimensional DNA Lattices: Static and Dynamic Angle Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Branched DNA motifs serve as the basic construction elements for all synthetic DNA nanostructures. However, precise control of branching orientation remains a key challenge to further heighten the overall structural order. In this study, we use two strategies to control the branching orientation. The first one is based on immobile Holliday junctions which employ specific nucleotide sequences at the branch points which dictate their orientation. The second strategy is to use angle&#8208;enforcing struts to fix the branching orientation with flexible spacers at the branch points. We have also demonstrated that the branching orientation control can be achieved dynamically, either by canonical Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing or non&#8208;canonical nucleobase interactions (  e.g.,  i&#8208;motif and G&#8208;quadruplex). With precise angle control and feedback from the chemical environment, these results will enable novel DNA nanomechanical sensing devices, and precisely&#8208;ordered three&#8208;dimensional architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside a Shell&#8212;Organometallic Catalysis Inside Encapsulin Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal catalysis strategy has been developed inside a confined space using encapsulins equipped with HaloTag and [CpRu(hydroxyquinoline)(allyl)]PF6. The strategy opens up a toolbox for designing compartmentalized &#8220;new&#8208;to&#8208;biology&#8221; reactions inside living cells.







Abstract
Compartmentalization of chemical reactions inside cells are a fundamental requirement for life. Encapsulins are self&#8208;assembling protein&#8208;based nanocompartments from the prokaryotic repertoire that present a highly attractive platform for intracellular compartmentalization of chemical reactions by design. Using single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer and 3D&#8208;MINFLUX analysis, we analyze fluorescently labeled encapsulins on a single&#8208;molecule basis. Furthermore, by equipping these capsules with a synthetic ruthenium catalyst via covalent attachment to a non&#8208;native host protein, we are able to perform in&#8197;vitro catalysis and go on to show that engineered encapsulins can be used as hosts for transition metal catalysis inside living cells in confined space.

         <title>Mapping of N&#8722;C Bond Formation from a Series of Crystalline Peri&#8208;Substituted Naphthalenes by Charge Density and Solid&#8208;State NMR Methodologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of charge density measurements, solid&#8208;state NMR 1JNC couplings, and DFT calculations is presented to characterise the transition from an n&#8211;&#960;* interaction to bond formation for a series of model crystalline peri&#8208;substituted naphthalenes.







Abstract
A combination of charge density studies and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1JNC coupling measurements supported by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to characterise the transition from an n&#8211;&#960;* interaction to bond formation between a nucleophilic nitrogen atom and an electrophilic sp2 carbon atom in a series of crystalline peri&#8208;substituted naphthalenes. As the N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C distance reduces there is a sharp decrease in the Laplacian derived from increasing charge density between the two groups at ca. N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C = 1.8&#8197;&#197;, with the periodic DFT calculations predicting, and heteronuclear spin&#8208;echo NMR measurements confirming, the 1JNC couplings of &#8776;3&#8211;6&#8197;Hz for long C&#8722;N bonds (1.60&#8211;1.65&#8197;&#197;), and 1JNC couplings of &lt;1&#8197;Hz for N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C &gt;2.1&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Pyrrole Hemithioindigo Antimitotics with Near&#8208;Quantitative Bidirectional Photoswitching that Photocontrol Cellular Microtubule Dynamics with Single&#8208;Cell Precision**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrole hemithioindigos can be near&#8208;quantitatively photoisomerised by the laser wavelengths available on confocal microscopes. The first pyrrole hemithioindigo&#8208;based photopharmaceuticals, PHTubs, which are photoswitchable tubulin inhibitors, have been developed. PHTubs optically inhibit microtubule dynamics in live cells with single&#8208;cell, second&#8208;scale spatiotemporal precision, with both lit&#8208;active and dark&#8208;active compounds demonstrated in action.







Abstract
We report the first cellular application of the emerging near&#8208;quantitative photoswitch pyrrole hemithioindigo, by rationally designing photopharmaceutical PHTub inhibitors of the cytoskeletal protein tubulin. PHTubs allow simultaneous visible&#8208;light imaging and photoswitching in live cells, delivering cell&#8208;precise photomodulation of microtubule dynamics, and photocontrol over cell cycle progression and cell death. This is the first acute use of a hemithioindigo photopharmaceutical for high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution biological control in live cells. It additionally demonstrates the utility of near&#8208;quantitative photoswitches, by enabling a dark&#8208;active design to overcome residual background activity during cellular photopatterning. This work opens up new horizons for high&#8208;precision microtubule research using PHTubs and shows the cellular applicability of pyrrole hemithioindigo as a valuable scaffold for photocontrol of a range of other biological targets.

         <title>Allosteric Switching of Calmodulin in a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA) Nanopore&#8208;Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ca2+&#8208;free, Ca2+&#8208;bound, and target peptide&#8208;bound states of calmodulin were distinguished by Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA). The D129G mutant of calmodulin was also discriminated. Interactions between calmodulin and other divalent ions were also detected, demonstrating high resolution structural profiling.







Abstract
Recent developments concerning large protein nanopores suggest a new approach to structure profiling of native folded proteins. In this work, the large vestibule of Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA) and calmodulin (CaM), a Ca2+&#8208;binding protein, were used in the direct observation of the protein structure. Three conformers, including the Ca2+&#8208;free, Ca2+&#8208;bound, and target peptide&#8208;bound states of CaM, were unambiguously distinguished. A disease related mutant, CaM D129G was also discriminated by MspA, revealing how a single amino acid replacement can interfere with the Ca2+&#8208;binding capacity of the whole protein. The binding capacity and aggregation effect of CaM induced by different ions (Mg2+/Sr2+/Ba2+/Ca2+/Pb2+/Tb3+) were also investigated and the stability of MspA in extreme conditions was evaluated. This work demonstrates the most systematic single&#8208;molecule investigation of different allosteric conformers of CaM, acknowledging the high sensing resolution offered by the MspA nanopore trap.

         <title>Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles Triggered by Hydrogen Peroxide&#8208;Initiated Chemiluminescence for Activated Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the well&#8208;known tetrazole/alkene &#8220;photoclick&#8221; chemistry, a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)&#8208;initiated chemiluminescence&#8208;triggered nanoparticle (NP) aggregation strategy was herein reported to activate the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapeutic functions of gold NPs for specific visualization and efficient treatment of tumors in&#8197;vivo. This approach could provide a valuable tool for achieving precise cancer treatment.







Abstract
Developing endogenous photo&#8208;activated theranostic platforms to overcome the limitation of low tissue&#8208;penetration from external light sources is highly significant for cancer diagnosis and treatment. We report a H2O2&#8208;initiated chemiluminescence (CL)&#8208;triggered nanoparticle aggregation strategy to activate theranostic functions of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for effective tumor imaging and therapy. Two types of AuNPs (tAuNP &amp; mAuNP) were designed and fabricated by conjugating 2,5&#8208;diphenyltetrazole and methacrylic acid onto the surface of AuNPs, respectively. Luminol was adsorbed onto the mAuNPs to afford self&#8208;illuminating mAuNP/Lu NPs that could produce strong CL by reaction with H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment, which triggers significant aggregation of AuNPs resulting in enhanced accumulation and retention of AuNPs for activated photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy of tumors. We thus believe that this approach may offer a promising tool for effective tumor treatment.

         <title>Harnessing Shape Complementarity for Upgraded Cyclohexane Purification through Adaptive Bottlenecked Pores in an Imidazole&#8208;Containing MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bottlenecked pores in an imidazole&#8208;containing MOF, namely MAF&#8208;stu&#8208;13, can adapt in shape to specifically binding of benzene molecules, making it desirable for upgraded purification to yield ultrahigh&#8208;purity (&#8805;99&#8201;%) cyclohexane in the late stage of industrial liquid&#8208;phase production.







Abstract
Shape complementarity is a biological craft for precisely binding substrates at protein&#8211;protein interfaces. An analogy to such a function can be drawn conceptually for crystalline porous solids; yet the manifested entities are rare in reticular chemistry. The bottleneck&#8208;shaped pores carved out of a metal&#8208;organic framework, Zn(MIBA)2 (aka. MAF&#8208;stu&#8208;13), can perfectly accommodate benzene molecules. Remarkably, its framework adapts to the optimal guest binding&#8208;the enhanced host&#8211;guest interactions in the neck in turn minimize the guest&#8208;guest repulsion in the pore to the extent it turns into attraction&#8208;as demonstrated by the combined X&#8208;ray structural and DFT computational studies. This adaptive material can be used for liquid&#8208;phase production of ultrahigh&#8208;purity (&#8805;99&#8201;%) cyclohexane, achieving a balance between uptake capacity and separation selectivity and surpassing the performances of other porous and nonporous crystals reported recently (e.g. product purity 99.4&#8201;% vs. 97.5&#8201;% to date).

     alt="Harnessing Shape Complementarity for Upgraded Cyclohexane Purification through Adaptive Bottlenecked Pores in an Imidazole-Containing MOF"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottlenecked pores in an imidazole-containing MOF, namely MAF-stu-13, can adapt in shape to specifically binding of benzene molecules, making it desirable for upgraded purification to yield ultrahigh-purity (&#8805;99&#8201;%) cyclohexane in the late stage of industrial liquid-phase production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shape complementarity is a biological craft for precisely binding substrates at protein&#8211;protein interfaces. An analogy to such a function can be drawn conceptually for crystalline porous solids; yet the manifested entities are rare in reticular chemistry. The bottleneck-shaped pores carved out of a metal-organic framework, Zn(MIBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aka. MAF-stu-13), can perfectly accommodate benzene molecules. Remarkably, its framework adapts to the optimal guest binding-the enhanced host&#8211;guest interactions in the neck in turn minimize the guest-guest repulsion in the pore to the extent it turns into attraction-as demonstrated by the combined X-ray structural and DFT computational studies. This adaptive material can be used for liquid-phase production of ultrahigh-purity (&#8805;99&#8201;%) cyclohexane, achieving a balance between uptake capacity and separation selectivity and surpassing the performances of other porous and nonporous crystals reported recently (e.g. product purity 99.4&#8201;% vs. 97.5&#8201;% to date).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dissection of the Polar and Non&#8208;Polar Contributions to Aromatic Stacking Interactions in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;Hammett approach has been used to dissect out the polar contributions to the total aromatic stacking energy.







Abstract
Aromatic stacking interactions have been a matter of study and debate due to their crucial role in chemical and biological systems. The strong dependence on orientation and solvent together with the relatively small interaction energies have made evaluation and rationalization a challenge for experimental and theoretical chemists. We have used a supramolecular cage formed by two tris(pyridylmethyl)amines units to build chemical Double Mutant Cycles (DMC) for the experimental measurement of the free energies of &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Extrapolating the substituent effects to remove the contribution due to electrostatic interactions reveals that there is a substantial contribution to the measured stacking interaction energies which is due to non&#8208;polar interactions (&#8722;3 to &#8722;6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The perfectly flat nature of the surface of an aromatic ring gives &#960;&#8208;stacking an inherent advantage over non&#8208;polar interactions with alkyl groups and accounts for the wide&#8208;spread prevalence of stacking interactions in Nature.

         <title>Neutrophil&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe Development through Metabolism&#8208;Oriented Live&#8208;Cell Distinction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly lipophilic fluorescent probe, NeutropG, has been developed for the specific distinction and imaging of human neutrophils over other blood cell types. The staining mechanism of neutrophil&#8208;selective NeutropG is achieved by metabolism&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (MOLD) through lipid droplet biogenesis. NeutropG enters a neutrophil transported by CD36, then forms a lipid droplet with the help of ACSL and DGAT.







Abstract
Human neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes and have been considered as the first line of defence in the innate immune system. Selective imaging of live neutrophils will facilitate the in&#8197;situ study of neutrophils in infection or inflammation events as well as clinical diagnosis. However, small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based probes for the discrimination of live neutrophils among different granulocytes in human blood have yet to be reported. Herein, we report the first fluorescent probe NeutropG for the specific distinction and imaging of active neutrophils. The selective staining mechanism of NeutropG is elucidated as metabolism&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (MOLD) through lipid droplet biogenesis with the help of ACSL and DGAT. Finally, NeutropG is applied to accurately quantify neutrophil levels in fresh blood samples by showing a high correlation with the current clinical method.

         <title>Realizing Record&#8208;High Electroluminescence Efficiency of 31.5&#8201;% for Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailor&#8208;made red thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with intramolecular hydrogen bonding are developed, which exhibit excellent photoluminescence efficiencies and large horizontal dipole ratios, and thus furnish the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art red and near infrared OLEDs, with a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 31.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tailor&#8208;made red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules comprised of an electron&#8208;withdrawing pyrazino[2,3&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile core and various electron&#8208;donating triarylamines are developed. They can form intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding, which is conducive to improving emission efficiency and promoting horizontal orientation and show near infrared (NIR) emissions (692&#8211;710 nm) in neat films and red delayed fluorescence (606&#8211;630 nm) with high photoluminescence quantum yields (73&#8211;90%) in doped films. They prefer horizontal orientation with large horizontal dipole ratios in films, rendering high optical out&#8208;coupling factors (0.39&#8211;0.41). Their non&#8208;doped OLEDs exhibit NIR lights (716&#8211;748 nm) with maximum external quantum efficiencies (&#951;ext,max) of 1.0&#8211;1.9%. And their doped OLEDs radiate red lights (606&#8211;648 nm) and achieve record&#8208;beating &#951;ext,max of up to 31.5%. These new red TADF materials should have great potentials in display and lighting devices.

An asymmetric hydrogenation of 3&#8208;benzoylaminocoumarins was achieved for the first time using a BridgePhos&#8208;Rh catalytic system. Chiral 3&#8208;amino dihydrocoumarins were yielded in high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.7&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
An asymmetric hydrogenation of 3&#8208;benzoylaminocoumarins was achieved for the first time using our BridgePhos&#8208;Rh catalytic system, providing chiral 3&#8208;amino dihydrocoumarins in high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.7&#8201;% ee). The relationship between the enantioselectivities of the hydrogenations and the dihedral angles and the resulting &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking effects of the BridgePhos&#8208;Rh complexes, which were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, are discussed. The corresponding hydrogenated products allow for many transformations, providing several chiral skeletons with important physiological and pharmacological activities.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of Ionic Liquids for the Fabrication of Ionogel Films and Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical vapor deposition of an ionic liquid allows the formation of ionogel thin films and microdrops in high resolution. The non&#8208;volatile ionic liquid is formed on a surface by reaction of two non&#8208;volatile precursors. A broad range of applications will benefit from this new &#8220;IL&#8208;CVD&#8221; approach, which enables the fabrication of microdevices.







Abstract
Film deposition and high&#8208;resolution patterning of ionic liquids (ILs) remain a challenge, despite a broad range of applications that would benefit from this type of processing. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of ILs.

&lt;p&gt;Chemical vapor deposition of an ionic liquid allows the formation of ionogel thin films and microdrops in high resolution. The non-volatile ionic liquid is formed on a surface by reaction of two non-volatile precursors. A broad range of applications will benefit from this new &#8220;IL-CVD&#8221; approach, which enables the fabrication of microdevices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Film deposition and high-resolution patterning of ionic liquids (ILs) remain a challenge, despite a broad range of applications that would benefit from this type of processing. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of ILs. The IL-CVD method is based on the formation of a non-volatile IL through the reaction of two vaporized precursors. Ionogel micropatterns can be easily obtained via the combination of IL-CVD and standard photolithography, and the resulting microdrop arrays can be used as microreactors. The IL-CVD approach will facilitate leveraging the properties of ILs in a range of applications and microfabricated devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Oversaturated Fe&#8208;N5 Multifunctional Catalytic Sites for Durable Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single atom (SA) catalyst with oversaturated Fe&#8208;N5 active site structure was developed as an efficient sulfur host material to realize excellent electrochemical performance at high sulfur loading.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are regarded as a promising next&#8208;generation system for advanced energy storage owing to a high theoretical energy density of 2600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. However, the practical implementation of Li&#8208;S batteries has been thwarted by the detrimental shuttling behavior of polysulfides, and the sluggish kinetics in electrochemical processes. Herein, a novel single atom (SA) catalyst with oversaturated Fe&#8208;N5 coordination structure (Fe&#8208;N5&#8208;C) is precisely synthesized by an absorption&#8211;pyrolysis strategy and introduced as an effective sulfur host material. The experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal synergism between atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N5 active sites and the unique carbon support. The results exhibit that the sulfur composite cathode built on the Fe&#8208;N5&#8208;C can not only adsorb polysulfides via chemical interaction, but also boost the redox reaction kinetics, thus mitigating the shuttle effect. Meanwhile, the robust three&#8208;dimensional nitrogen doped carbon nanofiber with large surface area, and high porosity enables strong physical confinement and fast electron/ion transfer process. Attributed to such unique features, Li&#8208;S batteries with S/Fe&#8208;N5&#8208;C composite cathode realize outstanding cyclability and rate capability, as well as high areal capacities under raised sulfur loading, which demonstrates great potential in developing advanced Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Highly Efficient Spin&#8208;Filtering Transport in Chiral Hybrid Copper Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity in Pb(Sn)&#8208;I hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites creates a platform for organic spintronics. Combining the low toxicity of Cu2+ and inoxidizability of halide ions, lead&#8208;free and air&#8208;stable chiral hybrid copper halides (R/S&#8208;MBA)2CuX4 were synthesized by facile methods. These compounds offer efficient (&#8776;90&#8201;%) spin&#8208;filtering charge transport.







Abstract
Chiral Pb(Sn)&#8208;I hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites exhibit outstanding chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) performance, but the nontoxic lead&#8208;free hybrid materials with high stability are still greatly desired for spin filtering in spintronic applications. We synthesize chiral hybrid copper halides (R/S&#8208;MBA)2CuX4 (MBA=methylbenzylammonium; X=Cl, Br) with characteristic 0D CuX4 tetrahedral structural motifs, combining the low toxicity of Cu2+ and air stability of halide ions (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;). Despite similar structural and electronic features, (R/S&#8208;MBA)2CuBr4 shows much smaller chiroptical activity than the chloride counterpart. Magnetically conductive atomic force microscopy measurements display a typical spin&#8208;polarized charge&#8208;transport property with high efficiency up to 90&#8201;% for both copper halides. Our work expands the CISS effect into eco&#8208;friendly and stable metal&#8211;organic halides, which is promising for applications in spintronics based on transition&#8208;metal hybrid systems.

         <title>Nanocarriers for Skin Applications: Where Do We Stand?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of nanocarriers for dermal drug delivery is a very promising research topic, as it enables the penetration of therapeutics across the skin, a highly complex biological barrier. This Review highlights recent advances in this area and describes the current status of nanocarriers to undergo market translation.







Abstract
Skin penetration of active molecules for treatment of diverse diseases is a major field of research owing to the advantages associated with the skin like easy accessibility, reduced systemic&#8208;derived side effects, and increased therapeutic efficacy. Despite these advantages, dermal drug delivery is generally challenging due to the low skin permeability of therapeutics. Although various methods have been developed to improve skin penetration and permeation of therapeutics, they are usually aggressive and could lead to irreversible damage to the stratum corneum. Nanosized carrier systems represent an alternative approach for current technologies, with minimal damage to the natural barrier function of skin. In this Review, the use of nanoparticles to deliver drug molecules, genetic material, and vaccines into the skin is discussed. In addition, nanotoxicology studies and the recent clinical development of nanoparticles are highlighted to shed light on their potential to undergo market translation.

         <title>Phosphorus Induced Electron Localization of Single Iron Sites for Boosted CO2 Electroreduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single phosphorous atoms were successfully incorporated into a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon supported single Fe atom catalyst mainly in the form of P&#8722;C bonds, which were demonstrated to promote CO2 electroreduction to CO at low overpotentials. The maximum CO faradaic efficiency was over 97&#8201;% at a low overpotential with a Tafel slope of only 59&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into chemicals and fuels has recently attracted much interest, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. In this work, single P atoms were introduced into a N&#8208;doped carbon supported single Fe atom catalyst (Fe&#8208;SAC/NPC) mainly in the form of P&#8722;C bonds for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. This catalyst exhibited a CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;97&#8201;% at a low overpotential of 320&#8197;mV, and a Tafel slope of only 59&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gold catalysts. Experimental analysis combined with DFT calculations suggested that single P atom in high coordination shells (n&#8805;3), in particular the third coordination shell of Fe center enhanced the electronic localization of Fe, which improved the stabilization of the key *COOH intermediate on Fe, leading to superior CO2 electrochemical reduction performance at low overpotentials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation (RASER) was employed for background&#8208;free detection of hyperpolarized NMR resonances even in the extreme case of protonated solvents and biological fluids. This approach paves the way to a wide range of high&#8208;resolution NMR&#8208; and in&#8197;vivo MRI applications of proton detection of hyperpolarized molecules.







Abstract
We report on the utility of Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation (RASER) for background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized biomolecules. We performed hyperpolarization of &#8776;0.3&#8197;M ethyl acetate via pairwise parahydrogen addition to vinyl acetate. A proton NMR signal with signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio exceeding 100&#8201;000 was detected without radio&#8208;frequency excitation at the clinically relevant magnetic field of 1.4&#8197;T using a standard (non&#8208;cryogenic) inductive detector with quality factor of Q=68. No proton background signal was observed from protonated solvent (methanol) or other added co&#8208;solvents such as ethanol, water or bovine serum. Moreover, we demonstrate RASER detection without radio&#8208;frequency excitation of a bolus of hyperpolarized contrast agent in biological fluid. Completely background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized contrast agents in biological media paves the way to new applications in the areas of high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and in&#8197;vivo spectroscopy and imaging.

         <title>Acceptorless dehydrogenation of methanol to carbon monoxide and hydrogen using molecular catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acceptorless dehydrogenation of methanol to carbon monoxide and hydrogen was investigated using homogeneous molecular complexes. Complexes of ruthenium and manganese comprising the MACHO ligand framework showed promising activities for this reaction. The molecular ruthenium complex [RuH(CO)(BH  4  )(HN(C  2  H  4  PPh  2  )  2  )] (Ru&#8208;MACHO&#8208;BH) achieved up to 3150 turnovers for carbon monoxide and 9230 turnovers for hydrogen formation at 150&#176;C reaching pressures up to 12 bar when the decomposition was carried out in a closed vessel. Control experiments affirmed that the metal complex mediates the initial fast dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde and methyl formate followed by subsequent slow decarbonylation. Depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions, the CO/H  2  ratio in the gas mixture thus varies over a broad range from almost pure hydrogen to the stoichiometric limit of 1:2.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining electrochemiluminescence detection with aptamer&#8208;gated indicator releasing mesoporous nanoparticles enables ppt sensitivity for strip&#8208;based rapid tests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) and aptamer&#8208;gated indicator delivering (gAID) magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles embedded into glass fibre paper functionalised with poly(ethyleneglycol) and N&#8208;(3&#8208;triethoxysilylpropyl)diethanolamine allowed the development of a rapid test that detects penicillin directly in diluted milk down to 50 &#177; 9 ppt in &lt;5 min. Covalent attachment of the aptamer &#8216;cap&#8217; to the silica scaffold enabled pore closure through non&#8208;covalent electrostatic interactions with surface amino groups, while binding of penicillin led to a folding&#8208;up of the aptamer thus releasing the ECL reporter Ru(bpy)32+ previously loaded into the material and letting it be detected after lateral flow by a smartphone camera upon electrochemical excitation with a screen printed electrode inserted into a 3D&#8208;printed holder. The approach is simple, generic and presents advantages with respect to sensitivity, measurement uncertainty and robustness compared with conventional fluorescence or electrochemical detection, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;need analyses of challenging matrices and analytes at ultra&#8208;trace levels.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Site Concerted Proton&#8722;Electron Transfer in a Manganese&#8208;Based Complete Functional Model for the [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a paradigm for multiple&#8208;site concerted proton&#8722;electron transfer (MS&#8208;CPET) in the process of proton reduction or hydrogen oxidation, the active site of [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase (H  2  ase) is preorganized with an amine (&#8216;azadithiolate&#8217;) as a proton relay and a [4Fe4S] subunit as an electron reservoir. The synergy of two individual factors efficiently lowers the overpotential for these reactions. In this study, we report  a mononuclear manganese  complex  fac&#8208;  [Mn(CO)  3  (6&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenol)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;quinoline) Br] (  1  ) as a rare model to fully mimic the functions of the H  2  ase. In  1  , a redox active bidentate ligand decorated with a pendent phenol replicates the roles of the electron reservoir and the proton relay in natural enzyme. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal two consecutive MS&#8208;CPET processes in the catalytic cycle. For each MS&#8208;CPET, electron prestored in the reductive ligand and proton at the proximal phenol synchronously transfer to the Mn center in a concerted way. By virtue of this mechanism, complex  1  &#160;exhibited a low overpotential comparable to that of natual enzyme in electrochemical hydrogen production using phenol as a proton source.&#160;.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Vicinal Difunctionalization of Five&#8208;Membered Heteroarenes with Dual Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article a new reaction mode of palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis is reported involving the selective coupling of two different carbon&#8208;based electrophiles for vicinal double C&#8722;H functionalization of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes in a site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral manner. The key is to use alkynyl bromides as the second electrophile, which allows vicinal difunctionalization of a wide range of heteroarenes including pyrroles, thiophenes and furans at their C4 and C5 positions. One&#8208; or two&#8208;step tetrafunctionalizations of simple pyrrole and thiophene have also been realized. The C2&#8208;substituted NBEs prove most effective in these reactions, and the mechanistic exploration discloses the origin of the high selectivity of this transformation. Synthetic utility of this method has been exemplified in the concise preparations of thiophene&#8208;containing organic materials and a protein kinase inhibitor analogue. Preliminary success has also been achieved in a direct annulation event, using a tethered ketone as the second electrophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Assisted Artesunate Delivery by Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Synergistic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clinical translation of artesunate (ATS) as a potent antitumor drug has been obstructed by its rapid degradation and low bioavailability. Herein, we report the development of ATS nanomedicine through the self&#8208;assembly with Mn[Co(CN)6]2/3 1/3 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) having hidden missing linkers. The defects originated from the missing linkers play a key role in increasing the biological stability and tumor accumulation of ATS. Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and ATS can be co&#8208;loaded into MOFs for a synergistic antitumor efficacy. In the presence of intracellular HCO3&#8208;, Mn2+ acts as an efficient catalyst to promote the bicarbonate&#8208;activated H2O2 system and induce oxidative death to cancer cells based on ATS with an endoperoxide bridge. The released [CoIII(CN)6] linker undergoes a redox reaction with intracellular glutathione to prevent the scavenging ability of reactive oxygen species, contributing to synergistic chemodynamic therapy of ATS and photodynamic therapy of Ce6. Thus, defect&#8208;engineered MOFs with hidden missing linkers hold great promises in advancing the practical uses of ATS as an antitumor medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>IrOx@In2O3 heterojunction made of individually crystallized oxides for weak&#8208;light promoted electrocatalytic water oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, multi&#8208;field coupling especially photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalysis has been studied for further improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity.  Herein, we for the first time employ n&#8208;type semiconductor of cubic In  2  O  3  for loading IrO  x  species (mass ratio: Ir to In  2  O  3  is 17.6%) forming IrO  x  @In  2  O  3  heterojunction, which exhibits outstanding OER performance promoted by weak&#8208;light irradiation.  Notably, IrO  x  (ca. 1.7 nm) and In  2  O  3  are found to independently crystallize during the heterogeneous nucleation process with no Ir atoms doped in In  2  O  3  lattice, avoiding Ir loss and ensuring all Ir&#8208;based sites&#8217; full exposure. IrO  x  @In  2  O  3  heterojunction shows the enhanced electrocatalytic water oxidation activity with a overpotential of 190 and 231 mV at the current densities of 10 and 50 mA/cm  2  , surpassing all reported IrO  x  &#8208;based catalysts ever reported. Significantly, the surface nano&#8208;sized IrO  x  can be 100% activated to act as the OER sites under one weak&#8208;light beam of LED&#8208;365 (1.8 mW/cm  2  ) and the overpotential is further reduced to 176 and 210 mV to deliver the respective current. This work can help us design more efficient multi&#8208;field coupling OER systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;metalation of porphyrins at the solid&#8208;gas interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;metalation is one of the most promising synthesis routes to include a single metal atom in a tetrapyrrolic macrocycle in the case of organic frameworks supported by metal surfaces. The molecule&#8208;surface interaction may provide the charge transfer and the geometric distortion of the molecular plane that are necessary for metal inclusion, thus mimicking enzymatic metalation mechanisms of porphyrins in biology. However, while the latter process proceeds at room temperature, at a metal surface, instead, the presence of an activation barrier can represent a technical obstacle that cannot be compensated by a higher substrate temperature without affecting the layer integrity. The formation of the intermediate state, the sitting&#8208;atop complex that weakens the two N&#8208;H bonds in the tetrapyrrole preceding the metal insertion step, can be facilitated in some cases by oxygen pre&#8208;adsorption at the supporting metal surface, like in the case of the 2H&#8208;TPP/Pd(100) system. In such cases, the activation barrier can be overcome by mild annealing, yielding the formation of desorbing products (hydrogen, water) and of the metalated tetrapyrrole. We show here that the self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;TPP molecules at the Pd(100) surface can be promoted already at room temperature by the presence of an oxygen gas phase at close&#8208;to&#8208;ambient conditions via an Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism, resembling the asymmetric interactions available in enzymatic pockets, thus opening the way to novel routes to metalate organic frameworks at surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical Enhancement and Kinetics Regulation of Fmoc&#8208; Diphenylalanine  Hydrogels by Thioflavin T</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of peptides is a key direction for fabrication of advanced materials. Novel approaches for fine tuning of macroscopic and microscopic properties of peptide self&#8208;assemblies are of a high demand for constructing biomaterials with desired properties. In this work, while studying the kinetics of the Fmoc&#8208;Diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) dipeptide self&#8208;assembly using the Thioflavin T (ThT) dye, we observed that the presence of ThT strongly modifies structural and mechanical properties of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel. Notably, the presence of ThT resulted in a tenfold increase of the gelation time and in the formation of short and dense fibers in the hydrogel. As a result of these morphological alteration higher thermal stability, and, most important, tenfold increase of the hydrogel rigidity was achieved. Hence, ThT not only slowed the kinetics of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel formation, but also strongly enhanced its mechanical properties. In this study, we provide a detailed description of the ThT effect on the hydrogel properties and suggest the mechanisms for this phenomenon, paving the way for the novel approach to the control of the peptide hydrogels&#8217; micro&#8208; and macroscale properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Tricyclic Nitrogen Heterocycles by Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Allenynes and Its Application to Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel approach to the direct construction of tricyclic nitrogen heterocycles based on gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of aminoallenynes is described. The expected bis&#8208;cyclization reaction of hydroxyisobutyryl&#8208;protected aminoallenynes was efficiently promoted by a catalytic amount of BrettPhosAuNTf  2  in the presence of  i  PrOH, producing 1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[  cd  ]indole derivatives in good yields. Combined with Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation or palladium&#8208;catalyzed  N  &#8208;arylation, the resulting tricyclic products were efficiently converted to nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (N&#8208;PACs) with highly conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems.

         <title>A Biocatalytic Cascade in an Ultrastable Mesoporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (MHOF)&#8208;confined biocatalytic cascade nanoreactor is constructed. This MHOF cascade nanoreactor has robust and large transport channels, allowing the efficient diffusion of a wide range of biocatalytic substrates and displays the advantages of superior activities, extended scope of substrates, and ultrahigh stability that enables mimicking intracellular signal communications and complex chemical transformations.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first example of using mesoporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MHOFs) as the protecting scaffold to organize a biocatalytic cascade. The confined microenvironment of MHOFs has robust and large transport channels, allowing the efficient transport of a wide range of biocatalytic substrates. This new MHOF&#8208;confined cascade system shows superior activity, extended scope of catalytic substrates, and ultrahigh stability that enables the operation of complex chemical transformations in a porous carrier. In addition, the advantages of MHOF&#8208;confined cascades system for point&#8208;of&#8208;care biosensing are also demonstrated. This study highlights the advantages of HOFs as scaffold for multiple enzyme assemblies, which has huge potential for mimicking complex cellular transformation networks in a controllable manner.

         <title>An Integrated Photoelectrochemical Nanotool for Intracellular Drug Delivery and Treatment Effect Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With reduced background and high sensitivity, photoelectrochemistry (PEC) may be applied as an intracellular nanotool and open a new technological direction of single&#8208;cell study. Nevertheless, the present palette of single&#8208;cell tools lacks such a PEC&#8208;oriented solution. Here a dual&#8208;functional photocathodic single&#8208;cell nanotool capable of direct electroosmotic intracellular drug delivery and evaluation of oxidative stress is devised by engineering a target&#8208;specific organic molecule/NiO/Ni film at the tip of a nanopipette. Specifically, the organic molecule probe serves simultaneously as the biorecognition element and sensitizer to synergize with p&#8208;type NiO. Upon intracellular delivery at picoliter level, the oxidative stress effect will cause structural change of the organic probe, switching its optical absorption and altering the cathodic response. This work has revealed the potential of PEC single&#8208;cell nanotool and extended the boundary of current single&#8208;cell electroanalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiopure C5 Pentaindenocorannulenes: Chiral Graphenoid Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four chiral C5 bowl&#8208;shaped aromatic hydrocarbons with exceptional configurational stability have been derived from pentaindenocorannulene have been synthesized. The chirality of these carbon bowls is instrumental to establishing the formation of columnar supramolecular assemblies in solution.







Abstract
Chiral carbon nanomaterials offer numerous prospects for material science. As a fundamental building block for non&#8208;planar graphenoid materials, pentaindenocorannulene (PIC) with its C5v symmetrical structure presents a platform for creation of supramolecular chiral carbon materials. Specifically, when uniformly penta&#8208;substituted on its periphery, PIC generates C5 symmetrical chiral buckybowls capable of columnar stacking. The synthesis and resolution of such PICs are achieved, assignment of absolute configuration is established by comparison of ECD and VCD spectra with theory, and material characterization is reported. Evidence for columnar stacking in solution and in the crystal is presented.

         <title>Energy Migration Control of Multimodal Emissions in an Er3+&#8208;Doped Nanostructure for Information Encryption and Deep&#8208;Learning Decoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The control of multimodal emissions has been demonstrated by a new type of Er3+&#8208;based lanthanide nanocrystals (NCs). The multiresponse color&#8208;switchable output can be used for information security. Based on the Vis/NIR&#8208;II multimodal emissions of these NCs and deep learning, it was possible to store and decode information in pork tissue by irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
Modulating the emission wavelengths of materials has always been a primary focus of fluorescence technology. Nanocrystals (NCs) doped with lanthanide ions with rich energy levels can produce a variety of emissions at different excitation wavelengths. However, the control of multimodal emissions of these ions has remained a challenge. Herein, we present a new composition of Er3+&#8208;based lanthanide NCs with color&#8208;switchable output under irradiation with 980, 808, or 1535&#8197;nm light for information security. The variation of excitation wavelengths changes the intensity ratio of visible (Vis)/near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emissions. Taking advantage of the Vis/NIR&#8208;II multimodal emissions of NCs and deep learning, we successfully demonstrated the storage and decoding of visible light information in pork tissue.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Emission in a Coassembly System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coassembly systems are formed by doping carbonyl compounds into polyvinyl alcohol. After light irradiation the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network stabilizes the free radicals generated for the carbonyl compounds, leading to strong free&#8208;radical emission. Light/heat&#8208;controlled information encryption using these systems is demonstrated.







Abstract
Developing radical emission at ambient conditions is a challenging task since radical species are unstable in air. In the present work, we overcome this challenge by coassembling a series of tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzene molecules with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The strong hydrogen bonds between the guest dopants and the PVA host matrix protect the free radicals of carbonyl compounds after light irradiation, leading to strong solid state free radical emission. Changing temperature and peripheral functional groups of the tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzenes can influence the intensity of the radical emission. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations predict that such free radical fluorescence originates from anti&#8208;Kasha D2&#8594;D0 vertical emission by the anion radicals. The photoinduced radical emission by the tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzenes was successfully utilized for information encryption application.

The structure and bonding of [FKrFXeF]+ were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations (ELF, AIM, NBO, and MEPS analyses). Upon warming, the compound undergoes redox decomposition in HF to yield mixed KrII/XeIV and KrII/XeVI species.







Abstract
Reaction of [XeF][AsF6] with excess KrF2 at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous HF (aHF) solvent has yielded the first mixed KrII/XeII noble&#8208;gas compound, [FKrFXeF][AsF6] &#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF, a salt of the [FKrFXeF]+ cation. The potent oxidative fluorinating properties of KrII fluoride species resulted in oxidation of XeII to XeIV in aHF at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C to form the mixed KrII/XeIV cocrystals, ([Kr2F3][AsF6])2&#8901;XeF4 and XeF4&#8901;KrF2. Further decomposition at 22&#8201;&#176;C resulted in oxidation of XeIV to XeVI to give the recently reported KrII/XeVI complexes, [F5Xe(FKrF)n][AsF6] (n=1, 2), [F5Xe][AsF6], and a new KrII/XeVI complex, [(F5Xe)2(&#956;&#8208;FKrF)(AsF6)2], which was characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) Raman spectroscopy. The [FKrFXeF][AsF6]&#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF, ([Kr2F3][AsF6])2&#8901;XeF4&#8201;, and XeF4&#8901;KrF2 compounds were characterized by LT Raman spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were used to assess the bonding in [FKrFXeF]+, [Kr2F3]+, and [Xe2F3]+ and to aid in their vibrational assignments.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Access to Dihydroquinoxalinones via Formal &#945;&#8208;Halo Acyl Halide Synthon in One Pot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot catalytic and scalable Knoevenagel/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC) strategy towards medicinally significant dihydroquinoxalinones, featuring 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyano epoxides as new masked &#945;&#8208;halo acyl halide synthons, is reported. Two out of the three steps are catalysed by highly robust, recyclable and easily available quinine&#8208;derived urea.







Abstract
An enantioselective one&#8208;pot catalytic strategy to dihydroquinoxalinones, featuring novel 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyano enantioenriched epoxides as masked &#945;&#8208;halo acyl halide synthons, followed by a domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC), is documented. A popular quinine&#8208;derived urea served as the catalyst in two out of the three steps performed in the same solvent using commercially available aldehydes, (phenylsulfonyl)acetonitrile, cumyl hydroperoxide and 1,2&#8208;phenylendiamines. Medicinally relevant 3&#8208;aryl/alkyl&#8208;substituted heterocycles are isolated in generally good to high overall yield and high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). A rare example of excellent reusability of an organocatalyst at higher scale, subjected to oxidative conditions, is demonstrated. Mechanistically, labile &#945;&#8208;ketosulfone has been detected as the intermediate involved in the DROC process. Theoretical calculations on the key epoxidation step rationalize the observed stereocontrol, highlighting the important role played by the sulfone group.

         <title>An NADPH&#8208;dependent Ketoreductase Catalyses the Tetracyclic to Pentacyclic Skeletal Rearrangement in Chartreusin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox tailoring enzymes play key roles in generating structural complexity and diversity in type II polyketides. In chartreusin biosynthesis, the early  13  C&#8208;labeling experiments and bioinformatic analysis suggest the unusual aglycone is originated from a tetracyclic anthracyclic polyketide. Here, we demonstrated that the carbon skeleton rearrangement from a linear anthracyclic polyketide to an angular pentacyclic biosynthetic intermediate requires two redox enzymes. The flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase ChaZ catalyses a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation on resomycin C to form a seven&#8208;membered lactone. Subsequently, a ketoreductase ChaE rearranges the carbon skeleton and afford the &#945;&#8208;pyrone containing pentacyclic intermediate in an NADPH&#8208;dependent manner, presumably via a cascade reactions including the reduction of the lactone carbonyl group, Aldol&#8208;type reaction, followed by a spontaneous &#947;&#8208;lactone ring formation, and aromatization. Our work reveals an unprecedented function of a ketoreductase that contributes to generate structural complexity of aromatic polyketide.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step enzymatic labeling reveals a critical role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in cell&#8208;cycle progression and DNA damage response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>O&#8208;linked  N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAcylation) is a ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modification of proteins that is essential for cell function. Perturbation of  O&#8208;GlcNAcylation leads to altered cell&#8208;cycle progression and DNA damage response. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we develop a highly sensitive one&#8208;step enzymatic strategy for capture and profiling  O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins in cells. Using this strategy, we discover that flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), an essential enzyme in DNA synthesis, is a novel substrate for  O&#8208;GlcNAcylation. FEN1  O&#8208;GlcNAcylation is dynamically regulated during the cell cycle.  O&#8208;GlcNAcylation at the serine 352 of FEN1 disrupts its interaction with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) at the replication foci, and leads to altered cell cycle, defects in DNA replication, accumulation of DNA damage, and enhanced sensitivity to DNA damage agents. Thus, our study provides a sensitive method for profiling  O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins, and reveals an unknown mechanism of  O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in regulating cell cycle progression and DNA damage response.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy for Instantaneous and Continuous Synthesis of Ultrasmall Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasmall metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) may generate unique properties to expand the scope of applications. However, the synthesis is still a great challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize ultrasmall MOFs by high gravity technology. With the aid of tremendous intensification of molecular mixing and mass transfer in high&#8208;gravity field, six typical MOFs were obtained instantaneously in a continuous way. These samples are monodispersed with sub&#8208;5 nm in size, smaller than the previously reported values and even close to the length of one crystal unit cell. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, catalytic activity for Knoevenagel reaction can be significantly enhanced using ultrasmall ZIF&#8208;8. Conversion time of benzaldehyde was decreased by 94 % or 75 % compared to those using conventional or hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8. More importantly, this approach is readily scalable with the highest space&#8208;time yield for nano&#8208;MOFs, which may promote the convenient synthesis and practical applications of ultrasmall MOFs in large&#8208;scale.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize ultrasmall MOFs by high gravity technology. With the aid of tremendous intensification of molecular mixing and mass transfer in high-gravity field, six typical MOFs were obtained instantaneously in a continuous way. These samples are monodispersed with sub-5 nm in size, smaller than the previously reported values and even close to the length of one crystal unit cell. As a proof-of-concept, catalytic activity for Knoevenagel reaction can be significantly enhanced using ultrasmall ZIF-8. Conversion time of benzaldehyde was decreased by 94 % or 75 % compared to those using conventional or hierarchically porous ZIF-8. More importantly, this approach is readily scalable with the highest space-time yield for nano-MOFs, which may promote the convenient synthesis and practical applications of ultrasmall MOFs in large-scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane Catalyzed Carbenium Ion Generation and Autocatalytic Pyrazole Synthesis &#8212; A Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, metal&#8208;free organic synthesis using triarylboranes as catalysts has become a prevalent research area. Herein we report a comprehensive computational and experimental study for the synthesis of highly selective N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles through the generation of carbenium species from the reaction between aryl esters and vinyl diazoacetates in presence of catalytic tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3  ]. DFT studies were undertaken to illuminate the reaction mechanism revealing that the in&#8208;situ generation of a carbenium species acts as an autocatalyst to prompt the formation of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles regiospecifically in good to excellent yields (up to 81%).</dc:description>

         <title>Predesign of Catalytically Active Sites via Stable Coordination Cluster Model System for Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purposefully designing the well&#8208;defined catalysts for the selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4 is an extremely important but challenging work. In this work, three crystalline trinuclear copper clusters (Cu3&#8208;X, X= Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, NO3&#8722;) have been designed, containing three active Cu sites with the identical coordination environment and appropriate spatial distance, delivering high selectivity for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C2H4. The highest faradaic efficiency of Cu3&#8208;X for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion can be adjusted from 31.90% to 55.01% by simply replacing the counter anions (NO3&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;). The DFT calculation results verify that Cu3&#8208;X can facilitate the C&#8208;C coupling of identical *CHO intermediates, subsequently forming molecular symmetrical C2H4 product. This work provides an important molecular model system and a new design perspective for electroreduction of CO2 to C2 products with symmetrical molecular structure.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a straightforward strategy to obtain enantioenriched silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzosiloles remains a challenging yet appealing synthesis venture due to their potential future application in chiral electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this context, all of the existing methods rely on Rh&#8208;catalyzed systems and are somewhat limited in scope. Herein, we disclose the first Ni(0)&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion process that enables the preparation of benzosiloles possessing tetraorganosilicon stereocenters in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The presented catalysis strategy is further applied to the asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic bis&#8208;silicon&#8208;bridged &#960;&#8208;extended systems. Preliminary studies reveal that such compounds exhibit pronounced fluorescence emission, Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;performance anode materials for potassium&#8208;based energy storage devices with long&#8208;term cyclability requires combined innovations from rational material design to electrolyte optimization. In this work, three&#8208;dimensional K  +  &#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti  3  C  2  T  x  MXene with enlarged interlayer distance has been constructed for efficient electrochemical potassium&#8208;ion storage. We found that the optimized solvation structure of the concentrated ether&#8208;based electrolyte leads to the formation of a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the K  +  &#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti  3  C  2  T  x  electrode, which is beneficial for interfacial stability and reaction kinetics. As a proof of concept, 3D K  +  &#8208;Ti  3  C  2  T  x  //activated carbon (AC) potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) have been assembled and exhibited promising electrochemical performances. These results highlight the significant roles of both rational structure design and electrolyte optimization for highly reactive MXene&#8208;based anode materials in energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of autophagy by a small molecule through covalent modification of LC3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The autophagic ubiquitin&#8208;like protein LC3 functions through interactions with LC3&#8208;interaction regions (LIRs) of other autophagy proteins including autophagy receptors, which stands out as a promising protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) target for the intervention of autophagy. Post&#8208;translational modifications like acetylation of Lys49 on the LIR&#8208;interacting surface could disrupt the interaction, offering an opportunity to design covalent small molecules interfering the interface. Through screening covalent compounds, we discover a small molecule modulator of LC3A/B that covalently modifies LC3A/B protein at Lys49. Activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) based evaluations reveal that a derivative molecule DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 exhibits a potent covalent reactivity and selectivity to LC3A/B in HeLa cells. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 compromises LC3B lipidation in vitro and in HeLa cells, leading to deficiency in the formation of autophagic structures and autophagic substrate degradation. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 could serve as a powerful tool for autophagy research as well as for therapeutic interventions.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Asymmetric Charge Distribution of Active Centers in Conjugated Polymers for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active center reconstruction is essential for searching high performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Usually, the ORR activity stems from the special electronic environment of active sites through charge redistribution. In this work, we introduce &#8220;asymmetry&#8221; strategy to adjust the charge distribution of active centers by precisely designing conjugated polymer (CP) catalysts with different degrees of asymmetry. We synthesized asymmetric backbone CP (  asy&#8208;PB  ) by modifying boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bonds (B&#8592;N) and asymmetric sidechain CP (  asy&#8208;PB&#8208;A  ) with different alkyl chain lengths. As a result, both CPs with backbone and sidechain asymmetry exhibit superior ORR performance to their symmetric counterparts (  sy&#8208;P  and  sy&#8208;PB  ). Interestingly,  asy&#8208;PB  with greater asymmetry degree shows higher catalytic activity than  asy&#8208;PB&#8208;A  with relatively smaller asymmetry. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the increased dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution caused by asymmetric structure endows the center carbon atom of bipyridine with efficient catalytic activity. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of asymmetric ORR active structures and this approach gives a new strategy to design high&#8208;performance non&#8208;metal electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Control of Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Cage via the Dissymmetrical Modulation of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature as well as life systems, the presence of asymmetrical and dissymmetrical structures with specific functions is extremely common. However, the construction of metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies based on dissymmetrical ligands still remains a considerable challenge for avoiding the generation of unexpected isomers with similar thermodynamic stabilities, especially for three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular structures. In this study, a strategy for the conformational control of metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages via the enhancement of ligand dissymmetry was proposed. Four dissymmetrical ditopic ligands were designed and synthesized. By increasing the dissymmetry of length or angle, conformations of assemblies were precisely controlled to form discrete  cis  &#8208;  Pd  n  L  2n  molecular cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Main Descriptors to correlate structures with performances of electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen/oxygen redox catalysis, which involves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, is crucial in determining the electrochemical performance of energy conversion and storage devices, such as water electrolysis, fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Traditional trial and error approaches to search for catalysts with high activity and stability are typically tedious and inefficient. The progress from these approaches to the rational design principle of catalysts is of great significance. To develop reasonable design strategies for catalytic materials, identifying the most important parameters in determining the catalytic performance is urgently required. The central issue is the energy scaling relationships and their derivatives&#8208;volcano plot, which facilitates the quantitative understanding of catalytic trends. In the past decades, several descriptors have been developed to unravel the structure&#8208;performance relationships. In this review, we summarize reactivity descriptors in electrocatalysis including adsorption energy descriptors involving reaction intermediates, electronic descriptors represented by a d&#8208;band center, structural descriptors, and universal descriptors, and discuss their merits/limitations. Understanding of the trends of the existing electrocatalytic performance and prediction of promising catalytic materials using reactivity descriptors should enable the rational construction of catalysts. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are expectedly adopted to discover new and advanced descriptors. Finally, we analyze the nature of linear scaling relationships and propose several strategies to circumvent or bypass the established scaling relationships to overcome the constraints imposed on the catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Restructuring of Cu&#8208;Doped SnS2 Nanoflowers for Highly Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With ever&#8208;increasing energy consumption and continuous rise in atmospheric CO  2  concentration, electrochemical reduction of CO  2  into chemicals/fuels is becoming a promising yet challenging solution. Sn&#8208;based materials are identified as attractive electrocatalysts for CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) to formate but suffer from insufficient selectivity and activity, especially at large cathodic current densities. In this work, we demonstrate that Cu&#8208;doped SnS  2  nanoflowers can undergo  in situ  dynamic restructuring to generate catalytically active S&#8208;doped Cu/Sn alloy for highly selective electrochemical CO  2  RR to formate over a wide potential window. Theoretical thermodynamic analysis of reaction energetics indicates that the optimal electronic structure of the Sn active site can be regulated by both S&#8208;doping and Cu&#8208;alloying to favor formate formation, while the CO and H  2  pathways will be suppressed. Our findings provide a rational strategy on electronic modulation of metal active site(s) for designing active and selective electrocatalysts towards CO  2  RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonylation of Alkenes towards 1,4&#8208;Diketones via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl compounds are intriguing motifs and versatile precursors in numerous pharmaceutical molecules and bioactive natural compounds. Direct incorporation of  two  carbonyl groups into a double bond at both ends is straightforward but extremely challengeable. Represented herein is the first example of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylation of alkenes by photocatalysis. Key to success is that N(  n  &#8208;Bu)  4  +  not only associates with alkyl anion to avoid protonation but also activates  &#945;  &#8208;keto acid to undergo electrophilic addition, where  &#945;  &#8208;keto acid is employed both for acyl generation and electrophilic addition. By tuning the reductive and electrophilic ability of acyl precursor, unsymmetric 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylation is achieved. This metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;neutral and regioselective 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylation of alkenes is executed only by a photocatalyst for versatile substrates under extremely mild condition that is appealing to great application prospect in biomolecular and drug molecular derivatization.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Resistive Switching Behavior through Embedding D&#8210;A System into 2D Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new materials for the fabrication of resistive random access memory is of great significance in this period of big data. Here, we present a novel design strategy of embedding donor (D) and acceptor (A) fragments into imine&#8208;linked frameworks to construct resistive switching covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for high&#8208;performance memristor. Following such strategy, two D&#8210;A type two&#8208;dimensional COFs, COF  &#8208;BT&#8208;TT  and COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT  , were designed and synthesized using conventional solvothermal approach. Moreover, high&#8208;quality COF thin films were deposited on ITO substrate with controllable thickness, and exhibited great potential in memristor as an active layer. The rewritable memristor based on 100 nm thick COF  &#8208;TT&#8208;BT  and COF  &#8208;TT&#8208;TVT  film showed a high ON/OFF current ratio of ~10^5  and 10^4  , and low driving voltage of 1.30 and 1.60 V, respectively. More importantly, the cycle period and retention time for COF  &#8208;TT&#8208;BT  based rewriteable devices were as high as 319 cycles and 3.3 x 10^4  s at a constant voltage of 0.1 V, respectively, which were twice than those of COF  &#8208;TT&#8208;TVT  memristor (160 cycles, 1.2 x 10^4  s). This work potentially provides a novel strategy to construct COF materials for highly efficient and stable nonvolatile memory devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Evidence on the Mechanism of Methane Conversion under Non&#8208;oxidative Conditions over Iron&#8208;modified Silica: The Role of Propargyl Radicals Unveiled</title>

The complex gas&#8208;phase reaction network present during methane conversion under non&#8208;oxidative conditions over iron&#8208;modified silica is unraveled, shedding light on the formation mechanism of C2+ hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated gas&#8208;phase reactions play an important role in the conversion of methane under non&#8208;oxidative conditions into olefins and aromatics over iron&#8208;modified silica catalysts. Herein, we use operando photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy to disentangle the elusive C2+ radical intermediates participating in the complex gas&#8208;phase reaction network. Our experiments pinpoint different C2&#8208;C5 radical species that allow for a stepwise growth of the hydrocarbon chains. Propargyl radicals (H2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;H) are identified as essential precursors for the formation of aromatics, which then contribute to the formation of heavier hydrocarbon products via hydrogen abstraction&#8211;acetylene addition routes (HACA mechanism). These results provide comprehensive mechanistic insights that are relevant for the development of methane valorization processes.

         <title>Interfaces and Interfacial Layers in Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the recent developments on interfaces in inorganic perovskite solar cells, with special focus on the fundamental understanding of how interfaces influence the performance of devices. Directions for developing highly efficient and stable inorganic perovskite solar cells by interface engineering are also provided.







Abstract
Owing to their superior thermal stability, metal halide inorganic perovskite materials continue to attract interest for photovoltaics applications. The highest reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) for solar cells based on inorganic perovskites is over 20&#8201;%. As this PCE corresponds to 73&#8201;% of the theoretical limit, there remains more room for further improving the device PCEs than for improving organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The main loss is in the photovoltage, which is limited by interfaces in terms of non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by traps and energy&#8208;level mismatch. Furthermore, inefficient charge extraction at interfacial contacts reduces the photocurrent and fill factor. This Minireview summarizes the recent developments in the fundamental understanding of how the interfaces and interfacial layers influence the performance of solar cells based on inorganic perovskite absorbers. An outlook for the development of highly efficient and stable inorganic PSCs from the interface point of view is also given.

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity NIR&#8208;II Multiplexed Lifetime Bioimaging with Bright Double Interfaced Lanthanide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a series of Er3+ doped double interface nanoparticles with resembled strong fluorescence intensity and differentiable fluorescence lifetimes for high&#8208;fidelity in vivo lifetime multiplexed imaging.







Abstract
Fluorescence lifetime imaging provides more possibility of in vivo multiplexing in second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. However, it still faces the obstacle that fluorescent probes with differentiable lifetime often exhibit quite different fluorescence intensity, especially the short lifetime usually accompanies with a weak fluorescence intensity, resulting in the difficulty for simultaneously decoding multiplexed lifetime information due to the interference of background noise. To facilitate high&#8208;fidelity lifetime multiplexed imaging, we developed a series of Er3+ doped double interface fluorescent nanoprobes (Er&#8208;DINPs): &#945;&#8208;NaYF4@NaErF4: Ce@NaYbF4@NaErF4: Ce@NaYF4 with strong fluorescence intensity and easily distinguishable fluorescence lifetime. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental results confirmed the advantage of these probes with comparable fluorescence intensity for high&#8208;fidelity multiplexed lifetime bioimaging.

         <title>Redox Ladder of Ni3 Complexes with Closed&#8208;Shell, Mono&#8208;, and Diradical Triphenylene Units: Molecular Models for Conductive 2D MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin coupling and electronic delocalization in trinickel clusters bridged by the radical&#8208;containing tritopic ligand 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaoxytriphenylene (HOTP) was investigated. The HOTP spin state and strength of Ni&#8208;HOTP magnetic coupling can be tuned by consecutive HOTP&#8208;centered redox processes. The results provide inspiration for the design of new molecular and solid&#8208;state magnetic and electrically conductive materials.







Abstract
We report the isolation and characterization of a series of trinickel complexes with 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaoxytriphenylene (HOTP), [(Me3TPANi)3(HOTP)](BF4)n (Me3TPA=N,N,N&#8208;tris[(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl]amine) (n=2, 3, 4 for complexes 1, 2, 3). These complexes comprise a redox ladder whereby the HOTP core displays increasingly quinoidal character as its formal oxidation state changes from &#8722;4, to &#8722;3, and &#8722;2 in 1, 2, and 3, respectively. No formal oxidation state changes occur on Ni, allowing the isolation of singlet diradical, monoradical, and closed&#8208;shell configurations for HOTP in 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with a concomitant decrease in the spin coupling strength upon oxidation. Because the three complexes can be considered models of the smallest building blocks of 2D conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks such as Ni9HOTP4, these results serve as possible inspiration for the construction of extended materials with targeted electric and magnetic properties.

         <title>Controlling Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells Using Multiplexed Conditional Guide RNAs for Cas12a**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conditional processing of Pol&#8201;II&#8208;transcribed Cas12a gRNAs for gene activation using three different activation modalities was achieved: RISC&#8208;based cleavage, an aptazyme, and an RNA strand displacement mechanism. Several switchable guide RNAs along with Cas12a itself can be integrated on a single transcript using a stabilizing triplex motif.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal control of the activity of CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) proteins is of considerable interest for basic research and therapeutics. Here, we show that conditional guide RNAs (gRNAs) for Cas12a can be transcribed in mammalian cells by RNA polymerase II, followed by activation via input&#8208;dependent processing of the 3&#8242; tail of the gRNA transcript. We demonstrate processing using an RNA strand displacement mechanism, as well as microRNA&#8208;dependent processing, and cleavage by a guanine&#8208;responsive ribozyme. We further demonstrate that Cas12a along with several independently switchable gRNAs can be compactly integrated on a single transcript using stabilizing RNA triplexes, providing a route towards Cas12a&#8208;based gene regulation constructs with multi&#8208;input switching capabilities. The principle is shown to work in HEK and mouse fibroblast cells using luminescence, fluorescence, and is also demonstrated for the conditional upregulation of an endogenous gene.

         <title>Dichloro Butenediamides as Irreversible Site&#8208;Selective Protein Conjugation Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maleic acid derivatives are studied as cysteine&#8208;selective reagents for protein labelling with comparable kinetics and superior stability to existing reagents. A novel mechanism is described to readily access stable chloro&#8208;maleamic acid. The mild conditions, fast kinetics, and irreversible conjugation make this method an appealing alternative to existing cysteine&#8208;targeted methods.







Abstract
We describe maleic&#8208;acid derivatives as robust cysteine&#8208;selective reagents for protein labelling with comparable kinetics and superior stability relative to maleimides. Diamide and amido&#8208;ester derivatives proved to be efficient protein&#8208;labelling species with a common mechanism in which a spontaneous cyclization occurs upon addition to cysteine. Introduction of chlorine atoms in their structures triggers ring hydrolysis or further conjugation with adjacent residues, which results in conjugates that are completely resistant to retro&#8208;Michael reactions in the presence of biological thiols and human plasma. By controlling the microenvironment of the reactive site, we can control selectivity towards the hydrolytic pathway, forming homogeneous conjugates. The method is applicable to several scaffolds and enables conjugation of different payloads. The synthetic accessibility of these reagents and the mild conditions required for fast and complete conjugation together with the superior stability of the conjugates make this strategy an important alternative to maleimides in bioconjugation.

         <title>Mechanical Force for the Transformation of Aziridine into Imine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When cis&#8208;N&#8208;phthalimidoaziridine is incorporated into a macromolecular backbone, it undergoes structural transformation into an imine by mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;migration of the N&#8208;phthalimido group. The migration occurs under mechanochemical conditions but not thermal conditions. The imine is further hydrolyzed in the presence of water under ambient conditions, resulting in an amine and aldehyde.







Abstract
Force&#8208;selective mechanochemical reactions may be important for applications in polymer mechanochemistry, yet it is difficult to achieve such reactions. This paper reports that cis&#8208;N&#8208;phthalimidoaziridine incorporated into a macromolecular backbone undergoes migration of N&#8208;phthalimido group to afford imine under mechanochemical condition and not thermal one. The imine is further hydrolyzed by water bifurcating into amine and aldehyde. These structural transformations are confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopic analyses. Computational simulations are conducted for the aziridine mechanophore to propose the mechanism of reaction and define the substrate scope of reaction.

         <title>Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybridization Engineering of Polyperylenediimide Cathodes for Efficient Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PDI@Fe&#8208;Sn@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx is smartly designed and exhibits superb potassium&#8208;storage properties, thanks to its unique properties including abundant contactable active sites, Fe/Sn&#8211;N3 bonds, electronic polarization, and strong coordination interactions, as shown by detailed experiments and theoretical calculations/simulations.







Abstract
Polyperylenediimide (PDI) is always subject to its modest conductivities, limited reversible active sites and inferior stability for potassium storage. To address these issues, herein, we firstly propose an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid (PDI@Fe&#8208;Sn@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx), where Fe/Sn single atoms are bound to the N&#8208;doped MXenes (N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) via the unsaturated Fe/Sn&#8211;N3 bonds, and functionalized with PDI via d&#8211;&#960; hybridization, forming a high conjugated &#948; skeleton. The resulted hybrid cathode endowed with enhanced electronic/ionic conductivities, lowered dissociation barriers of multiple redox centers and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase layer displays a 14&#8208;electron involved high&#8208;rate capacities and long cycle life. Moreover, it shows competitive performance in full cells even under different folding states and low operating temperatures.

         <title>Thermoneutral N&#8722;H Bond Activation of Ammonia by a Geometrically Constrained Phosphine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometrically constrained phosphine bearing an NNS pincer ligand is reported. The steric and electronic parameters were tuned to allow for unprecedented reversible ammonia activation via N&#8722;H bond scission. The phosphine's electronic structure and the associated reaction mechanism of N&#8722;H bond scission are elucidated by derivatization reactions and computational methods.







Abstract
A geometrically constrained phosphine bearing a tridentate NNS pincer ligand is reported. The effect of the geometric constraint on the electronic structure was probed by theoretical calculations and derivatization reactions. Reactions with N&#8722;H bonds result in formation of cooperative addition products. The thermochemistry of these transformations is strongly dependent on the substrate, with ammonia activation being thermoneutral. This represents the first example of a molecular compound that reversibly activates ammonia via N&#8722;H bond scission in solution upon mild heating.

         <title>Chiral TADF&#8208;Active Polymers for High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a chiral donor&#8211;acceptor copolymerization strategy, two pairs of chiral nonconjugated TADF polymers with low &#916;EST values and high PLQYs were constructed. The corresponding solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibited intense CPEL signals and high device efficiencies with an EQEmax of up to 22.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
A strategy of chiral donor&#8211;acceptor copolymerization is proposed to develop chiral nonconjugated polymers with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Based on this strategy, two pairs of chiral polymers (R,R)&#8208;/(S,S)&#8208;pTpAcDPS and (R,R)&#8208;/(S,S)&#8208;pTpAcBP were synthesized. The alternating copolymerization of the chiral donors and acceptors could effectively separate the frontier molecular orbitals, which made the polymers show small &#916;EST of 0.01&#8211;0.03&#8197;eV and efficient TADF properties. Moreover, the polymers also showed the quantum yield of up to 92&#8201;% and the circularly polarized luminescence. The solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes showed circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with high external quantum efficiencies of up to 22.1&#8201;% and maximum luminance of up to 34350&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This is the first report of CP&#8208;OLEDs based on chiral TADF polymer, which provides a useful and valuable guidance for the development of high&#8208;efficiency CPEL polymers.

         <dc:description>
For discovery of novel RNA modifications, a stringent workflow for structure validation is necessary to avoid misinterpretation of artifacts. The comparison of the synthetic standard to the native compound's retention time, full mass spectrum, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrum and metabolic isotope labeling allow for confident identification of RNA modifications.







Abstract
In this report, we perform structure validation of recently reported RNA phosphorothioate (PT) modifications, a new set of epitranscriptome marks found in bacteria and eukaryotes including humans. By comparing synthetic PT&#8208;containing diribonucleotides with native species in RNA hydrolysates by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (MS), metabolic stable isotope labeling, and PT&#8208;specific iodine&#8208;desulfurization, we disprove the existence of PTs in RNA from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, human cell lines, and mouse brain. Furthermore, we discuss how an MS artifact led to the initial misidentification of 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methylated diribonucleotides as RNA phosphorothioates. To aid structure validation of new nucleic acid modifications, we present a detailed guideline for MS analysis of RNA hydrolysates, emphasizing how the chosen RNA hydrolysis protocol can be a decisive factor in discovering and quantifying RNA modifications in biological samples.

         <title>Noncovalent CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions in Phosphoramidite Palladium(II) Complexes with Strong Conformational Preference</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Weak noncovalent interactions and flexibility of ligands play a key role in enantioselective metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. In transition metal complexes and their catalytic applications, the experimental assessment and the design of key interactions is as difficult as the prediction of the enantioselectivities, especially for flexible, privileged ligands such as chiral phosphoramidites. Therefore, the interligand interactions in cis&#8208;Pd(II)L2Cl2 phosphoramidite complexes were investigated by NMR and computations. We were able to induce a strong conformational preference by breaking the symmetry of the C2&#8208;symmetric ligand side chain of one of the ligands, and shift the equilibrium between hetero&#8208; and homocomplexes towards heterocomplexes because of interligand interactions in the cis&#8208;complexes. The modulation of aryl substituents was exploited, along with the solvent effect. The combined CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions reveal design patterns for binding and folding of chiral ligands and catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective 1H&#945; NMR methods to reveal functionally relevant proline cis/trans isomers in IDPs: characterization of minor forms, effects of phosphorylation and occurrence in proteome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identification of proline  cis/trans  isomers appearing in several regulatory mechanisms of proteins and characterization of minor species present due to the conformational heterogeneity in IDPs is highly important. To obtain residue level information on these mobile systems we introduce two  1  H  &#945;  &#8208;detected, proline selective, real&#8208;time homodecoupled NMR experiments and analyze the proline abundant transactivation domain of p53. The measurements are sensitive enough to identify minor conformers present in 4&#8208;15% amounts, moreover we show the consequences of CK2 phosphorylation on the  cis/trans  &#8208;proline equilibrium. Using our results and available literature data we perform a statistical analysis on how the amino acid type effects the  cis/trans  proline distribution. The methods are applicable under physiological conditions, and they can contribute to find key proline isomers in proteins and statistical analysis results may help in amino acid sequence optimization for biotechnological purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene&#8208;copper/cobalt hybrids via Lewis acidic molten salts etching for high performance symmetric supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes have attracted great interests as supercapacitors due to their metallic conductivity, high density, and hydrophilic nature. Herein we report Ti3C2&#8208;Cu/Co hybrids via molten salt etching in which the existence of metal atoms and their interactions with MXene via surficial O atoms were elucidated by XAFS for the first time. The electrochemical investigation of Ti3C2&#8208;Cu electrode demonstrated the pseudocapacitive contribution of Cu and a splendid specific capacitance of 885.0 F g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 in 1.0 M H2SO4. Symmetric supercapacitor Ti3C2&#8208;Cu//Ti3C2&#8208;Cu was demonstrated with operating voltage of 1.6 V, areal capacitance of 290.5 mF cm&#8208;2 at 1 mA cm&#8208;2, and stability over 10000 cycles. It delivered an areal energy density of 103.3 &#956;Wh cm&#8208;2 at power density of 0.8 mW cm&#8208;2, based on which a supercapacitor pouch was fabricated. It provides deeper insights into the molten salt mechanism and strategies for designing MXene&#8208;based materials for electrochemical energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterizing Conformational Distribution in Amorphous Film of Organic Emitter and Its Application in &#8220;Self&#8208;Doping&#8221; Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conformational distributions and mutual interconversions of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters significantly affect the exciton utlization. However, their influence of photophysics in amorphous film states are still underdevelopment due to the lack of a suitable quantitative analysis method. Herein, by using temperature dependent time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we quantitatively measured the relative populations of the conformations of a TADF emitter for the first time which not only help deepen the understanding of conformational distributions of TADF emitters, but also provide an aspect to analyze the overall properties of organic amorphous films for other applications. In terms of conformational distribution aspect, we further propose a new concept of &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; for realizing high&#8208;efficiency nondoped OLEDs. Interestingly, this &#8220;compositionally&#8221; pure film actually behaves as a film with dopant (quasi&#8208;equatorial form) in a matrix (quasi&#8208;axial form). The concentration&#8208;induced quenching that may seriously occur at high concentrations is thus expected to be effectively relieved. The &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; OLED by using newly developed TADF emitter TP2P&#8208;PXZ as a neat emitting layer, realizes a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4% and neglectable efficiency roll&#8208;off. This demonstrates high&#8208;performance in doped OLEDs can indeed be achieved with the present &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; emitting layer based on one single compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Repurposing &#960; Electrophilic Cyclization/Dealkylation for Group Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free regio&#8208; and stereocontrolled group&#8208;transfer route toward the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes is described. In this route, an electrophilic heterocyclization is followed by ring&#8208;opening group transfer. Specifically, a thioboration reaction transforms readily available alkynyl sulfide precursors into alkenyl boronates and alkenyl sulfides with defined regio&#8208; and stereochemistry in one synthetic step using commercially available  B&#8208;  chlorocatecholborane (ClBcat). Mechanistic studies identified the likely pathway as proceeding through zwitterionic rather than haloborated intermediates. The regio&#8208; and stereochemistry set in the initial cyclization step is preserved in the final acyclic alkene product, producing alkenes with up to four modifiable substituents with predictable regio&#8208; and stereochemistry. Downstream functionalization reactions showcase the versatility of the substitutions of the resulting alkenes. The mechanistic concept maps onto future reaction designs, given the abundance of known electrophiles and nucleophiles for electrophilic heterocyclization/dealkylation sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterojunction&#8208;based electron donators to stabilize and activate ultrafine Pt nanoparticles for efficient hydrogen atom dissociation and gas evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum (Pt) is the most effective bench&#8208;marked catalyst for producing renewable and clean hydrogen energy by electrochemical water splitting. There is demand for high HER catalytic activity to achieve efficient utilization and minimize the loading of Pt in catalysts.  In this work, we significantly boost  the HER mass activity of Pt nanoparticles in  Pt  x  /Co to 8.3 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C by using Co/NC heterojunctions as a heterogeneous version of electron donors. The highly coupled interfaces between Co/NC and Pt metal enrich the electron density of Pt nanoparticles to facilitate the adsorption of H  +  , the dissociation of Pt&#8208;H bonds and H  2  release, giving the lowest HER overpotential of 6.9 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm  2  in acid among reported HER electrocatalysts. Given the easy scale&#8208;up synthesis due to the stabilization of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles by Co/NC solid ligands,  Pt  x  /Co  can even be a promising substitute for commercial Pt/C for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We anticipate high&#8208;valent metal fluoride species will be highly effective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) oxidants because of the magnitude of the H&#8211;F bond (in the product) that drives HAT oxidation.

         <title>Highly Perfluorinated Covalent Triazine Frameworks Derived from&#160;a Low&#8208;Temperature Ionothermal&#160;Approach Towards Enhanced&#160;CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluorinated covalent triazine frameworks (F&#8208;CTFs) have shown unique features and attractive performance in separation and catalysis. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;art F&#8208;CTFs synthesized via the ZnCl  2  &#8208;promoted procedure have quite low fluorine contents due to C&#8208;F bond cleavage induced by chloride (a Lewis base) and the harsh conditions deployed (400&#8208;700 &#176;C). Fabricating F&#8208;CTFs with high fluorine contents (&gt; 30 wt%) remains challenging. Herein, we present a low&#8208;temperature ionothermal approach (275 &#176;C) to prepare F&#8208;CTFs, which is achieved via polymerization of tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (TFPN) over the Lewis superacids, e.g., zinc triflimide [Zn(NTf  2  )  2  ] without side reactions. With low catalyst loading (equimolar), F&#8208;CTFs are afforded with high fluorine content (31 wt%), surface area up to 367 m  2  g  &#8208;1  , and micropores around 1.1 nm. The highly hydrophobic F&#8208;CTF&#8208;1 exhibits good capability to boost electroreduction of CO  2  to CO, with faradaic efficiency of 95.7% at &#8722;0.8 V and high current density (&#8722;141 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) surpassing most of the metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation Effect on the Improved Sodium Storage Performance of N&#8208;heteropentacenequinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of electrode material is correlated with the choice of electrolyte, however, how the solvation has significant impact on electrochemical behavior is underdeveloped. Herein, N&#8208;heteropentacenequinone (TAPQ) is investigated to reveal the solvation effect on the performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries in different electrolyte environment. TAPQ cycled in diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits superior electrochemical performance, but experiences a rapid capacity fading in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. The function of solvation effect is mainly embodied in two aspects: one is the stabilization of anion intermediate via the compatibility of electrode and electrolyte, the other is the interfacial electrochemical characteristics influenced by solvation sheath structure. By revealing the failure mechanism, this work presents an avenue for better understanding electrochemical behavior and enhancing performance from the angle of solvation effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Benzothiophene Synthesis via Enantiospecific Coupling of Benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides with Boronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzothiophenes are valuable heterocycles that are widely used in medicines, agrochemicals, and materials science. Herein, we report a general method for the synthesis of enantioenriched 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzothiophenes via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C2&#8208;alkylation of benzothiophenes with boronic esters. The reactions utilize benzothiophene  S  &#8208;oxides in lithiation&#8211;borylations to generate intermediate arylboronate complexes, and subsequent Tf  2  O&#8208;promoted S&#8722;O bond cleavage to trigger a Pummerer&#8208;type 1,2&#8208;metalate shift, which gives the coupled products with complete enantiospecificity. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl boronic esters and aryl boronic esters are successfully coupled with a range of C3&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes. Importantly, this transformation does not require the use of C3 directing groups, therefore it overcomes a major limitation of previously developed transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated C2 alkylations of benzothiophenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;[7]helicenocyanine and Its Discrete &#960;&#8208;Stacked Homochiral Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc phthalocyanine&#8208;[7]helicene hybrid molecular structure forms a discrete homochiral dimer and exhibits chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior also in a racemic mixture. The self&#8208;assembled dimeric structure shows remarkable stability in solution and the solid state, as well as effective electronic communication. The [7]helicene units induce an intense CD effect to the characteristic absorption band in the NIR region of phthalocyanine.







Abstract
In this communication, we demonstrate a novel approach to prepare a discrete dimer of chiral phthalocyanine (Pc) by exploiting the flexible molecular geometry of helicenes, which enables structural interlocking and strong aggregation tendency of Pcs. Synthesized [7]helicene&#8208;Pc hybrid molecular structure, zinc&#8208;[7]helicenocyanine (Zn&#8208;7HPc), exclusively forms a stable dimeric pair consisting of two homochiral molecules. The dimerization constants were estimated to be as high as 8.96&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 3.42&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1 in THF and DMSO, respectively, indicating remarkable stability of dimer. In addition, Zn&#8208;7HPc exhibited chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior, which resulted in preferential formation of a homochiral dimer also in the racemic sample. Two phthalocyanine subunits in the dimeric form strongly communicate with each other as revealed by a large comproportionation constant and observation of an IV&#8208;CT band for the thermodynamically stable mixed&#8208;valence state.

         <dc:description>
This Review discusses progress on principles and methods for creating nanoparticle&#8208;based materials via programmable self&#8208;assembly. We review the pathways by which DNA&#8208;based assembly has been used to impart organization to prescribed particles. DNA, as a programmable structural element, can be used to create designer nanomaterials from inorganic and organic nanoparticles of multiple types and functionalities.







Abstract
Nanoparticles have long been recognized for their unique properties, leading to exciting potential applications across optics, electronics, magnetism, and catalysis. These specific functions often require a designed organization of particles, which includes the type of order as well as placement and relative orientation of particles of the same or different kinds. DNA nanotechnology offers the ability to introduce highly addressable bonds, tailor particle interactions, and control the geometry of bindings motifs. Here, we discuss how developments in structural DNA nanotechnology have enabled greater control over 1D, 2D, and 3D particle organizations through programmable assembly. This Review focuses on how the use of DNA binding between nanocomponents and DNA structural motifs has progressively allowed the rational formation of prescribed particle organizations. We offer insight into how DNA&#8208;based motifs and elements can be further developed to control particle organizations and how particles and DNA can be integrated into nanoscale building blocks, so&#8208;called &#8220;material voxels&#8221;, to realize designer nanomaterials with desired functions.

         <title>Conformational Adaptation of &#946;&#8208;Peptide Foldamers for the Formation of Metal&#8211;Peptide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag+&#8208;coordination&#8208;mediated assembly of &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers led to the formation of distinctive metal&#8211;peptide frameworks with unique interwoven topologies. Formation of the network structures was accompanied by unusual conformational distortions of the foldamer ligands. These new metal&#8211;peptide frameworks built from modular foldamers may provide useful molecular platforms for further structural evolution and mechanistic investigation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;coordinated frameworks derived from small peptidic ligands have received much attention thanks to peptides&#8217; vast structural and functional diversity. Various peptides with partial conformational preferences have been used to build metal&#8211;peptide frameworks, however, the use of conformationally constrained &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers has not been explored yet. Herein we report the first metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;mediated assembly of &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers with 12&#8208;helical folding propensity. The coordination of Ag+ to the terminal pyridyl moieties afforded a set of metal&#8211;peptide frameworks with unique entangled topologies. Interestingly, formation of the network structures was accompanied by notable conformational distortions of the foldamer ligands. As the first demonstration of new metal&#8211;peptide frameworks built from modular &#946;&#8208;peptide foldamers, we anticipate that this work will be an important benchmark for further structural evolution and mechanistic investigation.

         <title>Oxyenamides as Versatile Building Blocks for a Highly Stereoselective One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;Diamino&#8208;2&#8208;ol&#8208;Scaffold Containing Three Continuous Stereocenters</title>

         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Oxyenamides are introduced as novel, highly versatile building blocks for the rapid construction of the 1,3&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;ol scaffold. A Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated reaction of 2&#8208;oxyenamides with acylimine precursors and a terminal nucleophile enables a modular assembly of the 1,3&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;ol structure bearing three continuous stereocenters with excellent levels of diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A highly diastereoselective one&#8208;pot synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;alcohol unit bearing three continuous stereocenters is described. This method utilizes 2&#8208;oxyenamides as a novel type of building block for the rapid assembly of the 1,3&#8208;diamine scaffold containing an additional stereogenic oxygen functionality at the C2 position. A stereoselective preparation of the required (Z)&#8208;oxyenamides is reported as well.

         <title>Identification of RNA Base Pairs and Complete Assignment of Nucleobase Resonances by Proton&#8208;Detected Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy at 100&#8197;kHz MAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed solid&#8208;state NMR experiments to detect base pair patterns in RNA. The experiments use high&#8208;sensitivity 1H&#8208;detection and allow site&#8208;specific assignment of base pairs to individual nucleotide spin&#8208;systems. In addition, the experiments yield full assignment of nucleobase resonances. The methodology is applicable to RNA embedded in particles of any size and provides rapid access to RNA secondary structure in biological complexes.







Abstract
Knowledge of RNA structure, either in isolation or in complex, is fundamental to understand the mechanism of cellular processes. Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) is applicable to high molecular&#8208;weight complexes and does not require crystallization; thus, it is well&#8208;suited to study RNA as part of large multicomponent assemblies. Recently, we solved the first structures of both RNA and an RNA&#8208;protein complex by ssNMR using conventional 13C&#8208; and 15N&#8208;detection. This approach is limited by the severe overlap of the RNA peaks together with the low sensitivity of multidimensional experiments. Here, we overcome the limitations in sensitivity and resolution by using 1H&#8208;detection at fast MAS rates. We develop experiments that allow the identification of complete nucleobase spin&#8208;systems together with their site&#8208;specific base pair pattern using sub&#8208;milligram quantities of one uniformly labelled RNA sample. These experiments provide rapid access to RNA secondary structure by ssNMR in protein&#8208;RNA complexes of any size.

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Coupling of Aliphatic N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide Esters with Polyfluoroaryl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative coupling of aliphatic N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters with polyfluoroaryl zinc reagents was achieved by dual photoredox and copper catalysis. This method allows the installation of alkyl groups on polyfluoroaryls with a wide range of F&#8208;content (2F&#8208;5F) and variable F&#8208;substitution patterns.







Abstract
Polyfluoroarenes are an important class of compounds in medical and material chemistry. The synthesis of alkylated polyfluoroarenes remains challenging. Here we describe a decarboxylative coupling reaction of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids with polyfluoroaryl zinc reagents (Zn&#8208;ArF) via synergetic photoredox and copper catalysis. This method readily converts primary and secondary alkyl carboxylic acids into the corresponding polyfluoroaryl compounds, which could have a wide range of F&#8208;content (2F&#8208;5F) and variable F&#8208;substitution patterns on the aryl groups. Broad scope and good functional group compatibility were achieved, including on substrates derived from natural products and pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic study revealed that a [Cu&#8208;(ArF)2] species could be responsible for the transfer of polyfluoroaryl groups to the alkyl radicals.

         <title>Construction of Function&#8208;Oriented Core&#8211;Shell Nanostructures in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Responsive Bacterial Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, core&#8211;shell heterostructures of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were fabricated via a stepwise ligand&#8208;grafting method. The UCNP &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation into visible ranges, which can further excite the HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; to achieve near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive photothermal and photodynamic bacterial inhibition.







Abstract
Exploration of effective ways to integrate various functional species into hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is critically important for their applications but highly challenging. In this study, according to the &#8220;bottle&#8208;around&#8208;ship&#8221; strategy, core&#8211;shell heterostructure of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and HOFs was fabricated for the first time via a ligand&#8208;grafting stepwise method. The UCNPs &#8220;core&#8221; can effectively upconvert near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation (980&#8197;nm) into visible light (540&#8197;nm and 653&#8197;nm), which further excites the perylenediimide&#8208;based HOF &#8220;shell&#8221; through resonance energy transfer. In this way, the nanocomposite inherits the high porosity, excellent photothermal and photodynamic efficiency, NIR photoresponse from two parent materials, achieving intriguing NIR&#8208;responsive bacterial inhibition toward Escherichia coli. This study may shed light on the design of functional HOF&#8208;based composite materials, not only enriching the HOF library but also broadening the horizon of their potential applications.

         <title>Isolable Geminal Bisgermenolates: A New Synthon in Organometallic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient method to obtain geminal bisenolates L2K2Ge[(CO)R]2 (R=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl (1&#8201;a,b), L=THF for (1&#8201;a) or [18]&#8208;crown&#8208;6 for (1&#8201;b)), a new synthon for the synthesis of organometallic reagents, is reported. Selected examples of electrophiles were used to display the efficiency of 1&#8201;a,b as new building in organometallic chemistry.







Abstract
We have synthesized the first isolable geminal bisenolates L2K2Ge[(CO)R]2 (R=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl (2&#8201;a,b), L=THF for (2&#8201;a) or [18]&#8208;crown&#8208;6 for (2&#8201;b)), a new synthon for the synthesis of organometallic reagents. The formation of these derivatives was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The UV/Vis spectra of these anions show three distinct bands, which were assigned by DFT calculations. The efficiency of 2&#8201;a,b to serve as new building block in macromolecular chemistry is demonstrated by the reactions with two different types of electrophiles (acid chlorides and alkyl halides). In all cases the salt metathesis reaction gave rise to novel Ge&#8208;based photoinitiators in good yields.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline (TH&#946;C) is not only a prevailing structural feature of many natural alkaloids but also a versatile synthetic precursor for a vast array of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. Asymmetric synthesis of C1&#8208;alkynyl TH&#946;Cs remains rarely explored and challenging. Herein, we describe the development of the two complementary approaches for the catalytic asymmetric alkynylation of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ions with up to 96% yield and 99%  ee  . The utility of chiral C1&#8208;alkynyl TH&#946;Cs was demonstrated by the collective total syntheses of seven indole alkaloids: harmicine, eburnamonine, desethyleburnamonine, larutensine, geissoschizol, geissochizine, and akuammicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenoxy Radical&#8208;induced Formation of Dual&#8208;Layered Protection Film for High&#8208;Rate and Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The uncontrollable dendrite growth of Li metal anode leads to poor cycle stability and safety concerns, hindering its utilization in high energy density batteries. Herein, a phenoxy radical Spiro&#8208;O8 is proposed as an artificial protection film for Li metal anode owing to its excellent film&#8208;forming capability and remarkable ionic conductivity. A spontaneous redox reaction between the Spiro&#8208;O8 and Li metal results in the formation of a uniform and highly ionic conductive organic film in the bottom. Meanwhile, the phenoxy radicals on surface of Spiro&#8208;O8 facilitate the decomposition of Li salt upon exposed to the ether electrolyte and lead the formation of LiF film on the top. Arising from the synergistic effects of inner high ionic&#160;conductive film and outer rigid film, stable Li plating/stripping can be realized at a high current density (4000 cycles at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) and a high areal capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8208;2  for 550 h with an ultrahigh Li utilization rate of 54.6%. As a proof of concept, this work shows a facile strategy to rationally fabricate dual&#8208;layered interfaces for Li metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition Mechanism of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease with Ketone&#8208;Based Inhibitors Unveiled by Multiscale Simulations.  Insights for Improved Designs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the results of classical and QM/MM simulations for the inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 3CL protease by a hydroxymethylketone inhibitor, PF&#8208;00835231. In the noncovalent complex the carbonyl oxygen atom of the warhead is placed in the oxyanion hole formed by residues 143 to 145, while P1&#8208;P3 groups are accommodated in the active site with similar interactions to those observed for the peptide substrate. According to alchemical free energy calculations, the P1&#8217; hydroxymethyl group also contributes to the binding free energy. Covalent inhibition of the enzyme is triggered by the proton transfer from Cys145 to His41. This step is followed by the nucleophilic attack of the S&#947; atom on the carbonyl carbon atom of the inhibitor and a proton transfer from His41 to the carbonyl oxygen atom mediated by the P1&#8217; hydroxyl group. Computational simulations show that the addition of a methylchloride substituent to the P1&#8217; group may lower the activation free energy for covalent inhibition.</dc:description>

This step is followed by the nucleophilic attack of the S&#947; atom on the carbonyl carbon atom of the inhibitor and a proton transfer from His41 to the carbonyl oxygen atom mediated by the P1&#8217; hydroxyl group. Computational simulations show that the addition of a methylchloride substituent to the P1&#8217; group may lower the activation free energy for covalent inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative NHC/Photoredox Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Opening of Aryl Cyclopropanes to 1&#8208;Aroyloxylated&#8208;3&#8208;Acylated Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes are an important class of building blocks in organic synthesis. Herein, a ring&#8208;opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation cascade reaction for the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis is reported. The cascade works on monosubstituted cyclopropanes that are in contrast to the heavily investigated donor/acceptor cyclopropanes more challenging to be difunctionalized. The key step is a radical/radical cross coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle with a ketyl radical from the NHC catalysis cycle. The transformation features metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and tolerates a diverse range of functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper pairing in the mordenite framework as a function of the Cu(I)/Cu(II) speciation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of gas&#8208;phase reactants is used to treat a Cu&#8208;exchanged mordenite zeolite with the aim of studying the influence of the reaction environment on the formation of Cu pairs. The rearrangement of Cu ions to form multimeric sites as a function of their oxidation state was probed by X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), also by applying advanced analysis through Wavelet Transform, a method able to specifically locate Cu&#8208;Cu interactions also in the presence of overlapping contributions from other scattering paths. The nature of the Cu&#8208;oxo species formed upon oxidation was further crosschecked by DFT&#8208;assisted fitting of the EXAFS data and by resonant Raman spectroscopy. Altogether, the Cu(I)/Cu(II) speciation clearly correlates with Cu proximity, with metal ion pairs quantitatively forming under an oxidative environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Propargyl Esters and Alkynylsilanes: Synthesis of Vinylallene Derivatives through a Twofold 1,2&#8208;Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of propargyl esters with alkynylsilanes under gold catalysis provides vinylallene derivatives through consecutive [1,2]&#8208;acyloxy/[1,2]&#8208;silyl rearrangements. Good yields, full atom&#8208;economy, broad substrate scope, easily scale&#8208;up and low catalyst loadings are salient features of this novel transformation. Density Functional Therory (DFT) calculations suggest a reaction mechanism involving initial [1,2]&#8208;acyloxy rearrangement to generate a gold vinylcarbene intermediate which upon regioselective attack of the alkynylsilane affords a vinyl cation which undergoes a type II&#8208;dyotropic rearrangement involving the silyl group and the metal fragment. Preliminary results on the enantioselective version of this transformation are also disclosed.</dc:description>

         <title>A cryptic plant terpene cyclase producing unconventional 18&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic C25 and C20 terpenoids with immunosuppressive activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A versatile terpene synthase (LcTPS2) producing unconventional macrocyclic terpenoids was characterized from Leucosceptrum canum. Engineered E. coli and Nicotiana benthamiana expressing LcTPS2 produced six 18&#8208;/14&#8208;membered sesterterpenoids including five new ones and two 14&#8208;membered diterpenoids, representing the first macrocyclic sesterterpenoids from plants and the largest sesterterpenoid ring system identified to date. Surprisingly, none of these macrocyclic terpenoids were detected in L. canum. Two variants F516A and F516G producing approximately 3.3&#8208; and 2.5&#8208; folds respectively more sesterterpenoids than the wild type enzyme was engineered. Both 18&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered ring sesterterpenoids displayed significant inhibitory activity on the IL&#8208;2 and IFN&#8208;&#947; production of T cells via inhibition of MAPK pathway. The findings will contribute to the development of efficient biocatalysts to create bioactive macrocyclic sesterterpenoids, and also herald a new potential in the well&#8208;trodden territory of plant terpenoid biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>An Effective Strategy for Designing Nonlinear Optical Crystals by Combining the Structure&#8208;directing Property of Oxyfluorides with the Chemical Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rationally designing a high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal remains a great ongoing challenge. It involves not only the design of noncentrosymmetric structures but also property optimization. In this communication, a new strategy for effectively designing the NLO crystal has been put forward,  i.e.  using the structure&#8208;directing property of oxyfluoride anions to obtain a noncentrosymmetric and polar structure, and then by substitution of IO  3  &#8208;  for isovalent F  &#8208;  anions to further enhance the SHG response. With this strategy, a new  iodate fluoride  , Ba  2  [MoO  3  F(IO  3  )](MoO  3  F  2  ) has been successfully designed from the Ba  2  (MoO  3  F  2  )F  2  with the  cis&#8208;  directing [MoO  4  F  2  ]  4&#8208;  groups. It exhibits a large SHG response  (  ~8 &#215; KDP), a wide transparent region (0.30&#8722;10.92 &#956;m), a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LDT) (88.53 MW cm  &#8722;2  ), and a large birefringence (~0.264@532 nm). These indicate Ba  2  [MoO  3  F(IO  3  )](MoO  3  F  2  ) would be a promising NLO crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Interfacial Layer for Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The plating/stripping of Li dendrites can fracture the static solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cause significant dynamic volume variations in the Li anode, which give rise to poor cyclability and severe safety hazards. Herein, a tough polymer with a slide&#8208;ring structure was designed as a self&#8208;adaptive interfacial layer for Li anodes. The slide&#8208;ring polymer with a dynamically crosslinked network moves freely while maintaining its toughness and fracture resistance, which allows it can to dissipate the tension induced by Li dendrites on the interphase layer. Moreover, the slide&#8208;ring polymer is highly stretchable, elastic, and displays an ultrafast self&#8208;healing ability, which allows even pulverized Li to remain coalesced without disintegrating upon consecutive cycling. The Li anodes demonstrate greatly improved suppression of Li dendrite formation, as evidenced by the high critical current density (6 mA cm  &#8722;2  ) and stable cycling for the full cells with high&#8208;areal capacity LiFePO  4  , high&#8208;voltage NCM, and an S cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Polymer Nanocapsules via Redox Competition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer nanocapsules have demonstrated significant value in materials science and biomedical technology, but require complicated and time&#8208;consuming synthetic steps. We report here the facile synthesis of monodisperse polymer nanocapsules via a redox&#8208;mediated kinetic strategy from two simple molecules: dopamine and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol (BDT). Specifically, BDT forms core templates and modulates the oxidation kinetics of dopamine into polydopamine (PDA) shells. These uniform nanoparticles can be tuned between ~70 and 200 nm because the core diameter directly depends on BDT while the shell thickness depends on dopamine. The supramolecular core can then rapidly disassemble in organic solvents to produce PDA nanocapsules. Such nanocapsules exhibit enhanced physicochemical performance (e.g., loading capacity, photothermal transduction, and anti&#8208;oxidation) versus their solid counterparts. Particularly, this method enables a straightforward encapsulation of functional nanoparticles providing opportunities for designing complex nanostructures such as yolk&#8211;shell nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Deformable Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While organic polymers are available as low&#8208;weight, affordable, flexible and available semiconductors, organic crystals remain relatively unexplored for the same purpose. Here, we report the first organic semiconductor crystal with a unique combination of properties and can be used as a multifunctional optoelectronic device. We demonstrate that mechanically flexible single crystals of 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) can function as a phototransistor, photoswitch, and an optical waveguide. The material can exist as two structurally different solid phases, with single crystals of one of the phase being elastic at room temperature while those of the other are brittle and become plastic at higher temperature. The spectral sensitivity of a phototransistors based on BPEA crystals was studied under excitation from the visible to the near&#8208;IR region. The output and transfer characteristics of the devices were characterized by measuring the generation and temporal response of the switching of the photogenerated current. The current&#8211;voltage characteristics of both phases exhibit linearity and symmetry about the positive and negative voltages. Moreover, the crystals transmit light in the telecommunications range with significantly low optical loss for an organic crystalline material. The combination of optoelectronic properties in these mechanically compliant single crystals set the path to exploration of mechanically complaint organic single crystals as light&#8208;weight phototransistors, fiber&#8208;optic waveguides and filters for optical transduction of information.</dc:description>

         <title>Desulfonative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling of Sulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfonyl fluorides have emerged as powerful &#8220;click&#8221; electrophiles to access sulfonylated derivatives. Yet, they are otherwise relatively inert towards C &#8208; C bond forming transformations,&#160;&#160;notably under transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Here, we describe conditions under which aryl sulfonyl fluorides act as electrophiles for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. This desulfonative cross&#8208;coupling occurs selectively in the absence of base and, unusually, even in the presence of strong acids. Divergent one&#8208;step syntheses of two analogues of bioactive compounds showcase the expanded reactivity of sulfonyl fluorides to encompass both S&#8208;Nu and C&#8208;C bond formation. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest oxidative addition occurs at the C&#8208;S bond followed by desulfonation to form a Pd&#8208;F intermediate that facilitates transmetalation.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR spectroscopy of the main protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and fragment&#8208;based screening identify three protein hotspots and an antiviral fragment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main protease (3CLp) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the causative agent for the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, is one of the main targets for drug development. To be active, 3CLp relies on a complex interplay between dimerization, active site flexibility, and allosteric regulation. The deciphering of these mechanisms is a crucial step to enable the search for inhibitors. In this context, using NMR spectroscopy, we studied the conformation of dimeric 3CLp from the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and monitored ligand binding, based on NMR signal assignments. We performed a fragment&#8208;based screening that led to the identification of 38 fragment hits. Their binding sites showed three hotspots on 3CLp, two in the substrate binding pocket and one at the dimer interface. F01 is a non&#8208;covalent inhibitor of the 3CLp and has antiviral activity in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected cells. This study sheds light on the complex structure&#8208;function relationships of 3CLp, and constitutes a strong basis to assist in developing potent 3CLp inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Hindrance Drives the Boron&#8208;Initiated Polymerization of Dienyltriphenylarsonium Ylides to Photoluminescent C5&#8208;Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22469-22477, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new alkyl&#8208;substituted dienyltriphenylarsonium ylides was synthesized and used as monomers in the borane&#8208;initiated polymerization, achieving almost pure C5&#8208;polymer (95.8&#8201;%), with photoluminescent properties.







Abstract
A series of alkyl&#8208;subsituted dienyltriphenylarsonium ylides were synthesized and used as monomers in borane&#8208;initiated polymerization to obtain practically pure C5&#8208;polymers (main&#8208;chain grows by five carbon atoms at a time). The impact of triethylborane (Et3B), tributylborane (Bu3B), tri&#8208;sec&#8208;butylborane (s&#8208;Bu3B), and triphenylborane (Ph3B) initiators on C5 polymerization was studied. Based on NMR and SEC results, we have shown that all synthesized polymers have C5 units with a unique unsaturated backbone where two conjugated double bonds are separated by one methylene. The synthesized C5&#8208;polymers possess predictable molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions (Mn,NMR=2.8 &#8722;11.9&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#208;=1.04&#8211;1.24). It has been found that increasing the steric hindrance of both the monomer and the initiator can facilitate the formation of more C5 repeating units, thus driving the polymerization to almost pure C5&#8208;polymer (up to 95.8&#8201;%). The polymerization mechanism was studied by 11B&#8197;NMR and confirmed by DFT calculations. The synthesized C5&#8208;polymers are amorphous with tunable glass&#8208;transition temperatures by adjusting the substituents of monomers, ranging from +30.1&#8201;&#176;C to &#8722;38.4&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, they possess blue photoluminescence that changes to yellow illuminating the polymers for 5&#8197;days with UV radiation of 365&#8197;nm (IIE, isomerization induced emission).

         <title>Superatom&#8208;in&#8208;Superatom [RhH@Ag24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22293-22300, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom concept was demonstrated for the first time. A rhodium hydride (RhH) superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom [RhH@Ag24(SR)18]2&#8722; nanocluster. The Rh atom with open d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d85s1) could be incorporated into the Ag24(SR)18 framework by forming the RhH superatom resembling the closed d&#8208;shell Pd atom ([Kr]4d10).







Abstract
Heterometal doping is a powerful method for tuning the physicochemical properties of metal nanoclusters. While the heterometals doped into such nanoclusters predominantly include transition metals with closed d&#8208;shells, the doping of open d&#8208;shell metals remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first synthesis of a [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; nanocluster, in which a Rh atom with open d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d85s1) is incorporated into the Ag24 framework by forming a RhH superatom with closed d&#8208;shells ([Kr]4d10). Combined experimental and theoretical investigations showed that the Ag24 framework was co&#8208;doped with Rh and hydride and that the RhH dopant was a superatomic construct of a Pd atom. Additional studies demonstrated that the [RhHAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; nanocluster was isoelectronic to the [PdAg24(SPhMe2)18]2&#8722; nanocluster with the superatomic 8&#8208;electron configuration (1S21P6). This study demonstrated for the first time that a superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanocluster.

&lt;p&gt;The superatom-in-superatom concept was demonstrated for the first time. A rhodium hydride (RhH) superatom could be incorporated into a cluster superatom to generate a stable superatom-in-superatom [RhH@Ag&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; nanocluster. The Rh atom with open d-shells ([Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;5s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) could be incorporated into the Ag&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; framework by forming the RhH superatom resembling the closed d-shell Pd atom ([Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterometal doping is a powerful method for tuning the physicochemical properties of metal nanoclusters. While the heterometals doped into such nanoclusters predominantly include transition metals with closed d-shells, the doping of open d-shell metals remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first synthesis of a [RhHAg&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(SPhMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; nanocluster, in which a Rh atom with open d-shells ([Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;5s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is incorporated into the Ag&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; framework by forming a RhH superatom with closed d-shells ([Kr]4d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;). Combined experimental and theoretical investigations showed that the Ag&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; framework was co-doped with Rh and hydride and that the RhH dopant was a superatomic construct of a Pd atom.

         <title>Chalcogenides by Reduction of their Dioxides in Ultra&#8208;Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22570-22577, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unexpected reduction of selenium(IV) and tellurium(IV) oxides to chalcogenides was achieved under ultra&#8208;alkaline conditions by using As2O3 as reducing agent. By optimization of the reaction conditions, large crystals of K2Se3, K2Te3 and K2Se2Te were grown within two days. In the latter compound, the novel mixed chalcogenide anion (SeTe)2&#8722; was discovered.







Abstract
The reaction of chalcogen dioxides ChO2 (Ch=Se, Te) with As2O3 in a 30&#8197;molar KOH hydroflux at about 200&#8201;&#176;C yielded crystals of potassium trichalcogenides K2Ch3 with dimensions up to 2&#8197;cm. Arsenic trioxide acts as electron donor and is oxidized to arsenate(V). The new heterochalcogenide anion (TeSe2)2&#8722; formed when starting from SeO2 and TeO2 simultaneously. The compound K2TeSe2 crystallizes isostructural to K2S3 and K2Se3. The unexpected redox reaction as well as the precipitation of hygroscopic compounds from an aqueous solution are attributed to a strongly reduced activity of water. The reactions were studied by Raman and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Depending on the concentration of As2O3, colorless monochalcogenide Ch2&#8722; or orange Se22&#8722; and purple Te22&#8722; anions are dominating the solutions.

3D single&#8208;particle&#8208;tracking microscopy combined with a lock&#8208;in filtering algorithm for the quantitative observation of individual protein&#8211;nanoparticle (NP) interactions without surface immobilization is presented. This highly sensitive method, which can be applied in various protein&#8211;NP systems, gives insight into in&#8197;situ protein corona on a per&#8208;particle basis and provides the possibility to study transient protein&#8211;NP interactions.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) adsorb proteins when exposed to biological fluids, forming a dynamic protein corona that affects their fate in biological environments. A comprehensive understanding of the protein corona is lacking due to the inability of current techniques to precisely measure the full corona in&#8197;situ at the single&#8208;particle level. Herein, we introduce a 3D real&#8208;time single&#8208;particle tracking spectroscopy to &#8220;lock&#8208;on&#8221; to single freely diffusing polystyrene NPs and probe their individual protein coronas, primarily using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model system. The fluorescence signals and diffusive motions of the tracked NPs enable quantification of the &#8220;hard corona&#8221; using mean&#8208;squared displacement analysis. Critically, this method's particle&#8208;by&#8208;particle nature enabled a lock&#8208;in&#8208;type frequency filtering approach to extract the full protein corona, despite the typically confounding effect of high background signal from unbound proteins. From these results, the dynamic in&#8197;situ full protein corona is observed to contain twice the number of proteins compared to the ex&#8197;situ&#8208;measured &#8220;hard&#8221; protein corona.

An iron&#8208;catalyzed reductive cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylanilides to prepare a variety of N&#8208;heterocycles is reported. The reaction, which usually occurs at room temperature over a short reaction time, employs an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable iron catalyst and EtMgBr as a hydride source. The breadth of this strategy was demonstrated by the synthesis of densely substituted indoles, oxindoles and novel tetrahydrobenzoazepinoindolones, as well as the application towards the formal syntheses of bioactive compounds.







Abstract
A reductive cyclization to prepare a variety of N&#8208;heterocycles, through the use of ortho&#8208;vinylanilides, is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable iron complex and generally occurs at ambient temperature. The transformation likely proceeds through hydromagnesiation of the vinyl group, and trapping of the in&#8197;situ generated benzylic anion by an intramolecular electrophile to form the heterocycle. This iron&#8208;catalyzed strategy was shown to be broadly applicable and was utilized in the synthesis of substituted indoles, oxindoles and tetrahydrobenzoazepinoindolone derivatives. Mechanistic studies indicated that the reversibility of the hydride transfer step depends on the reactivity of the tethered electrophile. The synthetic utility of our approach was further demonstrated by the formal synthesis of a reported bioactive compound and a family of natural products.

         <title>Base&#8208;Activated Latent Heteroaromatic Sulfinates as Nucleophilic Coupling Partners in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22461-22468, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Next&#8208;generation, base&#8208;activated latent sulfinate reagents have been successfully developed for use in the construction of heteroaromatic frameworks, such as 2&#8208;arylpyridines. Under Pd&#8208;catalyzed conditions, these species unmask to give the sulfinate in situ, which then undergoes efficient desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with an array of (hetero)aryl halides.







Abstract
Heteroaromatic sulfinates are effective nucleophilic reagents in Pd0&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with aryl halides. However, metal sulfinate salts can be challenging to purify, solubilize in reaction media, and are not tolerant to multi&#8208;step transformations. Here we introduce base&#8208;activated, latent sulfinate reagents: &#946;&#8208;nitrile and &#946;&#8208;ester sulfones. We show that under the cross&#8208;coupling conditions, these species generate the sulfinate salt in situ, which then undergo efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with (hetero)aryl bromides to deliver a broad range of biaryls. These latent sulfinate reagents have proven to be stable through multi&#8208;step substrate elaboration, and amenable to scale&#8208;up.

     alt="Base-Activated Latent Heteroaromatic Sulfinates as Nucleophilic Coupling Partners in Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next-generation, base-activated latent sulfinate reagents have been successfully developed for use in the construction of heteroaromatic frameworks, such as 2-arylpyridines. Under Pd-catalyzed conditions, these species unmask to give the sulfinate in situ, which then undergoes efficient desulfinative cross-coupling with an array of (hetero)aryl halides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heteroaromatic sulfinates are effective nucleophilic reagents in Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions with aryl halides. However, metal sulfinate salts can be challenging to purify, solubilize in reaction media, and are not tolerant to multi-step transformations. Here we introduce base-activated, latent sulfinate reagents: &#946;-nitrile and &#946;-ester sulfones. We show that under the cross-coupling conditions, these species generate the sulfinate salt in situ, which then undergo efficient palladium-catalyzed desulfinative cross-coupling with (hetero)aryl bromides to deliver a broad range of biaryls. These latent sulfinate reagents have proven to be stable through multi-step substrate elaboration, and amenable to scale-up.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photodriven Elimination of Chlorine From Germanium and Platinum in a Dinuclear PtII&#8594;GeIV Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22352-22358, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel platinum dichloride complex supported by an ambiphilic bisphosphinodichlorogermane ligand photo&#8208;isomerizes into a tetravalent platinum trichloride germyl complex. Further irradiation of this new complex triggers the elimination of chlorine and the formation of a covalent Pt&#8211;Ge bond. Transient absorption spectroscopy points to the intermediacy of a charge&#8208;transfer complex involving the nascent chlorine atom and the aromatic ligand.







Abstract
Searching for a connection between the two&#8208;electron redox behavior of Group&#8208;14 elements and their possible use as platforms for the photoreductive elimination of chlorine, we have studied the photochemistry of [(o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)2GeIVCl2]PtIICl2 and [(o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)2ClGeIII]PtIIICl3, two newly isolated isomeric complexes. These studies show that, in the presence of a chlorine trap, both isomers convert cleanly into the platinum germyl complex [(o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)2ClGeIII]PtICl with quantum yields of 1.7&#8201;% and 3.2&#8201;% for the GeIV&#8211;PtII and GeIII&#8211;PtIII isomers, respectively. Conversion of the GeIV&#8211;PtII isomer into the platinum germyl complex is a rare example of a light&#8208;induced transition&#8208;metal/main&#8208;group&#8208;element bond&#8208;forming process. Finally, transient&#8208;absorption&#8208;spectroscopy studies carried out on the GeIII&#8211;PtIII isomer point to a ligand arene&#8211;Cl. charge&#8208;transfer complex as an intermediate.

         <title>A Borondifluoride&#8208;Complex&#8208;Based Photothermal Agent with an 80&#8201;% Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for Photothermal Therapy in the NIR&#8208;II Window</title>

A NIR&#8208;II absorbing BF2 complex with high photothermal performance was designed. The complex achieves a high photothermal conversion efficiency value of 80&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. In vivo studies reveal the great potential of the complex in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in the NIR&#8208;II window.







Abstract
Small organic photothermal agents (SOPTAs) that absorb in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) window are highly desirable in photothermal therapy for their good biocompatibility and deeper tissue penetration. However, the design of NIR&#8208;II absorbing SOPTAs remains a great challenge. Herein, we report that molecular engineering of BF2 complex via strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor conjugation and increasing the intramolecular motions is an efficient strategy to achieve NIR&#8208;II absorbing SOPTAs with high photothermal performance. Based on this strategy, a BF2 complex, BAF4, was designed and synthesized. BAF4 exhibits an intense absorption maximum at 1000&#8197;nm and negligible fluorescence. Notably, the nanoparticles of BAF4 achieve a high photothermal conversion efficiency value of 80&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation (0.75&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2). In vitro and in vivo studies reveal the great potential of BAF4 nanoparticles in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in the NIR&#8208;II window.

         <title>Discrete Heteropolynuclear Yb/Er Assemblies: Switching on Molecular Upconversion Under Mild Conditions</title>

The performance of discrete heteropolynuclear Yb/Er salts is switched from a Yb/Er doublet to competitive upconversion luminescence exploiting fluoride association. A more than 20&#8208;fold enhancement of the relative quantum yield &#981;UC under low power densities in non&#8208;deuterated solvents at room temperature was recorded.







Abstract
The salts {[Ln2Ln*(Hhmq)3(OAc)3(hfac)2]+ [Ln*(hfac)3(OAc)(MeOH)]&#8722;} (Hhmq=2&#8208;methanolquinolin&#8208;8&#8208;oxide, hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate; Ln, Ln*=Er, Gd, Yb) feature a discrete heteronuclear cation consisting of two types of lanthanide atoms. The quinolinoxy O&#8208;atom serves as a &#956;2&#8208;bridge to two Ln atoms and as a &#956;3&#8208;bridge to all three atoms, with metal&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;metal distances being around 3.7&#8197;&#197;. For 1 ([Yb2Er]+), near&#8208;infrared downshifted luminescence is switched to competitive upconversion luminescence upon irradiation by a 980&#8197;nm laser under an extremely low excitation power (0.288 W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) through introduction of fluoride ions. The stability of 1 after addition of fluoride was confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and multistage mass spectrometry, associated with the 1H&#8197;NMR of 6 ([La2Eu]+). More importantly, the at least 20&#8208;fold enhancement of the quantum yield in non&#8208;deuterated solvents at room temperature under low power densities (2&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) is the highest among the few molecular examples reported.

         <title>18.77&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Promoted by Aqueous Solution Processed Cobalt(II) Acetate Hole Transporting Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22554-22561, October 4, 2021. </description>

A robust hole transporting layer based on cobalt(II) acetate was developed by aqueous solution processing technology, low temperature thermal annealing and UV&#8208;ozone treatment, which enabled a record high&#8208;power conversion efficiency of 18.77&#8201;% of binary blend organic solar cells.







Abstract
A robust hole transporting layer (HTL), using the cost&#8208;effective Cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Co(OAc)2&#8901;4&#8201;H2O) as the precursor, was simply processed from its aqueous solution followed by thermal annealing (TA) and UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatments. The TA treatment induced the loss of crystal water followed by oxidization of Co(OAc)2&#8901;4&#8201;H2O precursor, which increased the work function. However, TA treatment differently realize a high work function and ideal morphology for charge extraction. The resulting problems could be circumvented easily by additional UVO treatment, which also enhanced the conductivity and lowered the resistance for charge transport. The optimal condition was found to be a low temperature TA (150&#8201;&#176;C) followed by simple UVO, where the crystal water in Co(OAc)2&#8901;4&#8201;H2O was removed fully and the HTL surface was anchored by substantial hydroxy groups. Using PM6 as the polymer donor and L8&#8208;BO as the electron acceptor, a record high PCE of 18.77&#8201;% of the binary blend OSCs was achieved, higher than the common PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based solar cell devices (18.02&#8201;%).

         <title>Key Features of Polyimide&#8208;Derived Carbon Molecular Sieves</title>

The chemical structures of fragments that are composed of CMS strands from varied polyimide precursors are similar, however, the texture or morphology structure is greatly affected by precursors, determining CMS membrane separation performance. The CMS properties can be tuned via controlling the strand&#8242;s structure, thereafter the plate and cellular structures, by designing precursor polymer chemical structure and pyrolysis conditions.







Abstract
Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes have impressive separation properties; however, both chemical and morphology structures need to be understood better. Here we characterize CMS with the simplest polyimide (PI) PMDA/pPDA (PMDA=pyromellitic dianhydride, pPDA=p&#8208;phenylenediamine), using FTIR, solid&#8208;state 15N&#8208;NMR and 13C&#8208;NMR, XPS, XRD, and Raman spectra to study chemical structure. We also compare gas separation properties for this CMS to a CMS derived from a more conventional PI precursor. The detailed characterization shows the presence of aromatic pyridinic, pyrrolic rings as well as graphitic, pyridonic components and a few other groups in both CMS types derived from the very different precursors. The CMS morphologies, while related to precursor and pyrolysis temperature details, show similarities consistent with a physical picture comprising distributed molecular sieving plate&#8208;like structures. These results assist in understanding diverse CMS membrane separation performance.

         <title>A Congruent&#8208;Melting Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Vanadate Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22447-22453, October 4, 2021. </description>

Access to the elusive mid&#8208;infrared by direct second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) enabled by a vanadate crystal is reported. Cs4V8O22 exhibits a wide transparent range, a strong SHG response, a large laser damage threshold and congruent&#8208;melting behavior. Quantum mechanical calculations demonstrate the key role played by its quasi&#8208;rigid layered structure in the improvement in linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical performance.







Abstract
Study of mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is hindered by the competing requirements of optimized second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) coefficient dij and laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT) as well as the harsh synthetic conditions. Herein, we report facile hydrothermal synthesis of a polar NLO vanadate Cs4V8O22 (CVO) featuring a quasi&#8208;rigid honeycomb&#8208;layered structure with [VO4] and [VO5] polyhedra aligned parallel. CVO possesses a wide IR&#8208;transparent window, high LIDT, and congruent&#8208;melting behavior. It has very strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG intensities in metal vanadate family (12.0 &#215; KDP @ 1064&#8197;nm and 2.2 &#215; AGS @ 2100&#8197;nm). First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the exceptional SHG responses of CVO largely originate from virtual electronic transitions within [V4O11]&#8734; layer; the excellent optical transmittance of CVO arises from the special characteristics of vibrational phonons resulting from the layered structure.

         <title>Ionic Functionalization of Multivariate Covalent Organic Frameworks to Achieve an Exceptionally High Iodine&#8208;Capture Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22432-22440, October 4, 2021. </description>

Multivariate covalent organic frameworks provide an ideal platform for ionic functionalization, enabling the integration of large surface areas, high pore volumes, and abundant binding sites, thereby leading to unprecedented levels of I2&#8208;capture performance under both static and dynamic adsorption conditions.







Abstract
Adsorption&#8208;based iodine (I2) capture has great potential for the treatment of radioactive nuclear waste. In this study, we apply a &#8220;multivariate&#8221; synthetic strategy to construct ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with a large surface area, high pore volume, and abundant binding sites for I2 capture. The optimized material iCOF&#8208;AB&#8208;50 exhibits a static I2 uptake capacity of 10.21&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C and a dynamic uptake capacity of 2.79&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8776;400&#8197;ppm I2 and 25&#8201;&#176;C, far exceeding the performances of previously reported adsorbents under similar conditions. iCOF&#8208;AB&#8208;50 also exhibits fast adsorption kinetics, good moisture tolerance, and full reusability. The promoting effect of ionic groups on I2 adsorption has been elucidated by experimentally identifying the iodine species adsorbed at different sites and calculating their binding energies. This work demonstrates the essential role of balancing the textural properties and binding sites of the adsorbent in achieving a high I2 capture performance.

         <title>Rapid Access to Ordered Mesoporous Carbons for Chemical Hydrogen Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22478-22486, October 4, 2021. </description>

Nitrogen&#8208;doped ordered porous carbon was synthesized by microwave heating using Fe3O4 nanoparticles as hard templates. The microwave&#8208;assisted method reduces the reaction time and provides highly ordered structure with large surface area and nitrogen doping. NaAlH4 was confined into the pores of the carbon scaffold and the hydrogen sorption kinetics is improved by the synergistic effects of nanoconfinement and nitrogen doping.







Abstract
Ordered mesoporous carbon materials offer robust network of organized pores for energy storage and catalysis applications, but suffer from time&#8208;consuming and intricate preparations hindering their widespread use. Here we report a new and rapid synthetic route for a N&#8208;doped ordered mesoporous carbon structure through a preferential heating of iron oxide nanoparticles by microwaves. A nanoporous covalent organic polymer is first formed in situ covering the hard templates of assembled nanoparticles, paving the way for a long&#8208;range order in a carbonaceous nanocomposite precursor. Upon removal of the template, a well&#8208;defined cubic mesoporous carbon structure was revealed. The ordered mesoporous carbon was used in solid state hydrogen storage as a host scaffold for NaAlH4, where remarkable improvement in hydrogen desorption kinetics was observed. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lowest activation energy of dehydrogenation as a single step was attributed to their ordered pore structure and N&#8208;doping effect.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as Molecular Sieve for Highly Selective Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Acetylene on Isolated Single Pd Atom Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22522-22528, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly selective acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation is realized using a polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework supported single Pd atom catalyst by creating dynamic confinement regions which preferentially adsorb acetylene from acetylene/ethylene gas mixtures and release the produced ethylene. This catalyst combines the advantages of MOFs for gas separation and single atomic sites for catalysis.







Abstract
Achieving highly selective acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation in an ethylene&#8208;rich gas stream is of great industrial importance. Herein, we construct isolated single Pd atom in a polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (POMOF). The unique internal environment allows this POMOF to separate acetylene from acetylene/ethylene gas mixtures and confine it close to the single Pd atom. After semi&#8208;hydrogenation, the resulting ethylene is preferentially discharged from the pores, achieving a selectivity of 92.6&#8201;%. First&#8208;principles simulations reveal that the adsorbed acetylene/ethylene molecules form hydrogen bond networks with oxygen atoms of SiW12O404&#8722; and create dynamic confinement regions, which preferentially release the produced ethylene. Besides, at the Pd site, the over&#8208;hydrogenation of ethylene exhibits a higher reaction energy barrier than the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene. The combined advantages of POMOF and single Pd atom provides an effective approach for the regulation of semi&#8208;hydrogenation selectivity.

         <title>Probing the Extremes of Covalency in M&#8722;Al bonds: Lithium and Zinc Aluminyl Compounds</title>

We report the synthesis of the first example of a molecular compound featuring a Li&#8722;Al bond and a systematic analysis of the bonding in this and related Mg and Zn systems through structural, quantum&#8208;chemical, and reactivity probes.







Abstract
Synthetic routes to lithium, magnesium, and zinc aluminyl complexes are reported, allowing for the first structural characterization of an unsupported lithium&#8211;aluminium bond. Crystallographic and quantum&#8208;chemical studies are consistent with the presence of a highly polar Li&#8722;Al interaction, characterized by a low bond order and relatively little charge transfer from Al to Li. Comparison with magnesium and zinc aluminyl systems reveals changes to both the M&#8722;Al bond and the (NON)Al fragment (where NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene), consistent with a more covalent character, with the latter complex being shown to react with CO2 via a pathway that implies that the zinc centre acts as the nucleophilic partner.

         <title>Feedback and Communication in Active Hydrogel Spheres with pH Fronts: Facile Approaches to Grow Soft Hydrogel Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22537-22546, October 4, 2021. </description>

pH fronts are generated from feedback&#8208;controlled reaction networks encapsulated in hydrogel spheres. The pH front/reaction diffusion chemistry is utilized to understand the systems such as membrane activity and inter&#8208;sphere communication. Further, its potential to develop smart self&#8208;growing materials as 2D and 3D hydrogel structures is showcased as an alternative to 3D printing tool.







Abstract
Compartmentalized reaction networks regulating signal processing, communication and pattern formation are central to living systems. Towards achieving life&#8208;like materials, we compartmentalized urea&#8208;urease and more complex urea&#8208;urease/ester&#8208;esterase pH&#8208;feedback reaction networks into hydrogel spheres and investigate how fuel&#8208;driven pH fronts can be sent out from these spheres and regulated by internal reaction networks. Membrane characteristics are installed by covering urease spheres with responsive hydrogel shells. We then encapsulate the two networks (urea&#8208;urease and ester&#8208;esterase) separately into different hydrogel spheres to devise communication, pattern formation and attraction. Moreover, these pH fronts and patterns can be used for self&#8208;growing hydrogels, and for developing complex geometries from non&#8208;injectable hydrogels without 3D printing tools. This study opens possibilities for compartmentalized feedback reactions and their use in next generation materials fabrication.

Butterfly&#8208;like oxacalix[2]arene[2]pyrazine molecules exhibit typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics through restriction of intramolecular vibrations. When used as ligands for the construction of MOFs, AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with multiple luminescence properties are produced.







Abstract
Butterfly&#8208;like molecules of oxacalix[2]arene[2]pyrazine (OAP) are reported, which exhibit the typical characteristics of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) via the restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV) mechanism. Unlike any of the reported RIV&#8208;type AIE molecules, the synthetic procedures of which are complicated and have associated high costs, OAP AIEgens can be synthesized in a facile manner by a one&#8208;step catalyst&#8208;free reaction using commercially available materials. Notably, OAP AIEgens are ideal ligands for constructing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their built&#8208;in pyrazine coordination sites. OAP&#8208;based MOFs exhibit multiple potential applications in reversible gas response, encrypted information storage, and construction of white light&#8208;emitting devices. This work builds on RIV&#8208;type AIEgens, offers additional selections of bridging ligands for constructing luminescent MOFs and provides a visualized prototype to understand the effect of the RIV process on the luminescence properties of MOFs.

Powerful combination of experimental methods and calculations highlights the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying stereoselective [4+2] cycloadditions catalyzed by a pair of decalin synthases, Fsa2 and Phm7, that catalyze intramolecular cycloadditions to form enantiomeric decalin scaffolds. Our proposed mechanism would open a new window on the enzymatic [4+2] cycloadditions.







Abstract
Enzymes catalyzing [4+2] cycloaddition have attracted increasing attention because of their key roles in natural product biosynthesis. Here, we solved the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of a pair of decalin synthases, Fsa2 and Phm7, that catalyze intramolecular [4+2] cycloadditions to form enantiomeric decalin scaffolds during biosynthesis of the HIV&#8208;1 integrase inhibitor equisetin and its stereochemical opposite, phomasetin. Computational modeling, using molecular dynamics simulations as well as quantum chemical calculations, demonstrates that the reactions proceed through synergetic conformational constraints assuring transition state&#8208;like substrates folds and their stabilization by specific protein&#8208;substrate interactions. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments verified the binding models. Intriguingly, the flexibility of bound substrates is largely different in two enzymes, suggesting the distinctive mechanism of dynamics regulation behind these stereoselective reactions. The proposed reaction mechanism herein deepens the basic understanding how these enzymes work but also provides a guiding principle to create artificial enzymes.

Computational modeling, using molecular dynamics simulations as well as quantum chemical calculations, demonstrates that the reactions proceed through synergetic conformational constraints assuring transition state-like substrates folds and their stabilization by specific protein-substrate interactions. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments verified the binding models. Intriguingly, the flexibility of bound substrates is largely different in two enzymes, suggesting the distinctive mechanism of dynamics regulation behind these stereoselective reactions. The proposed reaction mechanism herein deepens the basic understanding how these enzymes work but also provides a guiding principle to create artificial enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bending for Better: Flexible Organic Single Crystals with Controllable Curvature and Curvature&#8208;Related Conductivity for Customized Electronic Devices</title>

Self&#8208;bending organic single crystals of coronene with controlled width, length, and curvature are constructed for customized electronic micro&#8208;devices. The bending crystal device presents a huge improvement beyond seven orders of magnitude in the conductivity over the straight one, which benefited from both &#960; electron level changing and carrier mobility enhancement caused by the structural deformation in the bent regions.







Abstract
Electronic microdevices of self&#8208;bending coronene crystals are developed to reveal an unexplored link between mechanical deformation and crystal function. First, a facile approach towards length/width/curvature&#8208;controllable micro&#8208;crystals through bottom&#8208;up solution crystallization was proposed for high processability and stability. The bending crystal devices show a significant increase beyond seven orders of magnitude in conductivity than the straight ones, providing the first example of deformation&#8208;induced function enhancement in crystal materials. Besides, double effects caused by bending, including the change of &#960; electron level as well as the enhancement of carrier mobility, were determined, respectively by the X&#8208;ray photoelectric spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography to coexist, contributing to the conductivity improvement. Our findings will promote future creation of flexible organic crystal systems with deformation&#8208;enhanced functional features towards customized smart devices.

         <title>Activity Trends and Mechanisms in Peroxymonosulfate&#8208;Assisted Catalytic Production of Singlet Oxygen over Atomic Metal&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts</title>

A series of carbon&#8208;supported atomic metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts with similar structural and physicochemical properties were synthesized to uncover the activity trends and mechanisms in peroxymonosulfate&#8208;assisted reactive oxygen species production. Fe&#8208;SAC displays the best single&#8208;site kinetic value (1.65&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and the PMS&#8594;OH*&#8594;O*&#8594;1O2 is the most reasonable 1O2 reaction pathway.







Abstract
We synthesized a series of carbon&#8208;supported atomic metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts (M&#8208;SACs: M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) with similar structural and physicochemical properties to uncover their catalytic activity trends and mechanisms. The peroxymonosulfate (PMS) catalytic activity trends are Fe&#8208;SAC&gt;Co&#8208;SAC&gt;Mn&#8208;SAC&gt;Ni&#8208;SAC&gt;Cu&#8208;SAC, and Fe&#8208;SAC displays the best single&#8208;site kinetic value (1.65&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1&#8201;mol&#8722;1) compared to the other metal&#8208;N&#8208;C species. First&#8208;principles calculations indicate that the most reasonable reaction pathway for 1O2 production is PMS&#8594;OH*&#8594;O*&#8594;1O2; M&#8208;SACs that exhibit moderate and near&#8208;average Gibbs free energies in each reaction step have a better catalytic activity, which is the key for the outstanding performance of Fe&#8208;SACs. This study gives the atomic&#8208;scale understanding of fundamental catalytic trends and mechanisms of PMS&#8208;assisted reactive oxygen species production via M&#8208;SACs, thus providing guidance for developing M&#8208;SACs for catalytic organic pollutant degradation.

A catalytic carbonylative cleavage of carbon&#8211;carbon triple bonds is achieved. This allows for a general and direct synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated piperidones by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade carbonylation of alkynols.







Abstract
A direct and selective synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated piperidones by a new palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade carbonylation is described. In the presented protocol, easily available propargylic alcohols react with aliphatic amines to provide a broad variety of interesting heterocycles. Key to the success of this transformation is a remarkable catalytic cleavage of the present carbon&#8211;carbon triple bond by using a specific catalyst with 2&#8208;diphenylphosphinopyridine as ligand and appropriate reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies and control experiments revealed branched unsaturated acid 11 as crucial intermediate.

A high yielding and scalable metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step linear domino reaction results in functionalized triarylbenzene (TAB) and opens the door for making a broad variety of synthetically challenging hexaarylbenzene (HAB) molecules with six different aryl groups.







Abstract
Hexaarylbenzene (HAB) derivatives are versatile aromatic systems playing a significant role as chromophores, liquid crystalline materials, molecular receptors, molecular&#8208;scale devices, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and candidates for organic electronics. Statistical synthesis of simple symmetrical HABs is known via cyclotrimerization or Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. By contrast, the synthesis of more complex, asymmetrical systems, and without involvement of statistical steps, remains an unsolved problem. Here we present a generally applicable synthetic strategy to access asymmetrical HAB via an atom&#8208;economical and high&#8208;yielding metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step domino reaction using nitrostyrenes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanoolefins as easily available starting materials. Resulting domino product&#8212;functionalized triarylbenzene (TAB)&#8212;can be used as a key starting compound to furnish asymmetrically substituted hexaarylbenzenes in high overall yield and without involvement of statistical steps. This straightforward domino process represents a distinct approach to create diverse and still unexplored HAB scaffolds, containing six different aromatic rings around central benzene core.

         <title>O&#8208;to&#8208;S Substitution Enables Dovetailing Conflicting Cyclizability, Polymerizability, and Recyclability: Dithiolactone vs. Dilactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22547-22553, October 4, 2021. </description>

Dithiolactone monomers derived from abundant feedstocks show appealing chemical properties, including accelerated ring closure and polymerizability, high depolymerizability and selectivity. The derived polymers constitute a unique class of polythioester materials exhibiting controlled molecular weight, atactic yet high crystallinity, structural diversity, and chemical recyclability.







Abstract
Developing chemically recyclable polymers represents a greener alternative to landfill and incineration and offers a closed&#8208;loop strategy toward a circular materials economy. However, the synthesis of chemically recyclable polymers is still plagued with certain fundamental limitations, including trade&#8208;offs between the monomer's cyclizability and polymerizability, as well as between polymer's depolymerizability and properties. Here we describe the subtle O&#8208;to&#8208;S substitution, dithiolactone monomers derived from abundant feedstock &#945;&#8208;amino acids can demonstrate appealing chemical properties different from those of dilactone, including accelerated ring closure, augmented kinetics polymerizability, high depolymerizability and selectivity, and thus constitute a unique class of polythioester materials exhibiting controlled molecular weight (up to 100.5&#8197;kDa), atactic yet high crystallinity, structurally diversity, and chemical recyclability. These polythioesters well addresses the formidable challenges of developing chemically recyclable polymers by having an unusual set of desired properties, including easy&#8208;to&#8208;make monomer from ubiquitous feedstock, and high polymerizability, crystallinity and precise tunability of physicochemical performance, as well as high depolymerizability and selectivity. Computational studies explain why O&#8208;to&#8208;S modification of polymer backbone enables dovetailing desirable, but conflicting, performance into one polymer structure.

         <title>A Family of Heterobimetallic Cubes Shows Spin&#8208;Crossover Behaviour Near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22562-22569, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from simple building blocks, six heterobimetallic cubes were obtained, following a straight&#8208;forward subcomponent self&#8208;assembly strategy. Three iron(II) based cages showed spin&#8208;crossover behaviour in solution. The crossover temperature was strongly dependent on interchangeable aldehyde components, giving rise to an efficient toolkit to manipulate magnetic behaviour.







Abstract
Using 4&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8208;pyridyl)aniline as a simple organic building block in combination with three different aldehyde components together with metal(II) salts gave three different Fe8Pt6&#8208;cubes and their corresponding Zn8Pt6 analogues by employing the subcomponent self&#8208;assembly approach. Whereas the use of zinc(II) salts gave rise to diamagnetic cages, iron(II) salts yielded metallosupramolecular cages that show spin&#8208;crossover behaviour in solution. The spin&#8208;transition temperature T1/2 depends on the incorporated aldehyde component, giving a construction kit for the deliberate synthesis of spin&#8208;crossover compounds with tailored transition properties. Incorporation of 4&#8208;thiazolecarbaldehyde or N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazole&#8208;carbaldehyde yielded cages that undergo spin&#8208;crossover around room temperature whereas the cage obtained using 1H&#8208;4&#8208;imidazolecarbaldehyde shows a spin&#8208;transition at low temperatures. Three new structures were characterized by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and all structures were characterized by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy.

         <title>Regio&#8208;controllable Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Hydrosilylation/Hydroboration of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22454-22460, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208;controllable sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of alkynes has been developed with complete control of all the possible regioselectivities for the double addition processes (up to &gt;20/1 rr for all the cases). Various silylboronate regioisomers can be efficiently obtained from the same materials, with good functional group tolerance, regioselectivities as well as atom and pot economy.







Abstract
Regiodivergent addition reactions provide straightforward and atom&#8208;economic approaches to access different regioisomers. However, the regio&#8208;chemistry control to access all the possible results is still challenging especially for the reaction involving multiple addition steps. Herein, we reported regio&#8208;controllable cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of arylacetylenes, delivering all the possible regio&#8208;outcomes with high regioselectivities (up to &gt;20/1 rr for all the cases). Each regioisomer of value&#8208;added silylboronates could be efficiently and regioselectively obtained from the same materials. The adjustment of the ligands of cobalt catalysts combined with dual catalysis relay strategy is the key to achieve regio&#8208;chemistry control. This regio&#8208;controllable research might inspire the exploration of the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis that involves multiple additions and provide full sets of regioisomers of other synthetic useful molecules.

         <title>Dynamic Constitutional Frameworks as Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22505-22512, October 4, 2021. </description>

Dynamic constitutional frameworks are expressed in the presence of bacteria templating from dynamic covalent libraries made of aromatic cores, PEGylated connectors, and ionic heads. These templated DCFs further translate into the multivalent presentation of cationic heads, subsequently promoting antibacterial and antibiofilm activities.







Abstract
Dynamic constitutional frameworks (DCFs) were synthesized and screened for biofilm inhibition or disruption. They are composed of a trialdehyde core reversibly linked to a diamine PEG connector and to a variety of neutral, anionic, or cationic heads, to generate a library of DCFs to generate multivalent dendritic architectures in the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The best DCFs were always polycationic and the nature of the cationic heads significantly impact the antibiofilm activity. The best antibiofilm activity was observed for DCF3B, displaying a polyethyleneimine head. A simple inactive guanidinium functional head strongly inhibited biofilm growth when assayed as a multivalent DCF3C. Using a more advanced in vitro biofilm model of chronic wound infection, DCF3C was found significantly superior than all other DCFs. These results demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of DCFs as low cost and efficient systems for antibiofilm disruption.

         <title>Tetrapyrrolic Pigments from Heme&#8208; and Chlorophyll Breakdown are Actin&#8208;Targeting Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
The physiological role of the degradation products of chlorophyll and heme, exogenous phyllobilins and endogenous bilins, respectively, remained an unsolved mystery for decades. We describe the influence of these tetrapyrroles on the actin cytoskeleton and introduce G&#8208;actin as the first human target protein for phyllobilins and a novel target for bilins. This study opens up a new perspective of the importance of these ubiquitous natural products.







Abstract
Chlorophyll and heme are among the &#8220;pigments of life&#8221;, tetrapyrrolic structures, without which life on Earth would not be possible. Their catabolites, the phyllobilins and the bilins, respectively, share not only structural features, but also a similar story: Long considered waste products of detoxification processes, important bioactivities for both classes have now been demonstrated. For phyllobilins, however, research on physiological roles is sparse. Here, we introduce actin, the major component of the cytoskeleton, as the first discovered target of phyllobilins and as a novel target of bilins. We demonstrate the inhibition of actin dynamics in vitro and effects on actin and related processes in cancer cells. A direct interaction with G&#8208;actin is shown by in silico studies and confirmed by affinity chromatography. Our findings open a new chapter in bioactivities of tetrapyrroles&#8212;especially phyllobilins&#8212;for which they form the basis for broad implications in plant science, ecology, and physiology.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Dependent Oxidative Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions of Palladium&#8211;TiO2 Determined by In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22339-22344, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) of well&#8208;defined Pd&#8208;TiO2 catalysts under high&#8208;temperature oxidation was studied via in&#8197;situ atmospheric pressure TEM. On the different facets of TiO2 supports there were significant differences in the encapsulation behaviors with a facet&#8208;dependent SMSI. Obvious cover layers were observed on Pd&#8197;NPs supported on TiO2 (101) and (100) facets, while no such phenomenon appeared on TiO2 (001) facets.







Abstract
The strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is widely used in supported metal catalysts and extensive studies have been performed to understand it. Although considerable progress has been achieved, the surface structure of the support, as an important influencing factor, is usually ignored. We report a facet&#8208;dependent SMSI of Pd&#8208;TiO2 in oxygen by using in&#8197;situ atmospheric pressure TEM. Pd NPs supported on TiO2 (101) and (100) surfaces showed encapsulation. In contrast, no such cover layer was observed in Pd&#8208;TiO2 (001) catalyst under the same conditions. This facet&#8208;dependent SMSI, which originates from the variable surface structure of the support, was demonstrated in a probe reaction of methane combustion catalyzed by Pd&#8208;TiO2. Our discovery of the oxidative facet&#8208;dependent SMSI gives direct evidence of the important role of the support surface structure in SMSI and provides a new way to tune the interaction between metal NPs and the support as well as catalytic activity.

         <title>Control Viscoelasticity of Polymer Networks with Crosslinks of Superposed Fast and Slow Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22332-22338, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of designing a crosslink of superposed fast and slow dynamics, we show the quantitative control of the association/dissociation rate constants of this crosslink over 5 orders of magnitude. With this crosslink, we achieved precise control over viscoelasticity and mechanical response of polymer networks.







Abstract
Depending on the dynamics of the crosslinks, polymer networks can have distinct bulk mechanical behaviors, from viscous liquids to tough solids. Here, by means of designing a crosslink with variable molecular dynamics, we show the control of viscoelasticity of polymer networks in a broad range quantitatively. The hexanoate&#8208;isoquinoline@cucurbit[7]uril (HIQ@CB[7]) crosslink exhibits in a combination of protonated and deprotonated states of similar association affinity but distinct molecular dynamics. The molecular property of this crosslink is contributed by linear combination of the parameters at the two states, which is precisely tuned by pH. Using this crosslink, we achieve the quantitative control of viscoelasticity of quasi&#8208;ideal networks in 5 orders of magnitude, and we show the reversible control of mechanical response, such as stiffness, strength and extensibility, of tough random polymer networks. This strategy offers a way to tailor the mechanical properties of polymer networks at the molecular level and paves the way for engineering &#8220;smart&#8221; responsive materials.

         <title>Controlling Coagulation in Blood with Red Light</title>

An engineered aptamer with a Cy7&#8208;based photocleavable linker can be used as anticoagulant. With tissue&#8208;penetrating red light, the aptamer is cleaved, and blood clotting is restored in human whole blood.







Abstract
Precise control of blood clotting and rapid reversal of anticoagulation are essential in many clinical situations. We were successful in modifying a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer with a red&#8208;light photocleavable linker derived from Cy7 by Cu&#8208;catalyzed Click chemistry. We were able to show that we can successfully deactivate the modified aptamer with red light (660&#8197;nm) even in human blood&#8212;restoring the blood's natural coagulation capability.

         <title>Radical Trifluoroacetylation of Alkenes Triggered by a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted C&#8211;O Bond Fragmentation of Trifluoroacetic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22487-22495, October 4, 2021. </description>

The trifluoroacyl radical is generated by C&#8722;O bond fragmentation of trifluoroacetic anhydride under photoredox conditions and undergoes olefinic C&#8722;H bond trifluoroacetylation in a mechanistically unique fashion. The protocol is operationally simple, scalable, and enables the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex biorelevant molecules delivering the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated trifluoromethyl ketones in one step.







Abstract
We report a mild and operationally simple trifluoroacylation strategy of olefines, that utilizes trifluoroacetic anhydride as a low&#8208;cost and readily available reagent. This light&#8208;mediated process is fundamentally different from conventional methodologies and occurs through a trifluoroacyl radical mechanism promoted by a photocatalyst, which triggers a C&#8722;O bond fragmentation. Mechanistic studies (kinetic isotope effects, spectroelectrochemistry, optical spectroscopy, theoretical investigations) highlight the evidence of a fleeting CF3CO radical under photoredox conditions. The trifluoroacyl radical can be stabilized under CO atmosphere, delivering the trifluoroacetylation product with higher chemical efficiency. Furthermore, the method can be turned into a trifluoromethylation protocol by simply changing the reaction parameters. Beyond simple alkenes, this method allows for chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of small&#8208;molecule drugs and common pharmacophores.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Encapsulation of Protein into Nanoscale Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Intracellular Biocatalysis</title>

The in situ encapsulation of protein by self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) enables the formation of nanoscale protein@TA&#8208;HOFs under mild conditions. Moreover, this strategy is generally applicable to proteins with different surface charge and molecular weight, facilitating the cellular internalization of proteins for efficient enzyme catalysis inside living cells.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are porous materials with great potential for biological applications. The self&#8208;assembly of HOFs and biomacromolecules, however, is challenging. We report herein the self&#8208;assembly of nanoscale HOFs (nHOFs) to encapsulate protein for intracellular biocatalysis. The self&#8208;assembly of tetrakis(4&#8208;amidiniumphenyl)methane and azobenzenedicarboxylate can encapsulate protein in situ to form protein@nHOFs under mild conditions. This strategy is applicable to proteins with different surface charge and molecular weight, showing a high protein encapsulation efficiency and minimal effect on protein activity. A cellular delivery study shows that the protein@TA&#8208;HOFs can efficiently enter cells and retain enzyme activity for biochemical catalysis in living cells for neuroprotection. Our strategy paves new avenues for interfacing nHOFs with biological settings and sheds light on expanding nHOFs as a platform for biomacromolecule delivery and disease treatment.

         <title>Ordered Conformation&#8208;Regulated Vesicular Membrane Permeability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22529-22536, October 4, 2021. </description>

Synthetic polypeptide vesicles can regulate their membrane permeability via ordered transition of secondary conformations. Particularly, a transformation from extended &#946;&#8208;strands to compact &#945;&#8208;helices in response to reactive oxygen species reduces the vesicular wall thickness and remodels the membrane structure, thereby enhancing the membrane permeability for efficient nanoreaction, glucose&#8208;triggered insulin secretion and effective therapy of diabetes mellitus.







Abstract
In nature, the folding and conformation of proteins can control the cell or organelle membrane permeability and regulate the life activities. Here we report the first example of synthetic polypeptide vesicles that regulate their permeability via ordered transition of secondary conformations, in a manner similar to biological systems. The polymersomes undergo a &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix transition in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to wall thinning without loss of vesicular integrity. The change of membrane structure increases the vesicular permeability and enables specific transport of payloads with different molecular weights. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the polymersomes encapsulating enzymes could serve as nanoreactors and carries for glucose&#8208;stimulated insulin secretion in vivo inspired by human glucokinase, resulting in safe and effective treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in mouse models. This study will help understand the biology of biomembranes and facilitate the engineering of nanoplatforms for biomimicry, biosensing, and controlled delivery applications.

         <title>A Tale of Two Isomers: Enhanced Antiaromaticity/Diradical Character versus Deleterious Ring&#8208;Opening of Benzofuran&#8208;fused s&#8208;Indacenes and Dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalenes</title>

Fusion of benzofuran to either s&#8208;indacene or dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalene results in two dramatically different outcomes depending upon heterocycle orientation. Whereas the &#8220;anti&#8221; isomers are unstable and hydrolyze readily to ring&#8208;opened products, the &#8220;syn&#8221; isomers are quite stable and afford molecules that either possess a high degree of antiaromaticity or exhibit pronounced diradical character.







Abstract
We examine the effects of fusing two benzofurans to s&#8208;indacene (indacenodibenzofurans, IDBFs) and dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalene (indenoindenodibenzofurans, IIDBFs) to control the strong antiaromaticity and diradical character of these core units. Synthesis via 3&#8208;functionalized benzofuran yields syn&#8208;IDBF and syn&#8208;IIDBF. syn&#8208;IDBF possesses a high degree of paratropicity, exceeding that of the parent hydrocarbon, which in turn results in strong diradical character for syn&#8208;IIDBF. In the case of the anti&#8208;isomers, synthesized via 2&#8208;substituted benzofurans, these effects are decreased; however, both derivatives undergo an unexpected ring&#8208;opening reaction during the final dearomatization step. All the results are compared to the benzothiophene&#8208;fused analogues and show that the increased electronegativity of oxygen in the syn&#8208;fused derivatives leads to enhancement of the antiaromatic core causing greater paratropicity. For syn&#8208;IIDBF increased diradical character results from rearomati&#8208;zation of the core naphthalene unit in order to relieve this paratropicity.

         <title>Tertiary Chiral Nanostructures from C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F Directed Assembly of Chiroptical Superatoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22411-22416, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tertiary chiral nanostructures have been created by assembling chiroptical superatoms of [Au7Ag6Cu2(S&#8208; or R&#8208;BINAP)3(SCH2Ph)6]+ (BINAP=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl). Both metal framework (primary structure) and surface ligands (secondary) of the nanocluster display perfect mirror symmetry. C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonding between the clusters and SbF6&#8722; counterions direct formation of left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed helices.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and structure of tertiary chiral nanostructures with 100&#8201;% optical purity. A novel synthetic strategy, using chiral reducing agent, R and S&#8208;BINAPCuBH4 (BINAP is 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl), is developed to access to atomically precise, intrinsically chiral [Au7Ag6Cu2(R&#8208; or S&#8208;BINAP)3(SCH2Ph)6]SbF6 nanoclusters in one&#8208;pot synthesis. The clusters represent the first tri&#8208;metallic superatoms with inherent chirality and fair stability. Both metal distribution (primary) and ligand arrangement (secondary) of the enantiomers exhibited perfect mirror images, and unprecedentedly, the self&#8208;assembly driven by the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction between the phenyl groups of the superatom moieties and SbF6&#8722; anions induced the formation of bio&#8208;mimic left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helices, achieving the tertiary chiral nanostructures. DFT calculations revealed the connections between the molecular details and chiral optical activity.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Shell Coronoid with Hybrid Chichibabin&#8211;Schlenk Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22496-22504, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expanded, 18&#8208;ring coronoid molecule, inspired by the structures of Chichibabin and Schlenk hydrocarbons, features a cross&#8208;over of Kekul&#233; and non&#8208;Kekul&#233; conjugation, resulting in a distinct hexaradicaloid character, easy accessibility of high&#8208;spin states, and redox amphoterism.







Abstract
A hexaradicaloid molecule with alternating Kekul&#233; and non&#8208;Kekul&#233; connectivities between adjacent spin centers was obtained by fusing two conjugation motifs in Chichibabin and Schlenk hydrocarbons into a coronoid structure. 1H&#8197;NMR, ESR, and SQUID experiments and computational analyses show that the system has a singlet ground state with a significant hexaradicaloid character (&#947;0=0.826, &#947;1=&#947;2=0.773). It has multiple thermally accessible high&#8208;spin states (up to the septet), with uniform energy gaps of ca 1.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 between consecutive multiplicities. In line with its open&#8208;shell character, the coronoid has a small electronic band gap (ca. 0.8&#8197;eV) and undergoes two consecutive one&#8208;electron oxidations at low potentials, yielding cationic forms with extended near&#8208;infrared absorption. The hexaradicaloid, which combines open&#8208;shell and macrocyclic contributions to its &#960; conjugation, is an example of a design strategy for multistate spin switches and redox&#8208;amphoteric NIR dyes.

         <title>Back Cover: Control Viscoelasticity of Polymer Networks with Crosslinks of Superposed Fast and Slow Dynamics (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22588-22588, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular crosslink of superposed fast and slow dynamics is reported by Hao Chen, Yi Cao, Yebang Tan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;22332. This crosslink exhibits quantitatively tailored molecular dynamics. The well&#8208;defined molecular dynamics of the crosslinks enable precise control over the viscoelasticity and mechanical response of the resulting polymer networks at the molecular level.

A linear hydrocarbon chain containing a diene and a dienophile is folded and transformed into a decalin scaffold by intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition. The substrates are folded oppositely but bind in the same orientation to the pockets of a pair of Diels&#8211;Alderases to yield enantiomeric decalin skeletons, as reported by Naoki Kato, Shunji Takahashi, Shingo Nagano, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;22401.

A high&#8208;speed 3D microscope has been developed to quantify the nanoparticle protein corona at the single&#8208;particle level. As presented by Xiaochen Tan and Kevin Welsher in their Research Article on page&#8197;22359, the microscope can &#8220;lock on&#8221; to freely diffusing nanoparticles to quantify the tightly bound &#8220;hard&#8221; and dynamic &#8220;soft&#8221; corona layers. This method can analyze single nanoparticles in the presence of significant protein background signals, opening the possibility for quantifying the protein corona in&#8197;vivo.

Hexaarylbenzene scaffolds , containing six different aromatic rings around the central benzene core, are a synthetic challenge. In their Research Article on page&#8197;22307, Svetlana&#8197;B. Tsogoeva et&#8197;al. report a process that allows the simple and straightforward generation of such hexaarylbenzenes (HABs). In an efficient, two&#8208;component four&#8208;step domino reaction, a functionalized triarylbenzene is formed and used as a key intermediate to furnish asymmetrically substituted HABs in high overall yield and without involvement of statistical steps.

         <dc:description>
The chemical reactivity of ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents can intentionally be exploited as a synthetic tool to prepare inorganic materials that are difficult or even impossible to obtain by traditional synthetic routes. This Review summarizes recent developments in inorganic syntheses that take advantage of reactions with ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents.







Abstract
Ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents are of growing interest as solvents for the resource&#8208;efficient synthesis of inorganic materials. This Review covers chemical reactions of various deep eutectic solvents and types of ionic liquids, including metal&#8208;containing ionic liquids, [BF4]&#8722;&#8208; or [PF6]&#8722;&#8208;based ionic liquids, basic ionic liquids, and chalcogen&#8208;containing ionic liquids. Cases in which cations, anions, or both are incorporated into the final products are also included. The purpose of this Review is to raise caution about the chemical reactivity of ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents and to establish a guide for their proper use.

         <title>Enabling Clinical Technologies for Hyperpolarized 129Xenon Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22126-22147, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of hyperpolarized 129Xe has the potential to revolutionize clinical imaging, offering a non&#8208;ionizing contrast of organ function complementary to that of CT imaging and conventional MRI. In this Review, the physics of spin&#8208;exchange optical pumping (SEOP) is discussed, production modalities of hyperpolarized 129Xe are explained, and biomedical applications to lung imaging and beyond are described.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization is a technique that can increase nuclear spin polarization with the corresponding gains in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals by 4&#8211;8 orders of magnitude. When this process is applied to biologically relevant samples, the hyperpolarized molecules can be used as exogenous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. A technique called spin&#8208;exchange optical pumping (SEOP) can be applied to hyperpolarize noble gases such as 129Xe. Techniques based on hyperpolarized 129Xe are poised to revolutionize clinical lung imaging, offering a non&#8208;ionizing, high&#8208;contrast alternative to computed tomography (CT) imaging and conventional proton MRI. Moreover, CT and conventional proton MRI report on lung tissue structure but provide little functional information. On the other hand, when a subject breathes hyperpolarized 129Xe gas, functional lung images reporting on lung ventilation, perfusion and diffusion with 3D readout can be obtained in seconds. In this Review, the physics of SEOP is discussed and the different production modalities are explained in the context of their clinical application. We also briefly compare SEOP to other hyperpolarization methods and conclude this paper with the outlook for biomedical applications of hyperpolarized 129Xe to lung imaging and beyond.

In this review, methods for the detection and quantification of membrane transport of pharma&#8208;molecules in bacteria are discussed.







Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is a significant challenge encountered by healthcare systems on a global scale. Knowledge about membrane transport of antibiotics and other pharmacologically relevant molecules in bacteria is crucial towards understanding and overcoming antibiotic resistance, as drug resistance often depends on drug transport. This comprehensive literature review discusses the detection and quantification of membrane transport of pharma&#8208;molecules in bacteria and highlights the importance of molecule transport to antibiotic resistance. This review emphasizes electrochemical and electrophysiological methods of detection and quantification. The results of this literature review reveal a substantial diversity in methods and types of quantitative information collected.

The transformation is catalyzed by a PdII&#8901;StackPhos complex and facilitates the substitution of a poor leaving group with what would ostensibly be a better leaving group in the product without selectivity issues arising from racemization.







Abstract
Asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) is a powerful method for the formation of highly useful, non&#8208;racemic allylic compounds. Here we present a complementary enantioselective process that generates allylic lactones via &#960;&#8208;acid catalysis. More specifically, a catalytic enantioselective dehydrative lactonization of allylic alcohols using a novel PdII&#8208;catalyst containing the imidazole&#8208;based P,N&#8208;ligand (S)&#8208;StackPhos is reported. The high&#8208;yielding reactions are operationally simple to perform with enantioselectivities up to 99&#8201;% ee. This strategy facilitates the replacement of a poor leaving group with what would ostensibly be a better leaving group in the product avoiding complications arising from racemization by equilibration.

         <title>Photoresponsive Palladium and Nickel Catalysts for Ethylene Polymerization and Copolymerization</title>

Two photoresponsive olefin polymerization systems were rationally designed. Light can be used to tune their properties in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar comonomers, enabling light&#8208;induced control of the polymerization processes, polymer microstructures and polymer properties.







Abstract
In this contribution, we install an azobenzene functionality in olefin polymerization catalysts and use light to modulate their properties via photoinduced trans&#8211;cis isomerization of the azobenzene moiety. The initially targeted azobenzene&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;diimine palladium and nickel catalysts are not photoresponsive. To address this issue, an imine&#8211;amine system bearing interrupted conjugation with the metal center, and a sandwich&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;diimine system bearing an azobenzene unit at a position covalently far from the metal center were prepared and studied. We demonstrate that light can be used to tune their properties in ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar comonomers, enabling light&#8208;induced control of the polymerization processes, polymer microstructures and polymer properties. More interestingly, the light&#8208;mediated property changes were attributed to ligand electronic effects in one system and ligand steric effects in the other.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Excited Multicolor Afterglow in Carbon Dots&#8208;Based Room&#8208;Temperature Afterglow Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22253-22259, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method is developed to activate near&#8208;infrared&#8208;excited multicolor afterglow of carbon dots&#8208;based RTA materials (CDAMs) through radiative energy transfer from NaYF4:Yb,Tm upconversion materials (UMs). The resulting UM/CDAMs demonstrate bright and persistent afterglow from blue to orange under NIR CW laser excitation at 980&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature afterglow (RTA) materials with long lifetime have shown tremendous application prospects in many fields. However, there is no general design strategy to construct near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;excited multicolor RTA materials. Herein, we report a universal approach based on the efficient radiative energy transfer that supports the reabsorption from upconversion materials (UMs) to carbon dots&#8208;based RTA materials (CDAMs). Thus, the afterglow emission (blue, cyan, green, and orange) of various CDAMs can be activated by UMs under the NIR continuous&#8208;wave laser excitation. The efficient radiative energy transfer ensured the persistent multicolor afterglow up to 7&#8197;s, 6&#8197;s, 5&#8197;s, and 0.5&#8197;s by naked eyes, respectively. Given the unusual afterglow properties, we demonstrated preliminary applications in fingerprint recognition and information security. This work provides a new avenue for the activation of NIR&#8208;excited afterglow in CDAMs and will greatly expand the applications of RTA materials.

Chiral trisubstituted epoxides were synthesized by boron&#8211;Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Darzens&#8208;type epoxidation of diazoesters in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The developed reaction provides an efficient synthetic route to various chiral compounds such as epoxy &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone, tertiary &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone, and epoxy diester.







Abstract
Highly enantioselective Darzens&#8208;type epoxidation of diazoesters with glyoxal derivatives was accomplished using a chiral boron&#8211;Lewis acid catalyst, which facilitated asymmetric synthesis of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy esters. In the presence of a chiral oxazaborolidinium ion catalyst, the reaction proceeded in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20:1 dr, respectively). The synthetic potential of this method was illustrated by conversion of the products to various compounds such as epoxy &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone, tertiary &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone and epoxy diester.

         <title>Dihydrogen Activation by Lithium&#8208; and Sodium&#8208;Aluminyls</title>

It turns out there is nothing special about potassium after all: Sodium and lithium metal reduce AlIII iodide precursors to the M2[Al(NONDipp)]2 aluminyls (M=Li, Na). Addition of Et2O afforded the monomeric ion pairs (NONDipp)Al&#8208;M(Et2O)2 containing unsupported Al&#8722;Li and Al&#8722;Na bonds. All species activate dihydrogen, albeit at significantly different rates of reaction.







Abstract
To date, aluminyl anions have been exclusively isolated as their potassium salts. We report herein the synthesis of the lithium and sodium aluminyls, M2[Al(NONDipp)]2 (M=Li, Na. NONDipp=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Both compounds crystallize from non&#8208;coordinating solvent as &#8220;slipped&#8221; contacted dimeric pairs with strong M&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;(aryl) interactions. Isolation from Et2O solution affords the monomeric ion pairs (NONDipp)Al&#8208;M(Et2O)2, which contain discrete Al&#8722;Li and Al&#8722;Na bonds. The ability of the full series of Li, Na and K aluminyls to activate dihydrogen is reported.

We report on a first demonstration for a catalyst comprising metal NPs and amorphous MOF in a gas&#8208;phase reaction. Cu/amorphous UiO&#8208;66 exhibited 3&#8208;fold catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation into methanol over Cu/crystalline UiO&#8208;66. Amorphous UiO&#8208;66 coating on Cu&#8208;ZnO nanocomposites showed 1.5&#8208;fold catalytic activity enhancement over that of Cu/amorphous UiO&#8208;66.







Abstract
We report on Cu/amUiO&#8208;66, a composite made of Cu nanoparticles (NPs) and amorphous [Zr6O4(OH)4(BDC)6] (amUiO&#8208;66, BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), and Cu&#8208;ZnO/amUiO&#8208;66 made of Cu&#8208;ZnO nanocomposites and amUiO&#8208;66. Both structures were obtained via a spray&#8208;drying method and characterized using high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectra, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. The catalytic activity of Cu/amUiO&#8208;66 for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol was 3&#8208;fold that of Cu/crystalline UiO&#8208;66. Moreover, Cu&#8208;ZnO/amUiO&#8208;66 enhanced the methanol production rate by 1.5&#8208;fold compared with Cu/amUiO&#8208;66 and 2.5&#8208;fold compared with &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;supported Cu&#8208;ZnO nanocomposites (Cu&#8208;ZnO/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3) as the representative hydrogenation catalyst. The high catalytic performance was investigated using in situ Fourier transform IR spectra. This is a first report of a catalyst comprising metal NPs and an amorphous metal&#8211;organic framework in a gas&#8208;phase reaction.

&lt;p&gt;We report on a first demonstration for a catalyst comprising metal NPs and amorphous MOF in a gas-phase reaction.

         <title>N&#947;&#8208;Hydroxyasparagine: A Multifunctional Unnatural Amino Acid That is a Good P1 Substrate of Asparaginyl Peptide Ligases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22207-22211, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unnatural amino acid, Asn(OH), mimics P1&#8208;Asn in the substrates of asparaginyl ligases, enabling efficient cyclization of P1&#8208;Asn(OH) peptides. The hydroxamic acid functionality in Asn(OH) is a metal&#8208;ion chelator for metalloenzyme inhibition, and Asn(OH) can be converted into native Asp by periodate oxidation (see scheme).







Abstract
Peptidyl asparaginyl ligases (PALs) are powerful tools for peptide macrocyclization. Herein, we report that a derivative of Asn, namely N&#947;&#8208;hydroxyasparagine or Asn(OH), is an unnatural P1 substrate of PALs. By Asn(OH)&#8208;mediated cyclization, we prepared cyclic peptides as new matrix metalloproteinase&#8197;2 (MMP2) inhibitors displaying the hydroxamic acid moiety of Asn(OH) as the key pharmacophore. The most potent cyclic peptide (Ki=2.8&#177;0.5&#8197;nM) was built on the hyperstable tetracyclic scaffold of rhesus theta defensin&#8208;1. The Asn(OH) residue in the cyclized peptides can also be readily oxidized to Asp. By this approach, we synthesized several bioactive Asp&#8208;containing cyclic peptides (MCoTI&#8208;II, kB2, SFTI, and integrin&#8208;targeting RGD peptides) that are otherwise difficult targets for PAL&#8208;catalyzed cyclization owing to unfavorable kinetics of the P1&#8208;Asp substrates. This study demonstrates that substrate engineering is a useful strategy to expand the application of PAL ligation in the synthesis of therapeutic cyclic peptides.

         <title>A Lamellar MXene (Ti3C2Tx)/PSS Composite Membrane for Fast and Selective Lithium&#8208;Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22265-22269, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lamellar MXene (Ti3C2Tx)@PSS membranes with specific size exclusion and Li+ identification property show excellent mono/multi&#8208;valent ions separation performance. Compared with the traditional 2D membranes, the selectivity of Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Mg2+ through such membranes is five to ten times improved.







Abstract
A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) laminar membrane with Li+ selective transport channels is obtained by stacking MXene nanosheets with the introduction of poly(sodium 4&#8208;styrene sulfonate) (PSS) with active sulfonate sites, which exhibits excellent Li+ selectivity from ionic mixture solutions of Na+, K+, and Mg2+. The Li+ permeation rate through the MXene@PSS composite membrane is as high as 0.08&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, while the Li+/Mg2+, Li+/Na+, and Li+/K+ selectivities are 28, 15.5, and 12.7, respectively. Combining the simulation and experimental results, we further confirm that the highly selective rapid transport of partially dehydrated Li+ within subnanochannels can be attributed to the precisely controlled interlayer spacing and the relatively weaker ion&#8208;terminal (&#8722;SO3&#8722;) interaction. This study deepens the understanding of ion&#8208;selective permeation in confined channels and provides a general membrane design concept.

The Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement has proven to be a powerful tool for the synthesis of new sp3&#8208;aryls via ipso substitution. The reaction has been applied to the strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening of 3&#8208;aminocyclobutanone oximes, giving cyanide&#8208;free access to &#946;&#8208;amino nitriles under metal&#8208;free, room temperature conditions. The reaction displays a wide scope of migrating arenes.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening of 3&#8208;aminocyclobutanone oximes enables easy generation of primary alkyl radicals, capable of undergoing an unprecedented strain&#8208;release, desulfonylative radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement, providing divergent access to valuable 1,3 diamines and unnatural &#946;&#8208;amino acids. Characterized by mild conditions and wide scope of migrating species, this protocol allows the modular assembly of sp3&#8208;aryls under transition metal&#8208;free, room&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <dc:description>
We report here an asymmetric decarboxylative allylation reaction initiated by the hydrocarboxylation reaction of heteroatom&#8208;substituted allene. The reaction works particularly well with heteroatom&#8208;substituted allenes such as alkoxyallenes and amidoallenes. A number of aryl and alkyl &#946;&#8208;keto acids as well as malonic acid mono&#8208;phenyl ester participates in the reaction to generate &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds possessing stereogenic heteroatom substituents at the &#946;&#8208;position.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition reaction of &#946;&#8208;keto acids to heteroatom&#8208;substituted allene is reported. This reaction generates &#946;&#8208;substituted ketones in an asymmetric manner through a branch&#8208;selective decarboxylative allylation pathway. The reaction accommodates various alkoxyallenes as well as amidoallenes.

         <title>Preparation of Bulk&#8208;Phase Nitride Perovskite LaReN3 and Topotactic Reduction to LaNiO2&#8208;Type LaReN2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22260-22264, October 4, 2021. </description>

Nitride perovskites are extremely rare and challenging to synthesise, but an azide&#8208;mediated high&#8208;pressure route has been used to prepare LaReN3 which can be topotactically reduced to layered LaReN2.







Abstract
While halide and oxide perovskites are numerous and many display outstanding properties, ABN3 perovskite nitrides are extremely rare due to synthetic challenges arising from the low chemical potential of nitrogen and a tendency to form low&#8208;coordination nitridometallate anions. We report the preparation of a perovskite nitride LaReN3 through azide&#8208;mediated oxidation at high pressure. High&#8208;resolution synchrotron diffraction shows that LaReN3 has a low&#8208;symmetry, triclinic, perovskite superstructure resulting from orbital ordering with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling distortions. Topotactic reduction of LaReN3 above 500&#8201;&#176;C leads to layered tetragonal LaReN2 via a probable LaReN2.5 intermediate, which is the first reported example of nitride defect perovskites. Magnetisation and conductivity measurements indicate that LaReN3 and LaReN2 are both metallic solids. The two chemical approaches presented are expected to lead to new classes of ABN3 and defect ABN3&#8722;x nitride perovskite materials.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Radical Covalent Organic Frameworks as Highly Efficient and Stable Catalysts for Selective Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22230-22235, October 4, 2021. </description>

Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) decorated with nitroxyl radicals are successfully prepared and employed as mild, efficient, and recyclable catalysts for selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones.







Abstract
With excellent designability, large accessible inner surface, and high chemical stability, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates as metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalysts. Here, we report two 3D radical&#8208;based COFs (JUC&#8208;565 and JUC&#8208;566) in which radical moieties (TEMPO) are uniformly decorated on the channel walls via a bottom&#8208;up approach. Based on grafted functional groups and suitable regular channels, these materials open up the application of COFs as highly efficient and selective metal&#8208;free redox catalysts in aerobic oxidation of alcohols to relevant aldehydes or ketones with outstanding turn over frequency (TOF) up to 132&#8197;h&#8722;1, which has exceeded other TEMPO&#8208;modified catalytic materials tested under similar conditions. These stable COF&#8208;based catalysts could be easily recovered and reused for multiple runs. This study promotes potential applications of 3D functional COFs anchored with stable radicals in organic synthesis and material science.

         <title>Metagenome&#8208;Guided Analogue Synthesis Yields Improved Gram&#8208;Negative&#8208;Active Albicidin&#8208; and Cystobactamid&#8208;Type Antibiotics</title>

Biosynthetic instructions contained within congener biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) have been used to guide the synthesis of improved antibiotic analogues. &#961;&#8208;Aminobenzoic acid encoding BGCs cloned from soil metagenomes have guided the synthesis of albicidin and cystobactamid analogues that show increased potency, different spectra of activity, as well as the ability to circumvent resistance conferred by endopeptidase cleavage enzymes.







Abstract
Natural products are a major source of new antibiotics. Here we utilize biosynthetic instructions contained within metagenome&#8208;derived congener biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to guide the synthesis of improved antibiotic analogues. Albicidin and cystobactamid are the first members of a new class of broad&#8208;spectrum &#961;&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA)&#8208;based antibiotics. Our search for PABA&#8208;specific adenylation domain sequences in soil metagenomes revealed that BGCs in this family are common in nature. Twelve BGCs that were bio&#8208;informatically predicted to encode six new congeners were recovered from soil metagenomic libraries. Synthesis of these six predicted structures led to the identification of potent antibiotics with changes in their spectrum of activity and the ability to circumvent resistance conferred by endopeptidase cleavage enzymes.

         <title>Polymer Topology Reinforced Synergistic Interactions among Nanoscale Molecular Clusters for Impact Resistance with Facile Processability and Recoverability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22212-22218, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique physical interaction facilitated by 1D topologies of molecular cluster&#8208;integrated polymers is applied for the design of impact&#8208;resistant materials with exceptional energy dissipation capability and strong rate&#8208;dependent mechanical strengths, enabling the simultaneous achievement of promising impact resistance and processability/recoverability.







Abstract
The intrinsic conflicts between mechanical performances and processability are main challenges to develop cost&#8208;effective impact&#8208;resistant materials from polymers and their composites. Herein, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSSs) are integrated as side chains to the polymer backbones. The one&#8208;dimension (1D) rigid topology imposes strong space confinements to realize synergistic interactions among POSS units, reinforcing the correlations among polymer chains. The afforded composites demonstrate unprecedented mechanical properties with ultra&#8208;stretchability, high rate&#8208;dependent strength, superior impact&#8208;resistant capacity as well as feasible processability/recoverability. The hierarchical structures of the hybrid polymers enable the co&#8208;existence of multiple dynamic relaxations that are responsible for fast energy dissipation and high mechanical strengths. The effective synergistic correlation strategy paves a new pathway for the design of advanced cluster&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Rhodium(I) Complexes Bearing an Aryl&#8208;Substituted 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatriene Chain: Catalysts for Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylene and Potential Helical Chirality of 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatrienes</title>

Isolable chiral rhodium(I) complexes bearing a helical aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain were synthesized by one&#8208;pot reactions of [Rh(nbd)Cl]2 with aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylenes in the presence of 50&#8201;% aqueous KOH (see scheme). The persistent helical chirality of the complexes enabled their separation into enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase. The complexes served as bench&#8208;stable catalysts for living polymerization of phenylacetylene.







Abstract
Unique bench&#8208;stable rhodium(I) complexes bearing an aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain have been synthesized by reactions of (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene)rhodium(I) chloride dimer ([Rh(nbd)Cl]2) with aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylenes in the presence of a 50&#8201;% aqueous solution of KOH. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the isolated complexes indicated a square&#8208;planar structure stabilized by a strong interaction with one of the aryl groups on the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain, which has a helical structure. The helical chirality of the isolated rhodium complexes was confirmed to be sufficiently stable to be resolved into enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase at room temperature. It was confirmed that the isolated rhodium complexes functioned as initiators for living polymerization of phenylacetylene to give cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene) with a well&#8208;controlled molecular weight.

         <title>Forrestiacids&#8197;A and&#8197;B, Pentaterpene Inhibitors of ACL and Lipogenesis: Extending the Limits of Computational NMR Methods in the Structure Assignment of Complex Natural Products</title>

Forrestiacids A (1) and B (2), comprising a rearranged spiro&#8208;lanostane unit fused with an abietene by a Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition, represent a novel class of pentaterpenoids obtained from Pseudotsuga forrestii. Chemical computations demonstrate to be an effective strategy in the structure elucidation of complex molecules. Both 1 and 2 showed potent ACL inhibitory effects, and 1 even significantly attenuated the de novo lipogenesis in HepG2 cells.







Abstract
Forrestiacids&#8197;A (1) and B (2) are a novel class of [4+2] type pentaterpenoids derived from a rearranged lanostane moiety (dienophile) and an abietane unit (diene). These unprecedented molecules were isolated using guidance by molecular ion networking (MoIN) from Pseudotsuga&#8197;forrestii, an endangered member of the Asian Douglas Fir Family. The intermolecular hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder adducts feature an unusual bicyclo[2.2.2]octene ring system. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, GIAO NMR calculations and DP4+ probability analyses, electronic circular dichroism calculations, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This unique addition to the pentaterpene family represents the largest and the most complex molecule successfully assigned using computational approaches to predict accurately chemical shift values. Compounds&#8197;1 and 2 exhibited potent inhibitory activities (IC50s &lt;5&#8197;&#956;M) of ATP&#8208;citrate lyase (ACL), a new drug target for the treatment of glycolipid metabolic disorders including hyperlipidemia. Validating this activity 1 effectively attenuated the de novo lipogenesis in HepG2 cells. These findings provide a new chemical class for developing potential therapeutic agents for ACL&#8208;related diseases with strong links to traditional medicines.

         <title>Electronic Modulation Caused by Interfacial Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M (M=Ru, Ir, Pd) Bonding for Accelerating Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22276-22282, October 4, 2021. </description>

A facile and spontaneous strategy is presented for synthesizing Ru&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;anchored metal&#8211;organic framework nanohybrids on Ni foam. The nanohybrids exhibit excellent HER performance at all pH values owing to the optimized adsorption free energies of intermediates by the interfacial&#8208;bond&#8208;induced electron redistribution.







Abstract
Designing definite metal&#8208;support interfacial bond is an effective strategy for optimizing the intrinsic activity of noble metals, but rather challenging. Herein, a series of quantum&#8208;sized metal nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on nickel metal&#8211;organic framework nanohybrids (M@Ni&#8208;MOF, M=Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a spontaneous redox strategy. The metal&#8208;oxygen bonds between the NPs and Ni&#8208;MOF guarantee structural stability and sufficient exposure of the surface active sites. More importantly, such precise interfacial feature can effectively modulate the electronic structure of hybrids through the charge transfer of the formed Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M bridge and then improves the reaction kinetics. As a result, the representative Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at all pH values, even superior to commercial Pt/C and recent noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Theoretical calculations deepen the mechanism understanding of the superior HER performance of Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF through the optimized adsorption free energies of water and hydrogen due to the interfacial&#8208;bond&#8208;induced electron redistribution.

Co&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;rich Prussian Blue Analog (PBA) hollow spheres (CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs) are rationally designed and synthesized through an efficient self&#8208;templating approach. Benefiting from the hollow structure and partial Co substitution, the CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs electrode exhibits enhanced zinc ion storage performance with high capacity, favorable rate capability, and impressive cycling stability.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are considered as reliable and promising cathode materials for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), but they suffer from low capacity and poor cycling stability due to insufficient active sites and structural damage caused by the ion insertion/extraction processes. Herein, a template&#8208;engaged ion exchange approach has been developed for the synthesis of Co&#8208;substituted Mn&#8208;rich PBA hollow spheres (CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs) as cathode materials for AZIBs. Benefiting from the multiple advantageous features including hollow structure, abundant active sites, fast Zn2+ ion diffusion, and partial Co substitution, the CoMn&#8208;PBA HSs electrode shows efficient zinc ion storage properties in terms of high capacity, decent rate capability and prolonged cycle life.

         <title>Double Double to Double Perovskite Transformations in Quaternary Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22248-22252, October 4, 2021. </description>

Thermal transformations under pressure of AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskites, where both A and B sites have 1:1 cation order, to (A0.5A&#8242;0.5)2BB&#8242;O6 double perovskites with disordered A/A&#8242; cations are demonstrated for CaMnMnWO6 and SmMnMnTaO6, leading to a dramatic switch in magnetic properties from ferrimagnetic order to spin glass behaviour in the former.







Abstract
Control of cation ordering in ABX3 perovskites is important to structural, physical and chemical properties. Here we show that thermal transformations of AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O6 double double perovskites, where both A and B sites have 1:1 cation order, to (A0.5A&#8242;0.5)2BB&#8242;O6 double perovskites with fully disordered A/A&#8242; cations can be achieved under pressure in CaMnMnWO6 and SmMnMnTaO6, enabling both polymorphs of each material to be recovered. This leads to a dramatic switch of magnetic properties from ferrimagnetic order in double double perovskite CaMnMnWO6 to spin glass behaviour in the highly frustrated double perovskite polymorph. Comparison of double double and double perovskite polymorphs of other materials will enable effects of cation order and disorder on other properties such as ferroelectricity and conductivity to be explored.

&lt;p&gt;Thermal transformations under pressure of AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double double perovskites, where both A and B sites have 1:1 cation order, to (A&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;A&#8242;&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BB&#8242;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double perovskites with disordered A/A&#8242; cations are demonstrated for CaMnMnWO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and SmMnMnTaO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, leading to a dramatic switch in magnetic properties from ferrimagnetic order to spin glass behaviour in the former.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control of cation ordering in ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskites is important to structural, physical and chemical properties. Here we show that thermal transformations of AA&#8242;BB&#8242;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double double perovskites, where both A and B sites have 1:1 cation order, to (A&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;A&#8242;&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BB&#8242;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double perovskites with fully disordered A/A&#8242; cations can be achieved under pressure in CaMnMnWO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and SmMnMnTaO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, enabling both polymorphs of each material to be recovered. This leads to a dramatic switch of magnetic properties from ferrimagnetic order in double double perovskite CaMnMnWO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to spin glass behaviour in the highly frustrated double perovskite polymorph. Comparison of double double and double perovskite polymorphs of other materials will enable effects of cation order and disorder on other properties such as ferroelectricity and conductivity to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative Methoxyallylation of 3&#8208;Nitroindoles with Allyl Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22184-22188, October 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermolecular Pd&#8208;catalyzed dearomative methoxyallylation of 3&#8208;nitroindoles with readily available allyl carbonates was reported. Good yields (up to 86&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20:1 dr) are obtained for a wide range of substrates. The compatibility of gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the relatively low catalyst loading (down to 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of [Pd]) enhance the practicality of this method.







Abstract
Herein we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed dearomative methoxyallylation of 3&#8208;nitroindoles with readily available allyl carbonates. Good yields (up to 86&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;20:1 dr) are obtained for a wide range of substrates. The compatibility of gram&#8208;scale synthesis and the relatively low catalyst loading (down to 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of [Pd]) enhance the practicality of this method. The kinetic experiments indicate that the rate&#8208;determining step of this reaction is the nucleophilic attack of the alkoxide anion.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ultraviolet Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Enabled by High&#8208;Lying Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22241-22247, October 4, 2021. </description>

Through the proposed long&#8208;short axis molecular design, an HLCT&#8208;type ultraviolet emitter is reported. Benefiting from the features of the low&#8208;lying LE emissive state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process, the ultraviolet OLED furnishes a record&#8208;high EQE of 10.79&#8201;%, accompanied by a satisfactory color purity and a small efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) organic emitters that can open up applications for future organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are of great value but rarely developed. Here, we report a high&#8208;quality UV emitter with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited state and its application in UV OLEDs. The UV emitter, 2BuCz&#8208;CNCz, shows the features of low&#8208;lying locally excited (LE) emissive state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) process, which helps to balance the color purity and exciton utilization of UV OLED. Consequently, the OLED based on 2BuCz&#8208;CNCz exhibits not only a desired narrowband UV electroluminescent (EL) at 396&#8197;nm with satisfactory color purity (CIEx, y=0.161, 0.031), but also a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10.79&#8201;% with small efficiency roll&#8208;off. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance can inspire the design of UV emitters, and pave a way for the further development of high&#8208;performance UV OLEDs.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Propargyl Ethers with Grignard Reagents for the Synthesis of Functionalized Allenes and Allenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 41, Page 22178-22183, October 4, 2021. </description>

A method for facile synthesis of highly substituted allenols and fluoroalkyl allenes via iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of propargyl ethers with Grignard reagents is disclosed. Various tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted fluoroalkyl allenes and &#946;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;allenols were obtained in good to excellent yields. The reaction was demonstrated to be stereospecific occurring with syn&#8208;SN2&#8242; displacement of the methoxy group by the Grignard reagent.







Abstract
Herein we disclose an iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of propargyl ethers with Grignard reagents. The reaction was demonstrated to be stereospecific and allows for a facile preparation of optically active allenes via efficient chirality transfer. Various tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted fluoroalkyl allenes can be obtained in good to excellent yields. In addition, an iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of Grignard reagents with &#945;&#8208;alkynyl oxetanes and tetrahydrofurans is disclosed herein, which constitutes a straightforward approach towards fully substituted &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;allenols, respectively.

         <title>Crystal Structure Classification of Copper&#8208;Based Sulfides as a Tool for the Design of Inorganic Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A classification of copper sulfides based on crystallographic features has been proposed from investigation of the structure&#8211;property relationships reported on their phases in dozens of publications from the fields of crystallography and materials for energy conversion. This classification reveals systematic trends that can be explained and exploited for the design and engineering of new environmentally friendly materials.







Abstract
Research focusing on the interplay between structural features and transport properties of inorganic materials is of paramount importance for the identification, comprehension, and optimisation of functional materials. In this respect, Earth&#8208;abundant copper sulfides have been receiving considerable attention from scientists as the urgency remains to discover and improve the efficiency of sustainable materials for energy applications. This proposed classification of copper sulfides, associated with p&#8208; and/or d&#8208;block elements, is based on their crystallographic features and an analysis of their transport properties. It provides guidelines to help estimate some properties of new materials (type of main charge carriers, thermal conductivity, transport mechanisms, etc.) from consideration of only their chemical composition and crystal structure. The classification relies primarily on recent studies in the fields of thermoelectricity and photovoltaics as well as on crystal&#8208;structure investigations.

         <title>Intragenomic Decarboxylation of 5&#8208;Carboxy&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A possibility that 5&#8208;carboxydC (cadC), which is a modification found in somatic and stem cells, is directly decarboxylated to dC via C&#8722;C bond cleavage in cells is suggested.







Abstract
Cellular DNA is composed of four canonical nucleosides (dA, dC, dG and T), which form two Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. In addition, 5&#8208;methylcytosine (mdC) may be present. The methylation of dC to mdC is known to regulate transcriptional activity. Next to these five nucleosides, the genome, particularly of stem cells, contains three additional dC derivatives, which are formed by stepwise oxidation of the methyl group of mdC with the help of Tet enzymes. These are 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;dC (hmdC), 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;dC (fdC), and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;dC (cadC). It is believed that fdC and cadC are converted back into dC, which establishes an epigenetic control cycle that starts with methylation of dC to mdC, followed by oxidation and removal of fdC and cadC. While fdC was shown to undergo intragenomic deformylation to give dC directly, a similar decarboxylation of cadC was postulated but not yet observed on the genomic level. By using metabolic labelling, we show here that cadC decarboxylates in several cell types, which confirms that both fdC and cadC are nucleosides that are directly converted back to dC within the genome by C&#8722;C bond cleavage.

         <title>Crystalline&#8208;Phase&#8208;Recognition&#8208;Induced Domino Phase Transition and Luminescence Switching for Advanced Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline phase recognition promoted the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transition of a metal halide by inducing a domino phase transition (DPT). A DPT occurred when single crystals of chiral &#946;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 (Bmmim=1&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;methylimidazolium) recognized those of achiral &#945;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 (see picture). Concomitant photoluminescence switching enabled in situ observation of the DPT, the potential of which for time&#8208;resolved encryption was demonstrated.







Abstract
Herein, a new mechanism, namely, crystalline phase recognition (CPR), is proposed for the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transition of metal halides. Chiral &#946;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 (Bmmim=1&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;methylimidazolium) can recognize achiral &#945;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 on the basis of a key&#8211;lock feature through intercontact of their single crystals, resulting in a domino phase transition (DPT). The concomitant photoluminescence (PL) switching enables observation of the DPT in situ. The liquid eutectic interface, stress&#8211;strain transfer, and feasible thermodynamics are key issues for the CPR. DFT calculations and PL measurements revealed that the optical absorption and emission of the isomers mainly originate from [SbCl5]2&#8722; anions. The structural effects (e.g., supramolecular interactions and [SbCl5]2&#8722; distortion) on the optical emission are clarified. As a novel type of stimuli response, the CPR&#8208;induced DPT and luminescence switching exhibit potential for application in advanced time&#8208;resolved information encryption.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Selective Synthesis of a Semiconductive Silver Thiolate Coordination Polymer with Segregated Paths for Holes and Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductive trithiocyanuric acid (H3ttc)&#8208;based coordination polymers (CPs) containing Ag&#8722;S bonds were synthesized using machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted techniques. One of the obtained CPs, [Ag2Httc]n (KGF&#8208;6), features a three dimensionally extended infinite Ag&#8722;S bond network with one&#8208;dimensional column structures of stacked triazine rings. This network structure provides segregated paths for holes and electrons (see picture).







Abstract
Coordination polymers (CPs) with infinite metal&#8211;sulfur bond networks have unique electrical conductivities and optical properties. However, the development of new (&#8208;M&#8208;S&#8208;)n&#8208;structured CPs is hindered by difficulties with their crystallization. Herein, we describe the use of machine learning to optimize the synthesis of trithiocyanuric acid (H3ttc)&#8208;based semiconductive CPs with infinite Ag&#8722;S bond networks, report three CP crystal structures, and reveal that isomer selectivity is mainly determined by proton concentration in the reaction medium. One of the CPs, [Ag2Httc]n, features a 3D&#8208;extended infinite Ag&#8722;S bond network with 1D columns of stacked triazine rings, which, according to first&#8208;principle calculations, provide separate paths for holes and electrons. Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity experiments show that [Ag2Httc]n is highly photoconductive (&#966;&#931;&#956;max=1.6&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Thus, our method promotes the discovery of novel CPs with selective topologies that are difficult to crystallize.

Thus, our method promotes the discovery of novel CPs with selective topologies that are difficult to crystallize.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
