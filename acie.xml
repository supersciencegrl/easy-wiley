      <title>Robust Supramolecular Nano&#8208;tunnels Built from Molecular Bricks</title>
      <dc:description>Chemists are always seeking new methods to construct porous lattice frameworks from simple motifs. To date, the most common tectons of reported porous frameworks are predesigned multi&#8208;armed scaffolds with  C3,  C4  or  C6  symmetry. Linear two&#8208;armed tectons with  C2  symmetry are easier to synthesize but cannot form porous architectures by themself, unless combined with tectons of different symmetry. Herein we report a linear ionic molecule that assembles into a supramolecular nano&#8208;tunnel structure through synergy of trident&#8208;type ionic interactions and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The nano&#8208;tunnel crystal exhibits anisotropic guest adsorption behavior. The material shows good thermal stability and undergoes multi&#8208;stage single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transformations to a nonporous structure on heating. The material exhibits remarkable chemical stability in both acidic and basic conditions, which is rarely observed in supramolecular organic frameworks and is often related to structures with designed hydrogen bonding interactions. Because of the high polarity of the tunnels, this molecular crystal also shows a large CO2  adsorption capacity while excluding other gases at ambient temperature, leading to high CO2  /CH4  selectivity. The aggregation&#8208;induced emission feature of the molecules gives the bulk crystals vapochromic behavior.</dc:description>

      <title>NIR&#8208;II pH Sensor with FRET Adjustable Transition Point for In Situ Dynamic Tumor Microenvironment Visualization</title>
      <dc:description>pH monitoring in tumor lesions provide abundant physiological information. However, currently developed pH sensors only achieve sensitive detection in the settled response region around the pH transition point (pHt). To realize tumor pH monitoring with high sensitivity in wider response region, we herein design a serial of pHt adjustable sensors (pTAS) through simply regulating the component ratio of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission aza&#8208;BODIPY (NAB) donor and pH sensitive rhodamine&#8208;based pre&#8208;acceptor (NRh) in F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) system. Combining the pH response regions of pTAS, a twofold widened pH detection range (6.11&#8208;7.22) is obtained compared to the pHt settled sensor (6.38&#8208;6.94). With pHt adjustable feature, in vivo tumor pH increase and decrease process could be dynamically visualized through dual&#8208;channel ratiometric bioimaging in NIR&#8208;II window with coefficient of variation under 1% compared to the standard pH meter.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Large Area Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films on Copper Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A controllable electrochemical synthesis method of MOF films is developed, and opens the door to the fabrication of large&#8208;scale 2D MOF films. Industrial&#8208;scale continuous production of large&#8208;scale MOF films may be realized via this technology, which can promote their application in the field of microelectronic devices.







Abstract
Owing to their excellent physical and electrical properties, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials with well&#8208;defined supramolecular structures have received extensive research attention. However, the fabrication of large&#8208;area two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOF films is still a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a novel electrochemical (EC) synthesis method for the preparation of large&#8208;area Cu3(HHTP)2 MOF film on single&#8208;crystal Cu (100) anode. The surface reaction was achieved via charge&#8208;induced molecular assembly. The synthesized MOF film exhibited a high crystalline quality with an electrical conductivity of approximately 0.087&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which was around 1000 times larger than the previously reported values for the same material prepared by the interface method. In addition, Cu2(MTCP), Cu3(BTPA)2, and Cu3(TPTC)2 MOF films were synthesized on Cu foil with the same strategy, which confirmed the universality of the proposed method. This controllable EC method can be effectively applied to the industrial&#8208;scale production of 2D MOF films on Cu foil.

Their vibrational band positions provide detailed insights into their molecular structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tunable eg orbital occupancy in Heusler compounds for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Heusler compounds have great potential in electrocatalysis due to their mechanical robustness, metallic conductivity, and wide tunability in the electronic structure and element compositions. This study reports the first application of Co  2  YZ  type Heusler compounds as electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A range of Co  2  YZ  crystals was synthesized through the arc&#8208;melting method and the  e  g  orbital filling of Co was precisely regulated by varying  Y  and  Z  sites of the compound. A strong correlation between the  e  g  orbital filling of reactive Co sites and OER activity was found on Co  2  Mn  Z  compounds (  Z  = Ti, Al, V, and Ga) whereby higher catalytic current was achieved with  e  g  orbital filling approaching to unity. A similar trend of  e  g  orbital filling on the reactivity of cobalt sites was also observed for other set of Heusler compounds (Co  2  V  Z  ,  Z  = Sn and Ga). This work demonstrates proof of concept of application of Heusler compounds as a new class of OER electrocatalyst and the influence of the manipulation of the spin orbitals on their catalytic performances.</dc:description>

      <title>A Functional Chemiluminescent Probe for in vivo Imaging of Natural Killer Cell Activity against Tumours</title>
      <dc:description>Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells that can directly kill certain types of cancer cells. Adoptive transfer of NK cells represents a novel and promising immunotherapy for malignant tumours; however, there is a lack of methods to validate anti&#8208;tumour activity of NK cells reaching target sites  in vivo. Herein we report a new chemiluminescent probe to image  in situ  the granzyme B&#8208;mediated killing activity of NK cells against cancer cells. We have optimised a granzyme B&#8208;specific construct using an activatable phenoxydioxetane reporter so that enzymatic cleavage of the probe results in bright chemiluminescence in the visible range. The probe shows high selectivity for active granzyme B over other proteases and higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios than commercial fluorophores. Finally, we demonstrate that the probe can detect activity of NK cells in preclinical mouse models, being the first chemiluminescent probe for  in vivo  imaging of NK cell activity in live tumours.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) has been recognized as an emerging and alternative tumor therapeutic modality, which mainly involved the catalytic generation of highly toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) through metal ions&#8208;mediated Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Among metal ions, ferrous ion (Fe  2+  ) is a classical catalyst ion, however, it suffers easy oxidation and systemic side effects. Therefore, the development of controllable Fe  2+  delivery system is a big challenge to maintain its valence state, reduce toxicity and improve therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered transformable Fe  2+  delivery agent (denoted as LET&#8208;6) for fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;modality imaging guided photothermal primed CDT. The LET&#8208;6 was composed of cyanine analogue (tPy&#8208;Cy&#8208;Fe) and distearoylphosphoethanolamine&#8208;polyethylene glycol (DSPE&#8208;PEG). The   tPy&#8208;Cy&#8208;Fe  contains a cyanine structure for FL/PA imaging and a chelating ligand, 4'&#8208;(amino&#8208; methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2':6',2"&#8208;terpyridine (tPy), for  Fe  2+  binding  . Thermal expansion caused by 808 nm laser irradiation triggered the transformation of LET&#8208;6 to expose Fe  2+  from its hydrophobic layer, which primed the catalytic breakdown of endogenous H  2  O  2  in tumor microenvironment, thus generating abundant of &#8226;OH for enhanced CDT. The LET&#8208;6 showed remarkable therapeutic effects under laser irradiation  ,  both in vitro and in vivo, achieving 100% tumor elimination after just once treatment. This high&#8208;performance Fe  2+  delivery system provides a sound basis for future metal&#8208;ions&#8208;mediated cancer synergistic therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Filling the Space: A Framework for Coordinated Global Actions To Diminish Academic Bullying</title>
      <dc:description>
Academic bullying is a serious issue that affects all disciplines and people of all levels of experience. Coordinated global actions against academic bullying in higher education seem to be the only effective and timely pathway to remove &#8220;power poisoning&#8221; at any level in our science backyard.







Abstract
Academic bullying is a serious issue that affects all disciplines and people of all levels of experience. To create a truly safe, productive, and vibrant environment in academia requires coordinated and collaborative input as well as the action of a variety of stakeholders, including scholarly communities, funding agencies, and institutions. In this Viewpoint, we focus on a framework of integrated responding, in which stakeholders as responsible and response&#8208;able parties could proactively collaborate and coordinate to reduce the incidence and consequences of academic bullying while at the same time building constructive academic cultures. The outcome of such a framework would be to create novel entities (e.g. centre of excellence in academic ethics and civility) and actions (e.g. incorporating bullying records into institutional rankings) that accelerate successful responses to academic bullying.

      <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Enantioselectivity in 3D Porous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) show great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but the confinement effect of frameworks on molecular catalysts has yet to be explored. Here we demonstrate the utilization of 3D COFs with well&#8208;defined porous channels capable of inducing chiral molecular catalysts from non&#8208;enantioselective to highly enantioselective in catalyzing organic transformations, sharply different from the typical methods for tailoring enantioselectivities by varying steric and electronic properties of molecular catalysts. By condensations of a tetrahedral tetraamine and two linear dialdehydes derived from enantiopure 1,1'&#8208;binaphthol (BINOL), two chiral 3D COFs with a 9&#8208;fold or 11&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamondoid framework are prepared. Obviously enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity was observed for the chiral BINOL units that are uniformly distributed within the tubular channels compared to the non&#8208;immobilized acids. This facilitates the Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis of cyclocondensation of aldehydes and anthranilamides to produce 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones. While homogeneous BINOL controls display no enantioselectivity and/or low activity, constraint of their conformations in CCOFs leads to up to 91% isolated yield with 97% ee. DFT calculations show COF catalyst provide preferential secondary interactions between the substrate and framework to induce enantioselectivities that are not achievable in homogeneous systems.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Azobenzene (azo)&#8208;based macrocycles are highly fascinating in supramolecular chemistry because of their light&#8208;responsiveness. In this work, a series of azo&#8208;based macrocyclic arenes  1  ,  2  ,  3  and  4  distinguished by the substituted positions of azo groups are rationally designed and synthesized via a fragment cyclization method. From the crystal and computed structures of  1  ,  2  and  3  , we observe that the cavity size of these azo&#8208;macrocycles decreases gradually upon  E  &#8594;  Z  photoisomerization. Moreover, light&#8208;controlled host&#8211;guest complexations between azo&#8208;macrocycle  1  and guest molecules (7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane, terephthalonitrile) are successfully achieved. This work provides a simple and effective method to prepare azo&#8208;macrocycles, and the light&#8208;responsive molecular encapsulation systems in this work may further advance the design and applications of novel photo&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Accurate Determination of the Quantity and Spatial Distribution of Counterions around a Spherical Macroion</title>
      <dc:description>The distribution of counterions around a macroion is an important feature for macroionic systems. Here we report the determination of the accurate number and the spatial distribution of countercations (Sr  2+  , Rb  +  ) around a rigid, spherical, 2.9&#8208;nm size polyoxometalate cluster, {Mo  132  }  42&#8208;  ,  using anomalous small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (ASAXS). The results show that both Rb  +  and Sr  2+  ions have shorter diffuse lengths than theoretical prediction. In addition, most of Rb  +  ions are closely associated with {Mo  132  } by staying near the skeleton of {Mo  132  } or in the Stern layer, whereas Sr  2+  ions preferred to loosely associate with {Mo  132  } in the diffuse layer. The results also explain the observations that monovalent Rb  +  ions have a stronger affinity towards {Mo  132  } in comparison to divalent Sr  2+  ions, as well as the anomalous lower critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of {Mo  132  } in the presence of Rb  +  ions compared to Sr  2+  ions.   The anomalous CCC behavior of {Mo  132  } can be attributed to most of the negative charges being located on the inner surface of its cavity. The longer anion&#8208;cation distance weakens the Coulomb interaction and, hence, making the enthalpy change due to the breakage of hydration layers of cations more important in regulating the counterion&#8208;{Mo  132  } interaction. Macroions with charges distributed on their external surfaces, e.g., {U  60  }, do not show such abnormal behavior.</dc:description>

      <title>Simultaneous dual&#8208;gene diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 based on CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated lateral flow assay</title>
      <dc:description>Accurate and large&#8208;scale screening of infected individuals has proven to be an effective means to control the spread of COVID&#8208;19. Currently, many assays have been developed to meet the huge testing requirements and the availability of diverse detection settings. However, few methods emphasize the capability to simultaneously detect two genes in a single test, which is a key measure to improve detection accuracy, as adopted by the gold standard RT&#8208;qPCR method. Herein, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;line lateral flow assay (TL&#8208;LFA) combined with multiplex reverse transcription&#8208;recombinase polymerase amplification (RT&#8208;RPA) for rapid and simultaneous dual&#8208;gene detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in a single strip test. This assay is characterized by the detection of envelope (E) and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) genes from cell&#8208;cultured SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viral RNA standards,&#160;showing a sensitivity of 100 RNA copies per reaction (25 &#956;L). Furthermore, dual&#8208;gene analysis of 64 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples showed 100% negative predictive agreement (NPA) and 97.14% positive predictive agreement (PPA). Expectantly, this developed platform will provide a more accurate and convenient pathway for diagnosis of COVID&#8208;19 or other infectious diseases in low&#8208;resource regions.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate and large&#8208;scale screening of infected individuals has proven to be an effective means to control the spread of COVID&#8208;19. Currently, many assays have been developed to meet the huge testing requirements and the availability of diverse detection settings. However, few methods emphasize the capability to simultaneously detect two genes in a single test, which is a key measure to improve detection accuracy, as adopted by the gold standard RT&#8208;qPCR method. Herein, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;line lateral flow assay (TL&#8208;LFA) combined with multiplex reverse transcription&#8208;recombinase polymerase amplification (RT&#8208;RPA) for rapid and simultaneous dual&#8208;gene detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in a single strip test. This assay is characterized by the detection of envelope (E) and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) genes from cell&#8208;cultured SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viral RNA standards,&#160;showing a sensitivity of 100 RNA copies per reaction (25 &#956;L). Furthermore, dual&#8208;gene analysis of 64 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples showed 100% negative predictive agreement (NPA) and 97.14% positive predictive agreement (PPA). Expectantly, this developed platform will provide a more accurate and convenient pathway for diagnosis of COVID&#8208;19 or other infectious diseases in low&#8208;resource regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Extremely high capacity hard carbon for Na&#8208;ion battery, delivering 478 mAh g  &#8208;1  , is successfully synthesized by heating a freeze&#8208;dried mixture of magnesium gluconate and glucose via a MgO&#8208;template technique.

      <title>Carbodicarbene Bismaalkene Cations: Unravelling the Complexities of Carbene versus Carbone in Heavy Pnictogen Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>While pnictaalkenes are well&#8208;established for the light group 15 elements, they become more reactive and exceptionally rare as the group is descended. Herein, we report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the first examples of carbodicarbene (CDC)&#8208;stabilized bismuth complexes, which feature low&#8208;coordinate cationic bismuth centers with C=Bi multiple bond character. Monocations [(CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl][SbF6] (8) and&#160;&#160;[(CDC)BiBr2(THF)2][SbF6] (11), dications [(CDC)Bi(Ph)][SbF6]2&#160;(9) and [(CDC)BiBr(THF)3][NTf2]2&#160;(12), and trication [(CDC)2Bi][NTf2]3&#160;(13) have been synthesized via sequential halide abstractions from (CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl2&#160;(7) and (CDC)BiBr3&#160;(10). Notably, the dications and trication exhibit C&#8649;Bi double dative bonds, and thus represent unprecedented bismaalkene cations. In addition,&#160;the synthesis of these species highlights a unique non&#8208;reductive route to C&#8211;Bi &#960;&#8208;bonding character.&#160;The CDC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (7&#8208;13) were compared with related NHC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (1,&#160;3&#8208;6) and show substantially different structural properties. Indeed, the CDC ligand has a remarkable influence on the overall stability of the resulting low&#8208;coordinate Bi complexes, suggesting that CDC is a superior ligand to NHC in heavy pnictogen chemistry.&#160;All compounds have been characterized by multiple analytical methods including&#160;1H and&#160;13C NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography, elemental analysis, and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy.

      <dc:description>Mitochondria have emerged as important target for cisplatin in cancer therapy. Apart from cisplatin, many Pt complexes based on various scaffolds have also been developed to target mitochondria. Yet how cisplatin or these mitochondria&#8208;targeting Pt analogues are being processed at the cellular level remained unexplored, largely due to a lack of tools capable of probing these Pt drugs intracellularly. Herein, we developed the first mitochondria&#8208;targeting fluorescent probe for real&#8208;time monitoring of cisplatin accumulation in mitochondria and applied it to investigate the mitochondria as cellular targets for cisplatin and its Pt  IV  prodrug derivatives in biological systems.

In this work, we studied dynamic covalent libraries made of complementary bifunctional cationic peptides, yielding a diversity of species from macrocycles to polymers. Although polymers are typically expressed only at high concentration, we found that siRNA act as a template in the formation of dynamic covalent polymers at low concentration in a process guided by electrostatic binding.

      <title>The Logic Behind Markovnikov's Rule: Was It an Inspired Guess? &#8230;No!</title>
      <dc:description>
Based on Markovnikov's 1870 Annalen paper, many western authors have viewed his rule as a relatively unimportant addendum to a paper on isobutyric acid derivatives, and some have suggested that the rule itself was simply an inspired guess. In this Essay, based on an analysis of his work on the structure of the double bond in his graduate dissertations, the argument is made that it was not.







Abstract
Vladimir Vasil&#8242;evich Markovnikov (1837&#8211;1904) was a Russian chemist whose graduate research at Kazan Imperial University from 1860&#8211;1869 gave us, among other things, one of the most enduring empirical rules in organic chemistry. Markovnikov's Rule for electrophilic addition was first published in the inaugural volume of the Journal of the Russian Chemical Society (Zh. Russ. Khim. O&#8208;va.), but it was not until a year later when it was published in German that it received attention internationally. The rule itself was worded differently from the most common modern versions, in that it is expressed in terms of the electronegative part of the adding reagent. It has been suggested that this rule was the result of an inspired guess, but a careful examination of Markovnikov's graduate dissertations reveals a very different picture. In the dissertations, there is a careful build&#8208;up of logic from which the rule itself, as defined by Markovnikov, emerges naturally. Markovnikov's Rule was most decidedly not an inspired guess.

      <title>Paired copper monomers in zeolite omega: the active site for methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion</title>

      <dc:description>Divalent lanthanide organometallics are well known highly reducing compounds usually used for single electron transfer reactivity and small molecule activation. As such, their very reactive nature prevented for many years the study of their physical properties, such as magnetic studies on a reliable basis.

      <dc:description>
Abstract
Compounds with the fresnoite structure type possess remarkable chemical diversity and a range of unique physical properties, including nonlinear optical (NLO) activity. K2Sb(P2O7)F, which was reported recently, belongs to this group and its structure is not novel in terms of either the topology or local coordination geometry around the Sb3+ cations. The crystallographic disorder observed in the fresnoite&#8208;type structures can be explained by twinning, which is frequent for non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystals.

      <title>Drug&#8208;sponge lipid nanocarrier for in situ cargo loading and release using dynamic covalent chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Currently, drug delivery strategies using nanocarriers (NCs) deal with encapsulation of cargo or its covalently modified prodrug. Here, we propose a concept of reversible pH&#8208;controlled capture and delivery of active cargo based on dynamic covalent chemistry inside lipid nano&#8208;droplets (nanoemulsions), coined as &#8220;drug sponge&#8221;. We designed a highly lipophilic hydrazide (LipoHD) capable to react with a free cargo&#8208;ketone (fluorescent dye and doxorubicin drug) directly inside lipid NCs, yielding lipophilic hydrazone prodrug efficiently captured in the oil core. LipoHD&#8208;loaded NCs spontaneously accumulated cargo&#8208;ketones, yielding formulations stable against cargo leakage at pH 7.4, and further released their dye/drug cargo at low pH range (5.0&#8208;6.8) in solution and live cells. Doxorubicin&#8208;loaded drug&#8208;sponge NCs showed cytotoxicity in four cancer cell lines and capacity to inhibit tumor growth in subcutaneous xenografts of mice. Finally, unprecedented extraction of dye/drug cargos directly from cells and tissues (i.e. detoxification) was realized by the drug&#8208;sponge NCs.</dc:description>

Its potential applications were demonstrated by electrosynthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals, and natural amino acid modification.

In this process, triazenyl alkynes were bifunctional that the alkyne moiety acts as C2 fragment and triazene serves as directing group to modulate the transition state thus achieving high diastereoselectivity, and this is consistent with DFT calculations.

      <title>Site Sensitivity of Interfacial Charge Transfer and Photocatalytic Efficiency in Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding structural effects and reaction mechanisms of photocatalysts is of great interest and importance. Herein we report a comprehensive study of photocatalytic oxidation of methanol on various anatase TiO2 nanocrystals by means of combined in situ and time&#8208;resolved characterizations and density functional theory calculations. Surface site and resulting surface adsorbates were observed to strongly affect the surface band bending/bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface charge migration processes and the interfacial electronic structure/interfacial charge transfer processes. TiO2 nanocrystals predominantly enclosed by the {001} facets expose a high density of reactive fourfold&#8208;coordinated Ti sites (Ti4c) at which CH3OH molecules dissociate to form the CH3O adsorbate (CH3O(a)Ti4c). CH3O(a)Ti4c exhibits the localized density of states almost at the valence band maximum of TiO2 surface, which facilitates the interfacial hole transfer process; meanwhile, CH3O(a)Ti4c with a high coverage greatly promotes the upward surface band bending, which facilitates the bulk&#8208;to&#8208;surface hole migration process. Consequently, among all the observed surface adsorbates, CH3O(a)Ti4c exhibits the highest photocatalytic oxidation rate constant. Consequently, TiO2 nanocrystals predominantly enclosed by the {001} facets are most active in photocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction. These results unambiguously exemplify the surface structure effect in photocatalysis and elucidate the underlying mechanism.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Two novel 18&#8208;electron titanium germylene complexes, Cp  2  Ti(L)=Ge[Si  3  (SiMe  t  Bu  2  )  4  ]  3b  (L = Me  3  P) and  3c  (L = XylNC), were synthesized, isolated, and structurally characterized. The length of the titanium&#8208;germanium bonds of 2.5387(3) &#197; and 2.5276(3) &#197; (in  3b  and  3c  , respectively) well match those expected for the double bond, which was further supported by the DFT study. Based on their structural characteristics, as well as their atomic charges calculations which revealed Ti(  &#948;  +)=Ge(  &#948;  &#8211;) bond polarization, both  3b  and  3c  are classified as the Schrock&#8208;type titanium germylidenes, as the germanium analogues of the widely known titanium alkylidenes. By contrast, germylene complexes of the group 6 metals  8a  (M = Mo) and  8b  (M = W) are better described as Fischer&#8208;type germylene complexes.</dc:description>

The assembly into flower&#8208;like Kagome, brick&#8208;wall like monolayer, orthogonal packed single or double layers, wrinkled monolayer, and colloidal honeycomb superstructures can be controlled by tuning the particles&#8217; patch sizes and assembly conditions.

      <title>A General Organocatalytic System for Enantioselective Radical Conjugate Additions to Enals</title>
      <dc:description>Herein,  we report a general iminium ion&#8208;based catalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon&#8208;centered radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals. The process uses an organic photoredox catalyst, which absorbs blue light to generate radicals from stable precursors, in combination with a chiral amine catalyst, which secures a consistently high level of stereoselectivity. The generality of this catalytic platform is demonstrated by the stereoselective interception of a wide variety of radicals, including non&#8208;stabilized primary ones which are generally difficult to engage in asymmetric processes. The system also served to develop organocatalytic cascade processes that combine an iminium&#8208;ion&#8208;based radical trap with an enamine&#8208;mediated step, affording stereochemically dense chiral products in one&#8208;step.</dc:description>

      <title>Formic Acid&#8208;Assisted Selective Hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Dimethylfuran over Bifunctional Pd Nanoparticles Supported on N&#8208;doped Mesoporous Carbon</title>
      <dc:description>Biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is regarded as one of the most promising platform chemicals to produce 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran (DMF) as a potential liquid transportation fuel. Pd nanoparticles supported on N&#8208;containing and N&#8208;free mesoporous carbon materials were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenolysis of HMF to DMF under mild reaction conditions. Quantitative conversion of HMF to DMF was achieved in the presence of formic acid (FA) and H  2  over Pd/NMC within 2 h. The reaction mechanism, especially the multiple roles of FA, was explored through a detailed comparative study by varying hydrogen source, additive, and substrate as well as by applying  in situ  ATR&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The major role of FA is to shift the dominant reaction pathway from the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group to the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxymethyl group via the protonation by FA at the C&#8722;OH group, lowering the activation barrier of the C&#8722;O bond cleavage and thus significantly enhancing the reaction rate. XPS results and DFT calculations revealed that Pd  2+  species interacting with pyridine&#8208;like N atoms significantly enhance the selective hydrogenolysis of the C&#8722;OH bond in the presence of FA due to their high ability for the activation of FA and the stabilization of H  &#8208;  .</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;equilibrium large&#8208;scale membrane transformations driven by MinDE biochemical reaction cycles</title>
      <dc:description>The MinDE proteins from  E.coli  have received great attention as a paradigmatic biological pattern forming system. Recently, it has surfaced that these proteins do not only generate oscillating concentration gradients driven by ATP hydrolysis, but that they can reversibly deform giant vesicles. In order to explore the potential of Min proteins to actually perform mechanical work, we introduce a new model membrane system, flat vesicle stacks on top of a supported lipid bilayer. MinDE oscillations can repeatedly deform these flat vesicles into tubules and promote progressive membrane spreading through membrane adhesion. Dependent on membrane and buffer compositions, Min oscillations further induce robust bud formation. Altogether, we demonstrate that under specific conditions, MinDE self&#8208;organization can result in work performed on biomimetic systems, and achieve a straightforward mechanochemical coupling between the MinDE biochemical reaction cycle and membrane transformation.</dc:description>

Nevertheless, only very limited progress has been made towards non&#8208;invasive and quantitative detections of tumor&#8208;specific biomarkers in vivo, especially with clinically compatible imaging modalities. Herein, we report an Fe3O4 nanoparticle&#8208;based glutathione (GSH) responsive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe that can form particle aggregates within tumors in vivo to give rise to strong GSH concentration dependent interlocked relaxivities (R1 and R2). Through theoretical analysis on the basis of a number of approximations, a quantitative correlation between the interlocked MRI signals and local GSH concentration was established, which was further applied for mapping the heterogeneous distribution of GSH within an intracranial tumor (2.4 mm&#160;&#215; 1.6 mm) in vivo. We believe our methodology will offer a potential and practical route for quantitatively mapping tumor&#8208;specific biomarkers in vivo with unlimited detection depth that largely challenges the optical&#8208;imaging&#8208;based approaches.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Many energetic materials synthesized to date have limited applications because of low thermal and/or mechanical stability. This limitation can be overcome by introducing structural modifications such as a bridging group. In this study, a series of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;bridged furazans was prepared.

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalysed C&#8211;H Bond Zincation of Arenes: Scope, Mechanism and the Role of Heterometallic Intermediates</title>
      <dc:description>Catalytic methods that transform C&#8211;H into C&#8211;X bonds are of paramount importance in synthesis. A particular focus has been the generation of organoboranes, organosilanes and organostannanes from simple hydrocarbons (X = B, Si, Sn). Despite the importance of organozinc compounds (X = Zn), their synthesis by the catalytic functionalisation of C&#8211;H bonds remains unknown. Here we show that a palladium catalyst and zinc&#8211;hydride reagent can be used to transform C&#8211;H into C&#8211;Zn bonds. The new catalytic C&#8211;H zincation protocol has been applied to a variety of arenes &#8211; including fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene &#8211; with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. A mechanistic study shows that heterometallic Pd&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Zn complexes play a key role in catalysis. The conclusions of this work are twofold; the first is that valuable organozinc compounds are finally accessible by catalytic C&#8211;H functionalisation, the second is that heterometallic complexes are intimately involved in bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking steps of C&#8211;H functionalisation .</dc:description>

Despite the importance of organozinc compounds (X = Zn), their synthesis by the catalytic functionalisation of C&#8211;H bonds remains unknown. Here we show that a palladium catalyst and zinc&#8211;hydride reagent can be used to transform C&#8211;H into C&#8211;Zn bonds. The new catalytic C&#8211;H zincation protocol has been applied to a variety of arenes &#8211; including fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene &#8211; with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. A mechanistic study shows that heterometallic Pd&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Zn complexes play a key role in catalysis. The conclusions of this work are twofold; the first is that valuable organozinc compounds are finally accessible by catalytic C&#8211;H functionalisation, the second is that heterometallic complexes are intimately involved in bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking steps of C&#8211;H functionalisation .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Silver single&#8208;atom catalyst for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction synthesized from thermal transformation and surface reconstruction</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report an Ag 1  single&#8208;atom catalyst (Ag 1  /MnO 2  ), which was synthesized from thermal transformation of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and surface reconstruction of MnO 2  . The evolution process of Ag NPs to single atoms is firstly revealed by various techniques including in&#8208;situ  ETEM, in&#8208;situ  XRD and DFT calculations. The temperature&#8208;induced surface reconstruction process from MnO 2  (211) to (310) lattice plane is critical to firmly confine the existed surface of Ag single&#8208;atom, i.e. the thermal treatment and surface reconstruction of MnO 2  is the driving force for the formation of single Ag atoms. The as&#8208;obtained Ag 1  /MnO 2  achieved 95.7% Faradic efficiency at &#8208;0.85 V vs. RHE, and coupled with long&#8208;term stability for electrochemical CO 2  reduction reaction (CO 2  RR). DFT calculations indicated single Ag sites possessed high electronic density close to Fermi Level and could act as the only active sites in CO 2  RR.

      <dc:description>Both  syn&#8208;  and  anti&#8208;  &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols are common structural motifs in natural products, drug molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts. However, the currently available methods for synthesizing these motifs are limited to generate only one diastereoisomer.

Herein, we report a method for dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed diastereodivergent coupling of alkoxyallenes with aldimine esters. By carefully selecting the two metals and appropriate chiral ligands, we could synthesize both  syn&#8208;  and  anti&#8208;  &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol motifs with high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity from the same set of starting materials. Furthermore, stereodivergent syntheses of all four stereoisomers of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols could be achieved.

      <title>In Situ Observation of Non&#8208;Classical 2&#8208;Norbornyl Cation in Confined Zeolites under Ambient Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>Carbonium ions are an important class of reaction intermediates, but their dynamic evolution is difficult to be monitored by  in situ  techniques under experimental conditions because of their extremely short life. Probably the most famous case is 2&#8208;norbornyl cation (2NB  +  ): its existing form (classical or non&#8208;classical) had been debated for decades, until the concrete proof of non&#8208;classical geometry was obtained by X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterization under ultra&#8208;low temperature (40 K) and super acidic environment.

      <title>Enantioselective, Stereoconvergent Resolution Copolymerization of Racemic cis&#8208;Internal Epoxides and Anhydrides</title>
      <dc:description>Enantioselective copolymerization of unsymmetric disubstituted epoxides (e.g.  racemic  cis  &#8208;internal epoxides) is a very challenging issue, due to their poor reactivity, and complicated stereo&#8208;/regio&#8208;selectivity. Herein, we present an unprecedented enantioselective resolution copolymerization of  racemic  cis  &#8208;internal epoxides and anhydrides mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, affording optically active polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers, and the unreacted substrates in good enantioselectivity. An unexpected stereoconvergence is observed in this resolution copolymerization, where the selectivity factor (  s&#8208;  factor) for the enantioselective formation of copolymer significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient (  k  rel  ) based on the unreacted epoxide at various conversions. The catalytic activity and copolymer enantioselectivity are revealed to be strongly influenced by the phenolate  ortho  &#8208;substituents of the ligand set, as well as the axial linker and its chirality. The use of enantiopure binaphthol&#8208;linked bimetallic (  R,R,R,R,R  )&#8208;Al(III) complex without any substituent at the phenolate ortho&#8208;positions of the ligand allows not only a stereoconvergent access to the highly stereoregular semi&#8208;crystalline polyesters with an unprecedented levels of enantioselectivities of up to 99%  ee  (with a  s&#8208;  factor of 437), but also a concomitant kinetic resolution of the epoxide substrates (with a  k  rel  of 118). Mechanistic studies performed by combining experimental observations and density functional theory calculations suggest that both the enantiomorphic site of the ligand set and the propagating chain&#8208;end control mechanisms determined the enantioconvergent access to enantioenriched copolymers.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual Ratiometric SERS and Photoacoustic Core&#8208;Satellite Nanoprobe for Quantitatively Visualizing Hydrogen Peroxide in Inflammation and Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>Excessive production of oxidative species alters the normal redox balance and leads to human diseases, such as chronic inflammation and cancer. Oxidative species are short&#8208;lived species, which makes the direct, precise and real&#8208;time measurements difficult. There is, therefore, a need for a highly sensitive and specific oxidative species probe  in vivo  . Herein, we developed a novel core&#8208;satellite gold nanostructure nanoprobe with dual ratiometric surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging strategies, to quantitatively visualize and precisely treat the inflammation/cancer&#8208;related oxidative species. The H  2  O  2  activated second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) PA images of the nanoprobe can accelerate real&#8208;time image acquisition of the entire area of the disease, which can further precisely differentiate between the inflammation region and normal tissue. Additionally, the fingerprint spectrum of the SERS with high sensitivity enabled ratiometrically measuring the point signals of different parts of the disease, along with the guidance of the NIR&#8208;II PA imaging. It can not only quantitatively and precisely monitor the oxidative species (  e.g.  H  2  O  2  ) produced in inflammation, tumor, and osteoarthritis in rabbits in real&#8208;time, but also track the process of the anti&#8208;inflammatory treatment process.</dc:description>

      <title>Four Mechanistic Mysteries: The Benefits of Writing a Critical Review</title>
      <dc:description>
Clues from the recent literature have been used to unravel a series of mechanistic puzzles regarding the reactions of epoxides with titanium(III) reagents. Four examples are highlighted that will change the way in which titanium(III) chemistry is practiced.







Abstract
While writing a comprehensive review on the reactions of epoxides with titanium(III) reagents, we encountered a series of mechanistic puzzles. Using clues from the literature, many of which were not available at the time that the mysteries emerged, it was possible to demystify a number of these conundrums. We discuss four examples, which we believe will significantly change the way in which titanium(III) chemistry is practiced. Our experience underscores the importance of comprehensive and critical reviews in chemistry and the truism that the authors are prime beneficiaries of the review process.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Layers Hierarchically Integrate Three Synergistic Active Sites for Tandem Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A tri&#8208;functional metal&#8211;organic layer with [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ photosensitizers and Hf12 secondary building units capped with triflate groups as strong Lewis acid sites and PPA&#8208;Co groups as hydrogen&#8208;transfer catalysts synergistically catalyzed dehydrogenative tandem transformations of indolines with alkenes or aldehydes to afford 3&#8208;alkylindoles and bisindolylmethanes, respectively.







Abstract
We report the design of a bifunctional metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL), Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co, composed of [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ [DBB&#8208;Ru, DBB=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;benzoato)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine] connecting ligand as a photosensitizer and Co(dmgH)2(PPA)Cl (PPA&#8208;Co, dmgH=dimethylglyoxime; PPA=4&#8208;pyridinepropionic acid) on the Hf12 secondary building unit (SBU) as a hydrogen&#8208;transfer catalyst. Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co efficiently catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of indolines and tetrahydroquinolines to afford indoles and quinolones. We extended this strategy to prepare Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co&#8208;OTf MOL with a [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ photosensitizer and Hf12 SBU capped with triflate as strong Lewis acids and PPA&#8208;Co as a hydrogen transfer catalyst. With three synergistic active sites, Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co&#8208;OTf competently catalyzed dehydrogenative tandem transformations of indolines with alkenes or aldehydes to afford 3&#8208;alkylindoles and bisindolylmethanes with turnover numbers of up to 500 and 460, respectively, illustrating the potential use of MOLs in constructing novel multifunctional heterogeneous catalysts.

      <title>Towards the circular economy: converting aromatic plastic waste back to arenes over Ru/Nb2O5 catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The upgrading of plastic waste is one of the grand challenges for the 21  st  century owing to its disruptive impact on environment. Here, we show the first example of the catalytic conversion of various aromatic plastic wastes with C&#8211;O and/or C&#8211;C linkages to arenes (75&#8208;85% yield)&#160; via catalytic hydrogenolysis over Ru/Nb  2  O  5&#160;  catalyst. This catalyst not only allows the selective conversion of single&#8208;component aromatic plastic, and more importantly, enables the simultaneous conversion of a mixture of aromatic plastic to arenes. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique features including: (1) the small sized Ru clusters on Nb  2  O  5&#160;  , which prevent the adsorption of aromatic ring and its hydrogenation; (2) the strong oxygen affinity of NbO  x  species for C&#8211;O bond activation and Br&#248;nsted acid sites for C&#8211;C bond activation. This study offers a catalytic path to integrate aromatic plastic waste back into the supply chain of plastic production under the context of circular economy.</dc:description>

      <title>Unimolecular Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysts for Selective Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of O&#8208;carboxyanhydrides</title>
      <dc:description>Anion&#8208;binding can regulate anion transport in chloride channels via dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions, which gives insights into the designing of new organocatalytic transformations, but is surprisingly unexplored in polymerization catalysis. Herein, we describe an effective unimolecular anion&#8208;binding organocatalysis where 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine is anchored to a thiourea for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of  O  &#8208;carboxyanhydrides (OCAs), which well addresses the formidable challenge of synthesizing high molecular weight (MW) stereoregular polyesters. Ring&#8208;opening polymerization of PheOCA (OCA from phenylalanine) mediated by unimolecular anion&#8208;binding organocatalyst generates highly isotactic poly(phenyllactic acid) (Ph&#8208;PLA) with MW up to 150.0 kDa. Specifically, high MW Ph&#8208;PLA exhibits 30&#8208;fold increase in the elongation at break in comparison to its low MW congener. Moreover, active species of the polymerization are moisture&#8208;tolerant and can be conducted in unpurified solvent, facilitating facile synthesis of high MW stereoregular polyesters with pendant functional groups.  Calculations and experiment studies indicate a dynamic cooperative anion&#8208;binding mechanism where the dynamic anion&#8208;binding interaction of thiourea moiety to propagating species facilitates efficient chain propagation and the synergetic decarboxylation retains high selectivity for OCA ring&#8208;opening over side reactions (e.g., cyclization, epimerization and transesterification).</dc:description>

      <title>The Transient Covalent Bond in Abiotic Nonequilibrium Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Biochemical systems accomplish many critical functions with systems that operate out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium using the energy of chemical fuels. The formation of a transient covalent bond is a simple but very effective tool in designing analogous reaction networks. This Minireview focuses on the fuel chemistries that have been used to generate transient bonds in recent demonstrations of abiotic nonequilibrium systems (i.e., systems that do not make use of biological components). Fuel reactions are divided into two fundamental classifications depending on whether the fuel contributes structural elements to the activated state, a distinction that dictates how they can be used. Reported systems are further categorized by overall fuel reaction (e.g., hydrolysis of alkylating agents, carbodiimide hydration) and illustrate how similar chemistry can be used to effect a wide range of nonequilibrium behavior, ranging from self&#8208;assembly to the operation of molecular machines.</dc:description>

      <title>Click&#8208;Functionalization of a Poly(Tetrazine)&#8208;co&#8208;Fluorene&#8208;Conjugated Polymer with a Series of trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>
A conjugated polymer containing tetrazine groups in the backbone was prepared and found to undergo rapid inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) click chemistry, enabling facile functionalization with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivatives.

Abstract
A soluble poly(tetrazine) polymer was prepared via Suzuki polycondensation of 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;bromofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine and a fluorene diboronate derivative. It can undergo efficient and quantitative post&#8208;polymerization inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder click reactions with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives. The resulting polymers were oxidized to convert dihydropyridazine rings into pyridazines. The absorption spectra of the product polymers, both before and after oxidation, showed hypsochromic shifts that correlated with steric hindrance of the appended side chains. They also exhibited a significantly enhanced fluorescence intensity relative to the original poly(tetrazine). While gel&#8208;permeation chromatography indicated that the product polymers exhibited longer retention times, NMR end&#8208;group analysis showed that the polymers retained relatively constant degrees of polymerization. Graft copolymers were easily prepared via reaction with TCO&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) chains and a cross&#8208;linked foam was produced by reacting the poly(tetrazine) with a bis&#8208;TCO crosslinker.
