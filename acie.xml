         <title>Bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;Nanotubes with Tunable Helicity and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D nanosheets hierarchical assembled into diverse bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube with tunable helicity by a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; route. The diameter ratio of the upper to lower edge of each stacking truncated nanocone (RH) can be regulated to express the different helicity of the nanotube. The chiroptical nanoarchitectures show an enhanced and RH&#8208;dependent adjustable chirality and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).







Abstract
We report the fabrication of an exotic bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube via the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of a dipeptide&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide gelator with tunable helicity and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). It was found that in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) the gelator molecules self&#8208;assembled into a bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube, which is composed of truncated nanocones and CPL active. When defining the diameter ratio of the lower to upper edge of each nanocone as a parameter to express the helicity of different nanotubes, it was found that both the helicity and CPL of these nanotubes can be adjusted by the amount of TFA. Moreover, the helicity of the nanotube can be conveyed to the achiral quantum dots (QDs) and produce a hybrid nanotube/QDs CPL active materials with adjustable dissymmetry factor. This work finds a new type self&#8208;assembled bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube and unveils their helicity and CPL control.

         <title>Phase Engineering of Cesium Manganese Bromides Nanocrystals with Color&#8208;Tunable Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For display applications, it is highly desirable to obtain tunable red/green/blue emission. However, lead&#8208;free perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) generally exhibit broadband emission with poor color purity. Herein, we develop a unique phase transition strategy to engineer the emission color of lead&#8208;free cesium manganese bromides NCs and we can achieve a tunable red/green/blue emission with high color purity in these NCs. Such phase transition can be triggered by isopropanol: from one dimensional (1D) CsMnBr 3  NCs (red&#8208;color emission) to zero dimensional (0D) Cs 3  MnBr 5  NCs (green&#8208;color emission). Furthermore, in a humid environment both 1D CsMnBr 3  NCs and 0D Cs 3  MnBr 5  NCs can be transformed into 0D Cs 2  MnBr 4  &#183;2H 2  O NCs (blue&#8208;color emission). Cs 2  MnBr 4  &#183;2H 2  O NCs could inversely transform into the mixture of CsMnBr 3  and Cs 3  MnBr 5  phase during the thermal annealing dehydration step. Our work highlights the tunable optical properties in single component NCs via phase engineering and provides a new avenue for future endeavors in light&#8208;emitting devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkene Difunctionalization Triggered by a Stabilized Allenyl Radical: Elusively Concomitant Installation of Two Unsaturated C&#8208;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;mediated difunctionalization of alkenes provides a promising approach to introduce one alkenyl or alkynyl group to target compounds. However, simultaneous installation of two unsaturated C&#8208;C bonds via alkene difunctionalization remains elusive, attributable to the high instability and transient lifetimes of alkenyl and alkynyl radicals. Herein, we report the photocatalytic 1,2&#8208;alkynylalkenylation and 1,2&#8208;enynylalkenylation of alkenes for the first time, triggered by the intermolecular addition of a stabilized allenyl radical to an alkene. A portfolio of strategically designed, easily accessible dual&#8208;function reagents are applied to a radical docking&#8208;migration cascade. The protocol has broad substrate scope and efficiently increases the degree of unsaturation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridge Functionalisation of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8220;Escaping from flatland&#8221;, by increasing the saturation level and three&#8208;dimensionality of drug&#8208;like compounds, can enhance their potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile. One approach that has attracted considerable recent attention is the bioisosteric replacement of aromatic rings, internal alkynes and tert&#8208;butyl groups with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) units. While functionalisation of the tertiary bridgehead positions of BCP derivatives is well&#8208;documented, functionalisation of the three concyclic secondary bridge positions remains an emerging field. The unique properties of the BCP core present considerable synthetic challenges to the development of such transformations. However, the bridge positions provide novel vectors for drug discovery and applications in materials science, providing entry to novel chemical and intellectual property space. This review aims to consolidate the major advances in the field, serving as a useful reference to guide further work that is expected in the coming years.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring Metabolites Using an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive Polymer Dot and a Metabolite&#8208;specific Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Medical biosensors for real&#8208;time measurement of patient metabolite levels are needed to improve the diagnosis and management of diseases such as diabetes, phenylketonuria, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Over 100 medically relevant metabolites can be quantified by measuring the stoichiometric formation of NAD(P)H in enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here we introduce an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive polymer dot (Pdot) biosensor for point&#8208;of&#8208;care monitoring of metabolites. The Pdot is combined with a metabolite&#8208;specific NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the metabolite, generating NAD(P)H. Upon UV illumination, the NAD(P)H quenches the fluorescence emission of Pdot at 627 nm via electron transfer, and also fluoresces at 458 nm, resulting in a shift from red to blue emission at higher NAD(P)H concentrations. Metabolite concentration is quantified ratiometrically&#8212;based on the ratio of blue&#8208;to&#8208;red channel emission intensities, with a digital camera&#8212;with high sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantifying several other disease&#8208;related metabolites (lactate, glucose, glutamate, and &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate), and a paper&#8208;based assay with smartphore imaging for point&#8208;of&#8208;care use. This biosensor has broad potential utility as any metabolite that is enzymatically oxidized by NAD  +  or NADP  +  can be detected with this system.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Protoboration of CF3&#8208;Containing 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;catalyzed highly selective protoboration of CF  3  &#8208;containing conjugated diene with proton source and B  2  pin  2&#160;  has been developed. This chemistry could suppress the well&#8208;known defluorination and provide borated reagents with an intact CF  3  &#8208;group. Further studies indicated that the functional group tolerance of this chemistry is very well, and the products could be used as versatile precursors for different types of transformations. Importantly, using chiral diphosphine ligand, we have developed the first example for using such starting material to synthesis allylic boron&#8208;reagents which bearing a CF  3  &#8208;containing chiral center. Notably, the reaction mechanism was intensively studied by DFT calculation, which could reveal the reason that defluorination was inhibited.</dc:description>

         <title>Twofold C&#8208;H Activation&#8208;Based Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective C&#8208;H Arylation Using Diarylacetylenes as Rare Arylating Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;H bond activation has been established as an attractive strategy to access axially chiral biaryls, and the most straightforward method is direct C&#8208;H arylation of arenes. However, the arylating source has been limited to several classes of reactive and bulky reagents. Reported herein is rhodium&#8208;catalyzed 1:2 coupling of diarylphosphinic amides and diarylacetylenes for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of biaryls with both central and axial chirality. This twofold C&#8208;H activation reaction stays contrast to the previously explored Miura&#8208;Satoh type 1:2 coupling of arenes and alkynes in terms of chemoselectivity and proceeded under mild conditions with the alkyne acting as a rare arylating reagent. Both C&#8208;H activation events are stereo&#8208;determining and are under catalyst control, with the 2nd C&#8208;H activation being diastereo&#8208;determining in a remote fashion. Analysis of the stereochemistries of the major and side products suggests moderate enantioselectivity of the initial C&#8208;H activation&#8208;desymmetrization process. However, the minor (R) rhodium vinyl intermediate is consumed more readily in undesired protonolysis, eventually resulting in high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity of the major product.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Heterobimetallic Mg(Zn)/Al(Ga) Combinations for Cooperative C&#8211;F Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Together strong: Electron&#8208;rich low&#8208;valent AlI and electron&#8208;poor Zn2+ centers cooperatively cleave the unactivated, strong C&#8722;F bond in fluorobenzene via a dearomatization&#8211;rearomatization mechanism.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent (MeBDI)Al and (MeBDI)Ga and highly Lewis acidic cations in [(tBuBDI)M+&#8901;C6H6][(B(C6F5)4&#8722;] (M=Mg or Zn, MeBDI=HC[C(Me)N&#8208;DIPP]2, tBuBDI=HC[C(tBu)N&#8208;DIPP]2, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) react to heterobimetallic cations [(tBuBDI)Mg&#8211;Al(MeBDI)+], [(tBuBDI)Mg&#8211;Ga(MeBDI)+] and [(tBuBDI)Zn&#8211;Ga(MeBDI)+]. These cations feature long Mg&#8211;Al (or Ga) bonds while the Zn&#8211;Ga bond is short. The [(tBuBDI)Zn&#8211;Al(MeBDI)+] cation was not formed. Combined AIM and charge calculations suggest that the metal&#8211;metal bonds to Zn are considerably more covalent, whereas those to Mg should be described as weak AlI(or GaI)&#8594;Mg2+ donor bonds. Failure to isolate the Zn&#8211;Al combination originates from cleavage of the C&#8722;F bond in the solvent fluorobenzene to give (tBuBDI)ZnPh and (MeBDI)AlF+ which is extremely Lewis acidic and was not observed, but (MeBDI)Al(F)&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;F)&#8208;(F)Al(MeBDI)+ was verified by X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations show that the remarkably facile C&#8211;F bond cleavage follows a dearomatization/rearomatization route.

         <title>A High&#8208;Resolution View of the Coordination Environment in a Paramagnetic Metalloprotein from its Magnetic Properties</title>

A close look from a distance: Pseudocontact shifts depend on the magnetic susceptibility of the metal center, which in turn depends on the coordination geometry. We exploit these dependencies to obtain a detailed view of metal coordination in a metalloprotein.







Abstract
Metalloproteins constitute a significant fraction of the proteome of all organisms and their characterization is critical for both basic sciences and biomedical applications. A large portion of metalloproteins bind paramagnetic metal ions, and paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy has been widely used in their structural characterization. However, the signals of nuclei in the immediate vicinity of the metal center are often broadened beyond detection. In this work, we show that it is possible to determine the coordination environment of the paramagnetic metal in the protein at a resolution inaccessible to other techniques. Taking the structure of a diamagnetic analogue as a starting point, a geometry optimization is carried out by fitting the pseudocontact shifts obtained from first principles quantum chemical calculations to the experimental ones.

         <title>Hybrid Electrolyte Engineering Enables Safe and Wide&#8208;Temperature Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15028-15035, June 25, 2021. </description>

The hybrid electrolyte design inherits the merits of both aqueous and non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes, showing promising features for next&#8208;generation redox flow batteries: non&#8208;flammability, wide potential window, and wide operational temperature range. This work presents a promising electrolyte chemistry towards safe and wide&#8208;temperature large&#8208;scale energy storage.







Abstract
Electrolyte is an important component in redox flow batteries (RFBs) that determines the current capability, potential window, and safety, but both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes have their intrinsic limits. Here, we develop the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybrid electrolyte chemistry to enable the design of safe and wide&#8208;temperature RFBs. In addition to the non&#8208;flammable characteristics, the hybrid electrolyte also inherits the high electrochemical stability and wide operational temperature range. It can show a potential window of 2.5&#8197;V and maintain high ion conductivities at low temperatures. It also enables LiI to achieve high Coulombic efficiencies of &gt;99.9&#8201;%, showing long cycling stability over 800&#8197;cycles. Moreover, it enables the successful operation of Zn/LiI RFBs at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C for 150&#8197;cycles with nearly no capacity loss. This study highlights the great potential of hybrid electrolyte chemistry for the approach of safe and high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale energy storage systems in wide temperature ranges.

         <title>Synthesis and Multiple Subsequent Reactivity of Anionic cyclo&#8208;E3 Ligand Complexes (E=P, As)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15101-15108, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transfer of an intact cyclo&#8208;E3 ligand (E=P, As) from the nickel complex [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni(&#951;3&#8208;E3)] to the anionic cobalt complex [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3)]&#8722; was achieved, which was afterwards quenched with main group electrophiles such as chlorophosphanes (R2PCl). That way, the E3 cycle can be expanded to a substituted four&#8208;membered ring, which undergoes further rearrangement processes by ring contractions to a cyclo&#8208;E3 ligand with an exocyclic {PR2} unit.







Abstract
A synthetic pathway for the synthesis of novel anionic sandwich complexes with a cyclo&#8208;E3 (E=P, As) ligand as an end deck was developed giving [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3)]&#8722; (Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcyclopentadienyl, E=P ([5]), As ([6])) in good yields suitable for further reactivity studies. In the reaction with the chlorophosphanes R2PCl (R=Ph, Cy, tBu), neutral complexes with a disubstituted cyclo&#8208;E3P (E=P, As) ligand in [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3PR2)] (E=P (7&#8201;a&#8211;c), As (9&#8201;a&#8211;c)) were obtained. These compounds can be partially or completely converted into complexes with a cyclo&#8208;E3 (E=P, As) ligand with an exocyclic {PR2} unit in [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;2:&#951;1&#8208;E3PR2)] (E=P (8&#8201;a&#8211;c), As (10&#8201;a&#8211;c)). Additionally, the insertion of the chlorosilylene [LSiCl] (L=(tBuN)2CPh) into the cyclo&#8208;E3 ligand of [5] and [6] was achieved and the novel heteroatomic complexes [Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co(&#951;3&#8208;E3SiL)] (E=P (11), As (12)) could be isolated. The reaction pathway was elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Kinetic Resolution of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;Diols and Amino Alcohols by Dipeptide&#8208;Phosphonium Salt Catalysis Inspired by the Atherton&#8211;Todd Reaction</title>

An enantiodivergent organocatalytic kinetic resolution method has been developed, which is inspired by the Atherton&#8211;Todd (A&#8208;T) reaction. A range of R&#8208; and S&#8208;enantiomers of atropisomeric biaryls were obtained in high yields with excellent selectivity factors. The bifunctional phosphonium halide catalysts differentiate between the in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated P&#8208;species in the A&#8208;T reaction system, which results in efficient enantiodivergent O&#8208;phosphorylation reactions.







Abstract
A highly enantiodivergent organocatalytic method is disclosed for the synthesis of atropisomeric biaryls via kinetic resolution inspired by a dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt&#8208;catalyzed Atherton&#8211;Todd (A&#8208;T) reaction. This flexible approach led to both R&#8208; and S&#8208;enantiomers by fine&#8208;tuning of bifunctional phosphonium with excellent selectivity factors (s) of up to 1057 and 525, respectively. The potential of newly synthesized O&#8208;phosphorylated biaryl diols was illustrated by the synthesis of axially chiral organophosphorus compounds. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the bifunctional phosphonium halide catalyst differentiates between the in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated P&#8208;species in the A&#8208;T process, mainly involving phosphoryl chloride and phosphoric anhydride, thus leading to highly enantiodivergent O&#8208;phosphorylation reactions. Furthermore hydrogen bonding interactions between the catalysts and phosphorus molecules were crucial in asymmetric induction.

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Pentagon&#8208; and Heptagon&#8208;Embedded Nanographene Containing a Central Pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole Core</title>

Multi&#8208;milligram&#8208;scale synthesis of the first example of a bowl&#8208;shaped nanographene with a pyrrolo&#8208;pyrrole core has been achieved via sequential, programmed, intramolecular direct arylations. This curved molecule possesses an inverse Stone&#8211;Thrower&#8211;Wales topology (a combination of fused pentagons and heptagons), small bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl inversion barrier, high&#8208;lying HOMO, weak red&#8208;emission at 615&#8197;nm, and a small dipole moment.







Abstract
A bowl&#8208;shaped nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographene composed of a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core substituted with six arene rings circularly bonded with one another has been prepared via a concise synthetic strategy encompassing the multicomponent tetraarylpyrrolopyrrole (TAPP) synthesis, the Scholl reaction, and intramolecular direct arylation. This synthesis represents the first case of programmed sequential intramolecular direct arylation reactions utilizing the different reactivity of C&#8211;Br and C&#8211;Cl bonds. The target compound contains two central pentagons confined between two adjacent heptagons&#8212;the inverse Stone&#8211;Thrower&#8211;Wales topology. The presence of both five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings in the final structure is responsible for interesting properties such as a perpendicularly aligned dipole moment, absorption and fluorescence in the orange&#8208;red region, weak emission originating from the charge&#8208;transfer character of a low&#8208;energy absorption band, and a high lying HOMO. In the solid state slipped convex&#8208;to&#8208;convex &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking dominates.

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Uranyl Superoxide</title>

A novel uranyl superoxide compound reacts with carbon dioxide resulting in uranyl carbonate phases within six days of air exposure, directly linking uranyl superoxide to the carbonate corrosion products observed on the surface of spent nuclear fuel.







Abstract
The high radiation field associated with spent nuclear fuel (UIVO2) pellets produces an array of reactive radical species that impact the corrosion and formation of secondary alteration phases. Dioxygen radicals are important as radiolysis products, but the interaction between these reactive oxygen species and UVIO22+ and its effects on the resultant alteration phases is unclear. We report the first example of a UVI superoxide compound and explore its reactivity in the environments relevant to the storage of spent nuclear fuel. We utilized X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman scattering techniques to demonstrate that the uranyl superoxide reacts with CO2 in air to afford a mixed uranyl peroxide/carbonate within 3&#8197;days, both in solution and under atmospheric conditions. An additional transformation occurs over the course of 3&#8197;months to form a potassium UVI carbonate (grimselite), which also occurs as an alteration product on Chernobyl corium. Our results demonstrate the presence and significance of the superoxide anion in the alteration of spent nuclear fuel and indicate the impact of uranyl superoxide chemistry on high prevalence of carbonate in the secondary phases of spent nuclear fuel.

         <title>Evidence of Mars&#8208;Van&#8208;Krevelen Mechanism in the Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution on Ni&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14981-14988, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry using a hanging droplet cell confirmed the occurrence of Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen lattice oxygen evolution reaction mechanism in both Ni(OH)2 and NiFe layered double hydroxide nanocatalysts. This mechanism involves the coupling of oxygen atoms from the catalyst surface and the electrolyte.







Abstract
Water oxidation is a crucial reaction for renewable energy conversion and storage. Among the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, NiFe based oxyhydroxides show the highest catalytic activity. However, the details of their OER mechanism are still unclear, due to the elusive nature of the OER intermediates. Here, using a novel differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) cell interface, we performed isotope&#8208;labelling experiments in 18O&#8208;labelled aqueous alkaline electrolyte on Ni(OH)2 and NiFe layered double hydroxide nanocatalysts. Our experiments confirm the occurrence of Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen lattice oxygen evolution reaction mechanism in both catalysts to various degrees, which involves the coupling of oxygen atoms from the catalyst and the electrolyte. The quantitative charge analysis suggests that the participating lattice oxygen atoms belong exclusively to the catalyst surface, confirming DFT computational hypotheses. Also, DEMS data suggest a fundamental correlation between the magnitude of the lattice oxygen mechanism and the faradaic efficiency of oxygen controlled by pseudocapacitive oxidative metal redox charges.

         <title>Noncanonical Heme Ligands Steer Carbene Transfer Reactivity in an Artificial Metalloenzyme**

Metalloprotein properties can be tuned by changing the primary metal coordination sphere. Here amber stop codon suppression with engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases was used to replace the proximal histidine in myoglobin with a range of new amino acids. In addition to tuning the heme redox potential over a &gt;200 mV range, these noncanonical ligands modulate the protein's carbene transfer activity with ethyl diazoacetate.







Abstract
Changing the primary metal coordination sphere is a powerful strategy for tuning metalloprotein properties. Here we used amber stop codon suppression with engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases, including two newly evolved enzymes, to replace the proximal histidine in myoglobin with N&#948;&#8208;methylhistidine, 5&#8208;thiazoylalanine, 4&#8208;thiazoylalanine and 3&#8208;(3&#8208;thienyl)alanine. In addition to tuning the heme redox potential over a &gt;200&#8197;mV range, these noncanonical ligands modulate the protein's carbene transfer activity with ethyl diazoacetate. Variants with increased reduction potential proved superior for cyclopropanation and N&#8211;H insertion, whereas variants with reduced Eo values gave higher S&#8211;H insertion activity. Given the functional importance of histidine in many enzymes, these genetically encoded analogues could be valuable tools for probing mechanism and enabling new chemistries.

         <title>Efficient Intramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Fluorophores Based on Substituted Triphenylphosphine Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15049-15053, June 25, 2021. </description>

Trivalent phosphorus is considered as new electron&#8208;donating species for intramolecular charge transfer fluorophores. The efficient triphenylphosphine&#8208;based emitters with excellent electrochemical stability and small singlet&#8211;triplet splitting afford potentials for luminescence&#8208;based applications and devices.







Abstract
Triphenylphosphine (TPP)&#8208;based luminescent compounds are rarely investigated because of the low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we demonstrate that introducing steric hindrance groups to the TPP moiety and separating the orbitals involved in the transition can drastically suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay induced by structural distortion of TPP in the excited state. High PLQY up to 0.89 as well as thermally activated delayed fluorescence are observed from the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) molecules with substituted TPP donors (sTPPs) in doped films. The red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes employing these emitters achieve comparable external quantum efficiencies to the control device containing a classical phosphorescent dye, revealing the great potential of the ICT emitters based on electrochemically stable sTPPs.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Dielectric Property and Energy Transfer on Charge Separation in Non&#8208;Fullerene&#8208;Based Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15054-15062, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic effect of the higher dielectric property of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and corresponding photoactive films and the energy transfer from donor to acceptor on charge separation of selected non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices, these results well interpret the high device performance with a tiny driving force, and the intrinsic physical working mechanism on non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices is proposed.







Abstract
In non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices, it is unclear how excitons efficiently dissociate into charge carriers under small driving force. Here, we developed a modified method to estimate dielectric constants of PM6 donor and non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. Surprisingly, most non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and blend films showed higher dielectric constants. Moreover, they exhibited larger dielectric constants differences at the optical frequency. These results are likely bound to reduced exciton binding energy and bimolecular recombination. Besides, the overlap between the emission spectrum of donor and absorption spectra of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors allowed the energy transfer from donor to acceptors. Hence, based on the synergistic effect of dielectric property and energy transfer resulting in efficient charge separation, our finding paves an alternative path to elucidate the physical working mechanism in non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based photovoltaic devices.

         <title>A Polarity&#8208;Sensitive Ratiometric Fluorescence Probe for Monitoring Changes in Lipid Droplets and Nucleus during Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15095-15100, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first lipid droplet (LD)/nucleus dual&#8208;targeted ratiometric fluorescence probe, CQPP, for monitoring polarity change was developed. CQPP offers ratiometric fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime imaging of LD polarity variations. Using nucleus imaging as a reference, CQPP was applied to report the increase in LD polarity and the homogenization of polarity between LDs and cytoplasm in the ferroptosis model.







Abstract
Ferroptosis regulates cell death through reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;associated lipid peroxide accumulation, which is expected to affect the structure and polarity of lipid droplets (LDs), but with no clear evidence. Herein, we report the first example of an LD/nucleus dual&#8208;targeted ratiometric fluorescent probe, CQPP, for monitoring polarity changes in the cellular microenvironment. Due to the donor&#8211;acceptor structure of CQPP, it offers ratiometric fluorescence emission and fluorescence lifetime signals that reflect polarity variations. Using nucleus imaging as a reference, CQPP was applied to report the increase in LD polarity and the homogenization of polarity between LDs and cytoplasm in the ferroptosis model. This LD/nucleus dual&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe shows the great potential of using fluorescence imaging to study ferroptosis and ferroptosis&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Constraint&#8208;Induced Peroxide Activation for Electrophilic Reactivity</title>

An end&#8208;on &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxodicobalt(III) complex 1 involving a non&#8208;heme ligand system, L1, supported on a Sn6O6 stannoxane core has been found to be a reactive electrophile that is capable of initiating hydrogen atom and oxygen atom transfer reactions. The electrophilicity of 1 is attributed to the constraints provided by the Sn6O6 core and represents a new domain for metal&#8722;peroxo reactivity.







Abstract
&#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8208;bridged diiron(III) intermediates P are proposed as reactive intermediates in various biological oxidation reactions. In sMMO, P acts as an electrophile, and performs hydrogen atom and oxygen atom transfers to electron&#8208;rich substrates. In cyanobacterial ADO, however, P is postulated to react by nucleophilic attack on electrophilic carbon atoms. In biomimetic studies, the ability of &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8208;bridged dimetal complexes of Fe, Co, Ni and Cu to act as nucleophiles that effect deformylation of aldehydes is documented. By performing reactivity and theoretical studies on an end&#8208;on &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxodicobalt(III) complex 1 involving a non&#8208;heme ligand system, L1, supported on a Sn6O6 stannoxane core, we now show that a peroxo&#8208;bridged dimetal complex can also be a reactive electrophile. The observed electrophilic chemistry, which is induced by the constraints provided by the Sn6O6 core, represents a new domain for metal&#8722;peroxide reactivity.

         <title>Origins of Endo Selectivity in Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of Cyclic Allene Dienophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14989-14997, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study of the factors contributing to endo selectivity in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with strained cyclic allenes is reported. The contributions of a new type of secondary orbital interaction resulting from the twisted nature of the strained allene, and electrostatic effects, to endo selectivity are established.







Abstract
Strained cyclic allenes, first discovered in 1966 by Wittig and co&#8208;workers, have recently emerged as valuable synthetic building blocks. Previous experimental investigations, and computations reported here, demonstrate that the Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of furans and pyrroles with 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadiene and oxa&#8208; and azaheterocyclic analogs proceed with endo selectivity. This endo selectivity gives the adduct with the allylic saturated carbon of the cyclic allene endo to the diene carbons. The selectivity is very general and useful in synthetic applications. Our computational study establishes the origins of this endo selectivity. We analyze the helical frontier molecular orbitals of strained cyclic allenes and show how secondary orbital and electrostatic effects influence stereoselectivity. The LUMO of carbon&#8208;3 of the allene (C&#8208;3 is not involved in primary orbital interactions) interacts in a stabilizing fashion with the HOMO of the diene in such a way that the carbon of the cyclic allene attached to C&#8208;1 favors the endo position in the transition state. The furan LUMO, allene HOMO interaction reinforces this preference. These mechanistic studies are expected to prompt the further use of long&#8208;avoided strained cyclic allenes in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Handed Double Helix and Spiral Platelet Formed by Racemate of Dissymmetric Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15080-15086, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of dissymmetric cage DC&#8208;1 forms an unusual supramolecular double helix, which is composed of six racemic pairs of DC&#8208;1 per turn, and exhibits a single&#8208;handed helical sense. These single&#8208;handed helices with frustrated packing further assembled into hexagonal crystals with screw dislocation, with symmetry&#8208;breaking at morphological level.







Abstract
Spontaneous deracemization has been used to separate homochiral domains from the racemic system. However, homochirality can only be referred to when the scales of these domains and systems are specified. To clarify this, we report self&#8208;assembly of racemates of dissymmetric cages DC&#8208;1 with a cone&#8208;shape propeller geometry, forming a centrosymmetric columnar crystalline phase (racemic at crystallographic level). Owing to their anisotropic geometry, the two enantiomers are packed in a frustrated fashion in this crystalline phase; single&#8208;handed double helices are observed (single&#8208;handedness at supramolecular level). The frustrated packing (layer continuity break&#8208;up) in turn facilitates screw dislocation during the crystal growth, forming left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed spiral platelets (symmetry&#8208;breaking at morphological level), although each platelet is composed of DC&#8208;1 racemates. The symmetry correlation between DC&#8208;1 molecules, the crystalline phase and spiral platelets, all exhibit C3 symmetry.

         <title>Supercharging Prions via Amyloid&#8208;Selective Lysine Acetylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15069-15079, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead compounds were designed to &#8220;supercharge&#8221; misfolded forms of proteins linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease (i.e., superoxide dismutase&#8208;1; &#945;&#8208;synuclein). Compounds increased the net negative charge of amyloid fibrils via lysine peracetylation, with minimal to no modification of various proteins in their native state. Supercharged fibrils exhibited weaker seeding activity in vitro and in organotypic spinal cord.







Abstract
Repulsive electrostatic forces between prion&#8208;like proteins are a barrier against aggregation. In neuropharmacology, however, a prion's net charge (Z) is not a targeted parameter. Compounds that selectively boost prion Z remain unreported. Here, we synthesized compounds that amplified the negative charge of misfolded superoxide dismutase&#8208;1 (SOD1) by acetylating lysine&#8208;NH3+ in amyloid&#8208;SOD1, without acetylating native&#8208;SOD1. Compounds resembled a &#8220;ball and chain&#8221; mace: a rigid amyloid&#8208;binding &#8220;handle&#8221; (benzothiazole, stilbene, or styrylpyridine); an aryl ester &#8220;ball&#8221;; and a triethylene glycol chain connecting ball to handle. At stoichiometric excess, compounds acetylated up to 9 of 11 lysine per misfolded subunit (&#916;Zfibril=&#8722;8100 per 103 subunits). Acetylated amyloid&#8208;SOD1 seeded aggregation more slowly than unacetylated amyloid&#8208;SOD1 in vitro and organotypic spinal cord (these effects were partially due to compound binding). Compounds exhibited reactivity with other amyloid and non&#8208;amyloid proteins (e.g., fibrillar &#945;&#8208;synuclein was peracetylated; serum albumin was partially acetylated; carbonic anhydrase was largely unacetylated).

         <title>Cyclotetrabenzoin Acetate: A Macrocyclic Porous Molecular Crystal for CO2 Separations by Pressure Swing Adsorption**

A porous molecular crystal assembled by the close packing of macrocyclic cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is used as an efficient adsorbent in pressure swing adsorption for CO2 capture. It exhibits excellent CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation performance via both kinetic and thermodynamic effects.







Abstract
A porous molecular crystal (PMC) assembled by macrocyclic cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is an efficient adsorbent for CO2 separations. The 7.1&#215;7.1&#8197;&#197; square pore of PMC and its ester C=O groups play important roles in improving its affinity for CO2 molecules. The benzene walls of macrocycle engage in an apparent [&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] interaction with the molecule of CO2 at low pressure. In addition, the polar carbonyl groups pointing inward the square channels reduce the size of aperture to a 5.0&#215;5.0&#8197;&#197; square, which offers kinetic selectivity for CO2 capture. The PMC features water tolerance and high structural stability under vacuum and various gas adsorption conditions, which are rare among intrinsically porous organic molecules. Most importantly, the moderate adsorbate&#8208;adsorbent interaction allows the PMC to be readily regenerated, and therefore applied to pressure swing adsorption processes. The eluted N2 and CH4 are obtained with over 99.9&#8201;% and 99.8&#8201;% purity, respectively, and the separation performance is stable for 30&#8197;cycles. Coupled with its easy synthesis, cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is a promising adsorbent for CO2 separations from flue and natural gases.

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Generation in Dark&#8208;Hypoxia by Catalytic Microenvironment&#8208;Tailored Nanoreactors for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence&#8208;Monitored Chemodynamic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Catalytic microenvironment&#8208;tailored nanoreactors (CMTNs) with a built&#8208;in ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescent 1O2 sensor were fabricated for monitored chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Benefiting from the impermeability of liposomal lipid membrane to ions and glutathione (GSH), the liposome&#8208;based CMTNs afford favorable pH for MoO42&#8722;&#8208;catalyzed generation of 1O2 from H2O2 and protect MoO42&#8722; from GSH chelation&#8208;triggered inactivation.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) has a potent anticancer effect, but photosensitized generation of 1O2 is inhibited by tumor hypoxia and limited light penetration depth. Despite the potential of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) to circumvent these issues by exploration of 1O2&#8208;producing catalysts, engineering efficient CDT agents is still a formidable challenge since most catalysts require specific pH to function and become inactivated upon chelation by glutathione (GSH). Herein, we present a catalytic microenvironment&#8208;tailored nanoreactor (CMTN), constructed by encapsulating MoO42&#8722; catalyst and alkaline sodium carbonate within liposomes, which offers a favorable pH condition for MoO42&#8722;&#8208;catalyzed generation of 1O2 from H2O2 and protects MoO42&#8722; from GSH chelation owing to the impermeability of liposomal lipid membrane to ions and GSH. H2O2 and 1O2 can freely cross the liposomal membrane, allowing CMTN with a built&#8208;in NIR&#8208;II ratiometric fluorescent 1O2 sensor to achieve monitored tumor CDT.

         <title>General, Divergent Platform for Diastereoselective Synthesis of trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes with High Reactivity and Favorable Physiochemical Properties**

Hydrophilic trans&#8208;cyclooct&#8208;4&#8208;enones (TCOs) with favorable physicochemical properties for live cell or in&#8197;vivo experiments are especially hard to access. Readily accessible TCOs are now shown to undergo diastereoselective additions with a broad range of nucleophiles to give access to functionalized axial&#8208;5&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (a&#8208;TCO), a family of trans&#8208;cyclooctenes with high reactivity and improved physiochemical properties.







Abstract
trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes (TCOs) are essential partners in the fastest known bioorthogonal reactions, but current synthetic methods are limited by poor diastereoselectivity. Especially hard to access are hydrophilic TCOs with favorable physicochemical properties for live cell or in&#8197;vivo experiments. Described is a new class of TCOs, &#8220;a&#8208;TCOs&#8221;, prepared in high yield by stereocontrolled 1,2&#8208;additions of nucleophiles to trans&#8208;cyclooct&#8208;4&#8208;enone, which itself was prepared on a large scale in two steps from 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene. Computational transition&#8208;state models rationalize the diastereoselectivity of 1,2&#8208;additions to deliver a&#8208;TCO products, which were also shown to be more reactive than standard TCOs and less hydrophobic than even a trans&#8208;oxocene analogue. Illustrating the favorable physicochemical properties of a&#8208;TCOs, a fluorescent TAMRA derivative in live HeLa cells was shown to be cell&#8208;permeable through intracellular Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry and to wash out more rapidly than other TCOs.

Temperature&#8208;sensitive lipo&#8208;proteinosomes were engineered by grafting lipids onto temperature&#8208;responsive elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs). Maintained at 37&#8201;&#176;C, folded ELP loops on the internal/external surface of the biohybrid membrane prevent the leaching of encapsulated molecules, while cooling of the dispersion induces a burst release, in correlation with the decompaction of ELP chains.







Abstract
Biomimetic design to afford smart functional biomaterials with exquisite properties represents synthetic challenges and provides unique perspectives. In this context, elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) recently became highly attractive building blocks in the development of lipoprotein&#8208;based membranes. In addition to the bioengineered post&#8208;translational modifications of genetically encoded recombinant ELPs developed so far, we report here a simple and versatile method to design biohybrid brush&#8208;like lipid&#8208;grafted&#8208;ELPs using chemical post&#8208;modification reactions. We have explored a combination of methionine alkylation and click chemistry to create a new class of hybrid lipoprotein mimics. Our design allowed the formation of biomimetic vesicles with controlled permeability, correlated to the temperature&#8208;responsiveness of ELPs.

A direct nickel&#8208;catalyzed monofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkyl halides has been established, by demonstrating the first example of reductive C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling fluoroalkylation. These transformations exhibited high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility, especially for a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Monofluorinated alkyl compounds are of great importance in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Herein, we describe a direct nickel&#8208;catalyzed monofluoromethylation of unactivated alkyl halides using a low&#8208;cost industrial raw material, bromofluoromethane, by demonstrating a general and efficient reductive cross&#8208;coupling of two alkyl halides. Results with 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;fluoroalkane also demonstrate the viability of monofluoroalkylation, which further established the first example of reductive C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling fluoroalkylation. These transformations demonstrate high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility, especially for a range of pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds. Mechanistic studies support a radical pathway. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction is first&#8208;order dependent on catalyst and alkyl bromide whereas the generation of monofluoroalkyl radical is not involved in the rate&#8208;determining step. This strategy provides a general and efficient method for the synthesis of aliphatic fluorides.

         <title>Cancer&#8208;Cell&#8208;Activated in situ Synthesis of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting AIE Photosensitizer for Precise Photodynamic Therapy</title>

Mitochondria&#8208;targeting AIE photosensitizer is specifically synthesized inside cancer cells, realizing precise photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Maximization of phototoxic damage on tumor with minimized side effect on normal tissue is essential for effective anticancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). This requires highly cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;specific or even cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;organelle&#8208;specific synthesis or delivery of efficient photosensitizers (PSs) in vitro and in vivo, which is difficult to achieve. Herein, we report a strategy of cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;activated PS synthesis, by which an efficient mitochondria&#8208;targeting photosensitizer with aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) feature can be selectively synthesized as an efficient image&#8208;guided PDT agent inside cancer cells. MOF&#8208;199, a CuII&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework, was selected as an inert carrier to load the PS precursors for efficient delivery and served as a CuI catalyst source for in situ click reaction to form PSs exclusively in cancer cells. The in situ synthesized PS showed mitochondria&#8208;targeting capability, allowing potent cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;specific ablation under light irradiation. The high specificity of PSs produced in cancer cells also makes it safer post&#8208;treatment.

         <title>Bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder Dimerization of ortho&#8208;Quinols in Natural Product (Bio)Synthesis: Bioinspired Chemical 6&#8208;Step Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Maytenone</title>

Biosynthesis of many natural bicyclo[2.2.2]octenone products involves the Diels&#8211;Alder cyclodimerization of ortho&#8208;quinols according to the same selectivity rules. This is illustrated by the enzyme&#8208;free synthesis of the bisditerpenoid (+)&#8208;maytenone, first achieved by a chiral iodane&#8208;mediated dearomative hydroxylation of (+)&#8208;ferruginol and a high pressure&#8208;promoted Diels&#8211;Alder reaction.







Abstract
Many natural products of plant or microbial origins are derived from enzymatic dearomative oxygenation of 2&#8208;alkylphenolic precursors into 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxycyclohexa&#8208;2,4&#8208;dienones. These so&#8208;called ortho&#8208;quinols cyclodimerize via a remarkably selective bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. Whether or not the intervention of catalytic or dirigent proteins is involved during this final step of the biosynthesis of these natural products, this cyclodimerization of ortho&#8208;quinols can be chemically reproduced in the laboratory with the same strict level of site&#8208;specific regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. This unique yet unified process, which finds its rationale in the inherent chemical reactivity of those ortho&#8208;quinols, is illustrated herein by an efficient and bioinspired first chemical synthesis of one of the most structurally complex and synthetically challenging examples of such natural cyclodimers, the bisditerpenoid (+)&#8208;maytenone.

In this work, we developed pH&#8208;responsive DNA switching circuits for directing mechanical deformation of microgel swelling system through multiple chemical pathways of soft matter computing with chemical reaction networks.







Abstract
Developing smart material systems for performing different tasks in diverse environments remains challenging. Here, we show that by integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials with multi&#8208;mode reconfigurable DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction circuits (D&#8208;CRCs), it can control size change of microgels with multiple reaction pathways and adapt expansion behaviors to meet diverse environments. We first use pH&#8208;responsive intramolecular conformational switches for regulating DNA strand displacement reactions (SDRs). The ability to regulate SDRs with tunable pH&#8208;dependence allows to build dynamic chemical reaction networks with diverse reaction pathways. We confirm that the designed DNA switching circuits are reconfigurable at different pH and perform different logic operations, and the swelling of DNA switching circuit&#8208;integrated microgel systems can be programmably directed by D&#8208;CRCs. Our approach provides insight into building smart responsive materials and fabricating autonomous soft robots.

         <title>Cooperative Bond Activation and Facile Intramolecular Aryl Transfer of Nickel&#8211;Aluminum Pincer&#8208;type Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 15087-15094, June 25, 2021. </description>

Nickel complexes supported by a pincer&#8208;type aluminum metalloligand were synthesized and demonstrated several unique modes of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity. Unexpectedly, the PAlP framework reversibly converts between the alane and aluminyl through aryl group transmetalation between aluminum and nickel.







Abstract
Pincer&#8208;type nickel&#8211;aluminum complexes were synthesized using two equivalents of the phosphinoamide, [PhNCH2PiPr2]&#8722;. The Ni0&#8211;AlIII complexes, {(MesPAlP)Ni}2(&#956;&#8208;N2) and {(MesPAlP)Ni}2(&#956;&#8208;COD), where MesPAlP is (Mes)Al(NPhCH2PiPr2)2, were structurally characterized. The (PAlP)Ni system exhibited cooperative bond cleavage mediated by the two&#8208;site Ni&#8211;Al unit, including oxidative addition of aryl halides, H2 activation, and ortho&#8208;directed C&#8722;H bond activation of pyridine N&#8208;oxide. One intriguing reaction is the reversible intramolecular transfer of the mesityl ring from the Al to the Ni site, which is evocative of the transmetalation step during cross&#8208;coupling catalysis. The aryl&#8208;transfer product,(THF)Al(NPhCH2PiPr2)2Ni(Mes), is the first example of a first&#8208;row transition metal&#8211;aluminyl pincer complex. The addition of a judicious donor enables the Al metalloligand to convert reversibly between the alane and aluminyl forms via aryl group transfer to and from Ni, respectively. Theoretical calculations support a zwitterionic Ni&#948;&#8722;&#8211;Al&#948;+ electronic structure in the nickel&#8211;aluminyl complex.

The (PAlP)Ni system exhibited cooperative bond cleavage mediated by the two-site Ni&#8211;Al unit, including oxidative addition of aryl halides, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation, and ortho-directed C&#8722;H bond activation of pyridine N-oxide. One intriguing reaction is the reversible intramolecular transfer of the mesityl ring from the Al to the Ni site, which is evocative of the transmetalation step during cross-coupling catalysis. The aryl-transfer product,(THF)Al(NPhCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni(Mes), is the first example of a first-row transition metal&#8211;aluminyl pincer complex. The addition of a judicious donor enables the Al metalloligand to convert reversibly between the alane and aluminyl forms via aryl group transfer to and from Ni, respectively. Theoretical calculations support a zwitterionic Ni&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Al&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; electronic structure in the nickel&#8211;aluminyl complex.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Dual Fluorescence&#8211;Spin Label Probe for Visualization and Quantification of Target Molecules in Tissue by Multiplexed FLIM&#8211;EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14938-14944, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;label synthetic platform for a functional dual fluorescence&#8211;spin label probe enables the non&#8208;destructive simultaneous quantification and visualization of molecules in biological tissue. Multiplexed FLIM and EPR spectroscopy avoids analytical inconsistencies between both techniques. Beside tissue applications, molecular spectroscopic studies of biomolecular conformation, structure, dynamics, and microenvironment are feasible.







Abstract
Simultaneous visualization and concentration quantification of molecules in biological tissue is an important though challenging goal. The advantages of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) for visualization, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy for quantification are complementary. Their combination in a multiplexed approach promises a successful but ambitious strategy because of spin label&#8208;mediated fluorescence quenching. Here, we solved this problem and present the molecular design of a dual label (DL) compound comprising a highly fluorescent dye together with an EPR spin probe, which also renders the fluorescence lifetime to be concentration sensitive. The DL can easily be coupled to the biomolecule of choice, enabling in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro applications. This novel approach paves the way for elegant studies ranging from fundamental biological investigations to preclinical drug research, as shown in proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle penetration experiments in human skin ex&#8197;vivo.

From the teaching class with the bispericyclic Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of ortho&#8208;quinols drawn on the chalk board to the laboratory with the (+)&#8208;ferruginol substrate and a chiral bisiodyl reagent in the flask: The single ortho&#8208;quinol diastereomer thus produced combines in pairs to reach a C2&#8208;symmetric transition state in which [4+2] and [2+4] processes are equivalent, as described by Laurent Pouys&#233;gu, St&#233;phane Quideau, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;14967. Under high pressure, this transition state leads to the product, the natural (+)&#8208;maytenone, which was first isolated from the plant Maytenus dispermus, here appearing in the background image. Design by Jean Ung@SQuideau Lab.

A bowl&#8208;shaped nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographene composed of a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core substituted with six arene rings circularly bonded with one another undergoes bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl inversion with a low barrier. This inversion resembles that of an umbrella flipped by the strong wind. The transition state is not planar, but possesses a rather twisted, S&#8208;shaped conformation with Ci symmetry. The bowl&#8208;inversion mechanism follows a quadruple&#8208;well potential model, as reported by Andrzej&#8197;L. Sobolewski, Micha&#322;&#8197;K. Cyra&#324;ski, Daniel&#8197;T. Gryko, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;14998.

Access to the elusive UV solar&#8208;blind region based on direct second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) enabled by a non&#8208;traditional &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation&#8208;based phosphate crystal is reported by Chi Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;14806. The rare coexistence of UV solar&#8208;blind&#8208;region phase&#8208;matchable optical nonlinearity and anisotropy, including wide UV transparency, large SHG response, and sufficient birefringence, can be attributed to the introduction of &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations and their favorable collaboration with phosphate anions.

A porous molecular crystal assembled by close&#8208;packing of macrocyclic cyclotetrabenzoin acetate efficiently captures CO2, as reported by Ognjen&#8197;&#352;. Miljani&#263;, Teng&#8208;Hao Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;14931. The square 7.1&#215;7.1 &#197; pores enable excellent CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation performance via both kinetic and thermodynamic effects. Moderately strong CO2&#8211;framework interactions allow easy regeneration of the adsorbent and its use in pressure swing adsorption.

Nuclear hyperpolarization is a powerful method that can dramatically enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy. This technology has been applied to the biomedical molecular imaging of a range of small molecules with stable isotopes and has provided valuable metabolic and physiological information. This review focuses on strategies for the design of molecular probes for hyperpolarized bioimaging.







Abstract
Nuclear hyperpolarization has emerged as a method to dramatically enhance the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy. By application of this powerful tool, small molecules with stable isotopes have been used for highly sensitive biomedical molecular imaging. The recent development of molecular probes for hyperpolarized in vivo analysis has demonstrated the ability of this technique to provide unique metabolic and physiological information. This review presents a brief introduction of hyperpolarization technology, approaches to the rational design of molecular probes for hyperpolarized analysis, and examples of molecules that have met with success in vitro or in vivo.

Organic transformations using electric current as a sustainable activator are a rapidly developing interdisciplinary field. However, different scientific backgrounds have led to a loss of important information being reported. Several pitfalls and misunderstandings regarding important parameters exist, which can cause challenges in reproducibility, even though electrical current is able to dial&#8208;in various reactivities.







Abstract
The use of electric current as a traceless activator and reagent is experiencing a renaissance. This sustainable synthetic method is evolving into a hot topic in contemporary organic chemistry. Since researchers with various scientific backgrounds are entering this interdisciplinary field, different parameters and methods are reported to describe the experiments. The variation in the reported parameters can lead to problems with the reproducibility of the reported electroorganic syntheses. As an example, parameters such as current density or electrode distance are in some cases more significant than often anticipated. This Minireview provides guidelines on reporting electrosynthetic data and dispels myths about this technique, thereby streamlining the experimental parameters to facilitate reproducibility.

This review examines and summarizes the recent advances on the rational design and structural modulation of nanogels to overcome the complex biological barriers on the way to the site of action following various dosing modes. In addition, the future perspectives are presented with regards to opportunities and challenges for the precise and efficient therapeutic use of nanogel formulations.







Abstract
Nanogels have been identified as outstanding nanocarrier candidates for drug delivery due to their desirable physiochemical properties and versatile applicability for diverse therapeutic molecules and imaging probes. One of the main challenges that hinder the clinical translation of nanogels is the low efficiency of drug delivery to the target sites because of the complex biological barriers during the in&#8197;vivo journey. The purpose of this review is to examine and summarize the recent advances on the rational design and structural modulation of nanogels to overcome the barriers and challenges on the way to the site of action following various dosing modes. In particular, the functional moieties or domains have been incorporated in the nanogels, allowing them to spontaneously regulate their structure and physiochemical properties to cross one or more of the multifaceted barriers. In addition, the future perspectives are presented with regards to opportunities and challenges for the precise and efficient therapeutic use of nanogel formulations.

         <title>Biological Nanopore Approach for Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Sequencing</title>

Nanopore electrochemistry offers a bright prospect for single&#8208;molecule protein sequencing by measuring specific interactions between amino acids based on their natural structure and chemistry continuity and diversity. This Minireview focusses on recent advances in biological nanopores from protein unfolding, peptide translocation, amino acid identification to diagnostic application.







Abstract
Proteins are responsible for the occurrence and treatment of many diseases, and therefore protein sequencing will revolutionize proteomics and clinical diagnostics. Biological nanopore approach has proved successful for single&#8208;molecule DNA sequencing, which resolves the identities of 4 natural deoxyribonucleotides based on the current blockages and duration times of their translocations across the nanopore confinement. However, open challenges still remain for biological nanopores to sequentially identify each amino acid (AA) of single proteins due to the inherent complexity of 20 proteinogenic AAs in charges, volumes, hydrophobicity and structures. Herein, we focus on recent exciting advances in biological nanopores for single&#8208;molecule protein sequencing (SMPS) from native protein unfolding, control of peptide translocation, AA identification to applications in disease detection.

Inspired by natural rhodopsin, an azobenzene&#8208;based molecular rotaxane was designed to insert into lipid membranes for the regulation of ion transport. Based on the shuttle transport mechanism, the significant difference in shuttling rate between trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;isomer caused by molecular isomerization facilitates light&#8208;gated ion transport.







Abstract
Inspired by the nontrivial and controlled movements of molecular machines, we report an azobenzene&#8208;based molecular shuttle PR2, which can perform light&#8208;gated ion transport across lipid membranes. The amphiphilicity and membrane&#8208;spanning molecular length enable PR2 to insert into the bilayer membrane and efficiently transport K+ (EC50=4.1&#8197;&#956;m) through the thermally driven stochastic shuttle motion of the crown ether ring along the axle. The significant difference in shuttling rate between trans&#8208;PR2 and cis&#8208;PR2 induced by molecular isomerization enables a light&#8208;gated ion transport, i.e., ON/OFF in situ regulation of transport activity and single&#8208;channel current. This work represents an example of using a photoswitchable molecular machine to realize gated ion transport, which demonstrates the value of molecular machines functioning in biomembranes.

         <title>Directed Evolution of an Improved Aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA Synthetase for Incorporation of L&#8208;3,4&#8208;Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA)</title>

Catechols are capable of diverse interactions with metals, radical chemistry, the ability to form redox&#8208;mediated crosslinks, and play an important role in many biological polymers. Genetic tools are presented that enable site&#8208;specific incorporation of the catechol amino acid 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA) into proteins in bacteria, and a new DOPA&#8208;specific fluorescent biosensor for monitoring incorporation in living cells.







Abstract
The catechol group of 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (L&#8208;DOPA) derived from L&#8208;tyrosine oxidation is a key post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) in many protein biomaterials and has potential as a bioorthogonal handle for precision protein conjugation applications such as antibody&#8211;drug conjugates. Despite this potential, indiscriminate enzymatic modification of exposed tyrosine residues or complete replacement of tyrosine using auxotrophic hosts remains the preferred method of introducing the catechol moiety into proteins, which precludes many protein engineering applications. We have developed new orthogonal translation machinery to site&#8208;specifically incorporate L&#8208;DOPA into recombinant proteins and a new fluorescent biosensor to selectively monitor L&#8208;DOPA incorporation in vivo. We show simultaneous biosynthesis and incorporation of L&#8208;DOPA and apply this translation machinery to engineer a novel metalloprotein containing a DOPA&#8208;Fe chromophore.

         <title>Electron Beam Irradiation&#8208;Induced Formation of Defect&#8208;Rich Zeolites under Ambient Condition within Minutes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14858-14863, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich Na&#8208;A zeolites were synthesized by electron beam irradiation under ambient condition within minutes. The as&#8208;synthesized Na&#8208;A shows enhanced adsorption performance for CO2 and heavy ions in comparison with samples synthesized hydrothermally.







Abstract
Zeolites are a well&#8208;known family of microporous aluminosilicate crystals with a wide range of applications. Their industrial synthetic method under hydrothermal condition requires elevated temperature and long crystallization time and is therefore quite energy&#8208;consuming. Herein, we utilize high&#8208;energy electron beam irradiation generated by an industrial accelerator as a distinct type of energy source to activate the formation reaction of Na&#8208;A zeolite. The initial efforts afford an attractive reaction process that can be achieved under ambient conditions and completed within minutes with almost quantitative yield, leading to notable energy saving of one order of magnitude compared to the hydrothermal reaction. More importantly, electron beam irradiation simultaneously exhibits an etching effect during the formation of zeolite generating a series of crystal defects and additional pore windows that can be controlled by irradiation dose. These observations give rise to significantly enhanced surface area and heavy metal removal capabilities in comparison with Na&#8208;A zeolite synthesized hydrothermally. Finally, we show that this method can be applied to many other types of zeolites.

         <title>In&#8197;Cellulo M&#246;ssbauer and EPR Studies Bring New Evidence to the Long&#8208;Standing Debate on Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster Binding in Human Anamorsin</title>

A combined in&#8197;cellulo M&#246;ssbauer&#8208; and EPR&#8208;based approach is applied to address controversial aspects of Fe&#8211;S cluster&#8208;binding properties of human anamorsin, a protein involved in the biogenesis of cytosolic [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster&#8208;binding proteins. We show that human anamorsin binds two [2Fe&#8211;2S] clusters in&#8208;cell in two highly conserved cysteine&#8208;rich motifs typical of the eukaryotic CIAPIN1 protein family, with different electron&#8208;spin&#8208;relaxation properties.







Abstract
Human anamorsin is an iron&#8211;sulfur&#8201;(Fe&#8211;S)&#8208;cluster&#8208;binding protein acting as an electron donor in the early steps of cytosolic iron&#8211;sulfur protein biogenesis. Human anamorsin belongs to the eukaryotic CIAPIN1 protein family and contains two highly conserved cysteine&#8208;rich motifs, each binding an Fe&#8211;S cluster. In&#8197;vitro works by various groups have provided rather controversial results for the type of Fe&#8211;S clusters bound to the CIAPIN1 proteins. In order to unravel the knot on this topic, we used an in&#8197;cellulo approach combining M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopies to characterize the iron&#8211;sulfur&#8208;cluster&#8208;bound form of human anamorsin. We found that the protein binds two [2Fe&#8211;2S] clusters at both its cysteine&#8208;rich motifs.

&lt;p&gt;A combined in&#8197;cellulo M&#246;ssbauer- and EPR-based approach is applied to address controversial aspects of Fe&#8211;S cluster-binding properties of human anamorsin, a protein involved in the biogenesis of cytosolic [4Fe&#8211;4S] cluster-binding proteins.

         <title>Changing the Reactivity of Zero&#8208; and Mono&#8208;Valent Germanium with a Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Bis(silylenyl)carborane Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14864-14868, June 25, 2021. </description>

The bis(silylenyl) ortho&#8208;dicarborane&#8208;supported zero&#8208;valent Ge complex (germylone) 1 undergoes facile dimerization with Ge&#8722;Ge bond formation upon one&#8208;electron oxidation and reduction to furnish the bis(silylene)&#8208;supported dicationic and dianionic [GeI&#8211;GeI] complexes 2 and 3, respectively. A neutral complex 4 bearing a Ge22+ dumbbell embedded in a shell of two radical&#8208;anionic di(silylenyl)dicarborane ligands could be synthesized.







Abstract
Using the chelating C,C&#8242;&#8208;bis(silylenyl)&#8208;ortho&#8208;dicarborane ligand, 1,2&#8208;(RSi)2&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10 [R=PhC(NtBu)2], leads to the monoatomic zero&#8208;valent Ge complex (&#8220;germylone&#8221;) 3. The redox non&#8208;innocent character of the carborane scaffold has a drastic influence on the reactivity of 3 towards reductants and oxidants. Reduction of 3 with one molar equivalent of potassium naphthalenide (KC10H8) causes facile oxidation of Ge0 to GeI along with a two&#8208;electron reduction of the C2B10 cluster core and subsequent GeI&#8208;GeI coupling to form the dianionic bis(silylene)&#8208;supported Ge2 complex 4. In contrast, oxidation of 3 with one molar equivalent of [Cp2Fe][B{C6H3(CF3)2}4] as a one&#8208;electron oxidant furnishes the dicationic bis(silylene)&#8208;supported Ge2 complex 5. The Ge0 atom in 3 acts as donor towards GeCl2 to form the trinuclear mixed&#8208;valent Ge0&#8594;GeII&#8592;Ge0 complex 6, from which dechlorination with KC10H8 affords the neutral Ge2 complex 7 as a diradical species.

A novel PdII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective oxycarbonylation of alkenes has been established. The ligand, which has an ethyl group at the C&#8208;6 position of Pyox, plays a significant role in the intermolecular oxypalladation process and results in high reactivity and excellent enantioselective control.







Abstract
A novel PdII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective oxycarbonylation of alkenes has been established. The ligand with an ethyl group at the C&#8208;6 position of Pyox plays a significant role in the intermolecular oxypalladation process, leading to high reactivity and excellent enantioselective control. Compared to the conventional methods, the reaction itself features alkenes as easily prepared starting materials, mild and operationally simple reaction conditions, and insensitivities to air and water. Moreover, this method allows for broad alkene substrate scope, excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities, scalabilities and a wide array of applications, and provides a useful route for the convenient and straightforward synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy alkylcarboxylic acids/esters.

         <title>UV Solar&#8208;Blind&#8208;Region Phase&#8208;Matchable Optical Nonlinearity and Anisotropy in a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Cation&#8208;Containing Phosphate</title>

The &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation&#8208;based phosphate [C(NH2)3]6(PO4)2&#8901;3&#8201;H2O exhibits rare coexistence of wide UV transparency, large second harmonic generation (SHG) response and sufficient birefringence for phase&#8208;matching at a short SHG wavelength.







Abstract
Wide ultraviolet (UV) transparency, strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, and sufficient optical birefringence for phase&#8208;matching (PM) at short SHG wavelengths are vital for practical UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, simultaneously optimizing these properties is a major challenge, particularly for metal phosphates. Herein, we report a non&#8208;traditional &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation&#8208;based UV NLO phosphate [C(NH2)3]6(PO4)2&#8901;3&#8201;H2O (GPO) with a short UV cutoff edge. GPO is SHG active at 1064&#8197;nm (3.8 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1064&#8197;nm) and 532&#8197;nm (0.3 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 @ 532&#8197;nm) and also possesses a significant birefringence (0.078 @ 546&#8197;nm) with a band gap &gt;6.0&#8197;eV. The PM SHG capability of GPO can extend to 250&#8197;nm, indicating GPO is a promising UV solar&#8208;blind NLO material. Calculations and crystal structure analysis show that the rare coexistence of wide UV transparency, large SHG response, and optical anisotropy is due to the introduction of &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations [C(NH2)3]+ and their favorable arrangement with [PO4]3&#8722; anions.

An efficient ODI&#8208;[5+2] cascade reaction of sensitive ethynylphenols was achieved under mild electrochemical conditions, which led to the rapid construction of a series of bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienone skeletons. By incorporation of a directed retro&#8208;aldol/aldol process, a [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement and an Al(O&#8208;iPr)3&#8208;promoted reductive 1,3&#8208;transposition, the asymmetric total syntheses of five 8,9&#8208;seco&#8208;ent&#8208;kauranoids have been accomplished.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Berkeleyone&#8197;A and Preaustinoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14869-14874, June 25, 2021. </description>

Based upon the recognition of latent symmetry within D&#8208;ring, we accomplished the first enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone&#8197;A and its five preaustinoid congeners. Meanwhile, we also uncovered a series of biomimetic rearrangements that would lend credence to the proposed biosynthetic sequence of DMOA&#8208;derived meroterpenoids.







Abstract
Herein we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of 3,5&#8208;dimethylorsellinic acid&#8208;derived meroterpenoids (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone A and its five congeners ((&#8722;)&#8208;preaustinoids&#8197;A, A1, B, B1, and B2) in 12&#8211;15 steps, starting from commercially available 2,4,6&#8208;trihydroxybenzoic acid hydrate. Based upon the recognition of latent symmetry within D&#8208;ring, our convergent synthesis features two critical reactions: 1)&#8197;a symmetry&#8208;breaking, diastereoselective dearomative alkylation to assemble the entire carbon core, and 2)&#8197;a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;mediated sequential Krapcho dealkoxycarbonylation/carbonyl &#945;&#8208;tert&#8208;alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework. We also conducted our preliminary biomimetic investigations and uncovered a series of rearrangements (&#945;&#8208;ketol, &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketone, etc.) responsible for the biomimetic diversification of (&#8722;)&#8208;berkeleyone&#8197;A into its five preaustinoid congeners.

         <title>Synthesis of Arylpalladium(II) Boronates: Confirming the Structure and Chemical Competence of Pre&#8208;transmetalation Intermediates in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14897-14901, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium(II) boronates are fundamental pre&#8208;transmetalation intermediates in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction that are typically transient and have never been isolated. Arylpalladium(II) boronates have now been synthesized that are kinetically stable in solution, which enabled their isolation and crystallographic characterization. These species were shown to be chemically competent in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings.







Abstract
Palladium(II) boronates are recognized as fundamental pre&#8208;transmetalation intermediates in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. While these typically transient species have been detected and studied spectroscopically, it is conspicuous that they have never been isolated since this important reaction was discovered over forty years ago. This study reports the synthesis of a family of unprecedented arylpalladium(II) boronates that are, by design, kinetically stable at ambient temperature, both in solution and in the solid state. These properties enabled unambiguous crystallographic confirmation of their structure for the first time and their chemical competence in a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction was demonstrated.

         <title>A Cooperatively Activatable, DNA&#8208;based Fluorescent Reporter for Imaging of Correlated Enzymatic Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14887-14891, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based fluorescent reporter operated orthogonally by the two enzymes, telomerase and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1, enables the imaging of their correlated activity both in vitro and in vivo. The system was further applied to specific tumor imaging through &#8220;dual lock&#8208;and&#8208;key&#8221; strategy and analysis of the dual enzymatic activities during drug treatment.







Abstract
The dynamic variation of the expression profile and spatial landscape of multiple enzymes are crucial factors influencing tumor progression and drug treatment. However, the comprehensive analysis of these events has been hampered by the limitations of existing imaging technologies. Here we report a cooperatively activatable, DNA&#8208;based fluorescent reporter programmed to detect the correlated activity of dual enzymes, telomerase (TE) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), both in vitro and in vivo. The conformational change of the DNA probe can be orthogonally triggered through TE&#8208;induced DNA elongation and APE1&#8208;mediated specific cleavage, producing a fluorescent signal for imaging the activity of the two enzymes in an AND&#8208;gated manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of the system for specific tumor imaging through &#8220;dual lock&#8208;and&#8208;key&#8221; strategy, and visualizing the correlated enzymatic activities during drug treatment of cancer.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis and Structural Revision of Dysiherbol&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14915-14920, June 25, 2021. </description>

In a key step of the first enantioselective total synthesis of the anti&#8208;inflammatory marine meroterpene dysiherbol&#8197;A, the tetra&#8208;carbocyclic core skeleton is set&#8208;up in a unique gold&#8208;catalyzed double cyclization, and the ether bridge of the pentacyclic target structure is spontaneously formed under cyclopropane opening upon deprotection of a late intermediate.







Abstract
A 12&#8208;step total synthesis of the natural product dysiherbol&#8197;A, a strongly anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;tumor avarane meroterpene isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea sp., was elaborated. As key steps, the synthesis features an enantioselective Cu&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;addition/enolate&#8208;trapping opening move, an Au&#8208;catalyzed double cyclization to build up the tetracyclic core&#8208;carbon skeleton, and a late installation of the C5&#8208;bridgehead methyl group via proton&#8208;induced cyclopropane opening associated with spontaneous cyclic ether formation. The obtained pentacyclic compound (corresponding to an anhydride of the originally suggested structure for dysiherbol&#8197;A) showed identical spectroscopic data as the natural product, but an opposite molecular rotation. CD&#8208;spectroscopic measurements finally confirmed that both the constitution and the absolute configuration of the originally proposed structure of (+)&#8208;dysiherbol&#8197;A need to be revised.

&lt;p&gt;In a key step of the first enantioselective total synthesis of the anti-inflammatory marine meroterpene dysiherbol&#8197;A, the tetra-carbocyclic core skeleton is set-up in a unique gold-catalyzed double cyclization, and the ether bridge of the pentacyclic target structure is spontaneously formed under cyclopropane opening upon deprotection of a late intermediate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 12-step total synthesis of the natural product dysiherbol&#8197;A, a strongly anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor avarane meroterpene isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea sp., was elaborated. As key steps, the synthesis features an enantioselective Cu-catalyzed 1,4-addition/enolate-trapping opening move, an Au-catalyzed double cyclization to build up the tetracyclic core-carbon skeleton, and a late installation of the C5-bridgehead methyl group via proton-induced cyclopropane opening associated with spontaneous cyclic ether formation. The obtained pentacyclic compound (corresponding to an anhydride of the originally suggested structure for dysiherbol&#8197;A) showed identical spectroscopic data as the natural product, but an opposite molecular rotation. CD-spectroscopic measurements finally confirmed that both the constitution and the absolute configuration of the originally proposed structure of (+)-dysiherbol&#8197;A need to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Optimizing Charge Transfer and Out&#8208;Coupling of A Quasi&#8208;Planar Deep&#8208;Red TADF Emitter: towards Rec.2020 Gamut and External Quantum Efficiency beyond 30&#8201;%</title>

         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;red TADF emitter pCNQ&#8211;TPA for UHD display was demonstrated, which realized the desired chromaticity matching rec.2020 standard and the record external quantum efficiency beyond 30&#8201;%. It is showed that its quasi&#8208;planar structure not only improves horizontal ratio of emitting dipole orientation for out&#8208;coupling enhancement, but also balances the intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer for radiation facilitation and quenching suppression.







Abstract
Herein, we report a deep&#8208;red TADF emitter pCNQ&#8211;TPA, composed of quinoxaline&#8208;5,8&#8208;dicarbonitrile (pCNQ) acceptor and triphenylamine (TPA) donor. pCNQ&#8211;TPA supported its OLED with desired CIE coordinates of (0.69, 0.31) and the record maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.3&#8201;%, which is the best red TADF diode with Rec.2020 gamut for UHDTV. It is showed that through tuning pCNQ&#8211;TPA doping concentration, intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer are balanced to synchronously improve emission color saturation and TADF radiation, and remedy aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, rendering photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) reaching 90&#8201;% for deep&#8208;red emission peaked at &#8776;690&#8197;nm. Quasi&#8208;planar structure further endows pCNQ&#8211;TPA with an improved horizontal ratio of emitting dipole orientation, which increases light out&#8208;coupling ratio to 0.34 for achieving the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device efficiencies.

         <title>Cyclic Diaryl &#955;3&#8208;Bromanes as Original Aryne Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14852-14857, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaryl &#955;3&#8208;bromanes are rare and unexplored hypervalent compounds. An efficient and mild protocol affords now a large panel of these hypervalent compounds, featuring reactivity complementary to that of the corresponding diaryl &#955;3&#8208;iodanes. Due to their high reactivity, metal&#8208;free meta&#8208;selective C&#8211;O and C&#8211;N coupling occurs through in situ aryne generation.







Abstract
Despite the widespread application of hypervalent iodines, the corresponding &#955;3&#8208;bromanes are less explored. Herein we report a general, safe, and high&#8208;yielding strategy to access cyclic diaryl &#955;3&#8208;bromanes. These unique compounds feature reactivity that is appealing and complementary to that of &#955;3&#8208;iodanes, generating arynes under mild reaction conditions and in the presence of a weak base. Accordingly, formal meta&#8208;selective transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8211;O and C&#8211;N couplings may be achieved. Mechanistic studies unambiguously support the aryne generation mechanism.

The first carbene&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective addition involving cumulenolates is disclosed. Both allene and spirooxindole products could be accessed with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities by varying the amount of the base.







Abstract
Azolium cumulenolates are a special type of intermediates in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. They contain elongated linear structures with three contiguous C=C bonds and sterically unhindered &#945;&#8208;carbon atoms. These structural features make it difficult to develop enantioselective reactions for these intermediates. Here we disclose the first carbene&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective addition reactions of azolium cumulenolates. The reaction starts with alkynals as the precursors for azolium cumulenolate intermediates that undergo enantioselective addition to activated ketones. From the same set of substrates, both allene and spirooxindole products can be obtained with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The allene moieties in our optically enriched products carry rich reactivities and can be transformed to diverse molecules. The spirooxindole scaffolds in our products are important structural motifs in natural products and medicines.

Macromolecular drug delivery vectors must translocate at the plasma membrane or escape from endosomes to reach the cytosol. This very inefficient process requires optimization, which is hindered by the difficulty to accurately measure cytosolic arrival. An exceptionally sensitive and robust assay to quantify this step was developed. The assay was validated by determining the absolute numbers of two macromolecular vectors reaching the cytosol.







Abstract
Macromolecular drugs inefficiently cross membranes to reach their cytosolic targets. They require drug delivery vectors to facilitate their translocation across the plasma membrane or escape from endosomes. Optimization of these vectors has however been hindered by the difficulty to accurately measure cytosolic arrival. We have developed an exceptionally sensitive and robust assay for the relative or absolute quantification of this step. The assay is based on benzylguanine and biotin modifications on a drug delivery vector of interest, which allow, respectively, for selective covalent capture in the cytosol with a SNAP&#8208;tag fusion protein and for quantification at picomolar sensitivity. The assay was validated by determining the absolute numbers of cytosolic molecules for two drug delivery vectors: the B&#8208;subunit of Shiga toxin and the cell&#8208;penetrating peptide TAT. We expect this assay to favor delivery vector optimization and the understanding of the enigmatic translocation process.

A series of [n]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylenes was synthesized. K&#8208;region functionalization of the pyrene moieties led to a confined space within those macrocycles. This confined space is especially pronounced for n=5 and resulted in a host&#8208;in&#8208;host binding with shape complementary alkaline crown ethers. A multifaceted approach combining computation, spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis elucidated the binding.







Abstract
A set of strained aromatic macrocycles based on [n]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;(4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrahydro)pyrenylenes is presented with size&#8208;dependent photophysical properties. The K&#8208;region of pyrene was functionalized with ethylene glycol groups to decorate the outer rim and thereby confine the space inside the macrocycle. This confined space is especially pronounced for n=5, which leads to an internal binding of up to 8.0&#215;104&#8197;m&#8722;1 between the ether&#8208;decorated [5]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;pyrenylene and shape&#8208;complementary crown ether&#8211;cation complexes. Both the ether&#8208;decorated [n]cyclo&#8208;pyrenylenes as well as one of their host&#8211;guest complexes have been structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. In combination with computational methods the structural and thermodynamic reasons for the exceptionally strong binding have been elucidated. The presented rim confinement strategy makes cycloparaphenylenes an attractive supramolecular host family with a favorable, size&#8208;independent read&#8208;out signature and binding capabilities extending beyond fullerene guests.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Mediated Construction of an Ultrathin Free&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Membrane for Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 27, Page 14875-14880, June 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with controlled thickness was obtained by using a surface&#8208;initiated polymerization strategy (see picture). The rigid organic skeleton and defined pore structure of the COF membrane as well as the abundance of sulfonic acid groups throughout the layer led to superior proton conductivity of 0.54&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in pure water.







Abstract
As a new class of crystalline porous organic materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted considerable attention for proton conduction owing to their regular channels and tailored functionality. However, most COFs are insoluble and unprocessable, which makes membrane preparation for practical use a challenge. In this study, we used surface&#8208;initiated condensation polymerization of a trialdehyde and a phenylenediamine for the synthesis of sulfonic COF (SCOF) coatings. The COF layer thickness could be finely tuned from 10 to 100&#8197;nm by controlling the polymerization time. Moreover, free&#8208;standing COF membranes were obtained by sacrificing the bridging layer without any decomposition of the COF structure. Benefiting from the abundant sulfonic acid groups in the COF channels, the proton conductivity of the SCOF membrane reached 0.54&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in pure water. To our knowledge, this is one of the highest values for a pristine COF membrane in the absence of additional additives.

The construction of novel halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs) based on iodonium&#8208;bridged N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions is reported.







Abstract
Due to the fascinating structures and wide applications, porous materials with open frameworks have attracted more and more attentions. Herein, a novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (XOF&#8211;TPPE) was successfully designed and fabricated by iodonium&#8208;bridged N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions between pyridyl groups and I+ for the first time. The formation of XOF&#8211;TPPE and its linear analogue was monitored by 1H&#8197;NMR, UV&#8211;Vis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), IR, SEM, TEM, HRTEM and selected&#8208;area electron diffraction (SAED). The structural model of XOF&#8211;TPPE was established based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) data and theoretical simulations. Significantly, synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), DLS and UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy experiments suggested that XOF&#8211;TPPE still maintains a stable 2D framework structure in solutions. This research opens up a novel avenue for the development of organic frameworks materials, and may bring new promising applications for the field of porous materials.

Molecular weight engineering of red&#8208;emissive mesopolymer with no detectable homo&#8208;coupling defects, fine&#8208;tuned energy level and better bipolar mobility was carried out. OFET and OLED based on the materials mark application potential in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Mesopolymers with high solubility, free of structural defects, and negligible batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation open a new avenue for organic optoelectronics. Organic light emitting transistors that combine the functions of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and organic field&#8208;effect transistors. However, charge transport ability and light emitting strength are contradictory within one conjugated polymer. Herein, three low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight mesopolymers with thienopyrroledione&#8211;benzothiadiazole repeating units (meso&#8208;TBTF) were obtained. The mesopolymers show strong solid&#8208;state emission and high ambipolar carrier mobility. The molecular weights of meso&#8208;TBTF can be tuned by polymerization temperature. The mesopolymers have photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of about 50&#8201;% in solution and 10&#8201;% in solid state. Polymer light emitting diodes of this material are fabricated to explore its potential use in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Chasing the Mond Cation: Synthesis and Characterization of the Homoleptic Nickel Tetracarbonyl Cation and its Tricarbonyl&#8208;Nitrosyl Analogue</title>

The synthesis of the first homoleptic nickel carbonyl cation [Ni(CO)4].+ and the nickel tricarbonyl&#8208;nitrosyl cation [Ni(CO)3(NO)]+ in the condensed phase is reported. They were obtained by oxidation of nickel metal in CO atmosphere and stabilized with a suitable weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
130&#8197;years after Mond discovered the first homoleptic carbonyl complex Ni(CO)4, we report on a [Ni(CO)4].+ salt as the first synthesis of any homoleptic nickel carbonyl cation in the condensed phase. It was prepared by oxidation of nickel metal with the synergistic oxidant Ag[F{Al(ORF)3}2]/0.5&#8201;I2 (RF=C(CF3)3) in CO atmosphere. This D2d&#8208;symmetric metalloradical represents the last missing entry among the structurally characterized homoleptic carbonyl cations of Groups&#8197;6 to 11. Additionally, the nickel tricarbonyl&#8208;nitrosyl cation [Ni(CO)3(NO)]+ was obtained by usage of NO[F{Al(ORF)3}2] and all products were fully characterized by means of IR, Raman, NMR/EPR, single crystal and powder XRD.

&lt;p&gt;130&#8197;years after Mond discovered the first homoleptic carbonyl complex Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, we report on a [Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;.+&lt;/sup&gt; salt as the first synthesis of any homoleptic nickel carbonyl cation in the condensed phase. It was prepared by oxidation of nickel metal with the synergistic oxidant Ag[F{Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]/0.5&#8201;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (R&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;=C(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in CO atmosphere. This D&lt;sub&gt;2d&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric metalloradical represents the last missing entry among the structurally characterized homoleptic carbonyl cations of Groups&#8197;6 to 11. Additionally, the nickel tricarbonyl-nitrosyl cation [Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NO)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was obtained by usage of NO[F{Al(OR&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and all products were fully characterized by means of IR, Raman, NMR/EPR, single crystal and powder XRD.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Highly Efficient Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Element&#8208;Free Red/Green/Blue Solid&#8208;State Bandgap Fluorescent Carbon Quantum Rings for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
We report the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of red/green/blue solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescent carbon quantum rings (R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQRs) with high quantum yields up to 30&#8211;46&#8201;% for high&#8208;performance warm&#8208;white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
The negative impact of rare&#8208;earth elements (REEs) on the environment, limited supply and high cost prompt the need for REE&#8208;free phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we report the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of red/green/blue solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescent carbon quantum rings (R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQRs) with high quantum yields up to 30&#8211;46&#8201;%. This was achieved using cyano&#8208;group&#8208;bearing p&#8208;phenyldiacetonitrile as precursor and forming carbon quantum rings of different diameters through the linkage of curved carbon quantum ribbons of different lengths. The results show the role of cyano groups in inducing the curvature of the carbon quantum ribbons for CQR formation and emission of stable solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescence. R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQRs&#8208;phosphor&#8208;based LEDs emitted warm white light with low CCT (3576&#8197;K), high CRI (96.6), and high luminous efficiency (48.7&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1), comparable to REE&#8208;phosphor&#8208;based LEDs.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Cage for Wide&#8208;Scope Chiral Recognition in Water</title>

A self&#8208;assembled homochiral anionic cage with dual binding modes acts as an efficient chiroptical sensor with a broad substrate scope in water.







Abstract
Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly of an anionic homochiral octahedral cage by condensing six Ga3+ cations and four trisacylhydrazone ligands. The robust nature of the hydrazone bond renders the cage stable in water, where it can take advantage of the hydrophobic effect for host&#8211;guest recognition. In addition to the internal binding site, namely, the inner cavity, the octahedral cage possesses four &#8220;windows&#8221;, each of which represents an external binding site allowing peripheral complexation. These internal and external binding sites endow the cage with the capability to bind a broad range of guests whose sizes could either be smaller than or exceed the volume of the cage&#8242;s inner cavity. Upon accommodation of a chiral guest, one of the two cage enantiomers becomes more favored than the other, producing circular&#8208;dichroism (CD) signals. The CD signal intensity of the cage is observed to be proportional to the ee value of the chiral guest, allowing a quantitative determination of the latter.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Engineered Long&#8208;Range Electrostatic Interactions for DNA Hybridization Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA frameworks contained various guest particles with different surface charges were employed to exert diverse long&#8208;range electrostatic effects on site&#8208;specifically tethered single stranded DNA. Long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions are the key factor for determining the hybridization rate of the tethered DNA to its complementary sequence.







Abstract
Long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions beyond biomolecular interaction interfaces have not been extensively studied due to the limitation in engineering electric double layers in physiological fluids. Here we find that long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions play an essential role in kinetic modulation of DNA hybridizations. Protein and gold nanoparticles with different charges are encapsulated in tetrahedral frameworks to exert diverse electrostatic effects on site&#8208;specifically tethered single DNA strands. Using this strategy, we have successfully modulated the hybridization kinetics in both bulk solution and single molecule level. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions are the key factor for hybridization rates. This work validates the important role of long&#8208;range electrostatic forces in nucleic acid&#8208;biomacromolecule complexes, which may encourage new strategies of gene regulation, antisense therapy, and nucleic acid detection.

         <title>Synthesis of a Boron&#8211;Imidazolate Framework Nanosheet with Dimer Copper Units for CO2 Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically well&#8208;defined catalysts with atomically dispersed dimer&#8208;copper sites are elaborated to modulate the reaction path of CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). The BIF&#8208;102NSs catalyst with Cl&#8722; bridged dimer copper (Cu2) units shows higher catalytic activity and selectivity for C2H4, because the neighboring Cu monomers perform as regulator for varying the reaction barrier and afford distinct reaction paths compared with isolated monomers.







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of the dependence between the structure and composition on the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) would guide the rational design of highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts. A major impediment to the deep reduction CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products is the complexity of carbon&#8211;carbon bond coupling. The chemically well&#8208;defined catalysts with atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal sites are required for these C&#8722;C coupling involved processes. Here, we developed a catalyst (BIF&#8208;102NSs) that features Cl&#8722; bridged dimer copper (Cu2) units, which delivers high catalytic activity and selectivity for C2H4. Mechanistic investigation verifies that neighboring Cu monomers not only perform as regulator for varying the reaction barrier, but also afford distinct reaction paths compared with isolated monomers, resulting in greatly improved electroreduction performance for CO2.

The chemically well-defined catalysts with atomically dispersed dual-metal sites are required for these C&#8722;C coupling involved processes. Here, we developed a catalyst (BIF-102NSs) that features Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; bridged dimer copper (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) units, which delivers high catalytic activity and selectivity for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Mechanistic investigation verifies that neighboring Cu monomers not only perform as regulator for varying the reaction barrier, but also afford distinct reaction paths compared with isolated monomers, resulting in greatly improved electroreduction performance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Pair of Cobalt(III/IV) Terminal Imido Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward access to a cobalt(IV) terminal imido complex was provided by one&#8208;electron oxidation of a cobalt(III) terminal imido precursor. The cobalt(IV) monoimido complex could be isolated at low temperatures in analytically pure form. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry and EPR spectroscopy corroborate the molecular structure and the d5 low&#8208;spin, S=
, electron configuration.







Abstract
The reaction of the cobalt(I) complex [(TIMMNmes)CoI](BPh4) (2) (TIMMNmes=tris&#8208;[2&#8208;(3&#8208;mesitylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)methyl]amine) with 1&#8208;adamantylazide yields the cobalt(III) imido complex [(TIMMNmes)CoIII(NAd)](BPh4) (3) with concomitant release of dinitrogen. The N&#8208;anchor in diamagnetic 3 features an unusual, planar tertiary amine, which results from repulsive electrostatic interaction with the filled d(z2)&#8208;orbital of the cobalt ion and negative hyperconjugation with the neighboring methylene groups. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 3 with [FeCp2](OTf) provides access to the rare, high&#8208;valent cobalt(IV) imido complex [(TIMMNmes)CoIV(NAd)](OTf)2 (4). Despite a half&#8208;life of less than 1&#8197;h at room temperature, 4 could be isolated at low temperatures in analytically pure form. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry and EPR spectroscopy corroborate the molecular structure and the d5 low&#8208;spin, S=
, electron configuration. A computational analysis of 4 suggests high covalency within the CoIV=NAd bond with non&#8208;negligible spin density located at the imido moiety, which translates into substantial triplet nitrene character.

         <title>Dynamics of Meso&#8211;Chiral Interconversion in a Butterfly&#8208;Shape Overcrowded Alkene Rotor Tunable by Solvent Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A butterfly&#8208;shape overcrowded alkene rotor was synthesized, and its meso&#8211;chiral diastereomeric interconversion processes were elucidated in different solvents. The interconversion has nontrivial bimodal dynamics involving two mechanisms, rim flip and double bond flip. The rotor shows a preference for meso cis&#8208;conformation in aromatic solvents and chiral trans&#8208;conformation in non&#8208;aromatic solvents.







Abstract
Elucidation of dynamics of molecular rotational motion is an essential part and challenging area of research. We demonstrate reversible diastereomeric interconversion of a molecular rotor composed of overcrowded butterfly&#8208;shape alkene (FDF). Its inherent dual rotatory motion (two rotors, one stator) with interconversion between two diastereomers, chiral trans&#8208;FDF and meso cis&#8208;FDF forms, has been examined in detail upon varying temperatures and solvents. The free energy profile of 180&#176; revolution of one rotor part has a bimodal shape with unevenly positioned maxima (transition states). FDF in aromatic solvents adopts preferentially meso cis&#8208;conformation, while in non&#8208;aromatic solvents a chiral trans&#8208;conformation is more abundant owing to the solvent interactions with peripheral hexyl chains (solvophobic effect). Moderate correlations between the trans&#8208;FDF/cis&#8208;FDF ratio and solvent parameters, such as refractive index, polarizability, and viscosity were found.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear&#8208;Optical van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals Beryllium Borates**
</title>

         <dc:description>
We propose a design strategy to achieve van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear&#8208;optical (NLO) materials. Berborite Be2BO5H3 with trigonal (BO3)&#8208;(BeO4H) layers and beryllium metaborate BeB2O4 with tetragonal (BO4)&#8208;(BeO4) layers are predicted as two promising vdW DUV NLO crystal candidates, exhibiting a good DUV NLO performance balance with ultrawide optical band gaps, strong NLO effects, and sufficiently large birefringence.







Abstract
Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear&#8208;optical (NLO) materials hold great potential to extend DUV NLO applications to two dimensions, but they are rare in nature. In this study, we propose a design principle to realize vdW DUV NLO materials via structural evolution from the non&#8208;vdW (BO3)&#8208;(BeO3F) layers in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) to the vdW (BO3)&#8208;(BeO4H) layers in berborite Be2BO5H3 (BBH) and the vdW (BO4)&#8208;(BeO4) layers in beryllium metaborate BeB2O4 (BEBO). Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, the fundamental NLO properties of BBH and BEBO demonstrate that a balanced DUV NLO performance can be achieved in these two systems. Importantly, BBH, a layered material existing in nature, can achieve an available DUV phase&#8208;matched output with strong second harmonic generation (SHG) for 177.3/193.7&#8197;nm DUV lasers, which is almost identical to that of KBBF. Remarkably, BEBO shows an excellent DUV SHG capacity and an even shorter phase&#8208;matching wavelength than KBBF. Therefore, the newly discovered vdW BBH and BEBO, once verified by experiments, could provide an ideal platform to study DUV NLO effects in three dimensions and two dimensions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Homolysis of Earth&#8208;Abundant Metal&#8208;Substrate Complexes: A Complementary Activation Strategy in Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of earth&#8208;abundant metal complexes in photoredox catalysis offers a complementary mode of activation for organic substrates through visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced homolysis (VLIH) of metal&#8211;substrate bonds. This Minireview describes different electronic transitions that occur in photoexcited metal&#8211;substrate complexes as well as recent advancements and future prospects in this area.







Abstract
The mainstream applications of visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis predominately involve outer&#8208;sphere single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) or energy transfer (EnT) processes of precious metal RuII or IrIII complexes or of organic dyes with low photostability. Earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based MnLn&#8208;type (M=metal, Ln=polydentate ligands) complexes are rapidly evolving as alternative photocatalysts as they offer not only economic and ecological advantages but also access to the complementary inner&#8208;sphere mechanistic modes, thereby transcending their inherent limitations of ultrashort excited&#8208;state lifetimes for use as effective photocatalysts. The generic process, termed visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced homolysis (VLIH), entails the formation of suitable light&#8208;absorbing ligated metal&#8211;substrate complexes (MnLn&#8208;Z; Z=substrate) that can undergo homolytic cleavage to generate Mn&#8722;1Ln and Z. for further transformations.

         <title>Surface oxygen Vacancies on Reduced Co3O4(100): Superoxide Formation and Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activated molecular oxygen (superoxide, O2&#8722;) can oxidize CO already at 120&#8197;K on B&#8208;layer terminated Co3O4(100) with oxygen vacancies. This rendered scheme illustrates how a vibrational spectrum of the adsorbed superoxide is recorded with surface action spectroscopy.







Abstract
The activation of molecular oxygen is a fundamental step in almost all catalytic oxidation reactions. We have studied this topic and the role of surface vacancies for Co3O4(100) films with a synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical methods. We show that the as&#8208;prepared surface is B&#8208;layer terminated and that mild reduction produces oxygen single and double vacancies in this layer. Oxygen adsorption experiments clearly reveal different superoxide species below room temperature. The superoxide desorbs below ca. 120&#8197;K from a vacancy&#8208;free surface and is not active for CO oxidation while superoxide on a surface with oxygen vacancies is stable up to ca. 270&#8197;K and can oxidize CO already at the low temperature of 120&#8197;K. The vacancies are not refilled by oxygen from the superoxide, which makes them suitable for long&#8208;term operation. Our joint experimental/theoretical effort highlights the relevance of surface vacancies in catalytic oxidation reactions.

         <title>Uncovering the Role of Bicarbonate in Calcium Carbonate Formation at Near&#8208;Neutral pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An important role of bicarbonate at near&#8208;neutral pH during CaCO3 formation was found. Its structural incorporation in amorphous intermediates, revealed by a combination of potentiometric titrations, NMR, computer simulations, and other techniques, can be quantitatively explained by a model based on the binding of bicarbonate ions to pre&#8208;nucleation clusters. The findings seem to be crucial for a better understanding of, e.g., CaCO3 biomineralization.







Abstract
Mechanistic pathways relevant to mineralization are not well&#8208;understood fundamentally, let alone in the context of their biological and geological environments. Through quantitative analysis of ion association at near&#8208;neutral pH, we identify the involvement of HCO3&#8722; ions in CaCO3 nucleation. Incorporation of HCO3&#8722; ions into the structure of amorphous intermediates is corroborated by solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, complemented by quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. We identify the roles of HCO3&#8722; ions as being through (i)&#8197;competition for ion association during the formation of ion pairs and ion clusters prior to nucleation and (ii)&#8197;incorporation as a significant structural component of amorphous mineral particles. The roles of HCO3&#8722; ions as active soluble species and structural constituents in CaCO3 formation are of fundamental importance and provide a basis for a better understanding of physiological and geological mineralization.

         <title>Ultralong&#8208;Range Polariton&#8208;Assisted Energy Transfer in Organic Microcavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralong&#8208;range polariton&#8208;assisted energy transfer was achieved in a microcavity containing two J&#8208;aggregate cyanine dyes. The two dyes were separated by a distance of up to 2 &#956;m using a polymeric spacer layer. Here, it was confirmed that hybrid middle polariton (MP) states, composed of a mixture between the cavity photon modes and the different exciton states, act as a route for efficient ultralong&#8208;range energy transfer to energetically lower&#8208;lying states.







Abstract
Non&#8208;radiative energy transfer between spatially&#8208;separated molecules in a microcavity can occur when an excitonic state on both molecules are strongly&#8208;coupled to the same optical mode, forming so&#8208;called &#8220;hybrid&#8221; polaritons. Such energy transfer has previously been explored when thin&#8208;films of different molecules are relatively closely spaced (&#8776;100&#8197;nm). In this manuscript, we explore strong&#8208;coupled microcavities in which thin&#8208;films of two J&#8208;aggregated molecular dyes were separated by a spacer layer having a thickness of up to 2&#8197;&#956;m. Here, strong light&#8208;matter coupling and hybridisation between the excitonic transition is identified using white&#8208;light reflectivity and photoluminescence emission. We use steady&#8208;state spectroscopy to demonstrate polariton&#8208;mediated energy transfer between such coupled states over &#8220;mesoscopic distances&#8221;, with this process being enhanced compared to non&#8208;cavity control structures.

         <title>Wiggling Mesopores Kinetically Amplified Adsorptive Separation of Propylene/Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive separation is an appealing technology for propylene and propane separation; however, the challenge lies in the design of efficient adsorbents which can distinguish the two molecules having very similar properties. Here we report a kinetically amplified separation by creating wiggling mesopores in structurally robust carbon monoliths. The wiggling mesopores with alternating wide and narrow segments afford a surface area of 413 m  2  g  &#8208;1  and a tri&#8208;modal pore size distribution centered at 1.5, 4.2 and 6.6 nm, respectively. The synergistically kinetic and equilibrium effects were observed and quantitatively assessed, which together ensured a remarkable propylene/propane selectivity up to 39. This selectivity outperformed not only the available carbon adsorbents but also highly competitive among the dominated crystalline porous adsorbents. In addition, the wiggling mesoporous carbon monoliths showed an excellent axial and radial compressive strength of around 5.5 MPa and 221 N cm  &#8208;1  , respectively, which ensured its great potential in practical molecular separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to and reactivity of Fe(0), Fe(&#8208;I), Fe(I) and Fe(II) PCcarbeneP pincer complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite their promising metal&#8208;ligand cooperative reactivity, PC  carbene  P pincer ligands are rarely reported for first row transition metal centres. Using a dehydration methodology, we report access to an Fe(0) PC  carbene  P pincer complex (  1  ) that proceeds via an isolated &#945;&#8208;hydroxylalkyl hydrido complex (  3  ). Reversible carbonyl migration to the carbene position in  1  is found to allow coordination chemistry and E&#8211;H bond addition (E = H, B, Cl) across the iron&#8208;carbene linkage, representing a unique mechanism for metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity. The PC  carbene  P pincer ligand is also found to stabilize formal Fe(II), Fe(I) and Fe(&#8208;I) oxidation states, as demonstrated with synthesis and characterization of the complexes [  11&#8208;X  ][BAr  F  20  ] (X = Br, I),  12  and K[  13  ]. Compound K[  13  ] is found to be highly reactive, and abstracts hydrogen from a range of aliphatic C&#8211;H sources. Computational analysis by DFT suggests that the formal Fe(I) and Fe(&#8208;I) complexes contain significant carbene radical character. The ability of the PC  carbene  P ligand scaffold to partake in metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity and to support a range of iron oxidation states renders it as potentially useful in many catalytic applications.</dc:description>

Mechanistic studies support a pathway distinct from previous hydroaminations: a Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT). This hydroamination tolerates a range of functional groups and advances the hydrofunctionalization of dienes.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;invasive Sweat&#8208;based Tracking of L&#8208;Dopa Pharmacokinetic Profiles Following an Oral Tablet Administration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Levodopa (L&#8208;Dopa) is the &#8216;gold&#8208;standard&#8217; medication for symptomatic therapy of Parkinson disease (PD). However, L&#8208;Dopa long&#8208;term use is associated with the development of motor and non&#8208;motor complications, primarily due to its fluctuating plasma levels in combination with the disease progression. Herein, we present the first example of individualized therapeutic drug monitoring for subjects upon intake of standard L&#8208;Dopa oral pill, centered on dynamic tracking of the drug concentration in naturally secreted fingertip sweat. The touch&#8208;based non&#8208;invasive detection method relies on instantaneous collection of fingertip sweat on a highly permeable hydrogel that transports the sweat to a biocatalytic tyrosinase &#8208;modified electrode, where sweat L&#8208;Dopa is measured by reduction of the dopaquinone enzymatic product. Personalized dose&#8208;response relationship is demonstrated within a group of human subjects, along with close pharmacokinetic correlation between the finger touch&#8208;based fingertip sweat and capillary blood samples. The new detection method obviates the need for frequent blood sampling and holds considerable promise for creating optimized, personalized therapeutic regimens for individuals with PD.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic selection in the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium autocatalytic reaction networks that produce macrocyclic peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autocatalytic reaction networks are instrumental for validating scenarios for the emergence of life on Earth and for synthesizing life  de novo  . It is well understood how the selection of specific molecules occurs in reaction networks driven by template&#8208;assisted ligation; however how selection could occur in strongly interconnected, nonselective, autocatalytic networks is less clear. Here, we demonstrate that dimeric thioesters of tripeptides with the general structure (Cys&#8208;Xxx&#8208;Gly&#8208;SR)  2  form strongly interconnected autocatalytic reaction networks that predominantly generate macrocyclic peptides up to 69 amino acids long. Some macrocycles of 6&#8208;12 amino acids were isolated from the product pool and were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. We studied the autocatalytic formation of macrocycles in a flow reactor in the presence of acrylamide, whose conjugate addition to thiols served as a model &#8220;removal&#8221; reaction. These results indicate that autocatalytic production and competing removal of molecular species in an open compartment could be a feasible route for selecting functional molecules during the pre&#8208;Darwinian stages of molecular evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Unambiguous tracking of protein phosphorylation by fast high&#8208;resolution FOSY NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dysregulation of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) like phosphorylation is often involved in disease. NMR may elucidate exact loci and time courses of PTMs at atomic resolution and near&#8208;physiological condition, but requires signal assignment to individual atoms. Conventional NMR methods for this base on tedious global signal assignment that may often fail, as for large intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). We present a sensitive, robust alternative to rapidly obtain only the local assign&#173;ment near affected signals, based on FOcused SpectroscopY (FOSY) experiments using selec&#173;tive polarisation transfer (SPT). We prove its efficiency by identifying two phosphorylation sites of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3&#946;) in human Tau40, an IDP of 441 residues, where the extreme spectral dispersion in FOSY revealed unprimed phosphorylation also of Ser409. FOSY may broadly benefit NMR studies of PTMs and other hotspots in IDPs, including sites involved in molecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Editing Light Emission with Stable Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks via Wall Surface Perturbation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ordered &#960; skeletons of covalent organic frameworks make them viable light&#8208;emitting materials but their limited tunability has precluded further implementation. Here we report the synthesis of hydrazone&#8208;linked frameworks which are stable in water, acid, and base, and demonstrate their utility as a platform for light emission. The polygonal backbone is designed to be luminescent and partially &#960; conjugated while the pore wall is docked with single atom or unit to induce resonance, hyperconjugation, and tautomerization effects. These effects can be transmitted to the backbone, so that the framework is capable of emitting three primary colors of light. The backbone can be perturbated with multiple surface sites, rendering the material able to edit diverse emission colors in a predesignable and digital way. The systems show high activity, stability, tunability, and sensibility &#8211; a set of features attractive for light&#8208;emitting and sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Over the past two decades, there has been a substantial increase in the number of synthetically useful transformations catalyzed by silver. Across the range of silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions that have been reported, dinuclear species often emerge as a common feature, either as the (pre&#8208;)catalysts themselves or as intermediates during catalysis. This Minireview explores the role of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis, which we hope will aid in the development of improved design principles for silver catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bridged nitrogen bicyclic skeletons have been accessed via unprecedented site&#8208; and diastereoselective orthogonal tandem catalysis from readily accessible reactants in a step economic manner. Directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8208;H olefination of aminocyclohexane with gem&#8208;dibromoalkenes, followed by a consecutive intramolecular Cu&#8208;catalyzed amidation of the 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;alkenylated product delivers the interesting&#160;normorphan skeleton. The tandem protocol can be applied on substituted aminocyclohexanes and aminoheterocycles, easily providing access to the corresponding substituted, aza&#8208; and oxa&#8208;analogues. The Cu catalyst of the Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg reaction additionally avoids off&#8208;cycle Pd catalyst scavenging by alkenylated reaction product. The picolinamide directing group stabilizes the enamine of the 7&#8208;alkylidenenormorphan, allowing further product post functionalizations. Without Cu catalyst, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8208;H olefination is&#160;achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Pseudocapacitive Na+ Intercalation Induced by Cobalt Vacancies at Atomically Thin Co1&#8208;xSe2/Graphene Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic structure engineering on electrode materials could bring in a new mechanism to achieve high energy and high power densities in sodium ion batteries. Herein, we design and create Co vacancies at the interface of atomically thin CoSe  2  /graphene heterostructure and obtain Co  1&#8208;x  Se  2  /graphene heterostructure electrode materials that facilitate significant Na  +  intercalation pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that the Na  +  adsorption energy is dramatically increased, and the Na  +  diffusion barrier is remarkably reduced due to the introduction of Co vacancy. The optimized electrode delivers a superior capacity of 673.6 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 C, excellent rate capability of 576.5 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 2.0 C and ultra&#8208;long life up to 2000 cycles. Kinetics analysis indicates that the enhanced Na  +  storage is mainly attributed to the intercalation pseudocapacitance induced by Co vacancies.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electronic structure engineering on electrode materials could bring in a new mechanism to achieve high energy and high power densities in sodium ion batteries. Herein, we design and create Co vacancies at the interface of atomically thin CoSe  2  /graphene heterostructure and obtain Co  1-x  Se  2  /graphene heterostructure electrode materials that facilitate significant Na  +  intercalation pseudocapacitance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that the Na  +  adsorption energy is dramatically increased, and the Na  +  diffusion barrier is remarkably reduced due to the introduction of Co vacancy. The optimized electrode delivers a superior capacity of 673.6 mAh g  -1  at 0.1 C, excellent rate capability of 576.5 mAh g  -1  at 2.0 C and ultra-long life up to 2000 cycles. Kinetics analysis indicates that the enhanced Na  +  storage is mainly attributed to the intercalation pseudocapacitance induced by Co vacancies. This work suggests that the creation of cation vacancy could bestow heterostructured electrode materials with pseudocapacitive Na  +  intercalation for high-capacity and high-rate energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azobispyrazole Family as Photoswitches Combining (Near&#8208;) Quantitative Bidirectional Isomerization and Widely Tunable Thermal Half&#8208;Lives from Hours to Years**

Azobispyrazoles are a family of bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo photoswitches that combine excellent E &#8646; Z photoisomerization yields and widely tunable Z&#8208;isomer thermal half&#8208;lives from hours to years, showing the great potential of Het&#8208;N=N&#8208;Het architecture in developing high&#8208;performance molecular photoswitches.







Abstract
Azobenzenes are classical molecular photoswitches that have been widely used. In recent endeavors of molecular design, replacing one or both phenyl rings with heteroaromatic rings has emerged as a strategy to expand molecular diversity and access improved photoswitching properties. Many mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo molecules with unique structures and/or properties have been developed, but the potential of bis&#8208;heteroaryl architectures is far from fully exploited. We report a family of azobispyrazoles, which combine (near&#8208;)quantitative bidirectional photoconversion and widely tunable Z&#8208;isomer thermal half&#8208;lives from hours to years. The two five&#8208;membered rings remarkably weaken the intramolecular steric hindrance, providing new possibilities for engineering the geometric and electronic structure of azo photoswitches. Azobispyrazoles generally exhibit twisted Z&#8208;isomers that facilitate complete Z&#8594;E photoisomerization, and their thermal stability can be broadly adjusted regardless of the twisted shape, overcoming the conflict between photoconversion (favored by the twisted shape) and Z&#8208;isomer stability (favored by the orthogonal shape) encountered by mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches.

         <title>The Synthesis of Hexaazatrinaphthylene&#8208;Based 2D Conjugated Copper Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Selective and Stable Electroreduction of CO2 to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline hexaazatrinaphthylene&#8208;based 2D conjugated copper metal&#8208;organic framework was synthesized. With the synergic effect of hexaazatrinaphthylene and copper node, the resultant HATNA&#8208;Cu&#8208;MOF displays high selectivity and stability toward the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to methane.







Abstract
2D conjugated MOFs have attracted significant interests in recent years owing to their special structural features and promising physical and chemical properties. These intriguing attributes, to a large extent, stem from the nature of incorporated ligands. The available ligands for the construction of 2D conjugated MOFs are still limited, especially those that have heteroatoms included and exposed to the pores. In this work, we designed and synthesized a highly symmetric hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA)&#8208;based ligand with two different coordination sites. Through selective coordination, a highly crystalline and porous 2D conjugated copper metal&#8208;organic framework was constructed. Due to the synergic effects of HATNA and copper catecholate node, this HATNA&#8208;based 2D conjugated MOF can mediate the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane with high selectivity of 78&#8201;% at high current density of 8.2&#8197;milliamperes per square centimetre (mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for long durability over 12&#8197;hours.

         <title>Chemical Identification of Catalytically Active Sites on Oxygen&#8208;doped Carbon Nanosheet to Decipher the High Activity for Electro&#8208;synthesis Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (OCNS900) has been demonstrated as highly effective catalyst for electrosynthesizing hydrogen peroxide with mass activity of 14.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.75&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and H2O2 production rate of 770&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in a flow cell. Chemical titration and DFT calculations were used to decipher the high activity for hydrogen peroxide production; the C=O groups are identified as the most active sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through two&#8208;electron (2&#8201;e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an on&#8208;site and clean route. Oxygen&#8208;doped carbon materials with high ORR activity and H2O2 selectivity have been considered as the promising catalysts, however, there is still a lack of direct experimental evidence to identify true active sites at the complex carbon surface. Herein, we propose a chemical titration strategy to decipher the oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (OCNS900) catalyst for 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR. The OCNS900 exhibits outstanding 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR performances with onset potential of 0.825&#8197;V (vs. RHE), mass activity of 14.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.75&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and H2O2 production rate of 770&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in flow cell, surpassing most reported carbon catalysts. Through selective chemical titration of C=O, C&#8722;OH, and COOH groups, we found that C=O species contributed to the most electrocatalytic activity and were the most active sites for 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR, which were corroborated by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Endocircular Li Carbon Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endocircular Li carbon rings exhibit two types of electronic states of very different nature, the ordering of which changes with the ring size. This enables possible interesting applications by excitations from the electronic ground states to states of different nature depending on the ring size.







Abstract
By employing accurate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art many&#8208;electron quantum&#8208;chemistry methods, we establish that monocyclic carbon rings can accommodate Li guest atoms. The low&#8208;lying electronic states of these endocircular systems are analyzed and found to include both charge&#8208;separated states where the guest Li atom appears as a cation and the ring as an anion and encircled&#8208;electron states where Li and the ring are neutral. The electron binding energies of the encircled&#8208;electron states increase drastically at their highly symmetric equilibrium geometries with increasing size of the ring, and in Li@C24, this state becomes the ground state. Li is very weakly bound vertical to the rings in the low&#8208;lying encircled&#8208;electron states, hinting to van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals binding. Applcations are mentioned.

         <dc:description>
The first supramolecular radical ferroics show paramagnetism, non&#8208;interacting spin moments, excellent piezoelectric and electrostrictive behaviors, as well as high&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity.







Abstract
Organic radical ferroics such as TEMPO have attracted widespread interest. However, the relatively low Curie temperature of 287&#8197;K and melting point of 311&#8197;K severely hinder its application potential. Despite extensive interest, high&#8208;temperature radical ferroics have not yet been found. Here, taking advantage of chemical design and supramolecular radical chemistry, we designed two high&#8208;temperature organic supramolecular radical ferroics [(NH3&#8208;TEMPO)([18]crown&#8208;6)](ReO4) (1) and [(NH3&#8208;TEMPO)([18]crown&#8208;6)](ClO4) (2), which can retain ferroelectricity up to 413&#8197;K and 450&#8197;K, respectively. To our knowledge, they are both the first supramolecular radical ferroics and unprecedented high&#8208;temperature radical ferroics, where the supramolecular component is vital for the stabilization of the radical and extending the working temperature window. Both also have paramagnetism, non&#8208;interacting spin moments, and excellent piezoelectric and electrostrictive behaviors comparable to that of LiNbO3.

         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Stacked dendrimers consisting of cofacially aligned donors and acceptors are developed by introducing three dendritic teracridan donors with orthogonal configuration and three triazine acceptors in periphery of hexaphenylbenzene skeleton, exhibiting through&#8208;space charge transfer emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence effect for white electroluminescence with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power efficiency of 58.9&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 by solution process.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Stacked dendrimers consisting of cofacially aligned donors and acceptors are developed by introducing three dendritic teracridan donors with orthogonal configuration and three triazine acceptors in periphery of hexaphenylbenzene skeleton. The dendritic structure and orthogonal configuration of teracridan not only make their outer acridan segments approaching to acceptor in close distance, but also fix donor and acceptor in face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment, leading to through&#8208;space charge transfer emission with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) effect. By regulating charge transfer strength via substituent effect of acceptor, emission color of the dendrimers can be tuned from blue to yellow/red region. Solution&#8208;processed two&#8208;color white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on blue and yellow &#960;&#8208;stacked donor&#8211;acceptor dendrimers exhibit the maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.6&#8201;% and maximum power efficiency of 58.9&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency for all&#8208;TADF white OLEDs by solution process.

         <title>Photocatalytic Upgrading of Lignin Oil to Diesel Precursors and Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lignin to diesel precursors route was achieved via solar driven coupling reaction over Au/CdS photocatalyst. The diesel precursors can be further hydrogenated to C16&#8211;C18 cyclic hydrocarbons or aromatics over Pd/C or CoMoS&#8208;P, respectively.







Abstract
Producing renewable biofuels from biomass is a promising way to meet future energy demand. Here, we demonstrated a lignin to diesel route via dimerization of the lignin oil followed by hydrodeoxygenation. The lignin oil undergoes C&#8722;C bond dehydrogenative coupling over Au/CdS photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, co&#8208;generating diesel precursors and hydrogen. The Au nanoparticles loaded on CdS can effectively restrain the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus improving the efficiency of the dimerization reaction. About 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 dimers and 1.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 H2 were generated over Au/CdS, which is about 12 and 6.5 times over CdS, respectively. The diesel precursors are finally converted into C16&#8211;C18 cycloalkanes or aromatics via hydrodeoxygenation reaction using Pd/C or porous CoMoS catalyst, respectively. The conversion of pine sawdust to diesel was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the lignin&#8208;to&#8208;diesel route.

         <title>Hierarchical Superstructures by Combining Crystallization&#8208;Driven and Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical fir&#8208;tree&#8208;like superstructures are accessible by utilizing the unique corona structure of patchy worm&#8208;like micelles immobilized on electrospun polymer fibers and the molecular self&#8208;assembly of a 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxamide. The used combination of crystallization&#8208;driven and molecular self&#8208;assembly concepts can give access to a large variety of fibrillar superstructures with potential applications in filtration or catalysis.







Abstract
Combining the unique corona structure of worm&#8208;like patchy micelles immobilized on a polymer fiber with the molecular self&#8208;assembly of 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs) leads to hierarchical superstructures with a fir&#8208;tree&#8208;like morphology. For this purpose, worm&#8208;like patchy micelles bearing pendant, functional tertiary amino groups in one of the corona patches were prepared by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly and immobilized on a supporting polystyrene fiber by coaxial electrospinning. The obtained patchy fibers were then immersed in an aqueous solution of a tertiary amino&#8208;functionalized BTA to induce patch&#8208;mediated molecular self&#8208;assembly to well&#8208;defined fir&#8208;tree&#8208;like superstructures upon solvent evaporation. Interestingly, defined superstructures are obtained only if the pendant functional groups in the surface patches match with the peripheral substituents of the BTA, which is attributed to a local increase in BTA concentration at the polymer fibers&#8217; surface.

         <title>Heteroaromatic Hyperbranched Polyelectrolytes: Multicomponent Polyannulation and Photodynamic Biopatterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent polymerization for the efficient synthesis of heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes was developed. These hyperbranched polymers showed excellent solubility, high quantum yields, tunable emission, and strong ROS generation ability, allowing for their widespread applications in highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning, efficient bacterial killing, and customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms.







Abstract
We reported an efficient multicomponent polyannulation for in situ generation of heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes by using readily accessible internal diynes and low&#8208;cost, commercially available arylnitriles, NaSbF6, and H2O/AcOH. The polymers were obtained in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with extraordinary high molecular weights (Mw up to 1.011&#215;106) and low polydispersity indices. The resulting polymers showed good processibility and high quantum yields with tunable emission in the solid state, making them ideal materials for highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning. These hyperbranched polyelectrolytes also possessed strong ability to generate reactive oxygen species, which allowed their applications in efficient bacterial killing and customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms in a simple and cost&#8208;effective way.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel visible light&#8208;driven catalytic activation of C=O bonds by exploiting the photoredox chemistry of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaphospholes, readily accessible from &#120572;&#8208;diketones and trialkyl phosphites, is reported.

         <title>DNA&#8208;based Synthetic Growth Factor Surrogates with Fine&#8208;tuned Agonism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing synthetic surrogates of functional proteins is an important, albeit challenging, task in the field of chemistry. A strategy toward the design of synthetic agonists for growth factor or cytokine receptors that elicit a desired signal activity has been in high demand, as such ligands hold great promise as safer and more effective therapeutics. In the present study, we used a DNA aptamer as a building block and described the strategy&#8208;guided design of a synthetic receptor agonist with fine&#8208;tuned agonism. The developed synthetic partial agonist can regulate therapeutically relevant cellular activities by eliciting fine&#8208;tuned receptor signaling.</dc:description>

But it is not easy to realize the transformation due to the disruption of the reactive NH2 group of glycinates. Inspired by enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine, we successfully developed asymmetric aldol reaction of glycinate 5 and trifluoromethyl ketones 4 with 0.1&#8208;0.0033 mol% of chiral N&#8208;methyl pyridoxal 7a as the catalyst, producing chiral &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters 6 in 55&#8208;82% yields (for the syn&#8208;diastereomers) with up to &gt;20:1 dr and 99% ee under very mild conditions. The reaction proceeds via a catalytic cycle similar to the enzymatic aldol reaction of glycine. Pyridoxal catalyst 7a activates both of the reactants at the same time and brings them together in a specific spatial orientation, accounting for the high efficiency, excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>A Family of Nonribosomal Peptides Modulate Collective Behavior in Pseudovibrio Bacteria Isolated from Marine Sponges**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudovibrio are &#945;&#8208;proteobacteria proposed to contribute to marine sponge health. Lack of reverse genetics have hindered exploration of the ecological and biotechnological potential of Pseudovibrio. Here we describe reverse genetics methods that enabled identification of 12 pseudovibriamides, which we show affect motility and biofilm behavior of Pseudovibrio.







Abstract
Although swarming motility and biofilms are opposed collective behaviors, both contribute to bacterial survival and host colonization. Pseudovibrio bacteria have attracted attention because they are part of the microbiome of healthy marine sponges. Two&#8208;thirds of Pseudovibrio genomes contain a member of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase gene cluster family, which is also found sporadically in Pseudomonas pathogens of insects and plants. After developing reverse genetics for Pseudovibrio, we isolated heptapeptides with an ureido linkage and related nonadepsipeptides we termed pseudovibriamides&#8197;A and B, respectively. A combination of genetics and imaging mass spectrometry experiments showed heptapetides were excreted, promoting motility and reducing biofilm formation. In contrast to lipopeptides widely known to affect motility/biofilms, pseudovibriamides are not surfactants. Our results expand current knowledge on metabolites mediating bacterial collective behavior.

Lack of reverse genetics have hindered exploration of the ecological and biotechnological potential of &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt;. Here we describe reverse genetics methods that enabled identification of 12 pseudovibriamides, which we show affect motility and biofilm behavior of &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although swarming motility and biofilms are opposed collective behaviors, both contribute to bacterial survival and host colonization. &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; bacteria have attracted attention because they are part of the microbiome of healthy marine sponges. Two-thirds of &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt; genomes contain a member of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase gene cluster family, which is also found sporadically in &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; pathogens of insects and plants. After developing reverse genetics for &lt;i&gt;Pseudovibrio&lt;/i&gt;, we isolated heptapeptides with an ureido linkage and related nonadepsipeptides we termed pseudovibriamides&#8197;A and B, respectively. A combination of genetics and imaging mass spectrometry experiments showed heptapetides were excreted, promoting motility and reducing biofilm formation. In contrast to lipopeptides widely known to affect motility/biofilms, pseudovibriamides are not surfactants. Our results expand current knowledge on metabolites mediating bacterial collective behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Identification of Kinetic and Spectroscopic Signatures of Copper Sites for Direct Oxidation of Methane to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic and spectroscopic signatures of dimeric and monomeric copper species hosted in mordenite and reacting with methane have been identified.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;exchanged zeolites of different topologies possess high activity in the direct conversion of methane to methanol via the chemical looping approach. Despite a large number of studies, identification of the active sites, and especially their intrinsic kinetic characteristics remain incomplete and ambiguous. In the present work, we collate the kinetic behavior of different copper species with their spectroscopic identities and track the evolution of various copper motifs during the reaction. Using time&#8208;resolved UV/Vis and in situ EPR, XAS, and FTIR spectroscopies, two types of copper monomers were identified, one of which is active in the reaction with methane, in addition to a copper dimeric species with the mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo structure. Kinetic measurements showed that the reaction rate of the copper monomers is somewhat slower than that of the dicopper mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo species, while the activation energy is two times lower.

         <title>Nocathioamides, Uncovered by a Tunable Metabologenomic Approach, Define a Novel Class of Chimeric Lanthipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chimeric Lanthipeptides: Employing a tunable metabologenomic approach, nocathioamides&#8197;A&#8211;C were isolated and elucidated. They inaugurate a new RiPP family, characterized by a unique and hyper degree of modifications, including an intramolecular imide bridge.







Abstract
The increasing number of available genomes, in combination with advanced genome mining techniques, unveiled a plethora of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) coding for ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). The products of these BGCs often represent an enormous resource for new and bioactive compounds, but frequently, they cannot be readily isolated and remain cryptic. Here, we describe a tunable metabologenomic approach that recruits a synergism of bioinformatics in tandem with isotope&#8208; and NMR&#8208;guided platform to identify the product of an orphan RiPP gene cluster in the genomes of Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406 and 0706T. The application of this tactic resulted in the discovery of nocathioamides family as a founder of a new class of chimeric lanthipeptides I.

         <title>Using Light to Modify the Selectivity of Transition Metal Catalysed Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light can be used to switch on or accelerate the catalytic activity of transition metals. However, using light to modify the selectivity of a transformation is considerably less common. This Minireview highlights early examples of controlling catalyst activity in this way and looks at the distinct approaches that have been taken to date.







Abstract
Light has a remarkable and often unique ability to promote chemical reactions. In combination with transition metal catalysis, it offers exciting opportunities to modify catalyst function in a non&#8208;invasive manner, most frequently being reported to switch on or accelerate reactions that do not occur in the dark. However, the ability to completely change reactivity or selectivity between two different reaction outcomes is considerably less common. In this Minireview we bring together examples of this concept and highlight their mechanistically distinct approaches. Our overview demonstrates how these non&#8208;natural, photo&#8208;switchable systems provide key fundamental mechanistic insights, enhancing our understanding and stimulating development of new catalytic activity, and how this might lead to tangible applications, impacting fields such as polymer chemistry.

         <title>H2O&#8208;Built Proton Transfer Bridge Enhances Continuous Methane Oxidation to Methanol over Cu&#8208;BEA Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2O can directly participate in the continuous N2O&#8208;DMTM reaction through a proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;bridge over the dicopper [Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu] site of Cu&#8208;BEA zeolite. This can significantly boost CH3OH production rate and enhance long&#8208;term reaction stability.







Abstract
Direct oxidation of methane to methanol (DMTM) is a big challenge in C1 chemistry. We present a continuous N2O&#8208;DMTM investigation by simultaneously introducing 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% H2O into the reaction system over Cu&#8208;BEA zeolites. Combining a D2O isotopic tracer technique and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, we for the first time demonstrate that the H2O molecules can participate in the reaction through a proton transfer route, wherein the H2O molecules can build a high&#8208;speed proton transfer bridge between the generated moieties of CH3&#8722; and OH&#8722; over the evolved mono(&#956;&#8208;oxo) dicopper ([Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]2+) active site, thereby pronouncedly boosting the CH3OH selectivity (3.1&#8594;71.6&#8201;%), productivity (16.8&#8594;242.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term reaction stability (10&#8594;70&#8197;h) relative to the scenario of absence of H2O. Unravelling the proton transfer of H2O over the dicopper [Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]2+ site would substantially contribute to highly efficient catalyst designs for the continuous DMTM.

         <title>Bioinspired Network Analysis Enabled Divergent Syntheses and Structure Revision of Pentacyclic Cytochalasans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired, divergent total syntheses of trichodermone and trichoderone A were accomplished from a common biogenetic precursor, aspochalasin Z. Key steps include transannular alkene cyclizations, a singlet oxygen ene reaction, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cascade reactions. This approach validates the proposed biosynthetic pathway from a chemical perspective and paves the way for the synthesis and characterization of other cytochalasans.







Abstract
We accomplished the divergent total syntheses of ten pentacyclic cytochalasans (aspergillin PZ, trichodermone, trichoderones, flavipesines, and flavichalasines) from a common precursor aspochalasin&#8197;D and revised the structures of trichoderone&#8197;B, spicochalasin&#8197;A, flavichalasine&#8197;C, aspergilluchalasin based on structure network analysis of the cytochalasans biosynthetic pathways and DFT calculations. The key steps of the syntheses include transannular alkene/epoxyalkene and carbonyl&#8208;ene cyclizations to establish the C/D ring of pentacyclic aspochalasans. Our bioinspired approach to these pentacyclic cytochalasans validate the proposed biosynthetic speculation from a chemical view and provide a platform for the synthesis of more than 400 valuable cytochalasans bearing different macrocycles and amino&#8208;acid residues.

         <title>Facilitating the Ferration of Aromatic Substrates through Intramolecular Sodium Mediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining iron with sodium in tris(amido) complexes has led to the selective ferration of non&#8208;activated arenes being accomplished. A new cooperative mechanism is disclosed, whereby the sodium performs the metal&#8208;H exchange and this is followed by a fast intramolecular trans&#8208;metal trapping of the aryl anion by the iron centre.







Abstract
Exploiting cooperative effects between Na and FeII centres present in tris(amide) ferrate complexes has led to the chemoselective ferration of pentafluorobenzene, benzene, toluene, anisole, and pyridine being realised at room temperature. The importance of this bimetallic partnership is demonstrated by neither the relevant sodium amide (NaHMDS or NaTMP) nor the FeII amide Fe(HMDS)2 efficiently metallating these substrates under the conditions of this study. By combining NMR studies with the isolation of key intermediates and DFT calculations, we offer a possible mechanism for how these reactions take place, uncovering a surprising reaction pathway in which the metals cooperate in a synchronised manner. Although the isolated products are formally the result of Fe&#8208;H exchange, theoretical calculations indicate that the aromatic substrates undergo Na&#8208;H exchange followed by fast intramolecular transmetallation to Fe, thus stabilizing the newly generated aryl fragment.

         <title>Trifluoromethyl Nonaflate: A Practical Trifluoromethoxylating Reagent and its Application to the Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Trifluoromethoxylated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethyl nonaflate (TFNf), an odorless liquid (bp 87&#8211;89&#8201;&#176;C), was developed as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, bench&#8208;stable, and reactive trifluoromethoxylating reagent that can be easily and safely prepared in large scale. The synthetic potency of TFNf was demonstrated with the synthesis of various trifluoromethoxylated alkenes, through a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective direct hydro(halo)trifluoromethoxylation of various alkyne derivatives.







Abstract
The trifluoromethoxy group has elicited much interest among drug and agrochemical discovery teams because of its unique properties. We developed trifluoromethyl nonafluorobutanesulfonate (nonaflate), TFNf, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, bench&#8208;stable, reactive, and scalable trifluoromethoxylating reagent. TFNf is easily and safely prepared in a simple process in large scale and the nonaflyl part of TFNf can easily be recovered as nonaflyl fluoride after usage and recycled. The synthetic potency of TFNf was showcased with the underexplored synthesis of various trifluoromethoxylated alkenes, through a high regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydro(halo)trifluoromethoxylation of alkyne derivatives such as haloalkynes, alkynyl esters, and alkynyl sulfones. The synthetic merits of TFNf were further underscored with a high&#8208;yielding and smooth nucleophilic trifluoromethoxylation of alkyl triflates/bromides and primary/secondary alcohols.

         <title>FRET&#8208;Integrated Polymer Brushes for Spatially Resolved Sensing of Changes in Polymer Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FRET chemistry was integrated within stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer brush layers on planar substrates for spatial sensing of changing polymer conformations. Sensing was demonstrated for a variety of liquid mixture compositions, including high&#8208;resolution observation of lateral differences in polymer conformation at immiscible liquid interfaces (see picture), thus offering great potential to be leveraged for new surface&#8208;based sensing devices.







Abstract
Polymer brush surfaces that alter their physical properties in response to chemical stimuli have the capacity to be used as new surface&#8208;based sensing materials. For such surfaces, detecting the polymer conformation is key to their sensing capabilities. Herein, we report on FRET&#8208;integrated ultrathin (&lt;70&#8197;nm) polymer brush surfaces that exhibit stimuli&#8208;dependent FRET with changing brush conformation. Poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) polymers were chosen due their exceptional sensitivity to liquid mixture compositions and their ability to be assembled into well&#8208;defined polymer brushes. The brush transitions were used to optically sense changes in liquid mixture compositions with high spatial resolution (tens of micrometers), where the FRET coupling allowed for noninvasive observation of brush transitions around complex interfaces with real&#8208;time sensing of the liquid environment. Our methods have the potential to be leveraged towards greater surface&#8208;based sensing capabilities at intricate interfaces.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water electrolysis that results in green hydrogen is the key process towards a circular economy. The availabilities of the sustainable electricity and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst are the main bottlenecks of the process for large&#8208;scale green hydrogen production. A broad range of OER electrocatalysts has been explored to decrease the overpotential and boost the kinetics of this sluggish half&#8208;reaction. Co, Ni, and Fe&#8208;based catalysts have been considered to be potential candidates to replace noble metals due to their tunable 3d electron configuration and spin state, versatility in the terms of crystal and electronic structures as well as abundance in nature. This review provides some basic principles of water electrolysis, key aspects of OER, and significant criteria for the development of the catalysts. It provides also some insights on recent advances of Co, Ni, and Fe&#8208;based oxides and a brief perspective on green hydrogen production and the challenges of water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles via oxidant&#8208;free dehydrocyclization of alcohols using heterogeneous catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N  &#8208;Heterocycles, such as pyrroles, pyrimidines, quinazolines, and quinoxalines are important building blocks for organic chemistry and the fine chemical industry. For their synthesis, catalytic borrowing hydrogen and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling reactions of alcohols as sustainable reagents have received significant attention in recent years. To overcome the problems of product separation and catalyst reusability, several metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts have been reported to achieve these transformations with good yields and selectivity. In this review, we summarize the recent developments using both noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts to synthesize  N  &#8208;heterocycles from alcohols and  N  &#8208;nucleophiles  via  acceptorless dehydrogenation or borrowing hydrogen methodologies. Furthermore, this review introduces the preparation and functionalization strategies of the corresponding heterogeneous catalysts, discusses the reaction mechanism and the roles of electron states of metals, and the influence of Lewis acid&#8208;base properties of the support on these reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208; and Enantioselective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Mono&#8208;Hydrogenation of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins is one of the most fundamental transformations for the production of chiral compounds. However, the control of site selectivity in asymmetric mono&#8208;hydrogenation of dienes or polyenes remains largely underdeveloped. Herein, we present a highly efficient desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;dienes  via  iridium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation. This methodology demonstrates the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desymmetriation of  meso  dienes and provides a concise approach to the installation of two vicinal stereogenic centers adjacent to an alkene. High isolated yields (up to 96%) and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to 99:1  d.r.  and 99%  ee  ) were obtained for a series of divinyl carbinol and divinyl carbinamide substrates. DFT calculations reveal that an interaction between the hydroxyl oxygen and the reacting hydride is responsible for the stereoselectivity of the desymmetrization of the divinyl carbinol. Based on the calculated energy profiles, a model that simulates product distribution over time was applied to show an intuitive kinetics of this process. The usefulness of the methodology was further demonstrated by the synthesis of the key intermediates of natural products Zaragozic acid A and (+)&#8208;Invictolide.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Pt&#8208;Co Nano&#8208;alloys in Porous Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanotubes for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient electrocatalysts are essential for the production of green hydrogen from water electrolysis. Herein, a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;reorganization approach is developed to obtain ultrafine Pt&#8208;Co alloy nanoparticles (sub&#8208;10 nm) attached on the inner and outer shells of porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT). During the thermal reorganization, the migration of Pt&#8208;Co nano&#8208;alloys to both surfaces ensures the maximized exposure of active sites while maintaining the robust attachment to the porous carbon matrix. Density functional theory calculations suggest a nearly thermodynamically&#8208;neutral free energy of adsorption of hydrogen intermediates and diversified active sites induced by alloying, thus resulting in a great promotion in intrinsic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the delicate structural design and compositional modulation, the optimized Pt  3  Co@NCNT electrocatalyst manifests outstanding HER activity and superior stability in both acidic and alkaline media.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Driven Reversible Free Radical Catalysis for Environment&#8208;adaptive Cancer Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amplifying free radical production by chemical dynamic catalysis to cause oxidative damage to cancer cells has received extensive interest for cancer&#8208;specific therapy. The major challenge is inevitable negative modulation on the tumor microenvironment (TME) by these species, hindering durable effectiveness. Here we show for the first time an oxygen vacancy &#8208; rich Bi&#8208;based regulator that allows environment&#8208;adaptive free radical catalysis. Specifically,&#160;the regulator catalyzes production of highly toxic O  2  &#8226;&#8208;  and  &#8226;  OH in cancer cells  via  logic enzymatic reactions, yet scavenges accumulation of free radicals and immunosuppressive mediators in TME&#8208;associated noncancerous cells. Atomic&#8208;level mechanistic studies reveal that such dual&#8208;modal regulating behavior is dominated by oxygen vacancies that well fit for free radical catalytic kinetics, along with distinguished cellular fates of this regulator. With this smart regulator, a &#8220;two birds with one shot&#8221; cancer dynamic therapy can be expected.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2, a light driven cation channel with a retinal chromophore, undergoes a cyclic photoreaction with several photointermediates. Here, we analyze the chromophore configuration of the intermediates, which can be cryo&#8208;trapped, in detail by DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and reveal that the desensitized state is in a 13&#8208;cis,15&#8208;syn configuration. Our results also shed further light on the photocycle of the protein.







Abstract
Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) is a light&#8208;gated cation channel and was used to lay the foundations of optogenetics. Its dark state X&#8208;ray structure has been determined in 2017 for the wild&#8208;type, which is the prototype for all other ChR variants. However, the mechanistic understanding of the channel function is still incomplete in terms of structural changes after photon absorption by the retinal chromophore and in the framework of functional models. Hence, detailed information needs to be collected on the dark state as well as on the different photointermediates. For ChR2 detailed knowledge on the chromophore configuration in the different states is still missing and a consensus has not been achieved. Using DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state MAS NMR spectroscopy on proteoliposome samples, we unambiguously determined the chromophore configuration in the desensitized state, and we show that this state occurs towards the end of the photocycle.

         <title>Discovery of a Low Thermal Conductivity Oxide Guided by Probe Structure Prediction and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ba10Y6Ti4O27 has a complex aperiodic structure with the lowest thermal conductivity of any first&#8208;transition&#8208;series oxide. It is metastable, which makes it challenging to identify. Experimental exploration was focused sufficiently by structure prediction and property&#8208;targeted machine learning to enable the isolation of this material (see picture), whose structural motifs provide new insight into the control of heat transport.







Abstract
We report the aperiodic titanate Ba10Y6Ti4O27 with a room&#8208;temperature thermal conductivity that equals the lowest reported for an oxide. The structure is characterised by discontinuous occupancy modulation of each of the sites and can be considered as a quasicrystal. The resulting localisation of lattice vibrations suppresses phonon transport of heat. This new lead material for low&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity oxides is metastable and located within a quaternary phase field that has been previously explored. Its isolation thus requires a precisely defined synthetic protocol. The necessary narrowing of the search space for experimental investigation was achieved by evaluation of titanate crystal chemistry, prediction of unexplored structural motifs that would favour synthetically accessible new compositions, and assessment of their properties with machine&#8208;learning models.

         <title>Water Oxidation under Modal Ultrastrong Coupling Conditions Using Au/Ag Alloy Nanoparticles and Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Nanocavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a photoanode consisting of Au&#8208;Ag alloy nanoparticles (NPs), a TiO  2  thin film and a Au film (AATA) under modal strong coupling conditions with a large splitting energy of 520 meV, which can be categorized into the "ultrastrong coupling regime". We fabricated a photoanode under ultrastrong coupling conditions to verify the relationship between the coupling strength and photoelectric conversion efficiency and successfully performed efficient photochemical reactions. The AATA photoanode showed 4.0% of the maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (IPCE) obtained at 580 nm, and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was 4.1%.These results were attributed to the high hot&#8208;electron injection efficiency due to the larger near&#8208;field enhancement and relatively negative potential distribution of the hot electrons. Furthermore, hybrid mode&#8208;induced water oxidation using AATA structures was performed with a Faraday efficiency of more than 70% for O  2  evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Na9Bi5Os3O24: A Diamagnetic Oxide Featuring a Pronouncedly Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;Compressed Octahedral Coordination of Osmium(VI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;compressed OsO6 octahedron resulting in an unprecedented large splitting of the t2g levels and a diamagnetic ground state has been observed.







Abstract
The Jahn&#8211;Teller (JT) theorem constitutes one of the most fundamental concepts in chemistry. In transition&#8208;element chemistry, the 3d4 and 3d9 configurations in octahedral complexes are particularly illustrative, where a distortion in local geometry is associated with a reduction of the electronic energy. However, there has been a lasting debate about the fact that the octahedra are found to exclusively elongate. In contrast, for Na9Bi5Os3O24, the octahedron around Os6+(5d2) is heavily compressed, lifting the degeneracy of the t2g set of 5d orbitals such that in the sense of a JT compression a diamagnetic ground state results. This effect is not forced by structural constraints, the structure offers sufficient space for osmium to shift the apical oxygen atoms to a standard distance. The relevance of these findings is far reaching, since they provide new insights in the hierarchy of perturbations defining ground states of open shell electronic systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclic Anhydrides via Ligand&#8208;Enabled C&#8211;H Carbonylation of Simple Aliphatic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdII&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H carbonylation of free carboxylic acids, a new method for the synthesis of a wide range of cyclic anhydrides, is reported. Decarboxylative functionalization of the installed carboxyl group provides access to diverse &#946;&#8208;functionalized aliphatic acids. The enantioselective C&#8211;H carbonylation of cyclopropanecarboxylic acids is also achieved.







Abstract
The development of C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalizations of free carboxylic acids has provided a wide range of versatile C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Y (Y=heteroatom) bond&#8208;forming reactions. Additionally, C&#8211;H functionalizations have lent themselves to the one&#8208;step preparation of a number of valuable synthetic motifs that are often difficult to prepare through conventional methods. Herein, we report a &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H carbonylation of free carboxylic acids using Mo(CO)6 as a convenient solid CO source and enabled by a bidentate ligand, leading to convenient syntheses of cyclic anhydrides. Among these, the succinic anhydride products are versatile stepping stones for the mono&#8208;selective introduction of various functional groups at the &#946; position of the parent acids by decarboxylative functionalizations, thus providing a divergent strategy to synthesize a myriad of carboxylic acids inaccessible by previous &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H activation reactions. The enantioselective carbonylation of free cyclopropanecarboxylic acids has also been achieved using a chiral bidentate thioether ligand

         <title>A Fully Coplanar Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymeric Semiconductor with Promoted Charge Separation Kinetics for Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two polyarylether&#8208;based polymers with single/double linking patterns were investigated to establish the effect of the linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process in D&#8211;A conjugated polymer photocatalysts, thus achieving remarkable photocatalytic HER and HPER performances.







Abstract
Charge generation and separation are regarded as the major constraints limiting the photocatalytic activity of polymeric photocatalysts. Herein, two new linear polyarylether&#8208;based polymers (PAE&#8211;CPs) with distinct linking patterns between their donor and acceptor motifs were tailor&#8208;made to investigate the influence of different linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process. Theoretical and experimental results revealed that compared to the traditional single&#8208;stranded linker, the double&#8208;stranded linking pattern strengthens donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in PAE&#8211;CPs and generates a coplanar structure, facilitating charge generation and separation, and enabling red&#8208;shifted light absorption. With these prominent advantages, the PAE&#8211;CP interlinked with a double&#8208;stranded linker exhibits markedly enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to that of its single&#8208;strand&#8208;linked analogue. Such findings can facilitate the rational design and modification of organic semiconductors for charge&#8208;induced reactions.

         <title>Unprecedented Noncanonical Features of the Nonlinear Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Assembly Line for WS9326A Biosynthesis</title>

Systematic manipulation of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains in combination with elucidation of the interactions between the unique domains and structure revealed several hitherto unprecedented nonlinear NRPS assembly processes during the biosynthesis of cyclodepsipeptide WS9326A.







Abstract
Systematic inactivation of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains and translocation of the thioesterase (TE) domain revealed several unprecedented nonlinear NRPS assembly processes during the biosynthesis of the cyclodepsipeptide WS9326A in Streptomyces sp. SNM55. First, two sets of type &#921;&#921; TE (TE&#921;&#921;)&#8208;like enzymes mediate the shuttling of activated amino acids between two sets of stand&#8208;alone adenylation (A)&#8208;thiolation (T) didomain modules and an &#8220;A&#8208;less&#8221; condensation (C)&#8208;T module with distinctive specificities and flexibilities. This was confirmed by the elucidation of the affinities of the A&#8208;T didomains for the TE&#921;&#921;s and its structure. Second, the C&#8208;T didomain module operates iteratively and independently from other modules in the same protein to catalyze two chain elongation cycles. Third, this biosynthetic pathway includes the first example of module skipping, where the interpolated C and T domains are required for chain transfer.

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyst&#8208;Free, Base&#8208;Promoted 1,2&#8208;Additions of Polyfluorophenylboronates to Aldehydes and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a transition metal&#8208;free procedure for the base&#8208;promoted 1,2&#8208;addition of polyfluorophenylboronates to aldehydes and ketones to generate organofluorine&#8208;containing alcohols in yields up to 93&#8201;%.







Abstract
A novel protocol for the transition metal&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;addition of polyfluoroaryl boronate esters to aldehydes and ketones is reported, which provides secondary alcohols, tertiary alcohols, and ketones. Control experiments and DFT calculations indicate that both the ortho&#8208;F substituents on the polyfluorophenyl boronates and the counterion K+ in the carbonate base are critical. The distinguishing features of this procedure include the employment of commercially available starting materials and the broad scope of the reaction with a wide variety of carbonyl compounds giving moderate to excellent yields. Intriguing structural features involving O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonding, as well as arene&#8208;perfluoroarene interactions, in this series of racemic polyfluoroaryl carbinols have also been addressed.

         <title>Healable and Rearrangeable Networks of Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Diselenide Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel exchangeable diselenide chain extender is incorporated into an LCE system, bringing about the reprogrammability and the healability under visible&#8208;light irradiation or upon thermal treatment. These properties enable the utilization of a self&#8208;welding strategy to fabricate the complex LCE&#8208;based soft actuators without using any auxiliary reagent (adhesive, tape, catalysts or initiator).







Abstract
Based on liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) materials, hierarchically structured soft actuators can meet some requirements for &#8220;human&#8208;friendly&#8221; working mode and execute complex tasks with intelligent adaptation to environmental changes. However, few researchers have paid much attention to the preparation methods of multicomponent/hierarchical LCE actuators. In this communication, we demonstrate the successful integration of an exchangeable diselenide chain extender for the preparation of dynamic LCEs, which could be reprogrammed on heating or under visible light illumination. Moreover, the rearrangeable polydiselenide networks could be applied to develop the self&#8208;welding technology toward fabricating hierarchically structured LCE actuators with sophisticated deformability without using any auxiliary reagent (adhesive, tape, catalysts or initiator) during the assembling process.

         <title>Photoelectron Circular Dichroism in the Photodetachment of Amino Acid Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chirality of chemical compounds is of undisputed importance in science and technology. In particular with respect to pharmacological application most molecules of interest cannot be accessed by the powerful techniques developed in recent years for gas phase analytes. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of electrospray ionization (ESI) with the detection of photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) provides access to chirality information applicable to molecular materials with negligible vapor pressure, e.g. amino acids. To this end, glutamic acid and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) have been electrosprayed into the source of a chirality spectrometer, where photodetachment is enforced and the PECD is detected. The technique can be expected to be conceptually applicable to all chemical systems with chirality based on molecular properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic lysozyme&#8208;photodynamic therapy against resistant bacteria based on an intelligent upconversion nanoplatform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid emergence of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria has raised a great social concern together with the impetus for exploring advanced antibacterial ways. NIR&#8208;triggered antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) by virtue of lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) as energy donor exhibits the advantages of high tissue penetration, broad antibacterial spectrum and less acquired resistance, but is still limited by its low efficacy. Herein, we designed a novel bio&#8208;inorganic nanohybrid and for the first time combined lysozyme (LYZ) with UCNP&#8208;PDT system to enhance the efficiency against resistant bacteria. Benefiting from the rapid adhesion to bacteria, intelligently bacteria&#8208;responsive LYZ release and synergistic LYZ&#8208;PDT effect, the nanoplatform achieves an exceptionally strong bactericidal capacity and conspicuous bacteriostasis on methicillin&#8208;resistant  S. aureus  . These findings pave the way for designing efficiently antibacterial nanomaterials and provide a new synergistic strategy for combating deep&#8208;tissue bacterial infection.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Iridium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocarbonation of Alkenes: A Versatile Approach to Heterocyclic Systems Bearing Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a versatile, highly enantioselective intramolecular hydrocarbonation reaction that provides a direct access to heteropolycyclic systems bearing chiral quaternary carbon stereocenters. The method, which relies on an iridium(I)/bisphosphine chiral catalyst, is particularly efficient for the synthesis of five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered fused indole and pyrrole products, bearing one and two stereocenters, with enantiomeric excesses of up to &gt; 99%. DFT computational studies allowed to obtain a detailed mechanistic profile and identify a cluster of weak non&#8208;covalent interactions as key factors to control the enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Successive Storage of Cations and Anions by Ligands of &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Coordination Polymers Enabling Robust Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymers (CCPs) accompanied with anion insertion has the merits of increasing the capacity and elevating the discharge voltages. However, the previous reports on this mechanism either required more investigations or showed low capacity and poor cyclablity. Herein, triphenylene catecholate&#8208;based two dimensional CCPs are constructed by employing inactive transition metal ions (Zn  2+  ) as nodes, forming Zn&#8208;HHTP. Substantial characterizations and theoretical calculations indicated the successive storage of cations and anions by redox of only ligands, leading to a high reversible capacity of ~150 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  and remarkable capacity retention of 90% after 1000 cycles. On the contrary, as a control experiment, the analogue CCPs (Cu&#8208;HHTP) with Cu  2+  nodes, involved the redox of both ligands and metal ions and accompanied with the storage of only Na  +  &#8208;cations, showing much poorer cyclability. These results highlighted the importance of redox of only ligands for long&#8208;term cycle life and the insight into the storage mechanisms would deepen our understanding on CCPs for further design of CCPs with high performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting Boron Difluoride Curcuminoid&#8208;Based Polymers Exhibiting Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence as Biological Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared emitting polymers were prepared using four boron&#8208;difluoride curcuminoid&#8208;based monomers using ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Well&#8208;defined polymers with molecular weights of ~20 kDa and dispersities &lt; 1.07 were produced and exhibited near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission in solution and in the solid state with photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;  PL  ) as high as 0.72. Time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy revealed thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in polymers containing highly planar dopants, whereas room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence dominated with twisted species. Density functional theory demonstrated that rotation about the donor&#8208;acceptor linker can give rise to TADF, even where none would be expected based on calculations using ground&#8208;state geometries. Incorporation of TADF&#8208;active materials into water&#8208;soluble polymer dots (Pdots) gave NIR&#8208;emissive nanoparticles, and conjugation of these Pdots with antibodies enabled immunofluorescent labeling of SK&#8208;BR3 human breast cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Organic Fluid Phosphorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has become an accepted approach to construct room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials by suppressing the non&#8208;radiative decay process. However, there is limited success in developing fluid phosphorescence materials due to the ultrafast non&#8208;radiation relaxation of vibration and collision of molecules in fluid matrixes. In this study, a universal deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent strategy was proposed for developing pure organic phosphorescent fluid materials that are able to generate effective phosphorescent emissions at both room temperature (&#934;  RTP, 293 K  ~ 30%) and even higher temperature (&#934;  RTP, 358 K  ~ 4.53%). Based on these findings, a qualitative analytical method was developed for leak detection and a quantitative analytical technique was further validated to help visually identify the heat distribution of irregular surfaces. This advancement greatly empowers the current organic phosphorescent system offering an alternative approach to determine moisture and heat from non&#8208;invasive photoluminescence emission colors.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Self&#8208;Assembly of Carbon Nitride Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of nanocrystal self&#8208;assembly into superlattices or superstructures is of great significance in nanoscience. Carbon nitride quantum dots (CNQDs), being a promising new group of nanomaterials, however, have hardly been explored in their self&#8208;organizing behavior. Here we report of a unique irradiation&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly and recrystallization phenomenon of crystalline CNQDs (c&#8208;CNQDs) terminated by abundant oxygen&#8208;containing groups. Unlike the conventional self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystals into ordered superstructures, the photoinduced self&#8208;assembly of c&#8208;CNQDs resembles a &#8220;click reaction&#8221; process of macromolecules, in which the activated &#8211;OH and &#8211;NH  2  functional groups along the perimeters initiate cross&#8208;linking of adjacent QDs through a photocatalytic effect. Our findings unveil fundamental physiochemical features of CNQDs and open up new possibilities of manipulating carbon nitride nanomaterials via controlled assembly. Prospects for potential applications are discussed as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkene Isomerization Revitalizes the Coates&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic vinyl acetals, first investigated by Coates nearly four decades ago, is set apart from other variants of the Claisen rearrangement owing to the versatile monoprotected 1,5 dicarbonyl motif featured in the products. Unfortunately, the synthetically elusive nature of the substrates has thus far precluded the widespread application of this attractive transformation. Herein, we show that the key allylic vinyl acetals can be efficiently generated through alkene isomerization of their readily available regioisomeric counterparts (derived from allylic alcohols and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes), thus enabling the first systematic study into the substrate scope of this rearrangement, as well as the discovery of exceptionally mild conditions for its mediation by Lewis&#8208; and Br&#248;nsted acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Control of Both Dispersity and Molecular Weight Distribution Shape by Polymer Blending</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The breadth and the shape of molecular weight distributions can significantly influence fundamental polymer properties that are critical for various applications. However, current approaches require the extensive synthesis of multiple polymers, are limited in dispersity precision and are typically incapable of simultaneously controlling both the dispersity and the shape of molecular weight distributions. Here we report a simplified approach, whereby on mixing two polymers (one of high  &#272;  and one of low  &#272;), any intermediate dispersity value can be obtained (e.g. from 1.08 to 1.84). Unrivalled precision is achieved, with dispersity values obtained to even the nearest 0.01 (e.g. 1.37&#8594;1.38&#8594;1.39&#8594;1.40&#8594;1.41&#8594;1.42&#8594;1.43&#8594;1.44&#8594;1.45), while maintaining fairly monomodal molecular weight distributions. This approach was also employed to control the shape of molecular weight distributions and to obtain diblock copolymers with high dispersity accuracy. The straightforward nature of our methodology alongside its compatibility with a wide range of polymerisation protocols (e.g. ATRP, RAFT), significantly expands the toolbox of tailored polymeric materials and renders them accessible to all researchers.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Activation of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes and Cyclobutanes: An Alternative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Cleavage Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical activation of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes and D&#8211;A cyclobutanes has been applied for the formal insertion of molecular oxygen into these compounds. C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cleavage of the ring moieties was achieved either by direct anodic electrolysis or by utilizing a DDQ&#8208;assisted electrochemical strategy. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and supportive experiments provided mechanistic understanding of the electrocatalytic process.







Abstract
We describe the first electrochemical activation of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes and D&#8211;A cyclobutanes leading after C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cleavage to the formation of highly reactive radical cations. This concept is utilized to formally insert molecular oxygen after direct or DDQ&#8208;assisted anodic oxidation of the strained carbocycles, delivering &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;hydroxy ketones and 1,2&#8208;dioxanes electrocatalytically. Furthermore, insights into the mechanism of the oxidative process, obtained experimentally and by additional quantum&#8208;chemical calculations are presented. The synthetic potential of the reaction products is demonstrated by diverse derivatizations.

         <title>Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol on Mononuclear Copper(II) Sites Supported on Al2O3: Structure of Active Sites from Electron Paramagnetic Resonance**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;dispersed CuII sites generated on transition alumina using a molecular approach were employed in the stepwise partial oxidation of methane to methanol. The reactive CuII centers could be identified spectroscopically due to their unique EPR signature. A structure for these unusual CuII monomers, working in pairs, was proposed based on advanced spectroscopic characterization, reactivity studies, and DFT modeling.







Abstract
The selective conversion of methane to methanol remains one of the holy grails of chemistry, where Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolites have been shown promote this reaction under stepwise conditions. Over the years, several active sites have been proposed, ranging from mono&#8208;, di&#8208; to trimeric CuII. Herein, we report the formation of well&#8208;dispersed monomeric CuII species supported on alumina using surface organometallic chemistry and their reactivity towards the selective and stepwise conversion of methane to methanol. Extensive studies using various transition alumina supports combined with spectroscopic characterization, in particular electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), show that the active sites are associated with specific facets, which are typically found in &#947;&#8208; and &#951;&#8208;alumina phase, and that their EPR signature can be attributed to species having a tri&#8208;coordinated [(Al2O)CuIIO(OH)]&#8722; T&#8208;shape geometry. Overall, the selective conversion of methane to methanol, a two&#8208;electron process, involves two monomeric CuII sites that play in concert.

         <title>Real&#8208;time NMR monitoring of spatially segregated enzymatic reactions in multilayered hydrogel assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compartmentalized chemical reactions at the microscale are important in biotechnology, yet monitoring the molecular content at these small scales is challenging. To address this challenge, we integrate a compact, reconfigurable reaction cell featuring electrochemical functionality with high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate the operation of this system by monitoring the activity of enzymes immobilized in chemically distinct layers within a multi&#8208;layered chitosan hydrogel assembly. As a benchmark, we observed the parallel activities of urease (Urs), catalase (Cat), and glucose oxidase (GOx) by monitoring reagent and product concentrations in real&#8208;time. Simultaneous monitoring of an independent enzymatic process (Urs) together with a cooperative process (GOx + Cat) was achieved, with chemical conversion modulation of the GOx + Cat process demonstrated by varying the order in which the hydrogel was assembled. Construction of complex reaction cascades with spatial control is thereby enabled, as would be interesting in, for example, metabolic engineering and multiplexed sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Azide&#8211;Thioalkyne Cycloaddition Catalyzed by Photoactivatable Ruthenium(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored cationic RuII complexes are highly effective precatalysts for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;thioalkyne cycloaddition (see scheme). These reactions can now be carried out under very dilute conditions and in complex biorelevant media; they are also compatible with and mutually orthogonal to CuAAC. Moreover, ruthenium&#8211;arene sandwich complexes function as photoactivatable precatalysts, providing for temporal control of the reactivity.







Abstract
Tailored ruthenium sandwich complexes bearing photoresponsive arene ligands can efficiently promote azide&#8211;thioalkyne cycloaddition (RuAtAC) when irradiated with UV light. The reactions can be performed in a bioorthogonal manner in aqueous mixtures containing biological components. The strategy can also be applied for the selective modification of biopolymers, such as DNA or peptides. Importantly, this ruthenium&#8208;based technology and the standard copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) proved to be compatible and mutually orthogonal.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral S&#8208;nitrosation Mediated by a Dicopper Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation of thiol has been achieved at a dicopper(I,I) center. This redox&#8208; and proton&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation process is the first functional model of ceruloplasmin in mediating S&#8208;nitrosation of external thiols, with implications for biological copper sites in the interconversion of NO./RSNO.







Abstract
A redox&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation of thiol has been achieved at a dicopper(I,I) center. Treatment of dicopper (I,I) complex with excess NO. and thiol generates a dicopper (I,I) di&#8208;S&#8208;nitrosothiol complex [CuICuI(RSNO)2]2+ or dicopper (I,I) mono&#8208;S&#8208;nitrosothiol complex [CuICuI(RSNO)]2+, which readily release RSNO in 88&#8211;94&#8201;% yield. The S&#8208;nitrosation proceeds by a mixed&#8208;valence [CuIICuIII(&#956;&#8208;O)(&#956;&#8208;NO)]2+ species, which deprotonates RS&#8208;H at the basic &#956;&#8208;O site and nitrosates RS&#8722; at the &#956;&#8208;NO site. The [CuIICuIII(&#956;&#8208;O)(&#956;&#8208;NO)]2+ complex is also competent for O&#8208;nitrosation of MeOH. A rare [CuIICuII(&#956;&#8208;NO)(OMe)]2+ intermediate was isolated and fully characterized, suggesting the S&#8208;nitrosation may proceed through the intermediary of analogous [CuIICuII(&#956;&#8208;NO)(SR)]2+ species. This redox&#8208; and proton&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation process is the first functional model of ceruloplasmin in mediating S&#8208;nitrosation of external thiols, with implications for biological copper sites in the interconversion of NO./RSNO.

         <title>Tricyanidoferrates(&#8722;IV) and Ruthenates(&#8722;IV) with Non&#8208;Innocent Cyanido Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;rich cyanidometalates [Fe(CN)3]7&#8722; and [Ru(CN)3]7&#8722; represent the first examples of group&#8197;8 elements with an oxidation state of &#8722;IV. DFT calculations reveal a nominal d10s0 configuration, which corresponds to an effective charge of 2&#8722;. The high negative charge also weakens the C&#8722;N bonds by the population of antibonding states.







Abstract
Exceptionally electron&#8208;rich, nearly trigonal&#8208;planar tricyanidometalate anions [Fe(CN)3]7&#8722; and [Ru(CN)3]7&#8722; were stabilized in LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] and AE3.5[M(CN)3] (AE=Sr, Ba; M=Fe, Ru). They are the first examples of group&#8197;8 elements with the oxidation state of &#8722;IV. Microcrystalline powders were obtained by a solid&#8208;state route, single crystals from alkali metal flux. While LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] crystallizes in P63/m, the polar space group P63 with three&#8208;fold cell volume for AE3.5[M(CN)3] is confirmed by second harmonic generation. X&#8208;ray diffraction, IR and Raman spectroscopy reveal longer C&#8722;N distances (124&#8211;128&#8197;pm) and much lower stretching frequencies (1484&#8211;1634&#8197;cm&#8722;1) than in classical cyanidometalates. Weak C&#8722;N bonds in combination with strong M&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bonding is a scheme also known for carbonylmetalates. Instead of the formal notation [Fe&#8722;IV(CN&#8722;)3]7&#8722;, quantum chemical calculations reveal non&#8208;innocent intermediate&#8208;valent CN1.67&#8722; ligands and a closed&#8208;shell d10 configuration for Fe, that is, Fe2&#8722;.

         <title>Stable Acidic Water Oxidation with a Cobalt&#8211;Iron&#8211;Lead Oxide Catalyst Operating via a Cobalt&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Healing Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Pb]Ox water oxidation anode catalyst facilitates long&#8208;term O2 evolution reaction in acidic electrolytes at elevated temperatures. Through a cobalt&#8208;selective self&#8208;healing mechanism, this catalyst operates in the absence of dissolved Pb2+ and Fe3+ precursors deeming it a prospective anode material for low&#8208;cost water electrolyzer systems.







Abstract
The instability and expense of anodes for water electrolyzers with acidic electrolytes can be overcome through the implementation of a cobalt&#8208;iron&#8208;lead oxide electrocatalyst, [Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Pb]Ox, that is self&#8208;healing in the presence of dissolved metal precursors. However, the latter requirement is pernicious for the membrane and especially the cathode half&#8208;reaction since Pb2+ and Fe3+ precursors poison the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platinum H2 evolving catalyst. To address this, we demonstrate the invariably stable operation of [Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Pb]Ox in acidic solutions through a cobalt&#8208;selective self&#8208;healing mechanism without the addition of Pb2+ and Fe3+ and investigate the kinetics of the process. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that low concentrations of Co2+ in the solution stabilize the catalytically active Co(Fe) sites. The highly promising performance of this system is showcased by steady water electrooxidation at 80&#177;1&#8201;&#176;C and 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, using a flat electrode, at an overpotential of 0.56&#177;0.01&#8197;V on a one&#8208;week timescale.

         <title>A Bubble&#8208;Assisted Approach for Patterning Nanoscale Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to pattern functional organic molecules with a template of foams has been developed, and this approach can achieve a resolution of sub 100&#8197;nm currently. Using a kind of water&#8208;soluble porphyrin, we elucidate the hierarchal assembly structure and molecular interactions in bubble system.







Abstract
We demonstrate a new approach to pattern functional organic molecules with a template of foams, and achieve a resolution of sub 100&#8197;nm. The bubble&#8208;assisted assembly (BAA) process is consisted of two periods, including bubble evolution and molecular assembly, which are dominated by the Laplace pressure and molecular interactions, respectively. Using TPPS (meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin), we systematically investigate the patterns and assembly behaviour in the bubble system with a series of characterizations, which show good uniformity in nanoscale resolution. Theoretical simulations reveal that TPPS's J&#8208;aggregates contribute to the ordered construction of molecular patterns. Finally, we propose an empirical rule for molecular patterning approach, that the surfactant and functional molecules should have the same type of charge in a two&#8208;component system. This approach exhibits promising feasibility to assemble molecular patterns at nanoscale resolution for micro/nano functional devices.

         <title>A Mortise&#8208;and&#8208;Tenon Joint Inspired Mechanically Interlocked Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated that the delicate mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint was precisely mimicked to construct a mechanically interlocked network (MIN), which simultaneously integrates incompatible mechanical adaptivity, robustness, and dynamic stability in a single system.







Abstract
Mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joints have been widely used for thousands of years in wooden architectures in virtue of their artistic and functional performance. However, imitation of similar structural and mechanical design philosophy to construct mechanically adaptive materials at the molecular level is a challenge. Herein, we report a mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint inspired mechanically interlocked network (MIN), in which the [2]rotaxane crosslink not only mimics the joint in structure, but also reproduces its function in modifying mechanical properties of the MIN. Benefiting from the hierarchical energy dissipative ability along with the controllable intramolecular movement of the mechanically interlocked crosslink, the resultant MIN simultaneously exhibits notable mechanical adaptivity and structural stability in a single system, as manifested by decent stiffness, strength, toughness, and deformation recovery capacity.

         <title>A Distannylated Monomer of a Strong Electron&#8208;Accepting Organoboron Building Block: Enabling Acceptor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymers for n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distannylated monomer of strong electron&#8208;deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) is readily synthesized and used to develop acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8208;A) type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels and can be effectively n&#8208;doped, and thus lead to excellent thermoelectric performance.







Abstract
Acceptor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8208;A) copolymerization is an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers. However, the development of A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers is challenging due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, a distannylated monomer of strong electron&#8208;deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit is readily synthesized and used to develop A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels of &#8722;4.4&#8197;eV, which is among the lowest value reported for organoboron polymers. After n&#8208;doping, the resulting polymers exhibit electric conductivity of 7.8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 24.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. This performance is among the best for n&#8208;type polymer thermoelectric materials. These results demonstrate the great potential of A&#8208;A type organoboron polymers for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectrics.

         <title>Isomeric Dibenzoheptazethrenes for Air&#8208;Stable Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dibenzoheptazethrene isomers with low diradical character, large singlet&#8211;triplet gaps, and narrow energy gaps were synthesized. Both compounds exhibited remarkably high stability, which allowed for the fabrication of single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors in air. A hole mobility of up to 0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was obtained with good bias&#8208;stress and storage stability.







Abstract
Singlet diradicaloids hold great potential as semiconductors for organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). However, their relative low material and device stabilities impede the practical applications. Here, to achieve balanced stability and performance, two isomeric dibenzoheptazethrene derivatives with singlet diradical character were synthesized in a concise manner. Benefitting from the aromatic stabilization, both compounds display a small diradical character and large singlet&#8211;triplet gap, as corroborated by variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, single&#8208;crystal analysis, and theoretical calculations. OFET devices based on single crystals showed a high hole mobility of 0.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is the highest for zethrene&#8208;based semiconductors. Both isomers exhibited remarkable material stability in air&#8208;saturated solutions as well as excellent bias&#8208;stress and storage stability in device under ambient air.

         <title>Rational Design of a Highly Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Fluorogenic Probe for Imaging Orthotopic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this report, we show that a carbamate as recognition unit has an excellent selectivity for a hepatocellular carcinoma chemotherapy (HCC)&#8208;related biomarker (carboxylesterase, CE) without interference from other hydrolases. We developed a near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe with high selectivity and strong fluorescence signals towards CE activity, enabling it to successfully monitor CE activity for evaluating HCC chemotherapy in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Selective fluorescence imaging of biomarkers in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;situ for evaluating orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) chemotherapy remains a great challenge due to current imaging agents suffering from the potential interferences of other hydrolases. Herein, we observed that carbamate unit showed a high selectivity toward the HCC&#8208;related biomarker carboxylesterase (CE) for evaluation of treatment. A near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe was developed to not only specially image CE activity in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;situ but also target orthotopic liver tumor after systemic administration. The in&#8197;vivo signals of the probe correlate well with tumor apoptosis, making it possible to evaluate the status of treatment. The probe enables the imaging of CE activity in&#8197;situ with a high&#8208;resolution three&#8208;dimensional view for the first time. This study may promote advances in optical imaging approaches for precise imaging&#8208;guided diagnosis of HCC in&#8197;situ and its evaluation of treatment.

         <title>An All&#8208;in&#8208;One Organic Semiconductor for Targeted Photoxidation Catalysis in Hypoxic Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gram&#8208;scale organic semiconductor C5N2 NPs were synthesized by a one&#8208;pot bottom&#8208;up method. The all&#8208;in&#8208;one semiconductor, with a low band gap of 1.63&#8197;eV and inherent nucleus targeting and strong photooxidation capacity, could accumulate at cell nucleus, split H2O to produce O2 and also generate cytotoxia 1O2 under high&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrable NIR irradiation, successfully achieving effective and enhanced PDT in a hypoxic tumor.







Abstract
Tumor hypoxia severely limits the therapeutic effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Although many methods for oxygen generation exist, substantial safety concerns, spatiotenporal uncontrollability, limited efficacy, and complicated procedures have compromised their practical application. Here, we demonstrate a biocompatiable all&#8208;in&#8208;one organic semiconductor to provide a photoxidation catalysis mechanism of action. A facile method is developed to produce gram&#8208;level C5N2 nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;based organic semiconductor. Under 650&#8197;nm laser irradiation, the semiconductor split water to generate O2 and simultaneously produce singlet oxygen (1O2), showing that the photocatalyst for O2 evolution and the photosensitizer (PS) for 1O2 generation could be synchronously achieved in one organic semiconductor. The inherent nucleus targeting capacity endows it with direct and efficient DNA photocleavage. These findings pave the way for developing organic semiconductor&#8208;based cancer therapeutic agents.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of Aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries with a Ruthenium&#8208;Complex&#8208;Based Mobile Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru(bpy)3Cl2 was applied as the first ruthenium&#8208;based mobile catalyst to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. The RuII catalyst was discovered to interact with both CO2 molecules and amorphous Li2C2O4 intermediate, thus promoting CO2RR and delaying carbonate formation and consequently leading to lowered overpotential, enlarged capacity, and prolonged cyclability of the batteries.







Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are regarded as next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical devices. However, the greatest challenge arises from the formation of the discharge product, Li2CO3, which would accumulate and deactivate heterogenous catalysts to cause huge polarization. Herein, Ru(bpy)3Cl2 was employed as a solution&#8208;phase catalyst for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries and proved to be the most effective one screened so far. Spectroscopy and electrochemical analyses elucidate that the RuII center could interact with both CO2 and amorphous Li2C2O4 intermediate, thus promoting electroreduction process and delaying carbonate transformation. As a result, the charge potential is reduced to 3.86&#8197;V and over 60 discharge/charge cycles are achieved with a fixed capacity of 1000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Our work provides a new avenue to improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with efficient mobile catalysts.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Second Time&#8208;Resolved Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Reveals Dynamic CO Intermediates during Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TR&#8208;SERS) reveals the dynamics of the CO2 reduction reaction over Cu surfaces with a sub&#8208;second time resolution of 717&#8197;ms per spectrum. Anodic treatment and subsequent reduction result in a highly active surface for both SERS and ethylene production within 7&#8197;s. A dynamic CO intermediate below 2060&#8197;cm&#8722;1 correlates with CO&#8208;CO coupling and ethylene formation, and a static CO intermediate with a vibration at 2092&#8197;cm&#8722;1 relates to CO production.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) into hydrocarbons is a promising approach for greenhouse gas mitigation, but many details of this dynamic reaction remain elusive. Here, time&#8208;resolved surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TR&#8208;SERS) is employed to successfully monitor the dynamics of CO2RR intermediates and Cu surfaces with sub&#8208;second time resolution. Anodic treatment at 1.55&#8197;V vs. RHE and subsequent surface oxide reduction (below &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) induced roughening of the Cu electrode surface, which resulted in hotspots for TR&#8208;SERS, enhanced time resolution (down to &#8776;0.7&#8197;s) and fourfold improved CO2RR efficiency toward ethylene. With TR&#8208;SERS, the initial restructuring of the Cu surface was followed (&lt;7&#8197;s), after which a stable surface surrounded by increased local alkalinity was formed. Our measurements revealed that a highly dynamic CO intermediate, with a characteristic vibration below 2060&#8197;cm&#8722;1, is related to C&#8722;C coupling and ethylene production (&#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE), whereas lower cathodic bias (&#8722;0.7&#8197;V vs. RHE) resulted in gaseous CO production from isolated and static CO surface species with a distinct vibration at 2092&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Formulating the Electrolyte Towards High&#8208;Energy and Safe Rechargeable Lithium&#8211;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formulation of conventional electrolyte composition yields a hybrid solid/liquid electrolyte that is electrochemically compatible with the Li&#8208;metal anode and the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes, which promises stable operation of a practical 10&#8208;Ah&#8208;grade pouch cell with a specific energy of &gt;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8211;metal batteries with a cell&#8208;level specific energy of &gt;400&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 are highly desired for next&#8208;generation storage applications, yet the research has been retarded by poor electrolyte&#8211;electrode compatibility and rigorous safety concerns. We demonstrate that by simply formulating the composition of conventional electrolytes, a hybrid electrolyte was constructed to ensure high (electro)chemical and thermal stability with both the Li&#8208;metal anode and the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes. By employing the new electrolyte, Li&#8741;LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cells show favorable cycling and rate performance, and a 10&#8197;Ah Li&#8741;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell demonstrates a practical specific energy of &gt;450&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Our findings shed light on reasonable design principles for electrolyte and electrode/electrolyte interfaces toward practical realization of high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries.

Abstract
Galectins are a galactoside specific subclass of carbohydrate binding proteins (lectins) involved in various cellular activities, certain cancers, infections, inflammations, and many other biological processes. The molecular basis for the selectivity of galectins is well&#8208;documented and revolves around appropriate interaction complementarity: an aromatic residue for C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and polar residues for (charge assisted) hydrogen bonds with the axial hydroxyl group of a galactoside. However, no synthetic mimics are currently available. We now report on the design and synthesis of the first galectin mimic (6), and show that it has a higher than 65&#8208;fold preference for n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;galactoside (8) over n&#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucoside (7) in CD2Cl2 containing 5&#8201;% [D6]DMSO (with Ka&#8805;4500&#8197;M&#8722;1 for 6:8). Molecular modeling informed by nOe studies reveal a high degree of interaction complementarity between 6 and galactoside 8, which is very similar to the interaction complementarity found in natural galectins.

         <title>Motorized Macrocycle: A Photo&#8208;responsive Host with Switchable and Stereoselective Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Motorized macrocycles have been successfully synthesized by combining molecular motors with crown ether macrocycles, enabling a unique photo&#8208;switchable host&#8211;guest systems controlled by the multi&#8208;stable unidirectional rotation of molecular motors. The switchable chiral cavity can be also used for the enantioselective recognition of guests.







Abstract
Designing photo&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems can provide versatile supramolecular tools for constructing smart systems and materials. We designed photo&#8208;responsive macrocyclic hosts, modulated by light&#8208;driven molecular rotary motors enabling switchable chiral guest recognition. The intramolecular cyclization of the two arms of a first&#8208;generation molecular motor with flexible oligoethylene glycol chains of different lengths resulted in crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like macrocycles with intrinsic motor function. The octaethylene glycol linkage enables the successful unidirectional rotation of molecular motors, simultaneously allowing the 1:1 host&#8211;guest interaction with ammonium salt guests. The binding affinity and stereoselectivity of the motorized macrocycle can be reversibly modulated, owing to the multi&#8208;state light&#8208;driven switching of geometry and helicity of the molecular motors. This approach provides an attractive strategy to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems and dynamic materials.

         <title>Plastic Waste Conversion over a Refinery Waste Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the path to finding better catalysts for polyolefin plastic waste conversion to aromatics, we have found that a waste refinery catalyst performed better than the fresh catalyst with decreased accumulation of deactivating carbonaceous deposits. Fluorescence microscopy and vibrational spectroscopy has been used to elucidate the interaction of the polymer with the catalyst and to map the location and type of bulky aromatic species.







Abstract
Polypropylene (PP) makes up a large share of our plastic waste. We investigated the conversion of PP over the industrial Fluid Catalytic Cracking catalyst (FCC&#8208;cat) used to produce gasoline from crude oil fractions. We studied transport limitations arising from the larger size of polymers compared to the crude oil&#8208;based feedstock by testing the components of this catalyst separately. Infrared spectroscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed the role of the FCC matrix in aromatization, and the zeolite Y domains in coking. An equilibrium catalyst (ECAT), discarded during FCC operation as waste, produced the same aromatics content as a fresh FCC&#8208;cat, while coking decreased significantly, likely due to the reduced accessibility and activity of the zeolite domains and an enhanced cracking activity of the matrix due to metal deposits present in ECAT. This mechanistic understanding provides handles for further improving the catalyst composition towards higher aromatics selectivity.

         <title>Azacalix[3]triazines: A Substructure of Triazine&#8208;Based Graphitic Carbon Nitride Featuring Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has drawn considerable interest since the discovery of its metal&#8208;free photocatalytic properties. The synthesis of a substructure of triazine&#8208;based GCN (Tz&#8208;GCN), azacalix[3]triazines, is reported. The material exhibits super strong basicity as well as anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has garnered broad research interest due to its unique catalytic properties. However, GCN, prepared by general methods, possesses myriad structural defects and it has been difficult to elucidate their intrinsic physical properties. We report the development of azacalix[3]triazines (AC3Ts), a substructure of triazine&#8208;based GCN (Tz&#8208;GCN). Despite the electron&#8208;deficient natures of triazine, AC3Ts capture protons as organic superbases. We reveal the unique anion&#8208;&#960; interactions of AC3Ts that alters the ionization potentials of AC3Ts. To the best of our knowledge, these features have not yet been recognized for Tz&#8208;GCN. These unveiled features of AC3Ts are expected to expand the usage scope and possibilities for GCNs.

Exposure of nitrostilbenes to sodium  tert  &#8208;butoxide was found to produce  N  &#8208;hydroxyindoles at room temperature without an additive. Changing the counterion to potassium changed the reaction outcome to yield solely oxindoles through an unprecedented dioxygen&#8208;transfer reaction followed by a 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration. Mechanistic experiments established that these reactions proceed via radical intermediates and suggest that counterion coordination controls whether an oxindole or  N  &#8208;hydroxyindole product is formed.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of a purely covalent cage with homochirality via imine formation in water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of host molecules in aqueous media via metal&#8208;ligand coordination is well developed. However, the preparation of purely covalent counterparts in water has remained a formidable task. Here, an anionic tetrahedron cage was successfully self&#8208;assembled in a [4+4] manner by condensing a trisamine and a trisformyl in water. Even although each individual imine bond is rather labile and apt to hydrolyze in water, the tetrahedron is remarkably stable or inert due to multivalence. The tetrahedral cages, as well as its neutral counterparts dissolved in organic solvent, have homochirality, namely that their four propeller&#8208;shaped trisformyl residues adopt the same rotational conformation. The cage is able to take advantage of hydrophobic effect to accommodate a variety of guest in water. When a chiral guest was recognized, the formation of one enantiomer of the cage becomes more favored relative to the other. As a consequence, the cage could be produced in an enantioselective manner. The tetrahedrons are able to maintain its chirality after removing the chiral guest, probably on account of the cooperative occurrence of intramolecular forces that restrict the intramolecular flipping of phenyl units in the cage framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulations of chiroptical properties in belt&#8208;persistent cycloarylenes via desymmetrization with heteroatom doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A desymmetrization strategy has been devised in the design of molecular cylinders to maximize the dissymmetry factor relevant to circularly polarized light. Although the highest dissymmetry factor of organic molecules was previously achieved with a chiral belt&#8208;persistent cycloarylene having magnetic and electric transition dipole moments in parallel, we noticed that an unbalanced magnitude of two moments was detrimental for higher dissymmetry factors. In this study, a molecular cylinder was desymmetrized by arraying doped and undoped panels via stereoselective cross&#8208;coupling macrocyclization. The desymmetrization succeeded in balancing two moments by reducing the electric transition moment at the global minimum but failed to maximize the dissymmetry factor. Structural studies revealed that the dissymmetry factor is sensitive to subtle structural fluctuations, while the rotatory strength is not affected. This study is important for the development of chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissecting the Flash Chemistry of Electrogenerated Reactive Intermediates by Microdroplet Fusion Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel mass spectrometric method for probing the flash chemistry of electrogenerated reactive intermediates was developed based on rapid collision mixing of electrosprayed microdroplets by using a theta&#8208;glass capillary. The two individual microchannels of the theta&#8208;glass capillary are asymmetrically or symmetrically fabricated with a carbon bipolar electrode to produce intermediates  in situ  . Microdroplets containing the newly formed intermediates collide with those of the invoked reactants at sub&#8208;10 microsecond level, making it a powerful tool for exploring their ultrafast initial transformations. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we present the identification of the key radical cation intermediate in the oxidative dimerization of 8&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline and also the first revealment of previously hidden nitrenium ion involved reaction pathway in the C&#8211;H/N&#8211;H cross&#8208;coupling between N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylaniline and phenothiazine.</dc:description>

         <title>Capture and Separation of SO2 Traces in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks via Pre&#8208;synthetic Pore Environment Tailoring by Methyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a pre&#8208;synthetic pore environment design strategy to achieve stable methyl&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for preferential SO2 binding and thus enhanced low (partial) pressure SO2 adsorption and SO2/CO2 separation. The enhanced sorption performance is for the first time attributed to an optimal pore size by increasing methyl group densities at the benzenedicarboxylate linker in [Ni2(BDC&#8208;X)2DABCO] (BDC&#8208;X = mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate/terephthalate; DABCO = 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane). Monte Carlo simulations and first&#8208;principles density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the key role of methyl groups within the pore surface on the preferential SO2 affinity over the parent MOF. The SO2 separation potential by methyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, simulated breakthrough curves and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Reversible Semicrystalline&#8208;to&#8208;Amorphous State Transitions of Stereoregular Azopolyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control over both the chirality and sequence of a synthetic polymer is critical for manipulating its material performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of a variety of isotactic azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters (azopolyesters) with main&#8208;chain chirality via highly enantioselective resolution copolymerization of  racemic  azobenzene&#8208;containing epoxides with cyclic anhydrides, using an enantiopure binuclear catalyst system. All the prepared polyesters bearing  trans  &#8208;azobenzene moieties were found to be typical semicrystalline materials with melting temperatures in the range of 153 to 231 &#176;C, while the corresponding isotactic  cis  &#8208;azopolyesters were amorphous. The azobenzene groups in the copolymers exhibited reversible  trans  &#8208;to&#8208;  cis  and  cis  &#8208;to&#8208;  trans  photoisomerization, upon irradiation with 365 and 450 nm light, respectively. These observations demonstrate that the crystallinity of isotactic azopolyesters can be manipulated via photoinduced reversible isomerization. In addition, mixing isotactic  trans  &#8208;polyesters with different enantiomeric configurations in a 1:1 mass ratio afforded crystalline stereocomplexes, for which the crystalline behaviors differed significantly from those of the component enantiomer. Also, photoinduced reversible transitions between semicrystalline and amorphous states were observed in various stereocomplexes of isotactic  trans  &#8208;azopolyesters, being similar to the isotactic azopolyesters themselves.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Iron Sulfide Nanoparticle Sizes in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the inherent performance limitations of intercalation&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries, solid&#8208;state conversion batteries are promising systems for future energy storage. A high specific capacity and natural abundancy make iron disulfide (FeS  2  ) a promising cathode active material. In this work, FeS  2  &#160;nanoparticles were prepared solvothermally. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, samples with average particle diameters between 10&#160;nm and 35&#160;nm were synthesized. The electrochemical performance was evaluated in solid&#8208;state cells with a Li&#8209;argyrodite solid electrolyte. While the reduction of FeS  2  &#160;was found to be irreversible in the initial discharge, a stable cycling of the reduced species was observed subsequently. A positive effect of smaller particle dimensions on FeS  2  &#160;utilization was identified, which can be attributed to a higher interfacial contact area and shortened diffusion pathways inside the FeS  2  &#160;particles. These results highlight the general importance of morphological design to exploit the promising theoretical capacity of conversion electrodes in solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ladder&#8208;Type Heteroheptacene&#8208;Based Nonfullerene Acceptors Enabled by Asymmetric&#160;Cores with Enhanced Noncovalent Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noncovalent intramolecular interactions play an important role in the photovoltaic performance of nonfullerene acceptors. Here, three nonfullerene acceptors (MQ3, MQ5 and MQ6) are designed and synthesized by using asymmetric and symmetric ladder&#8208;type heteroheptacene cores which have one and two selenophene heterocycles, respectively. Although MQ3 and MQ5 are constructed with the same number of selenophene heterocycles, the heteroheptacene core of MQ5 is end&#8208;capped with selenophene rings while that of MQ3 is flanked with thiophene rings. With the enhanced noncovalent interaction of O&#183;&#183;&#183;Se in comparison with that of O&#183;&#183;&#183;S, MQ5 shows a bathochromically shifted absorption band and greatly improved carrier transport thereby leading to a higher power conversion ef&#64257;ciency (PCE) of 15.64% in comparison with MQ3 which shows a PCE of 13.51%. Additionally, based on the asymmetric heteroheptacene core, MQ6 shows a further improved carrier transport induced by the reduced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance which could be related with the increased dipole moment in comparison with the nonfullerene acceptors based on symmetric cores. Therefore, MQ6 exhibits an outstanding PCE of 16.39% with a  V  OC  of 0.88 V, a FF of 75.66% and a  J  SC  of 24.62 mA cm  &#8208;2  . These results suggest an important strategy to improve the performance of nonfullerene acceptors by using asymmetric&#160;cores with enhanced noncovalent intramolecular interactions.</dc:description>

The concept is based on the incorporation of  13  C&#8208;labels at specific monosaccharide units, selected within a repeating glycan oligomeric structure. No new chemical tags are added, and thus the chemical entity remains the same, while the presence of the  13  C&#8208;labeled monosaccharide breaks the NMR chemical shift degeneracy that occurs in the non&#8208;labeled compound and allows the unique identification of the different components of the oligomer. The approach is demonstrated by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study dealing with the interaction of a polylactosamine hexasaccharide with five different galectins that display distinct preferences for these entities.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis via Br&#248;nsted Acid Modulated Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;Like Reaction in Carbodicarbene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbodicarbene (CDC), unique carbenic entities bearing two lone pairs of electrons are well&#8208;known for their strong Lewis basicity. We demonstrate herein, upon introducing a weak Br&#248;nsted acid benzyl alcohol (BnOH) as a co&#8208;modulator, CDC is remoulded into a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP)&#8208;like reactivity. DFT calculation and experimental evidence show BnOH loosely interacting with the binding pocket of CDC via H&#8208;bonding and p&#8208;p stacking. Four distinct reactions in nature were deployed to demonstrate the viability of proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept as synergistic FLP/Modulator (CDC/BnOH), demonstrating enhanced catalytic reactivity in cyclotrimerization of isocyanate, polymerization process for  L  &#8208;lactide (LA), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and dehydrosilylation of alcohols. Importantly, the catalytic reactivity of carbodicarbene is uniquely distinct from conventional NHC which relies on only single chemical feature of nucleophilicity. This finding also provides a new spin in diversifying FLP reactivity with co&#8208;modulator or co&#8208;catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Novel Bacterial Chalcone Isomerases by a Sequence&#8211;Structure&#8211;Function&#8211;Evolution Strategy for Enzymatic Synthesis of (S)&#8208;Flavanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcone isomerase (CHI) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in plants. The first bacterial CHI (CHIera) was identified from Eubacterium ramulus, but its distribution, evolutionary source, substrate scope, and stereoselectivity are still unclear. Here, we describe the identification of 66 novel bacterial CHIs from Genbank using a novel Sequence&#8211;Structure&#8211;Function&#8211;Evolution (SSFE) strategy. These novel bacterial CHIs show diversity in substrate specificity towards various hydroxylated and methoxylated chalcones. The mutagenesis of CHIera according to the substrate binding models of these novel bacterial CHIs resulted in several variants with greatly improved activity towards these chalcones. Furthermore, the preparative scale conversion catalyzed by bacterial CHIs has been performed for five chalcones and revealed (S)&#8208;selectivity with up to 96% ee, which provides an alternative biocatalytic route for the synthesis of (S)&#8208;flavanones in high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo Click Reaction of Acylsilanes with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;mediated coupling of acylsilanes with indoles is reported. This photo click reaction occurs under mild conditions (415 nm) mostly in quantitative yield and provides stable silylated N,O&#8208;acetals via light mediated siloxycarbene generation with subsequent indole&#8208;N&#8722;H insertion. We show that this very efficient and fully atom economic coupling process can be applied to conjugate complex systems, as documented by the clicking of carbohydrates with indole alkaloids. The method is also applicable to the conjugation of polymer chains. The linking acetal moiety can be readily cleaved and it is also shown that wavelength&#8208;selective coupling and cleavage with acyl silanes bearing a second photoactive moiety is possible. This is documented by a successful polymerization/depolymerization sequence and by a polymer folding/unfolding process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Water Transport in Two&#8208;Dimensional Channels Enabled by Spherical Polyelectrolyte Brushes with Controllable Flexibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast water transport channels are crucial for water&#8208;related membrane separation processes. However, overcoming the trade&#8208;off between flux and selectivity is still a major challenge. To address this, we constructed spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) structures with a highly hydrophilic polyelectrolyte brush layer, and introduced them into GO laminates, which increased both the flux and the separation factor. At 70 &#176;C, the flux reached 5.23 kg m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  , and the separation factor of butanol/water increased to ~8000, which places it among the most selective separation membranes reported to date. Interestingly, further studies demonstrated that the enhancement of water transport was not only dependent on the hydrophilicity of the polyelectrolyte chains, but also influenced by their flexibility in the solvent. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the structure&#8211;performance correlations between water molecule migration and the flexibility of the ordered polymer chains in the 2D confined space.</dc:description>

Benefiting from the well&#8208;defined {100} facets and an optimal Au/Pd ratio for the surface, the nanocubes bearing a shell made of Au  0.95  Pd  0.05  work as an efficient electrocatalyst toward H  2  O  2  production, with high selectivity of 93&#8211;100% in the low&#8208;overpotential region of 0.4&#8211;0.7 V. When the Au  0.95  Pd  0.05  alloy is confined to a shell of only three atomic layers in thickness, the electrocatalyst is able to maintain its surface structure and elemental composition, endowing continuous and stable production of H  2  O  2  during oxygen reduction at a high rate of 1.62 mol g  (Pd+Au)  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  .

         <title>Electronic&#8208;State Manipulation of Surface Titanium Activates Dephosphorylation Over TiO2 Near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate for the first time that TiO2 with a F&#8208;modified (001) surface can activate p&#8208;NPP dephosphorylation near room temperature. The electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of fluorine imposed on the TiO2(001) surface strongly manipulates the electronic state of surrounding Ti5C atoms by making them very acidic, facilitating not only the bidentate adsorption of p&#8208;NPP but also its subsequent activation.







Abstract
Dephosphorylation that removes a phosphate group from substrates is an important reaction for living organisms and environmental protection. Although CeO2 has been shown to catalyze this reaction, cerium is low in natural abundance and has a narrow global distribution (&gt;90&#8201;% of these reserves are located within six countries). It is thus imperative to find another element/material with high worldwide abundance that can also efficiently extract the phosphate out of agricultural waste for phosphorus recycle. Using para&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate (p&#8208;NPP) as a model compound, we demonstrate that TiO2 with a F&#8208;modified (001) surface can activate p&#8208;NPP dephosphorylation at temperatures as low as 40&#8201;&#176;C. By probe&#8208;assisted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), it was revealed that the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of fluorine makes Ti atoms (the active sites) on the (001) surface very acidic. The bidentate adsorption of p&#8208;NPP on this surface further promotes its subsequent activation with a barrier &#8776;20&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower than that of the pristine (001) and (101) surfaces, allowing the activation of this reaction near room temperature (from &gt;80&#8201;&#176;C).

Although CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been shown to catalyze this reaction, cerium is low in natural abundance and has a narrow global distribution (&amp;gt;90&#8201;% of these reserves are located within six countries). It is thus imperative to find another element/material with high worldwide abundance that can also efficiently extract the phosphate out of agricultural waste for phosphorus recycle. Using &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl phosphate (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-NPP) as a model compound, we demonstrate that TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a F-modified (001) surface can activate &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-NPP dephosphorylation at temperatures as low as 40&#8201;&#176;C. By probe-assisted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), it was revealed that the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine makes Ti atoms (the active sites) on the (001) surface very acidic. The bidentate adsorption of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-NPP on this surface further promotes its subsequent activation with a barrier &#8776;20&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; lower than that of the pristine (001) and (101) surfaces, allowing the activation of this reaction near room temperature (from &amp;gt;80&#8201;&#176;C).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Designer Nanomaterials through Programmable Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles have long been recognized for their unique properties arising from their nanoscale morphology. While these phenomena offer exciting potential applications across optics, electronics, magnetism, and catalysis, these specific functions often require a designed organization of particles. This organizational control includes the type of order as well as placement and orientation of particles of the same or different kinds relative to each other. Although self&#8208;assembly processes can lead to a plethora of structures, the key aspect of rational material fabrication&#8212;designability&#8212;is difficult to achieve. DNA nanotechnology offers the ability to introduce highly addressable bonds, tailor particle interactions, and control the geometry of bindings motifs. Together, these features uniquely position DNA&#8208;based methods to tackle the problem of building fully designed nanomaterials. Here, we discuss how developments in structural DNA nanotechnology have enabled greater control over 1D, 2D, and 3D particle organizations through programmable assembly. This review focuses on how the use of DNA binding between nano&#8208;components and DNA structural motifs has progressively allowed rational formation of prescribed particle organizations. We offer insight into how DNA&#8208;based motifs and elements can be further developed to control particle organizations and how particles and DNA can be integrated into nanoscale building blocks, so called &#8216;material voxels&#8217;, to realize designer nanomaterials with desired functions.</dc:description>

         <title>From Selection to Instruction and Back &#8212; Competing Conformational Selection and Induced Fit Pathways in Abiotic Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two limiting cases of molecular recognition, induced fit (IF) and conformational selection (CS), play a central role in allosteric regulation of natural systems. The IF paradigm states that a substrate &#8220;instructs&#8221; the host to change its shape after complexation, while CS asserts that a guest &#8220;selects&#8221; the optimal fit from an ensemble of preexisting host conformations. With no studies that quantitatively address the interplay of two limiting pathways in abiotic systems, we herein and for the first time describe the way by which twisted capsule&#160;  M  &#8208;  1,&#160;  encompassing two conformers&#160;  M  &#8208;  1  (+) and&#160;  M  &#8208;  1  ( &#8208; ), traps CX  4  &#160;(X = Cl, Br) to give CX  4  &#204;  M  &#8208;  1  (+)  &#160;  and  &#160;  CX  4  &#204;  M  &#8208;  1  ( &#8208; ), with all four states being in thermal equilibrium. With the assistance of 2D EXSY, we found that CBr  4  &#160;would, at its lower concentrations, bind&#160;  M  &#8208;  1&#160;  via&#160;  M  &#8208;  1  (+)&#8594;  M  &#8208;  1  ( &#8208; )&#8594;CBr  4  &#204;  M  &#8208;  1  ( &#8208; ) pathway corresponding to conformational selection. Nudged elastic band (NEB) coupled with density functional theory (DFT) computations revealed the mechanism of&#160;  M  &#8208;  1  ( &#8208; )/  M  &#8208;  1  (+) interconversion from which we deduced that the reduced rate for CX  4  &#204;  M  &#8208;  1  ( &#8208; ) converting  &#160;  into  &#160;  CX  4  &#204;  M  &#8208;  1  (+) resulted from favorable C&#8212;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl/Br&#8212;C host&#8208;guest contacts stabilizing the corresponding ground state. For&#160;  M  &#8208;  1  &#160;complexing CCl  4&#160;  though,  &#160;  we used data from 2D EXSY measurements and 1D NMR lineshape analysis to characterize the dynamics of every elementary step in the four&#8208;state equilibrium. Subsequently, the contribution of IF and CS was determined using flux analysis wherein the mass transport (i.e. flux) through each particular pathway was quantified. Importantly, we found that lower CCl  4  &#160;concentrations would favor CS while the IF pathway prevailed at higher proportions of the guest.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Structure of Bimetallic Coreshell [Au42Cd40(SR)52]2&#8208; Nanocluster and Its Implications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimetallic coreshell nanostructures hold great promise in elucidating the bimetallic synergism. However, it remains a challenge to construct atomically precise core&#8208;shell with high&#8208;valence active metals on the gold surface. In this work, we report the total structure of a [Au42Cd40(SR)52]2&#8208; coreshell nanocluster and multiple implications. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) reveals that the structure possesses a two&#8208;shelled Au6@Au36 core and a closed cadmium shell of Cd40, and the coreshell structure is then protected by 52 thiolate (&#8208;SR) ligands. The composition of the nanocluster is further confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS). A catalytic test for styrene oxidation and a comparison with relevant nanoclusters reveal the surface effect on the catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Synthesis of Vicinal Diamines from Diols through Borrowing Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein an unprecedented diastereoconvergent synthesis of vicinal diamines from diols through an economical, redox&#8208;neutral process. Under cooperative ruthenium and Lewis acid catalysis, readily available anilines and 1,2&#8208;diols (as a mixture of diastereomers) couple to forge two C&#8208;N bonds in an efficient and diastereoselective fashion. By identifying an effective chiral iridium/phosphoric acid co&#8208;catalyzed procedure, the first enantioconvergent double amination of racemic 1,2&#8208;diols has also been achieved, resulting in a practical access to highly valuable enantioenriched vicinal diamines.</dc:description>

Deprotonation of  1  with Na[N(SiMe  3  )  2  ] generates the salt [Na(THF)  2  ][Ph  3  PCHC(O)P(GePh  3  )]  2  which provides subsequent access to the  bis  &#8208;germanylated acylphosphine, Ph  3  PCHC(O)P(GePh  3  )  2  3  . Alternatively, treatment of  1  with HCl in dioxane affords the primary acylphosphine Ph  3  PCHC(O)PH  2  4  . Compound  4  is a rare example of an air stable primary acyl&#8208;phosphines and the first devoid of a stabilizing heteroatom adjacent to the carbonyl fragment.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems Based on AIEgen&#8208;branched Rotaxane Dendrimers for Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at the construction of novel platform for efficient light harvesting, the precise synthesis of a new family of AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers was successful realized from an AIEgen&#8208;functionalized [2]rotaxane through a controllable divergent approach. In the resultant AIE macromolecules, up to twenty&#8208;one AIEgens located at the tails of each branches, thus making them the first successful example of AIEgen&#8208;branched dendrimers. Attributed to the solvent&#8208;induced switching feature of the rotaxane branches, the integrated rotaxane dendrimers displayed interesting dynamic feature upon the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) process. Moreover, novel artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems were further constructed based on these AIEgen&#8208;branched rotaxane dendrimers, which revealed impressive generation&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performances for both photooxidation reaction and aerobic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aiming at the construction of novel platform for efficient light harvesting, the precise synthesis of a new family of AIEgen-branched rotaxane dendrimers was successful realized from an AIEgen-functionalized [2]rotaxane through a controllable divergent approach. In the resultant AIE macromolecules, up to twenty-one AIEgens located at the tails of each branches, thus making them the first successful example of AIEgen-branched dendrimers. Attributed to the solvent-induced switching feature of the rotaxane branches, the integrated rotaxane dendrimers displayed interesting dynamic feature upon the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) process.

         <title>A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II emissive chromium(III) complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of pi&#8208;donating amido with pi&#8208;accepting pyridine coordination units in a tridentate chelate ligand causes a strong nephelauxetic effect in a homoleptic Cr(III) complex, which shifts its luminescence to the NIR&#8208;II spectral range. Previously explored Cr(III) polypyridine complexes typically emit between 727 and 778 nm (in the red to NIR&#8208;I spectral region), and ligand design strategies have so far concentrated on optimizing the ligand field strength. The present work takes a fundamentally different approach and focusses on increasing metal&#8208;ligand bond covalence to shift the ruby&#8208;like 2E emission of Cr(III) to 1067 nm at 77 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrodiolide Diversification Reveals Broad Immunosuppressive Activity That Impairs the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new immunomodulatory agents can impact various areas of medicine. In particular, compounds with the ability to modulate innate immunological pathways hold significant unexplored potential. Here, we report a modular synthetic approach to the macrodiolide natural product (&#8208;)&#8208;vermiculine, an agent previously shown to possess diverse biological effects including cytotoxic and immunosuppressive activity.&#160; The synthesis allows for a very high degree of flexibility in introducing new modifications to the macrocyclic framework including the formation of all possible stereoisomers. In total 18 analogues were prepared. Biological characterization revealed that analogues LH531 and LH519, which both possess very minor structural modifications, had clearly enhanced cancer cell line selectivity and reduced toxicity. Moreover, these compounds possessed broad inhibitory activity against innate immunological pathways in human PBMCs, including the DNA&#8208;sensing cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Initial mechanistic characterization suggests a surprising impairment on the STING&#8208;TBK1 interaction that prompts interesting questions for future studies of the immunosuppressive actions.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroleptic Ligation by an endo&#8208;Functionalized Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A conceptual approach for the synthesis of quasiheteroleptic&#160;complexes with properly endo&#8208;functionalized cages as&#160;ligands is presented. The cage ligand&#160;reported here is of a covalent&#160;organic nature, it has been synthesized via a dynamic combinatorial&#160;chemistry approach, making use of a masked amine.&#160;Inspired by&#160;enzymatic active sites the described system bears one carboxylate&#160;and two imidazole moieties as independent ligating units through&#160;which it is able to coordinate to transition metals. Analysis of the&#160;iron(II) complex in solution and the solid&#8208;state validate the structure&#160;and show that no undesired, but commonly observed dimerization&#160;process takes place. The solid&#8208;state structure shows a five&#8208;coordinate&#160;metal center with the carboxylate bidentately bound to iron, which&#160;makes Fe@2 an unprecedently detailed structural model complex for&#160;this kind of non&#8208;heme iron oxygenases. As, proven by the crystal&#160;structure, sufficient space for other organic ligands is available, the&#160;biologically relevant ligand &#120572; &#8208;ketoglutarate is implemented. We&#160;observe biomimetic reaction behavior towards dioxygen that opens&#160;studies investigating Fe@2 as a functional model complex.</dc:description>
