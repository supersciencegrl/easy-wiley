         <title>Sustaining 500,000 Folding Cycles through Bioinspired Stress Dispersion Design in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing super&#8208;foldable electronic materials and devices presents a significant challenge, as intrinsic conductive materials are unable to achieve numerous true&#8208;folding operations (super&#8208;foldable) due to limitations from short&#8208;range forces of chemical bonds. Consequently, super&#8208;foldable batteries remain unexplored. This work focused on sodium&#8208;ion batteries as a breakthrough point to advance super&#8208;foldable devices. By employing a "2+1" bioinspired strategy, we stepwise designed and assembled super&#8208;foldable components, from substrates to electrodes, and to ultimately device. This bioinspired approach completely disperses folding stress and thus prevents the breakage of chemical bonds, enabling the successful fabrication of the first super&#8208;foldable ion battery. This battery can withstand true&#8208;folding at any angle, in any direction, and for an unprecedented number of cycles&#8212;far outperforming current foldable phones with hinge structures. Remarkably, after 500,000 true&#8208;folding cycles, the battery's microstructure remains intact with no significant degradation of electrochemical performance. Real&#8208;time dynamic folding observations reveal an M&#8208;shaped folding structure within the bioinspired materials, which effectively disperses stress via bulged layers, dispersed arcs, and slidable microgrooves that work together across different directions and dimensions to achieve super&#8208;foldability. Mechanical simulations vividly verify this principle. This work represents a breakthrough in super&#8208;foldable devices, offering valuable insights and promoting practical application for future super&#8208;foldable devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Activation of DNAzyme Nanoassembly for Synergistically Combined Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNAzymes represents a promising toolbox for gene silencing but face challenges related to poor substrate accessibility in specific cells. Herein, a compact DNA nanoassembly, incorporating multimeric therapeutic DNAzyme, was prepared for selective delivery of gene&#8208;silencing DNAzyme with requisite cofactors and auxiliary chemo&#8208;drugs. By virtue of the sequence&#8208;conservative duplex&#8208;specific nuclease, the endogenous miRNA catalyzes the successive and site&#8208;specific cleavage of DNA nanoassembly substrate (nominated as the localized RNA walking machine) and thus ensures the liberation/activation of therapeutic agents with high accuracy and efficacy. The miR&#8208;10b&#8208;stimulated DNAzyme was designed to downregulate the TWIST transcription factor, an upstream promotor of miR&#8208;10b, thus acquiring the self&#8208;sufficient downregulation of TWIST/miR&#8208;10b signaling nodes (self&#8208;adaptive negative feedback loop) for abrogating tumor metastasis and chemo&#8208;resistance issues.</dc:description>

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Mediated Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Efficient Partial Oxidation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct conversion and efficient utilization of methane pose a critical scientific challenge. Indirect activation via reactive oxygen species (ROS) offers a high probability of contact with methane and conversion efficiency under mild conditions. However, reported product yields are suboptimal due to challenges in activating oxygen and facilitating mass transfer in suspension systems. We propose the use of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC), employing polydopamine (PDA) as a catalyst that undergoes electron transfer with oxygen under ultrasound, generating ROS that drives the partial oxidation of methane (POM). Corresponding experimental results indicate that CH3OH and most HCHO are produced directly from CH4. Furthermore, through in situ characterizations, we have shown that light pretreatment of the catalysts in an oxygenated atmosphere facilitates the forming of more C=O functional groups with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, thereby significantly enhancing overall product yields, particularly for CH3OH. Within two hours, product yields reach 1.5 mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1 for HCHO and 0.9 mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1 for CH3OH. This work introduces a novel approach for efficient POM, while highlighting the distinctive catalytic properties of PDA.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatically Dominated Pre&#8208;Organization in&#160;Cyclodextrin Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged entities play a key role in pre&#8208;organizing substrates and stabilizing transition states of reactions in enzymes. The use of electrostatic interactions to pre&#8208;organize ions in nanoconfined pores, however, has not been investigated to its full potential. Herein, we describe how carboxylate anions can be pre&#8208;organized at the behest of their electrostatic interactions with K+ cations in nanoconfined tunnels present in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic frameworks, i.e., CD&#8208;MOFs. Several carboxylate anions, which are all much smaller than the cavities of the tunnels, were visualized by X&#8208;ray crystallography when nanoconfined in CD&#8208;MOFs, despite the large voids present in the tunnels. These anions were found to be aligned within a planar array defined by four K+ cations, positioned around the periphery of the tunnels. The strong electrostatic interactions between the carboxylate anions and the K+ cations dictate the orientation of the anions and override the influence of other possible noncovalent bonding interactions between them and the tunnels. Consequently, the aligned pairs of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin rings constituting the tunnels become distorted, resulting in their lower symmetry and fewer disordered carboxylate anions in the solid&#8208;state. Our findings offer a transformative strategy for controlling the packing and orientation of ions in nanoconfined environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Polysilaketals: High&#8208;Performance Polyether&#8208;Based Electrolytes with Tunable Disubstituted Silane Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolytes exhibit higher energy density and improved safety in lithium&#8208;ion batteries relative to traditionally used liquid electrolytes but are currently limited by their lower electrochemical performance.&#160;Aiming to access polymer electrolytes with competitive electrochemical properties, we developed the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (AROP) of cyclic silaketals to synthesize amorphous silicon&#8208;containing polyether&#8208;based electrolytes with varying substituent bulk of the general formula [OSi(R)2(CH2CH2O)2]n&#160;(R = alkyl, phenyl).&#160;As opposed to previously reported uncontrolled polycondensation routes toward low molecular weight polysilaketals, AROP allows access to targeted molecular weights above the entanglement threshold of the polymers. The polysilaketal with the lowest steric bulk (P(OSiMe,Me&#8208;2EO)) exceeds the conductivity of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), a leading polymer electrolyte. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solid polymer electrolyte to achieve this benchmark. Steric bulk in polysilaketals was found to impart stability and two bulkier polysilaketals, P(OSiEt,Et&#8208;2EO) and P(OSiMe,Ph&#8208;2EO), exhibited higher current fractions than PEO over a wide range of salt loadings. Moreover, the efficacy of P(OSiEt,Et&#8208;2EO) was competitive with that of PEO. Taken together, the tunable and competitive electrochemical properties of polysilaketals validate the&#160;&#160;systematic incorporation of silyl groups as a strategy to access high performance polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Linker&#8208;Mediated Delocalized Excited States in Dimeric Acceptors Enable Efficient Exciton Dissociation with Negligible Energy&#8208;level Offsets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient exciton dissociation at low energy offsets is key to overcoming voltage losses in organic solar cells. In this work, we developed two dimeric acceptors, i&#8208;YT and o&#8208;YT, by precisely controlling the position of an asymmetric electron&#8208;donating linker. It induced the foldamer conformation of i&#8208;YT with a para linkage (relative to the dicyano groups), while retaining the unfold conformation for o&#8208;YT. This subtle structural modification influenced the molecular assembly properties, enabled near&#8208;zero energy offset exciton dissociation and power conversion efficiencies exceeding 18% for i&#8208;YT based organic solar cells. Detailed excitonic dynamics further revealed that the linker position critically influences three processes: the formation of delocalized singlet excited states, ultrafast charge transfer (~5 ps) in solid blends, and the suppression of exciton recombination. Additionally, devices based on i&#8208;YT demonstrated outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining over 85% of their initial efficiency after 1,400 hours of continuous illumination. These findings introduce a new class of dimeric acceptors that combine high efficiency with exceptional stability, offering a promising pathway toward low&#8208;energy&#8208;loss organic photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>An Integrated Module Performs Selective &#8216;Online&#8217; Epoxidation in the Biosynthesis of the Antibiotic Mupirocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important and biosynthetically challenging polyketide antibiotic that requires key assembly steps including epoxidation, tetrahydropyran ring formation and fatty acid esterification. A linear polyketide fragment of mupirocin with six asymmetric centres was synthesized, and it was demonstrated that the mini&#8208;module MmpE is docked to MmpA and performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation using a previously unannotated ACP.







Abstract
The delineation of the complex biosynthesis of the potent antibiotic mupirocin, which consists of a mixture of pseudomonic acids (PAs) isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586, presents significant challenges, and the timing and mechanisms of several key transformations remain elusive. Particularly intriguing are the steps that process the linear backbone from the initial polyketide assembly phase to generate the first cyclic intermediate PA&#8208;B. These include epoxidation as well as incorporation of the tetrahydropyran (THP) ring and fatty acid side chain required for biological activity. Herein, we show that the mini&#8208;module MmpE performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation and is integrated (&#8216;in&#8208;cis&#8217;) into the polyketide synthase via a docking domain. A linear polyketide fragment with six asymmetric centres was synthesised using a convergent approach and used to demonstrate substrate flux via an atypical KS0 and a previously unannotated ACP (MmpE_ACP). MmpE_ACP&#8208;bound synthetic substrates were critical in demonstrating successful epoxidation in vitro by the purified MmpE oxidoreductase domain. Alongside feeding studies, these results confirm the timing as well as chain length dependence of this selective epoxidation. These mechanistic studies pinpoint the location and nature of the polyketide substrate prior to the key formation of the THP ring and esterification that generate PA&#8208;B.

         <title>Cobalt Tetracationic 3,4&#8208;Pyridinoporphyrazine for Direct CO2 to Methanol Conversion Escaping the CO Intermediate Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigate the electrocatalytic properties of tetracationic cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for CO2 reduction in a heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike previous reports on cobalt&#8208;based phthalocyanine electrocatalysis, which suggested CO as an intermediate in the reduction to methanol, our findings indicate that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol, thereby excluding a mechanistic pathway where CO is an intermediate.







Abstract
Molecular catalysts offer a unique opportunity to implement different chemical functionalities to steer the efficiency and selectivity for the CO2 reduction for instance. Metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines are under high scrutiny since their most classic derivatives the tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and parent phthalocyanine (Pc), have been used as the molecular platform to install, hydrogen bonds donors, proton relays, cationic fragments, incorporation in MOFs and COFs, to enhance the catalytic power of these catalysts. Herein, we examine the electrocatalytic properties of the tetramethyl cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for the reduction of CO2 in heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike reported electrocatalysis with cobalt based phthalocyanine where CO was advocated as the two electron and two protons reduced intermediate on the way to the formation of methanol, we found here that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol. Henceforth, ruling out a mechanistic pathway where CO is a reaction intermediate.

         <title>A Targeted Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Activation of the Last&#8208;Resort Antibiotic Colistin Reduces its Renal Cell Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report non&#8208;nephrotoxic trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8722;colistin derivatives which are activated by the tetrazine&#8208;appended, bacteria&#8208;targeting peptide ubiquicidin (29&#8211;41) via a click&#8208;to&#8208;release mechanism. Having reduced charge, the masked analogues are devoid of colistin's renal cell toxicity. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in&#8197;vivo study showed the feasibility of the two&#8208;component antibiotics in targeting an infection site, followed by a chemically triggered drug release.







Abstract
The use of highly potent but very toxic antibiotics such as colistin has become inevitable due to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed for a chemically&#8208;triggered, controlled release of colistin at the infection site to lower its systemic toxicity by harnessing the power of click&#8208;to&#8208;release reactions. Kinetic experiments with nine tetrazines and three dienophiles demonstrated a fast release via an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and the amine&#8208;functionalised tetrazine Tz7. The antibiotic activity of colistin against Escherichia coli was masked by TCO units, but restored upon reaction with d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz, a tetrazine functionalised with the bacterial binding peptide d&#8208;Ubi29&#8211;41. While standard TCO did not improve toxicity against human proximal tubular kidney HK&#8208;2 cells, the installation of an aspartic acid&#8208;modified TCO masking group reduced the overall charge of the peptide and entry to the kidney cells, thereby dramatically lowering its toxicity. The analog Col&#8722;(TCO&#8208;Asp)1 had favourable pharmacokinetic properties in mice and was successfully activated locally in the lung by d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz in an in&#8197;vivo infection model, whereas it remained inactive and non&#8208;harmful without the chemical trigger. This study constitutes the first example of a systemically acting two&#8208;component antibiotic with improved drug tolerability.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by a Fullerene&#8208;Based Hole Transport Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fullerene&#8208;based hole transport material (FHTM) has been designed and synthesized, exhibiting high hole mobility through intramolecular electron transfer. Incorporating FHTM at the NiOx/perovskite interface optimizes the energy level alignment and improves the quality of the perovskite layer. This integration results in an inverted perovskite solar cell with a champion efficiency of 25.58&#8201;% (certified:25.04&#8201;%) and enhanced stability.







Abstract
Designing an efficient modification molecule to mitigate non&#8208;radiative recombination at the NiOx/perovskite interface and improve perovskite quality represents a challenging yet crucial endeavor for achieving high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we synthesized a novel fullerene&#8208;based hole transport molecule, designated as FHTM, by integrating C60 with 12 carbazole&#8208;based moieties, and applied it as a modification molecule at the NiOx/perovskite interface. The in situ self&#8208;doping effect, triggered by electron transfer between carbazole&#8208;based moiety and C60 within the FHTM molecule, along with the extended &#960; conjugated moiety of carbazole groups, significantly enhances FHTM's hole mobility. Coupled with optimized energy level alignment and enhanced interface interactions, the FHTM significantly enhances hole extraction and transport in corresponding devices. Additionally, the introduced FHTM efficiently promotes homogeneous nucleation of perovskite, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films. These combined improvements led to the FHTM&#8208;based PSCs yielding a champion efficiency of 25.58&#8201;% (Certified: 25.04&#8201;%), notably surpassing that of the control device (20.91&#8201;%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated device maintained 93&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This study highlights the potential of functionalized fullerenes as hole transport materials, opening up new avenues for their application in the field of PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;A novel fullerene-based hole transport material (FHTM) has been designed and synthesized, exhibiting high hole mobility through intramolecular electron transfer. Incorporating FHTM at the NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/perovskite interface optimizes the energy level alignment and improves the quality of the perovskite layer. This integration results in an inverted perovskite solar cell with a champion efficiency of 25.58&#8201;% (certified:25.04&#8201;%) and enhanced stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing an efficient modification molecule to mitigate non-radiative recombination at the NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/perovskite interface and improve perovskite quality represents a challenging yet crucial endeavor for achieving high-performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we synthesized a novel fullerene-based hole transport molecule, designated as FHTM, by integrating C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; with 12 carbazole-based moieties, and applied it as a modification molecule at the NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/perovskite interface. The in situ self-doping effect, triggered by electron transfer between carbazole-based moiety and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; within the FHTM molecule, along with the extended &#960; conjugated moiety of carbazole groups, significantly enhances FHTM's hole mobility. Coupled with optimized energy level alignment and enhanced interface interactions, the FHTM significantly enhances hole extraction and transport in corresponding devices. Additionally, the introduced FHTM efficiently promotes homogeneous nucleation of perovskite, resulting in high-quality perovskite films. These combined improvements led to the FHTM-based PSCs yielding a champion efficiency of 25.58&#8201;% (Certified: 25.04&#8201;%), notably surpassing that of the control device (20.91&#8201;%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated device maintained 93&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking under continuous one-sun illumination. This study highlights the potential of functionalized fullerenes as hole transport materials, opening up new avenues for their application in the field of PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polar molecular crystals hold a promise for controlling bulk physical properties originated in&#160;their unique switchable polarity via&#160;structural transformation.&#160;However, the mechanisms for switching polarization are mainly limited to displacive and disorder&#8208;order phase transitions, which rarely&#160;involve the&#160;reconstruction of chemical bonds. Here, we have switched&#160;and tuned electric polarization&#160;in&#160;a bimetallic halide, (Neopentylammonium)4AgBiBr8&#160;(1), as verified by light&#8208;excited pyroelectric effect. Most notably, its Ag&#8208;Br coordination bonds show a zipper&#8208;like dynamic switching behavior from the &#8216;locked&#8217;&#160;to &#8216;unlocked&#8217;&#160;state, namely, reconstruction of chemical bonds.&#160;Coupling with the dynamic ordering of organic cations,&#160;this bond&#8208;switching transition&#160;makes a contribution to switchable polarization of 1. As expected, its polarity&#160;creates pyroelectric effect&#160;for self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection&#160;with&#160;high&#160;sensitivity (3.8&#215;103&#160;&#956;C Gy&#8208;1&#160;cm&#8208;2) and low limit&#160;of detection&#160;(4.8 nGy s&#8208;1). This work on&#160;the bond&#8208;switching mechanism provides an avenue to design&#160;polar molecular&#160;candidate&#160;for smart optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Li2MoO4 tailored Anion&#8208;enhanced&#160;Solvation Sheath Layer Promotes Solution&#8208;phase Mediated Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high overpotential of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) is primarily triggered by sluggish charge transfer kinetics at the reaction interfaces. A typical LiBr redox mediator (RM) catalyst can effectively reduce the battery&#8217;s overpotential. However, it is prone to shuttling and corroding the Li anode, leading to RM loss and reduced energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduced Li2MoO4 into the LiBr&#8208;containing electrolyte to promote the solution&#8208;phase mediated LOBs. This addition tailors the anion&#8208;enhanced Li+ solvation sheath layer and forms a robust anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) on the Li anode. The robust SEI effectively mitigates the corrosion of soluble Br3&#8208;/Br2 and attacks by highly reactive oxygen species. Additionally, the dispersed and high&#8208;density Li2MoO4 exhibits strong adsorption capabilities for O2/LiO2 and Br&#8208;related species during the discharge/charge process, thereby promoting the growth and decomposition of Li2O2 in the solution phase and inhibiting the shuttle effect of Br&#8208;related species in LOBs. Consequently, the LOBs demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (415 cycles) and high energy efficiency (86.2%), paving the way for the sustainable development and practical application of these battery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation Effect&#8208;Determined Mechanisms of Cation Exchange Reactions for Efficient Multicomponent Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cation exchange (CE) reaction is a classical synthesis method for creating complex structures. A lock of study on intrinsic mechanism limits its understanding and practical application. Using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we observed that the evolution from Ru&#8722;Cl to Ru&#8722;O/OH occurs during the CE between K2RuCl6 and CoSn(OH)6 in aqueous solution, while CE between K2PtCl6 and CoSn(OH)6 is inhibited due to the failure of structural evolution from Pt&#8722;Cl to Pt&#8722;O/OH. Theoretical simulations imply that the interaction between Ru&#8722;O and CoSn(OH)6 with Co vacancy (CoVCoSn(OH)6) endows the electron transfer, as a result of strengthened adsorption on CoVCoSn(OH)6. Moreover, this mechanism is validated for CE between K2RuCl6 and ASn(OH)6 (A = Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn), and CE between K2PdCl6/Na3RhCl6/K2IrCl6 and CoSn(OH)6. Impressively, the Pt&#8208;free CoRuSn(OH)x produced via CE displays a mass activity and a power density of 15.0 A mgRu&#8722;1 and 11.6 W mgRu&#8722;1, respectively, for anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) exceeding the values of commercial PtRu/C (11.8 A mgRu+Pt&#8722;1 and 9.0 W mgRu+Pt&#8722;1). This work, for the first time, reveals the intrinsic mechanism of CE as structural evolution of target ion breaking through the traditional classic etch&#8208;adsorption mechanism and will promote fundamental research and practical application in various fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Signature of Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity through Spontaneous Resolution of 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Chiral&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect has emerged as a fascinating phenomenon within the realm of electron&#8217;s spin manipulation, showcasing a unique interplay between electron&#8217;s spin and molecular chirality. Subsequent to its discovery, researchers have been actively involved in exploring the new chiral molecules as effective spin filters. In the realm of observing the CISS effect, the conventional approach has mandated the utilization of two distinct enantiomers of chiral molecules. However, this present study represents a significant advancement by demonstrating the ability to control both spin states of electrons in a single system. In this work, we have demonstrated the preparation of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) via a "spontaneous resolution" process, obviating the requirement for chiral sources. Remarkably, this work signifies the first instance of achieving dual signature of spin selectivity from a single and exclusively achiral system through a spontaneous resolution process. This holds immense potential as it facilitates the production of two distinct spin&#8208;filtering materials from a unified system. In overall, the significant findings achieved using these robust and easily synthesized MOF crystals without the requirement for chiral medium represent a crucial advancement in enhancing the effectiveness of spin filtering materials to produce spintronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Plasma Triggered Co&#8208;O&#8208;Fe Motif in Prussian Blue Analogue for Efficient and Robust Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the context of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the construction of high&#8208;valent transition metal sites to trigger the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is considered crucial for overcoming the performance limitations of traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. However, the dynamic evolution of lattice oxygen during the reaction poses significant challenges for the stability of high&#8208;valent metal sites, particularly in high&#8208;current&#8208;density water&#8208;splitting systems. Here, we have successfully constructed Co&#8208;O&#8208;Fe catalytic active motifs in cobalt&#8208;iron Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) through oxygen plasma bombardment, effectively activating lattice oxygen reactivity while sustaining robust stability. Our spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that the Co&#8208;O&#8208;Fe bridged motifs enable a unique double&#8208;exchange interaction between Co and Fe atoms, promoting the formation of high&#8208;valent Co species as OER active centers while maintaining Fe in a low&#8208;valent state, preventing its dissolution. The resultant catalyst (CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30) requires an overpotential of only 276 mV to achieve 1000 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline exchange membrane electrolyzer using CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30 as anode material achieves a high current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2 at 1.76 V and continuously operates for 250 hours with negligible degradation. This work provides significant insights for activating lattice oxygen redox without compromising structure stability in practical water electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <title>Preserving Molecular Tuning for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer protective layer on top of the organic molecule&#8208;functionalized Cu catalyst layer effectively mitigates the leaching of organic additives on the Cu catalyst surface, and preserves the molecular tuning effect during CO2R. The confined DMAP molecules enhance selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, particularly EtOH, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Modifying catalyst surface with small molecular&#8208;additives presents a promising avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic performance. However, challenges arise in preserving the molecular&#8208;additives and maximizing their tuning effect, particularly at high current densities. Herein, we develop an effective strategy to preserve the molecular&#8208;additives on electrode surface by applying a thin protective layer. Taking 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an example of a molecular&#8208;additive, the hydrophobic protection layer on top of the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu&#8208;catalyst effectively prevents its leaching during CO2 electroreduction (CO2R). Consequently, the confined DMAP molecules substantially promote the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion at low overpotentials. For instance, at a potential as low as &#8722;0.47&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu exhibits over 80&#8201;% selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, while the pristine Cu shows only ~35&#8201;% selectivity for multi&#8208;carbon products. Notably, ethanol appears as the primary product on DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed kinetic analysis, in situ spectroscopies, and theoretical calculations indicate that DMAP&#8208;induced electron accumulations on surface Cu&#8208;sites decrease the reaction energy for C&#8722;C coupling. Additionally, the interactions between DMAP and oxygenated intermediates facilitate the ethanol formation pathway in CO2R. Overall, this study showcases an effective strategy to guide future endeavors involving molecular tuning effects.

         <title>Navigating Ball Mill Specifications for Theory&#8208;to&#8208;Practice Reproducibility in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commonly reported parameters such as time, rpm, and ball mass are often insufficient to replicate mechanochemical syntheses accurately. By demonstrating that reaction outcomes are tied to the cumulative total energy, we can enhance the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across various laboratory mills, including planetary and mixer mills. To aid in this, we offer a free online calculator to compute and report all necessary parameters.







Abstract
The rising prospects of mechanochemically assisted syntheses hold promise for both academia and industry, yet they face challenges in understanding and, therefore, anticipating respective reaction kinetics. Particularly, dependencies based on variations in milling equipment remain little understood and globally overlooked. This study aims to address this issue by identifying critical parameters through kinematic models, facilitating the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across the most prominent mills in laboratory settings, namely planetary and mixer mills. Through a series of selected experiments replicating major classes of organic, organometallic, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, and inorganic reactions from literature, we rationalize the independence of kinematic parameters on reaction kinetics when the accumulated energy criterion is met. As a step forward and to facilitate the practicability of our findings, we provide a freely accessible online tool[&#8224;] that allows the calculation of respective energy parameters for different planetary and mixer mills. Our work advances the current understanding of mechanochemistry and lays the foundation for future rational exploration in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phenolic Nanomaterial with Organelle&#8208;Level Precision Primes Antitumor Immunity via mtDNA&#8208;dependent cGAS&#8208;STING Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we present a strategy of targeting excessive mtDNA damages by the synergistic action of mitochondria&#8208;targeted PDT&#8208;induced oxidative stress and furan&#8208;mediated DNA cross&#8208;linking, which leads to more release of mtDNA fragments and synergies with Mn2+ in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to significantly repolarized M2&#8208;like TAMs to M1 phenotype in a STING&#8208;dependent manner. We envision that our metal&#8208;phenolic nanomaterial offers an attractive tool for initiating robust antitumor immunity at the organelle level.







Abstract
New generation of nanomaterials with organelle&#8208;level precision provide significant promise for targeted attacks on mitochondria, exhibiting remarkable therapeutic potency. Here, we report a novel amphiphilic phenolic polymer (PF) for the mitochondria&#8208;targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT), which can trigger excessive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage by the synergistic action of oxidative stress and furan&#8208;mediated DNA cross&#8208;linking. Moreover, the phenolic units on PF enable further self&#8208;assembly with Mn2+ via metal&#8208;phenolic coordination to form metal&#8208;phenolic nanomaterial (PFM). We focus on the synergistic activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway by Mn2+ and tumor&#8208;derived mtDNA in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), and subsequently repolarizing M2&#8208;like TAMs to M1 phenotype. We highlight that PFM facilitates the cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;dependent immunity at the organelle level for potent antitumor efficacy.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ultrafast Charge Transfer and Air&#8208;Stable Radical Formation in Tetraphenylpyrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the photo&#8208;induced ultrafast charge transfer process in tetraphenylpyrene derivatives and enhanced the air stability of photo&#8208;generated radicals by regulating non&#8208;covalent interactions between molecules. All TPPy, Py&#8208;TTA, and Py&#8208;TTAc demonstrate photo&#8208;induced ultrafast charge transfer processes under solid&#8208;state conditions. While TPPy exhibits limited stability of photo&#8208;induced radicals in the atmosphere, observable on the picosecond scale through femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectroscopy. Py&#8208;TTA shows a slight improvement in radical stability with weak signals observed using EPR technology despite their brief presence in the atmosphere. After irradiation, Py&#8208;TTAc molecules display distinctive EPR signals, with a radical concentration of up to 2.21&#8201;%. Moreover, Py&#8208;TTAc demonstrates excellent reproducibility in generating photo&#8208;induced radicals.







Abstract
Stable organic radicals generated by photo&#8208;excitation hold applications in molecular switching devices and information storage. It remains challenging to develop photo&#8208;generated radical materials with rapid response and air stability in the solid state. Here, we report a structure based on 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetraphenylpyrene derivative (Py&#8208;TTAc) displaying photo&#8208;induced radicals with air stability in the solid state. Photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, exposed to a 365&#8197;nm ultraviolet lamp for 1&#8197;minute, affords radicals in Py&#8208;TTAc powder as confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The maximum radical concentration reaches 2.21&#8201;% after continuous irradiation for 1&#8197;hour and recurs more than 10&#8197;times without any chemical degradation. The mechanistic study according to the femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) and X&#8208;ray technology suggests that the radicals are derived from photo&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) and stabilized through non&#8208;covalent interactions. The photo&#8208;generated stable radical system is employed in anti&#8208;counterfeiting paper and optoelectronic device applications. This study will provide insights into the development of photoactive organic radical materials.

Photo-induced electron transfer, exposed to a 365&#8197;nm ultraviolet lamp for 1&#8197;minute, affords radicals in Py-TTAc powder as confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The maximum radical concentration reaches 2.21&#8201;% after continuous irradiation for 1&#8197;hour and recurs more than 10&#8197;times without any chemical degradation. The mechanistic study according to the femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) and X-ray technology suggests that the radicals are derived from photo-induced symmetry-breaking charge separation (SB-CS) and stabilized through non-covalent interactions. The photo-generated stable radical system is employed in anti-counterfeiting paper and optoelectronic device applications. This study will provide insights into the development of photoactive organic radical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Impact of Supersaturated Electrode on Heterogeneous Lithium Nucleation and Growth Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces new insights into the heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth dynamics that directly influence the performance of lithium metal anodes (LMAs). It reveals that high&#8208;performance electrodes for LMAs, characterized by a high active lithium adsorption capacity and fast surface diffusion kinetics, can be defined as &#8242;supersaturated electrodes.







Abstract
The concept of a lithiophilic electrode proves inadequate in describing carbon&#8208;based electrode materials due to their substantial mismatch in surface energy with lithium metal. However, their notable capacity for lithium chemisorption can increase active lithium concentration required for nucleation and growth, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of lithium metal anodes (LMAs). In this study, we elucidate the effects of the supersaturated electrode which has high active lithium capacity around equilibrium lithium potential on LMAs through an in&#8208;depth electrochemical comparison using two distinct carbon electrode platforms with differing carbon structures but similar two&#8208;dimensional morphologies. In the supersaturated electrode, both the dynamics and thermodynamic states involved in lithium nucleation and growth mechanisms are significantly improved, particularly under continuous current supply conditions. Furthermore, the chemical structures of the solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface layers (SEIs) are greatly influenced by the elevated surface lithium concentration environment, resulting in the formation of more conductive lithium&#8208;rich SEI layers. The improved dynamics and thermodynamics of surface lithium, coupled with the formation of enhanced SEI layers, contribute to higher power capabilities, enhanced Coulombic efficiencies, and improved cycling performances of LMAs. These results provide new insight into understanding the enhancements in heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth kinetics on the supersaturated electrode.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Dependent Diversity of Pt&#8722;O Coordination for Pt1/CeO2 Catalysts Achieved by Oriented Atomic Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via proper preparation methods, oriented atomic deposition of Pt is achieved on different facets of truncated CeO2 octahedrons. Normal impregnation results in Pt location on the predominantly exposed {111} plane on the side, while UV photo&#8208;deposition stabilizes Pt atoms in the &#8220;nano&#8208;pockets&#8221; formed at the top {100} plane. Distinct catalytic performance for CO oxidation is found, where the key is the varied Pt&#8722;O coordination environments on different facets determined by the preparation method.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of CeO2 is dictated by the well&#8208;defined facets, which exert great influence on the supported metal species and the catalytic performance. Here we report Pt1/CeO2 catalysts exhibiting specific structures of Pt&#8722;O coordination on different facets by using adequate preparation methods. The simple impregnation method results in Pt&#8722;O3 coordination on the predominantly exposed {111} facets, while the photo&#8208;deposition method achieves oriented atomic deposition for Pt&#8722;O4 coordination into the &#8220;nano&#8208;pocket&#8221; structure of {100} facets at the top. Compared to the impregnated Pt1/CeO2 catalyst showing normal redox properties and low&#8208;temperature activity for CO oxidation, the photo&#8208;deposited Pt1/CeO2 exhibits uncustomary strong metal&#8208;support interaction and extraordinary high&#8208;temperature stability. The preparation methods dictate the facet&#8208;dependent diversity of Pt&#8722;O coordination, resulting in the further activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. By applying specific preparation routes, our work provides an example of disentangling the effects of support facets and coordination environments for nano&#8208;catalysts.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Alkaline Water: One Atom Makes a Significant Improvement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoactive azobenzene&#8208;bridged 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo) shows an excellent photocatalytic H2O2 production rate up to 1498&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at pH = 11, which is 7.9&#8197;times higher than its corresponding imine&#8208;linked 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA), although only one atom is different in the two 2D COFs (&#8722;N=N&#8722; vs. &#8722;C=N&#8722;). COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo exhibits much narrower band gap, enhanced charge transport, and prompted photoactivity, which is benefited from its azo linkages.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been demonstrated as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, the construction of COFs with new active sites, high photoactivity, and wide&#8208;range light absorption for efficient H2O2 production remains challenging. Herein, we present the synthesis of a novel azobenzene&#8208;bridged 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo) with excellent performance on photocatalytic H2O2 production under alkaline conditions. Notably, although COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo differs by only one atom (&#8722;N=N&#8722; vs. &#8722;C=N&#8722;) from its corresponding imine&#8208;linked counterpart (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA), COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo exhibits a significantly narrower band gap, enhanced charge transport, and prompted photoactivity. Remarkably, when employed as a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo achieves a high photocatalytic H2O2 production rate up to 1498&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at pH = 11, which is 7.9&#8197;times higher than that of COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the &#8722;N=N&#8722; linkages are the active sites for photocatalysis. This work provides new prospects for developing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Thermoelectric Performance in Triplet&#8208;Ground&#8208;State Polymer Intrinsically Boosted by Enhanced Proquinoidal Characteristic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the simultaneous incorporation of strong proquinoidal donor and acceptor units, copolymer PBBT&#8208;TT exhibits a highly stable triplet ground state, an ultra&#8208;narrow band gap, and strong spin interactions between the polymer chain terminals. These unique properties enable PBBT&#8208;TT to achieve a high power factor of up to 26.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 with extraordinary ambient stability, which is currently the best performed doping&#8208;free organic thermoelectric material.







Abstract
Over the past decade, polymer thermoelectric materials featuring flexibility, lightness, and bio&#8208;friendliness have been paid increasing attention as promising candidates for waste heat recovery and energy generation. For a long time, the dominant approach to optimizing the thermoelectric performance of most organic materials is chemical doping, which, however, is not always ideal for practical applications due to its tendency to involve intricate processing procedure and trigger material and device instability. Currently, the pursuit of single&#8208;component neutral thermoelectric materials without exogenous doping presents a compelling alternative. In this work, we designed and synthesized a high&#8208;spin polymer material, PBBT&#8208;TT, by simultaneously employing thieno[3,4&#8208;b]thiophene (TbT) and benzo[1,2&#8208;c&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBT) units with pronounced proquinoidal characteristics, its analogue, PBBT&#8208;T to demonstrate the effect of the TbT unit was also synthesized. The results indicate that because of the enhanced quinoidal resonance, increased spin density and strong intermolecular antiferromagnetic coupling, PBBT&#8208;TT exhibits high intrinsic electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, which showcases an outstanding power factor of 26.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 without doping. This achievement surpasses other neutral organic conjugated polymer and radical conductors, and is even comparable to some typical early&#8208;stage doped polymers. Notably, PBBT&#8208;TT exhibits remarkable ambient stability, retaining its initial thermoelectric performance over a 120&#8208;day period. Our finding demonstrates that modulating the intermolecular spin interactions in open&#8208;shell polymers through the introduction of strong proquinoidal units is an effective strategy for the development of doping&#8208;free, intrinsically high&#8208;performance polymer thermoelectric materials.

The results indicate that because of the enhanced quinoidal resonance, increased spin density and strong intermolecular antiferromagnetic coupling, PBBT-TT exhibits high intrinsic electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, which showcases an outstanding power factor of 26.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; without doping. This achievement surpasses other neutral organic conjugated polymer and radical conductors, and is even comparable to some typical early-stage doped polymers. Notably, PBBT-TT exhibits remarkable ambient stability, retaining its initial thermoelectric performance over a 120-day period. Our finding demonstrates that modulating the intermolecular spin interactions in open-shell polymers through the introduction of strong proquinoidal units is an effective strategy for the development of doping-free, intrinsically high-performance polymer thermoelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Performance Memristors Based on Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Obtained Using a Protonation Modification Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protonation&#8208;modification strategy has been employed to modify imine&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type covalent organic frameworks (COFs), significantly improving the electron delocalization capabilities of the imine bonds and constructing advanced memory devices. The obtained novel COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT@PTSA thin film&#8208;based rewritable memristors exhibit high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105) and unprecedented endurance (more than 1300 number of cycles).







Abstract
Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are garnering substantial interest in resistive random&#8208;access memory, attributed to their superior crystallinity, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and modifiable molecular structures. However, the development of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based memristors impeded by challenges such as low conjugation degree of imine bonds and poor electron delocalization ability. Herein, we report a protonation strategy to modify the imine bonds of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs. This modification significantly enhances the electron delocalization capability of imine bonds, lowers the energy barriers for electron injection from electrodes, and stabilizes the conductive charge transfer state, thus markedly improving device performance. The protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;BPy and COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT thin films&#8208;based memristors show remarkable device performance with a high ON/OFF current ratio of 105, a low driving voltage, and outstanding endurance exceeding 600 and 1300&#8197;cycles, respectively, which is nearly twice the durability of analogous non&#8208;protonated COFs&#8208;based memristors. Notably, the protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT&#8208;based memristor exhibit the highest number of cycles reported at present. This work not only unprecedentedly enhances the performance of COF&#8208;based memristors, but also provides a universal and promising approach for the molecular design and potential application of D&#8208;A type imine&#8208;linked COFs.

         <title>Fused Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Porphyrin Conjugates with Tailorable Excited&#8208;State Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of three novel C&#8722;C bond&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) conjugates is presented. By connecting the aromatic systems of the macrocycles via 5&#8208;membered rings under standard Scholl conditions, the formation of highly soluble and stable &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins is achieved. The described planarization led to significant alterations regarding the photophysical and optoelectronic characteristics of the molecules.







Abstract
A new clear&#8208;cut strategy for fusing N&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;pure systems is introduced en route to a versatile platform of multi&#8208;purpose tetrapyrrolic chromophores. In particular, three novel C&#8722;C bond&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) conjugates were synthesized under oxidative cyclodehydrogenation conditions, starting from tailor&#8208;made nickel porphyrin precursors. The fusion of the individual aromatic systems via 5&#8208;membered rings led to highly soluble &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins in excellent yields. The resulting porphyrin&#8208;HBC conjugates exhibit absorption cross&#8208;sections that are of interdisciplinary interest in the ever&#8208;growing field of organic photovoltaics and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. Quantum chemical calculations show that the newly formed 5&#8208;membered rings induce biradicaloid character in the porphyrin core, which has a strong impact on excited state lifetimes. This is confirmed by a thorough optoelectronic and time&#8208;resolved characterization in order to understand these unique features better. Broadened absorption characteristics go hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with short&#8208;lived excited states with up to six orders of magnitude faster decay rates.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term and Continuous Plasmonic Oligonucleotide Monitoring Enabled by Regeneration Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for long&#8208;term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with 5&#8208;minute temporal resolution by using regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach. A picomolar limit of detection (LoD) in both buffered and serum complexes is achieved, and reliable performance for over 100&#8197;measurements per day and stability over 9&#8197;days were demonstrated.







Abstract
The demand for continuous monitoring of biochemical markers for diagnostic purposes is increasing as it overcomes the limitations of traditional intermittent measurements. This study introduces a method for long&#8208;term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with high temporal resolution. Our method is based on a regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach that ensures rapid reversibility in less than 1&#8197;minute, allowing the sensor to fully reset after each measurement. We investigated label&#8208;free and AuNP enhancements for different dynamic ranges and sensitivities, achieving a limit of detection down to pM levels. We developed a regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach for continuous biosensing, optimizing buffer conditions using the Taguchi method to achieve rapid, consistent reversibility, ensuring reliable performance for long&#8208;term monitoring. We detected oligonucleotides in buffered and complex solutions, including undiluted and unfiltered human serum, for up to 100 sampling cycles in a day. Moreover, we showed the long&#8208;term stability of the sensor for monitoring capabilities in buffered solutions and human serum, with minimal signal value drift and excellent sensor reversibility for up to 9&#8197;days. Our method opens the door to new prospects in continuous biosensing by providing insights beyond intermittent measurements for numerous analytical and diagnostic applications.

         <title>Photoinduced Asymmetric Alkene Aminohetarylation with Chiral Sulfoximine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents that demonstrate high efficacy for asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control.







Abstract
Given the pivotal role of &#946;&#8208;(het)arylethylamine moiety in bioactive molecules, the direct amino(het)arylation of alkenes occupies a privileged position in the construction of (het)arylethylamine derivatives. Herein we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents which exhibit remarkable efficiency in the challenging asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation reaction, particularly in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control. The chiral reagents can be conveniently accessed in gram scale, and efficiently generate N&#8208;centered radicals under mild photochemical conditions. The transformation proceeds through enantioselective 1,4&#8208;hetaryl migration, ensuring precise chirality transfer from sulfur&#8208; to carbon&#8208;centers, rendering wide applicability to both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes. Furthermore, the method is straightforward to operate and does not require transition metals or photosensitizers, making it an attractive and practical option.

         <title>Simultaneous Structural and Electronic Engineering on Bi&#8208; and Rh&#8208;co&#8208;doped SrTiO3 for Promoting Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid (template)&#8208;molten (dopants) reaction was employed to synthesize Bi&#8208; and Rh&#8208;codoped SrTiO3 (SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh) photocatalyst particles. The structure and electronic configuration of SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh were precisely engineered, resulting in the generation of high&#8208;concentration, long&#8208;lived free electrons. When used for photocatalytic H2 evolution, SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh achieved an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 18.9&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, setting a new benchmark among Rh&#8208;doped SrTiO3&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
Activating metal ion&#8208;doped oxides as visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts requires intricate structural and electronic engineering, a task with inherent challenges. In this study, we employed a solid (template)&#8208;molten (dopants) reaction to synthesize Bi&#8208; and Rh&#8208;codoped SrTiO3 (SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh) particles. Our investigation reveals that SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh manifests as single&#8208;crystalline particles in a core (undoped)/shell (doped) structure.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating metal ion-doped oxides as visible-light-responsive photocatalysts requires intricate structural and electronic engineering, a task with inherent challenges. In this study, we employed a solid (template)-molten (dopants) reaction to synthesize Bi- and Rh-codoped SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh) particles. Our investigation reveals that SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh manifests as single-crystalline particles in a core (undoped)/shell (doped) structure. Furthermore, it exhibits a well-stabilized Rh&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; energy state for visible-light response without introducing undesirable trapping states. This precisely engineered structure and electronic configuration promoted the generation of high-concentration and long-lived free electrons, as well as facilitated their transfer to cocatalysts for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. Impressively, SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh achieved an exceptional apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 18.9&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, setting a new benchmark among Rh-doped-based SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; materials. Furthermore, when integrated into an all-solid-state Z-Scheme system with Mo-doped BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and reduced graphene oxide, SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;Bi,Rh enabled water splitting with an AQY of 7.1&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.

         <title>Fabrication of Scalable Covalent Organic Framework Membrane&#8208;based Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large free&#8208;standing PEG&#8208;COF membrane (COM) has been fabricated to serve as a polymer electrolyte for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. By adjusting the lengths of PEG chains within the framework, a satisfactory ion conductivity of 0.153&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C was achieved. Benefiting from the collaborative effect of guest&#8208;promoted transport, the Li|Li, Li|LFP, and pouch cell assemblies with PEG&#8208;COM polymer electrolytes demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance at 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The conventional covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based electrolytes with tailored ionic conducting behaviors are typically fabricated in the powder morphology, requiring further compaction procedures to operate as solid electrolyte tablets, which hinders the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of COF materials. In this study, we present a feasible electrospinning strategy to prepare scalable, self&#8208;supporting COF membranes (COMs) that feature a rigid COF skeleton bonded with flexible, lithiophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, forming an ion conduction network for Li+ transport. The resulting PEG&#8208;COM electrolytes exhibit enhanced dendrite inhibition and high ionic conductivity of 0.153&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The improved Li+ conduction in PEG&#8208;COM electrolytes stems from the loose ion pairing in the structure and the production of higher free Li+ content, as confirmed by solid&#8208;state 7Li NMR experiments. These changes in the local microenvironment of Li+ facilitate its directional movement within the COM pores. Consequently, solid&#8208;state symmetrical Li|Li, Li|LFP, and pouch cells demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy offers a universal approach for constructing scalable COM&#8208;based electrolytes, thereby broadening the practical applications of COFs in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Horizontal Transport in Ti3C2Tx MXene for Highly Efficient Osmotic Energy Conversion from Saline&#8208;Alkali Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene with horizontal ionic transport channels (H&#8208;MXene) to withstand extreme saline&#8208;alkali conditions, significantly outperforms that with vertical ionic transport channels (V&#8208;MXene) in ion selectivity and permeability, achieving a current density over three orders of magnitude higher without significant polarization, an osmotic power density of 9.47&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2, and an exceptional energy conversion efficiency of 45.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Osmotic energy from the ocean has been thoroughly studied, but that from saline&#8208;alkali lakes is constrained by the ion&#8208;exchange membranes due to the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, stemming from the unfavorable structure of nanoconfined channels, pH tolerance, and chemical stability of the membranes. Inspired by the rapid water transport in xylem conduit structures, we propose a horizontal transport MXene (H&#8208;MXene) with ionic sequential transport nanochannels, designed to endure extreme saline&#8208;alkali conditions while enhancing ion selectivity and permeability. The H&#8208;MXene demonstrates superior ion conductivity of 20.67&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M NaCl solution and a diffusion current density of 308&#8197;A&#8201;m&#8722;2 at a 10&#8208;fold salinity gradient of NaCl solution, significantly outperforming the conventional vertical transport MXene (V&#8208;MXene). Both experimental and simulation studies have confirmed that H&#8208;MXene represents a novel approach to circumventing the permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Moreover, it exhibits efficient ion transport capabilities, addressing the gap in saline&#8208;alkali osmotic power generation.

         <title>Silylene&#8208;Copper&#8208;Amide Emitters: From Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Dual Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of emissive N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene Cu(I) amide complexes herald a significant advancement in the domain of linear two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) emitters, characterized by their thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and dual emissive properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report the inaugural instance of N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene (NHSi)&#8208;coordinated copper amide emitters (2&#8211;5). These complexes exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and singlet&#8208;triplet dual emission in anaerobic conditions. The NHSi&#8208;Cu&#8208;diphenylamide (2) complex demonstrates TADF with a very small &#916;EST gap (0.01&#8197;eV), an absolute quantum yield of 11&#8201;%, a radiative rate of 2.55&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, and a short &#964;TADF of 0.45&#8197;&#956;s in the solid state. The dual emissive complexes (3&#8211;5) achieve an absolute quantum yield of up to 20&#8201;% in the solid state with a kISC rate of 1.82&#215;108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and exhibit room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with lifetimes up to 9&#8197;ms. The gradual decrease in the intensity of the triplet state of complex 3 under controlled oxygen exposure demonstrates its potential for future oxygen&#8208;sensing applications. Complexes 2 and 3 have been further utilized to fabricate converted LEDs, paving the way for future OLED production using newly synthesized NHSi&#8208;Cu&#8208;amides.

         <title>Independent LUMO Reactivity in Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Thiones: Synthesis of a Stable Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoionic compounds, with positive and negative charges, are expected to have dual&#8208;site highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, donor) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, acceptor) reactivity. Herein, we report&#160;a novel class of air&#8208;stable mesoionic&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones (mNHTs) synthesized from abnormal&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (aNHCs). DFT studies revealed a highly polarized exocyclic thione moiety and computed Fukui function analysis suggests the dual&#8208;site HOMO/LUMO reactivity of mNHTs predicting donor property at the negatively charged &#8216;S&#8217; center while acceptor property at the cationic imidazole ring.&#160;The independent LUMO reactivity of the mNHT was realized by its chemical reduction to an elusive radical anion, which was characterized by a single crystal X&#8208;diffraction study.&#160;Further, we explore the reactivity of radical anion for the activation of SO2&#160;gas, C&#8208;Br bonds of aryl bromide and photocatalytic functionalization of C&#8208;X (X = F, Br) bonds.&#160;This work unlocks the independent LUMO reactivity of a mesoionic compound.</dc:description>

DFT studies revealed a highly polarized exocyclic thione moiety and computed Fukui function analysis suggests the dual-site HOMO/LUMO reactivity of mNHTs predicting donor property at the negatively charged &#8216;S&#8217; center while acceptor property at the cationic imidazole ring.&#160;The independent LUMO reactivity of the mNHT was realized by its chemical reduction to an elusive radical anion, which was characterized by a single crystal X-diffraction study.&#160;Further, we explore the reactivity of radical anion for the activation of SO2&#160;gas, C-Br bonds of aryl bromide and photocatalytic functionalization of C-X (X = F, Br) bonds.&#160;This work unlocks the independent LUMO reactivity of a mesoionic compound.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxyanions Enhancing Crystallinity of Reconstructed Phase for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalysts were always undergoing continuous amorphization and dissolution of active structure in operating condition, hindering the compatibility between stability and activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we propose the selective adsorption of leached NO3&#8208; to strengthen the crystallinity and activity of surface reconstructed layer with amorphous and crystalline (a&#8208;c) heterojunction. Taking a&#8208;c Ni doped Fe2O(OH)3NO3&#183;H2O (Ni&#8208;FeNH) as a model precatalyst, we uncover that the leached NO3&#8208; are readily adsorbs on the crystalline phase in the formed a&#8208;c Fe(Ni)OOH during OER, lowering the disorder degree and further activating Ni and Fe ion of the crystalline Fe(Ni)OOH on a&#8208;c heterojunctions. Accordingly, Ni&#8208;FeNH deliver a low overpotential of 303 mV and high durability of 500 hours at 500 mA cm&#8208;2 for OER. Particularly, constructing industrial water electrolysis equipment exhibits high stability of 100 hours under a high operating current of 8000 mA.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Polarity&#8208;Induced Regulation of Cation Solvation Sheaths for High&#8208;Voltage Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries with a 1.94 V Discharge Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To address the challenge of low discharge platforms (&lt;1.5 V) in aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries, highly concentrated salts have been explored due to their wide electrochemical window (~3 V). However, these electrolytes mainly prevent hydrogen evolution and dendrite growth at the anode without significantly enhancing voltage performance. Herein we introduce an approach by adjusting solvent polarity to regulate cation solvation sheaths in hybrid electrolytes, reducing Zn/Zn2+ oxidation potential and water activity. Through strong cation&#8208;water coordination and hydrogen bonding between dimethylsulfoxide and water, the designed electrolyte, at a low concentration, achieves a broader electrochemical window (4 V) than conventional concentrated electrolytes. Using this electrolyte, a Zn/Zn battery showed an impressive cycle life of 4340 cycles, while a Zn/lithium manganate battery delivered a high discharge platform of over 1.9 V with exceptional cycling stability. A Zn&#8208;based micro&#8208;battery with a polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;based hybrid electrolyte also achieved a record&#8208;high discharge platform of 1.94 V. This work presents a promising strategy for developing low&#8208;concentration electrolytes for high&#8208;performance sustainable energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;promoted Controlled Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization via Side Chain&#8208;mediated Proton Transfer for the Synthesis of Tertiary Amine&#8208;pendant Polypeptoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton transfer is essential in virtually all biochemical processes, with enzymes facilitating this transfer by optimizing the proximity and orientation of reactants through site&#8208;specific hydrogen bonds. Proton transfer is also crucial in the rate&#8208;determining step for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs), widely used to prepare various peptidomimetic materials. This study utilizes side chain&#8208;assisted strategy to accelerate the rate of chain propagation by using NCAs with tertiary amine pendants. This moiety enables hydrogen bond formation between the incoming NCA and the polymer amino growing end. The tertiary amine side chain of the NCA forms a proton shuttle, via a less constrained transition state, to facilitate the proton transfer process. Moreover, the tertiary amine side chains enable the precipitation of NCA monomers through in situ protonation during the monomer synthesis. This greatly facilitates the synthesis of these unreported monomers, allowing the direct controlled synthesis of tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids. This side chain&#8208;promoted polymerization has rarely been reported. Additionally, the tertiary amine side chains, as widely used functional groups, endow the polymers with unique properties including pH&#8208; and thermo&#8208;responsiveness, tunable pKas, and siRNA transfection capability. The self&#8208;promoted synthesis, facile monomer preparation, and attractive properties make tertiary amine&#8208;pendant polypeptoids promising materials for various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H Amination of N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;heterocycles are privileged structures in both marketed drugs and natural products. On the other hand, C&#8211;H amination reactions furnish unconventional and straightforward approaches for the construction of C&#8211;N bonds. Yet, most of the known methods rely on precious metal catalysts. Herein we report a site&#8208;selective intermolecular C(sp3)&#8211;H amination of N&#8208;heterocycles, catalyzed by inexpensive FeCl2,&#160;which allows the functionalization of a wide range of pharmaceutically relevant cyclic amines. The C&#8211;H amination occurs site&#8208;selectively in &#945;&#8208;position to the nitrogen atom, even when weaker C&#8211;H bonds are present, and furnishes Troc&#8208;protected aminals or amidines. The method employs the N&#8208;heterocycle as limiting reagent and is applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. Its synthetic potential was further illustrated through the derivatization of &#945;&#8208;aminated products and the application to a concise total synthesis of the reported structure for senobtusin. Mechanistic studies allowed to propose a plausible reaction mechanism involving a turnover&#8208;limiting Fe&#8208;nitrene generation followed by fast H atom transfer and radical rebound.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Glycan Presentation in Liquid&#8208;Ordered or &#8208;Disordered Membrane Phases and its Effect on Lectin Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycan&#8208;protein interactions play a key role in various biological processes from fertilization to infections. Many of these interactions take place at the glycocalyx &#8211; a heavily glycosylated layer at the cell surface. Despite its significance, studying the glycocalyx remains challenging due to its complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature. This study introduces a glycocalyx model allowing for the first time to control spatial organization and heterogeneity of the glycan moieties. Glycan&#8208;mimetics with lipid&#8208;moieties that partition into either liquid&#8208;ordered (Lo, lipid rafts) or liquid&#8208;disordered (Ld) phases of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), which serve as simplified cell membrane models micking lipid rafts, are developed. This phase&#8208;specific allocation allows controlled placement of glycan motifs in distinct membrane environments, creating heteromultivalent systems that replicate the natural glycocalyx's complexity. We show that phase localization of glycan mimetics significantly influences recruitment of protein receptors to the membrane. Glycan&#8208;conjugates in the ordered phase demonstrate enhanced lectin binding, supporting the idea that raft&#8208;like domains facilitate stronger receptor interactions. This study provides a platform for systematically investigating spatial and dynamic presentation of glycans in biological systems and presents the first experimental evidence that glycan accumulation in lipid rafts enhances receptor binding affinity, offering deeper insights into the glycocalyx's functional mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Complexes Derived from Non&#8208;classical Diboriranes: Side&#8208;on vs. End&#8208;on Carbonylative Ring Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike cyclopropanes, the analogous B2C species, the diboriranes, tend to adopt non&#8208;classical H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromatic structures with bridging moieties R between the boron atoms. The coordination of the thus generated cyclic 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system to transition metals is completely unexplored. We here report that complexation of non&#8208;classical diboriranes cyclo&#8208;&#956;&#8208;RB2Dur2CPh (R = H, SnMe3; Dur = 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl) to Fe(CO)3 fragments allows for the carbonylative ring expansion of the B2C ring to either four&#8208; or five&#8208;membered rings depending on the nature of the BRB 3&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron bond (3c2e): the H&#8208;bridged diborirane (R = H) initially reacts with Fe2(CO)9 to the allylic &#960;&#8208;complex with an agostic BH/Fe interaction. Subsequent formal hydroboration of CO from excess Fe2(CO)9 results in the side&#8208;on ring expansion to a five&#8208;membered B2C2O ring, coordinated to the Fe(CO)3 moiety. In contrast, in case of the stannyl&#8208;bridged diborirane (R = SnMe3) under the same conditions, CO is added end&#8208;on to the B&#8208;B bond with the carbon terminus formally inserting into the B2Sn 3c2e&#8208;bond.

The coordination of the thus generated cyclic 2e&#8722; &#960;-system to transition metals is completely unexplored. We here report that complexation of non-classical diboriranes cyclo-&#956;-RB2Dur2CPh (R = H, SnMe3; Dur = 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl) to Fe(CO)3 fragments allows for the carbonylative ring expansion of the B2C ring to either four- or five-membered rings depending on the nature of the BRB 3-center-2-electron bond (3c2e): the H-bridged diborirane (R = H) initially reacts with Fe2(CO)9 to the allylic &#960;-complex with an agostic BH/Fe interaction. Subsequent formal hydroboration of CO from excess Fe2(CO)9 results in the side-on ring expansion to a five-membered B2C2O ring, coordinated to the Fe(CO)3 moiety. In contrast, in case of the stannyl-bridged diborirane (R = SnMe3) under the same conditions, CO is added end-on to the B-B bond with the carbon terminus formally inserting into the B2Sn 3c2e-bond. The two carbonylative ring expansion products can also be described as nido and closo clusters, respectively, according to the Wade-Mingos rules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Defined Synthesis Enabled by Fast and Living Anionic Monoaddition of Vinyl Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective monoaddition of polymerizable vinyl monomers like styrenes and methacrylates in a living manner has been achieved for the flash&#8208;flow preparation of molecules in a defined sequence with high selectivity. We demonstrated the sequence&#8208;defined synthesis of multifunctional molecules using an initiator, functionalized styrenes, diarylethylenes, various methacrylates, and an electrophilic trapping reagent at the living terminus (six&#8208;component sequential connection at maximum) without any intermediate purification steps. The anionic living terminus of the vinyl monomers in the flow system described herein is active for polymerization, such that the styrene or methacrylate sequence can be expanded to afford highly dispersed oligomers without affecting other single units, which means that the unequivocal sequences were successfully inserted into the internal or terminal positions. The methodology described herein provides an adaptable method for the construction of new molecular spaces based on unimolecular sequence control and pinpoint functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Electro&#8208;Biosynthesis of Ectoine from Greenhouse Gases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting greenhouse gases into valuable products has become a promising approach for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral economy and sustainable development. However, the conversion efficiency depends on the energy yield of the substrate. In this study, we developed an electro&#8208;biocatalytic&#160;system by integrating electrochemical and microbial processes to upcycle CO2 into a valuable product (ectoine) using renewable energy. This system initiates the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane, an energy&#8208;dense molecule, which then serves as an electrofuel to energize the growth of an engineered methanotrophic cell factory for ectoine biosynthesis. The scalability of this system was demonstrated using an array of ten 25 cm2 electrochemical cells equipped with a high&#8208;performance carbon&#8208;supported isolated copper catalyst. The system consistently generated methane at the cathode under a total partial current of approximately &#8722;37 A (~175 mmolCH4 h&#8211;1) and O2 at the anode under a total partial current of approximately 62 A (~583 mmolO2 h&#8211;1). This output met the requirements of a 3&#8208;L bioreactor, even at maximum CH4 and O2 consumption, resulting in the high&#8208;yield conversion of CO2 to ectoine (1146.9 mg L&#8211;1). This work underscores the potential of electrifying the biosynthesis of valuable products from CO2, providing a sustainable avenue for biomanufacturing and energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Omnidirectional Design of Non&#8208;volatile Solid Additive Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 19.5%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid additives have drawn great attention due to their numerous appealing benefits in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). To date, various strategies have been reported for the selection or design of non&#8208;volatile solid additives. However, the lack of a general design/evaluation principles for developing non&#8208;volatile solid additives often results in individual solid additives offering only one or two efficiency&#8208;boosting attributes. In this work, we propose an integrated omnidirectional strategy for designing non&#8208;volatile solid additives. By validating the method on the 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrene diimide (PyDI) system, a novel non&#8208;volatile solid additive named PyMC5 was designed. PyMC5 is capable of enhancing device performance by establishing synergistic dual charge transfer channels, forming appropriate interactions with active layer materials, reducing non&#8208;radiative voltage loss and optimizing film morphology. Notably, the binary device (PM6:L8&#8208;BO) treated by PyMC5 achieved a PCE over 19.5%, ranking among the highest reported to date. In addition, the integration of PyMC5 mitigated the degradation process of the devices under photo&#8208; and thermal&#8208;stress conditions. This work demonstrates an efficient integrated omnidirectional approach for designing non&#8208;volatile solid additives, offering a promising avenue for further advancements in OSC development.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linking of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons to &#960;&#8208;Extended Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalyst for H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) hold the predominant role either as individual molecules or building blocks in the field of organic semiconductors or nanocarbons. Connecting PAHs via sp2&#8208;carbon bridges to form high&#8208;crystalline p&#8208;extended structures is highly desired not only for enlarging the regimes of two&#8208;dimensional materials but also for achieving exceptional properties/functions. In this work, we developed 5,10&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,9&#8208;diazapyrene as a key monomer, whose two methyl groups at the positions adjacent to nitrogen atoms, can helpfully increase the solubility, and serve as the active connection sites. In the presence of organic acids, this monomer enables smoothly conducting Knoevenagel condensation to form two vinylene&#8208;linked PAH&#8208;cored COFs, which show high&#8208;crystalline honeycomb structures with large surface areas up to 1238 m2 g&#8722;1. Owing to the direct connection mode of PAH building blocks with vinylene, the as&#8208;prepared COFs possess spatially extended p&#8208;conjugation and substantial semiconducting properties. Consequently, their visible&#8208;light photocatalysis with exceptional activity and durability was manifested to generate H2O2 up to 3820 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in pure water, and even 17080 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 using benzyl alcohol as a hole sacrificial agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Derivatization of a Thienobenzobisthiazole&#8208;Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer Through Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Towards High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers based on thienobenzobisthiazole (TBTz) with alkyl, ester, and acyl groups are synthesized by the late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy, where the TBTz&#8208;monomers are efficiently synthesized via the common intermediate. Among them, the ester&#8208;functionalized polymer shows the highest power conversion efficiency in organic photovoltaic cells with a small nonradiative voltage loss and a high charge generation efficiency.







Abstract
Derivatization is essential for optimizing organic material properties. However, because functional groups are often introduced at an early stage of the synthesis, similar intermediates have to be repeatedly synthesized to produce derivatives, which amounts to a daunting and time&#8208;consuming task. Using thienobenzobisthiazole (TBTz) as a building unit of donor polymers for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), we demonstrate an efficient derivatization of a TBTz&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer by late&#8208;stage functionalization. In the developed synthetic route, functional groups are introduced at the last step of monomer synthesis, enabling us to easily synthesize several derivatives from a common intermediate. Ester and acyl groups are introduced into the polymer instead of the alkyl group, giving rise to deep HOMO energy levels and resulting in OPV cells with high open&#8208;circuit voltage even in the absence of halogen substituents that are typically introduced into the donor polymers. Notably, the ester&#8208;functionalized TBTz&#8208;based polymer shows a small nonradiative voltage loss (&#916;Vnr) of 0.19&#8197;V and has one of the highest charge generation efficiencies among the halogen&#8208;free donor polymers with similar &#916;Vnr, improving the critical trade&#8208;off relationship between voltage loss and charge generation. Our results provide an important guideline for the efficient development of high&#8208;performance polymers for OPVs.

         <title>Contrasting Historical and Physical Perspectives in Asymmetric Catalysis: &#9653;&#9653;G&#8800; versus Enantiomeric Excess</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the difference between enantiomeric excess (ee) and relative Gibbs free activation energies (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;) as modeling targets in asymmetric catalysis. Through data analysis and application of modern machine learning methods, we unveil the strengths and limitations of each approach. Our results offer critical insights into which target more accurately predicts enantioselectivity, providing a guide for future research in machine learning for catalysis.







Abstract
With the rise of machine learning (ML), the modeling of chemical systems has reached a new era and has the potential to revolutionize how we understand and predict chemical reactions. Here, we probe the historic dependence on utilizing enantiomeric excess (ee) as a target variable and discuss the benefits of using relative Gibbs free activation energies (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;), grounded firmly in transition&#8208;state theory, emphasizing practical benefits for chemists. This perspective is intended to discuss best practices that enhance modeling efforts especially for chemists with an experimental background in asymmetric catalysis that wish to explore modelling of their data. We outline the enhanced modeling performance using &#916;&#916;G&#8800;, escaping physical limitations, addressing temperature effects, managing non&#8208;linear error propagation, adjusting for data distributions and how to deal with unphysical predictions,in order to streamline modeling for the practical chemist and provide simple guidelines to strong statistical tools. For this endeavor, we gathered ten datasets from the literature covering very different reaction types. We evaluated the datasets using fingerprint&#8208;, descriptor&#8208;, and graph neural network&#8208;based models. Our results highlight the distinction in performance among varying model complexities with respect to the target representation, emphasizing practical benefits for chemists.

         <title>Nonfullerene Acceptors Bearing Spiro&#8208;Substituted Bithiophene Units in Organic Solar Cells: Tuning the Frontier Molecular Orbital Distribution to Reduce Exciton Binding Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is a key parameter for efficient charge&#8208;carrier generation in organic solar cells (OSCs). To tune the electronic structures for reducing Eb, we developed new nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) featuring spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophenes. This NFA showed the separated frontier molecular orbitals, effectively lowering the Eb. Single&#8208;component and bulk&#8208;heterojunction OSCs based on this NFA showed enhanced photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
The development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), represented by ITIC, has contributed to improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Although tuning the electronic structures to reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) is considered to promote photocharge generation, a rational molecular design for NFAs has not been established. In this study, we designed and developed two ITIC&#8208;based NFAs bearing spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophene or biphenyl units (named SpiroT&#8208;DCI and SpiroF&#8208;DCI) to tune the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution of NFAs. While the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of SpiroF&#8208;DCI and ITIC are delocalized in the main &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, the HOMO of SpiroT&#8208;DCI is distributed on the bithiophene unit. Reflecting this difference, SpiroT&#8208;DCI exhibits a smaller Eb than either SpiroF&#8208;DCI or ITIC, and exhibits greater external quantum efficiency in single&#8208;component OSCs. Furthermore, SpiroT&#8208;DCI shows improved PCEs for bulk&#8208;heterojunction OSCs with a donor of PBDB&#8208;T, compared with that of either SpiroT&#8208;DCI or ITIC. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements show that the photo&#8208;induced intermolecular charge separation is effective even in pristine SpiroT&#8208;DCI films. This study highlights the introduction of spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophene units that are effective in tuning the FMOs of ITIC, which is desirable for reducing the Eb and improving the PCE in OSCs.

         <title>Identification of Novel Target DCTPP1 for Colorectal Cancer Therapy with the Natural Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors Regulating Metabolic Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twelve unprecedented terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers and their monomers were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27, which represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. Mechanically, DCTPP1 was a novel potential clinically effective biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.







Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Identification of new effective drug targets for CRC and exploration of bioactive small&#8208;molecules are clinically urgent. The human dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1) is a newly identified pyrophosphatase regulating the cellular nucleotide pool but remains unexplored as potential target for CRC treatment. Here, twelve unprecedented chemical architectures terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers (1&#8211;12) and their monomers (13&#8211;20) were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27. Compounds 1&#8211;12 represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. A series of assays showed that 2 could repress proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest, apoptotic and autophagic CRC cell death in vitro and in vivo. Clinical cancer samples data revealed that DCTPP1 was a novel target associated with poor survival in CRC. DCTPP1 was also identified as a new target protein of 2. Mechanically, compound 2 bound to DCTPP1, inhibited its enzymatic activity, intervened with amino acid metabolic reprogramming, and exerted anti&#8208;CRC activity. Our study demonstrates that DCTPP1 was a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.

         <title>Traceless Nucleophile Strategy for C5&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Sulfonylation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an efficient strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfonylation of pyridines using transient enamine&#8208;type intermediates from N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process utilizes EDA complexes, achieving high selectivity without external photocatalysts. Our method offers late&#8208;stage functionalization capabilities that expand the pyridine modification toolbox and provide access to challenging meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.







Abstract
The functionalization of pyridines is crucial for the rapid construction and derivatization of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Conventional functionalization approaches have primarily focused on the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions, while achieving precise meta&#8208;selective functionalization, particularly at the C5 position in substituted pyridines, remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines. Herein, we present a new strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfonylation of N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts, which employs a transient enamine&#8208;type intermediate generated through a nucleophilic addition to N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process harnesses the power of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, enabling high selectivity and broad applicability, including the construction of complex pyridines bearing valuable sulfonyl functionalities under mild conditions without the need for an external photocatalyst. The remarkable C5 selectivity, combined with the broad applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization, significantly expands the toolbox for pyridine functionalization, unlocking access to previously unattainable meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.

         <dc:description>
We report a convenient multi&#8208;ionic co&#8208;precipitation method to produce layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4). High valent and high entropy are simultaneously enabled in this LDH structure by embedding F&#8722; into individual layers of LDH to deliver both high catalytic efficiency and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are urgently needed to unlock the full potential of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). High&#8208;valence oxides (HVOs) and high entropy oxides (HEOs) are suitable candidates for their optimal electronic structures and stability but suffer from demanding synthesis. Here, a low&#8208;cost fluorine&#8208;lodged high&#8208;valent high&#8208;entropy layered double hydroxide (HV&#8208;HE&#8208;LDH) (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4) is conveniently prepared through multi&#8208;ions co&#8208;precipitation, where F&#8722; are firmly embedded into the individual hydroxide layers. Spectroscopic detections and theoretical simulations reveal high valent metal cations are obtained in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4, which enlarge the energy band overlap between metal 3d and O&#8197;2p, enhancing the electronic conductivity and charge transfer, thus affording high intrinsic OER catalytic activity. More importantly, the strengthened metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8722;O) bonds and stable octahedral geometry (M&#8722;O(F)6) in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4 prevent structural reorganization, rendering long&#8208;term catalytic stability. Furthermore, an efficient three&#8208;phase reaction interface with fast oxygen transportation was constructed, significantly improving the ORR activity. ZABs assembled with FeCoNi2F4(OH)4@HCC (hydrophobic carbon cloth) cathodes deliver a top performance with high round&#8208;trip energy efficiency (61.3&#8201;% at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term stability (efficiency remains at 58.8&#8201;% after 1050 charge&#8211;discharge cycles).

&lt;p&gt;We report a convenient multi-ionic co-precipitation method to produce layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst (FeCoNi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). High valent and high entropy are simultaneously enabled in this LDH structure by embedding F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; into individual layers of LDH to deliver both high catalytic efficiency and long-term stability.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Enabled Copper Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Pyrimidinyl Phosphine with both Axial and P&#8208;Stereogenicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present the first NHC ligand&#8208;enabled Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;P construction to obtain axial and P&#8208;chiral phosphines. The product can undergo a SNAr reaction with many nucleophiles for the rapid synthesis and late&#8208;stage derivatization of drugs.







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines, renowned for their utility as ligands and catalysts, have been instrumental in the field of asymmetric catalysis. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands possessing both axial and phosphine chirality remains a significant challenge. Here, we present the successful demonstration of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;P construction using in situ generated secondary phosphine and heteroaryl chloride. By introducing a chiral NHC ligand and an achiral diphosphine auxiliary ligand, we effectively alleviated the poisoning effect caused by phosphine(III) compounds and suppressed the nonenantioselective background reaction. The reaction exhibited excellent enantioselectivity, with up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee, and good diastereoselectivity, with up to 14&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, when employing less sterically hindered secondary phosphines. This particular substrate poses a significant challenge due to its strong poisoning effect in copper catalysis.

         <title>In Situ Alloying Enabled by Active Liquid Metal Filler for Self&#8208;Healing Composite Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the dual effects of incorporating active LMs into solid&#8208;state composite PEO electrolytes, including providing additional free volume for segmental relaxation to enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity and acting as dynamic chemical traps to realize self&#8208;healing protection against dendritic problems. These combined effects enable Li/LiFePO4 full cells with notable rate performance and cycling stability.







Abstract
Solid inorganics, known for kinetically inhibiting polymer crystallization and enhancing ionic conductivity, have attracted significant attention in solid polymer electrolytes. However, current composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are still facing challenges in Li metal batteries, falling short of inhibiting severe dendritic growth and resulting in very limited cycling life. This study introduces Ga62.5In21.5Sn16 (Galinstan) liquid metal (LM) as an active liquid alternative to conventional passive solid fillers, aiming at realizing self&#8208;healing protection against dendrite problems. Compared to solid inorganics, for example silica, LM droplets could more significantly reduce polymer crystallinity and enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity due to their liquid nature, especially at temperatures below the polymer melting point. More importantly, LMs are unraveled as dynamic chemical traps, which are capable of blocking and consuming lithium dendrites upon contact via in situ alloying during battery operation and further inhibiting dendritic growth due to the lower deposition energy barrier of the formed Li&#8208;LM alloy. As a proof of concept, by strategically designing an asymmetric CPE with the active LM filling, a solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 battery achieves promising full&#8208;cell functionality with notable rate performance and stable cycle life. This active filler&#8208;mediated self&#8208;healing approach could bring new insights into the battery design in versatile solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>Sieving&#8208;type Electric Double Layer with Hydrogen Bond Interlocking to Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol constructs a sieving&#8208;type EDL through strong hydrogen bond interlocking, which can reduce the presence of H2O and SO42&#8722; at the interface to inhibit side effects. It also restricts the diffusion of SO42&#8722;, thereby increasing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Therefore, the electrolyte containing SDE significantly improves electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The stability of aqueous zinc metal batteries is significantly affected by side reactions and dendrite growth on the anode interface, which primarily originate from water and anions. Herein, we introduce a multi H&#8208;bond site additive, 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol (SDE), into an aqueous electrolyte to construct a sieving&#8208;type electric double layer (EDL) by hydrogen bond interlock in order to address these issues. On the one hand, SDE replaces H2O and SO42&#8722; anions that are adsorbed on the zinc anode surface, expelling H2O/SO42&#8722; from the EDL and thereby reducing the content of H2O/SO42&#8722; at the interface. On the other hand, when Zn2+ are de&#8208;solvated at the interface during the plating, the strong hydrogen bond interaction between SDE and H2O/SO42&#8722; can trap H2O/SO42&#8722; from the EDL, further decreasing their content at the interface. This effectively sieves them out of the zinc anode interface and inhibits the side reactions. Moreover, the unique characteristics of trapped SO42&#8722; anions can restrict their diffusion, thereby enhancing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Consequently, utilizing an SDE/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables excellent cycling stability in Zn//Zn symmetrical cells and Zn//MnO2 full cells with lifespans exceeding 3500&#8197;h and 2500&#8197;cycles respectively.

         <title>Regulating Nucleic Acid Catalysis Using Active Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we use active, fuel&#8208;dependent complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles and spatiotemporally control the catalytic activity of the 17E DNAzyme. Partitioning the biocatalyst into the peptide&#8208;RNA droplets results in unfolding and activity loss. The catalytic activity is recovered after droplets transiently dissolve when fuel is used up, mimicking they dynamic regulation of biocatalytic pathways in membraneless organelles.







Abstract
Cells use transient membraneless organelles to regulate biological reaction networks. For example, stress granules selectively store mRNA to downregulate protein expression in response to heat or oxidative stress. Models mimicking this active behavior should be established to better understand in vivo regulation involving compartmentalization. Here we use active, complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles to spatiotemporally control the activity of a catalytic DNA (DNAzyme). Upon partitioning into these peptide&#8208;RNA droplets, the DNAzyme unfolds and loses its ability to catalyze the cleavage of a nucleic acid strand. We can transiently pause the DNAzyme activity upon inducing droplet formation with fuel. After fuel consumption, the DNAzyme activity autonomously restarts. We envision this system could be used to up and downregulate multiple reactions in a network, helping understand the complexity of a cell&#8216;s pathways. By creating a network where the DNAzyme could reciprocally regulate the droplet properties, we would have a powerful tool for engineering synthetic cells.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells use transient membraneless organelles to regulate biological reaction networks. For example, stress granules selectively store mRNA to downregulate protein expression in response to heat or oxidative stress. Models mimicking this active behavior should be established to better understand in vivo regulation involving compartmentalization. Here we use active, complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles to spatiotemporally control the activity of a catalytic DNA (DNAzyme). Upon partitioning into these peptide-RNA droplets, the DNAzyme unfolds and loses its ability to catalyze the cleavage of a nucleic acid strand. We can transiently pause the DNAzyme activity upon inducing droplet formation with fuel. After fuel consumption, the DNAzyme activity autonomously restarts. We envision this system could be used to up and downregulate multiple reactions in a network, helping understand the complexity of a cell&#8216;s pathways. By creating a network where the DNAzyme could reciprocally regulate the droplet properties, we would have a powerful tool for engineering synthetic cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxyanion Engineering on RuO2 for Efficient Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion modification strategy has been developed to improve the acidic OER performance of RuO2 by MoO3&#8208;stabilized sulfate anion, which exhibits the exceptional OER activity and stability in both acidic electrolyte and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.







Abstract
In acidic proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts rely heavily on the expensive and scarce iridium&#8208;based materials. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) with lower price and higher OER activity, has been explored for the similar task, but has been restricted by the poor stability. Herein, we developed an anion modification strategy to improve the OER performance of RuO2 in acidic media. The designed multicomponent catalyst based on sulfate anchored on RuO2/MoO3 displays a low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stably operates for 500&#8197;hours with a very low degradation rate of 20&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 in acidic electrolyte. When assembled in a PEMWE cell, this catalyst as an anode shows an excellent stability at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 150&#8197;h. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that MoO3 could stabilize sulfate anion on RuO2 surface to suppress its leaching during OER. Such MoO3&#8208;anchored sulfate not only reduces the formation energy of *OOH intermediate on RuO2, but also impedes both the surface Ru and lattice oxygen loss, thereby achieving the high OER activity and exceptional durability.

         <title>Higher Affinity Enables More Accurate Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in Human Saliva Using Aptamer&#8208;Based Litmus Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created an Aptamer&#8208;based and Urease&#8208;mediated Litmus Test (AUT) to systematically evaluate the analytical performance of biosensors constructed with aptamers possessing varying binding affinities. The outcomes underscore the substantial impact of high binding affinity aptamers in enhancing clinical detection sensitivity. These findings emphasize the importance of developing aptamers with exceptionally high affinity to enable precise detection of viral infections in the face of future pandemics.







Abstract
Many aptamers have been generated by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to recognize spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&amp;ek), some of which have been engineered into dimeric and trimeric versions for enhanced affinity for diagnostic applications. However, no studies have been conducted to compare the utilities of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric aptamers in diagnostic assays with real clinical samples to answer the question of what levels of affinity an aptamer must have for accurate clinical diagnostics. Herein, we carried out a comparative study with two monomeric aptamers MSA1 and MSA5, one dimeric aptamer and two homotrimeric aptamers constructed with MSA1 and MSA5, with affinity varying by 1000&#8208;fold. Using a colorimetric sandwich assay to analyze 48 human saliva samples, we found that the trimeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;10&#8197;pM) can identify the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection much more accurately than the dimeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;100&#8197;pM) and monomeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;10,000&#8197;pM). Based on the experimental data, we theoretically predict the levels of affinity an aptamer needs to possess to achieve 80&#8211;100&#8201;% sensitivity and 100&#8201;% specificity. The findings from this study highlight the need for deriving very high affinity aptamers to enable highly accurate detection of viral infection for future pandemics.

         <title>General and Modular Synthesis of Covalent Organic Cages for Efficient Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and modular synthetic strategy for covalent organic cages is reported. These cage receptors possess customized skeletons and sizes, diverse 3D structures, and excellent host&#8208;guest recognition for neutral aromatic diimides.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;type structures based on coordination and dynamic covalent chemistry have the characteristics of facile and efficient preparation but poor stability. Chemically stable organic cages, generally involving fragment coupling and multi&#8208;step reactions, are relatively difficult to synthesize. Herein, we offer a general and modular strategy to customize covalent organic cages with diverse skeletons and sizes. First, one skeleton (S) module with three extension (E) modules and three reaction (R) modules are connected by one&#8208; or two&#8208;step coupling to get the triangular monomer bearing three reaction sites. Then one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts condensation of the monomer and linking module of paraformaldehyde produces the designed organic cages. The cage forming could be regulated by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. The S&#8722;E&#8722;R angles in the monomer is crucial; only 120&#176; (2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) or 60&#176; (2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) angle between S&#8722;E&#8722;R successfully affords the resulting cages. By the rational design of the three modules, a series of organic cages have been constructed. In addition, the host&#8208;guest properties show that the representative cages could strongly encapsulate neutral aromatic diimide guests driven by solvophobic interactions in polar solvents, giving the highest association constant of (2.58&#177;0.18)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1.

         <title>Arginine Accelerates Sulfur Fluoride Exchange and Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange Reactions between Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing an arginine (Arg) residue adjacent to the latent bioreactive unnatural amino acid (Uaa) significantly accelerates both SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This offers a general and biocompatible strategy to harness these robust click chemistries for fundamental and applied biological research, applicable in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) and phosphorus fluoride exchange (PFEx) click chemistries are advancing research across multiple disciplines. By genetically incorporating latent bioreactive unnatural amino acids (Uaas), these chemistries have been integrated into proteins, enabling precise covalent linkages with biological macromolecules and paving the way for new applications. However, their suboptimal reaction rates in proteins limit effectiveness, and traditional catalytic methods for small molecules are often incompatible with biological systems or in vivo applications. We demonstrated that introducing an arginine adjacent to the latent bioreactive Uaa significantly boosts SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This method is effective across various Uaas, target residues, and protein environments. Notably, it also enables efficient SuFEx reactions in acidic conditions, common in certain cellular compartments and tumor microenvironments, which typically hinder SuFEx reactions. Furthermore, we developed the first covalent cell engager that substantially enhances natural killer cell activation through improved covalent interaction facilitated by arginine. These findings provide mechanistic insights and offer a biocompatible strategy to harness these robust chemistries for advancing biological research and developing new biotherapeutics.

         <title>A Fluorinated Imide&#8208;Functionalized Arene Enabling a Wide Bandgap Polymer Donor for Record&#8208;Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new electron&#8208;deficient arene, fluorinated bithiophene imide (F&#8208;BTI) and its polymer donor SA1, in which two fluorine atoms were introduced at the &#946;&#8208;positions in the thiophene rings of BTI to fine&#8208;tune the energy levels and aggregation of the resulting polymers. The SA1&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs achieved a record efficiency of 19.33&#8201;% (certified PCE: 19.17&#8201;%). These results highlight that F&#8208;BTI is a promising unit for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer donors for all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) present compelling advantages for commercial applications, including mechanical durability and optical and thermal stability. However, progress in developing high&#8208;performance polymer donors has trailed behind the emergence of excellent polymer acceptors.

Thus, SA1&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs exhibit an efficiency of 16.31&#8201;% with excellent stability, which is further enhanced to a record value of 19.33&#8201;% (certified: 19.17&#8201;%) by constructing ternary device. This work demonstrates that F&#8208;BTI offers an effective route for developing new polymer materials with improved optoelectronic properties, and the emergence of F&#8208;BTI will change the scenario in terms of developing polymer donor for high&#8208;performance and stable all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Diaminonaphthalene Boronic Acid (DANBA): New Approach for Peroxynitrite Sensing Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaminonaphthalene (DAN)&#8208;protected boronic acid (DANBA) proved to be a universal and highly selective recognition group for ONOO&#8722; over H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species, overcoming the long&#8208;standing issues of aryl&#8208;boronic acid&#8208;based probes. DANBA can be combined with diverse hydroxyl&#8208;containing fluorophores to obtain ONOO&#8722; sensing probes with different spectral emissions. A DANBA and malononitrile fluorophore&#8208;based probe detected subtle changes in the ONOO&#8722; levels of mouse brains with Parkinson's disease.







Abstract
Selective detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is vital for studying their role in brain diseases. Fluorescence probes can distinguish ONOO&#8722; species from other ROS; however, their selectivity toward ONOO&#8722; species depends on the ONOO&#8722; recognition group. Aryl&#8208;boronic acids and esters, which are common ONOO&#8722; recognition groups, are not selective for ONOO&#8722; over H2O2. In this study, we developed a diaminonaphthalene (DAN)&#8208;protected boronic acid as a new ONOO&#8722; recognition group that selectively reacts with ONOO&#8722; over H2O2 and other ROS. Three DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid (DANBA)&#8208;based fluorophores that emit fluorescence over visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions, Cou&#8208;BN, BVP&#8208;BN, and HDM&#8208;BN, and their aryl&#8208;boronic acid&#8208;based counterparts (Cou&#8208;BO, BVP&#8208;BO, and HDM&#8208;BO), were developed. The DANBA&#8208;based probes exhibited enhanced selectivity toward ONOO&#8722; over that of their control group, as well as universality in solution assays and in vitro experiments with PC12 cells. The NIR&#8208;emissive HDM&#8208;BN was optimized to delineate in vivo ONOO&#8722; levels in mouse brains with Parkinson's disease. This DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid belongs to a new generation of recognition groups for developing ONOO&#8722; probes, and this strategy could be extended to other common hydroxyl&#8208;containing dyes to detect ONOO&#8722; levels in complex biological systems and processes.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Drive Tandem Electrocatalytic CO2 to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 catalysts with Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2 for the electroreduction of CO2, which exhibited excellent FEC2+ and FEEtOH. The coordinated tandem action of the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites enhanced the adsorption of the *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization, while stabilizing the crucial intermediate *CH2CHO, leading to improved selectivity towards C2+ and EtOH.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals is a promising route for renowable energy storage and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emission, and production of multicarbon (C2+) products is highly desired. Here, we report a 1.4&#8201;%Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 comprising of dispersive CuOx and PdO dual nanoclusters embedded in the MOF CuPz2 (Pz=Pyrazole), which achieves a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FEC2+) of 81.9&#8201;% and C2+ alcohol FE of 47.5&#8201;% with remarkable stability when using 0.1&#8197;M KCl aqueous solution as electrolyte in a typical H&#8208;cell. Particularly, the FE of alcohol is obviously improved on 1.4&#8201;%Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 compared to Cu@CuPz2. Theoretical calculations have revealed that the enhanced interfacial electron transfer facilitates the adsorption of *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization on the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2. Additionally, the oxophilicity of Pd can stabilize the key intermediate *CH2CHO and promote subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer more efficiently, confirming that the formation pathway is skew towards *C2H5OH. Consequently, the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites play a synergistic tandem role in cooperatively improving the selectivity of alcohol and accelerating reductive conversion of CO2 to C2+.

         <title>Water&#8208;Vapor Responsive Metallo&#8208;Peptide Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, morphologies, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polyimide film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.







Abstract
Short peptides are versatile molecules for the construction of supramolecular materials. Most reported peptide materials are hydrophobic, stiff, and show limited response to environmental conditions in the solid&#8208;state. Herein, we describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). We tested a series of histidine (H) containing dipeptides with varying hydrophobicity, XH, where X is G, A, L, Y (glycine, alanine, leucine, and tyrosine). The one&#8208;dimensional fiber formation is supported by metal coordination and dynamic H&#8208;bonds. Solvent conditions were identified where GH/Zn and AH/Zn formed gels that upon air&#8208;drying gave rise to nanofibers. Upon exposure of the nanofiber networks to increasing RH, a reduction in stiffness was observed with GH/Zn fibers reversibly (dis&#8208;)assembled at 60&#8211;70&#8201;% RH driven by a rebalancing of hydrogen bonding interactions between peptides and water. When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polymer film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.

         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry has brought a revolution in our ability to interrogate and manipulate biological systems. However, the toolbox of bioorthogonal reactions is yet very limited. The field of photocatalysis offers a promising avenue for developing new type of mild and biocompatible chemical reactions, and thereby expanding the repertoire of bioorthogonal tools. This minireview summarizes recent advances in bioorthogonal photocatalytic technologies, with a particular focus on their potential for the selective generation of designed products within biorelevant or living settings.







Abstract
The field of bioorthogonal chemistry has revolutionized our ability to interrogate and manipulate biological systems at the molecular level. However, the range of chemical reactions that can operate efficiently in biological environments without interfering with the native cellular machinery, remains limited. In this context, the rapidly growing area of photocatalysis offers a promising avenue for developing new type of bioorthogonal tools. The inherent mildness, tunability, chemoselectivity, and external controllability of photocatalytic transformations make them particularly well&#8208;suited for applications in biological and living systems. This minireview summarizes recent advances in bioorthogonal photocatalytic technologies, with a particular focus on their potential to enable the selective generation of designed products within biologically relevant or living settings.

         <title>Unconventional Luminescence Polymer with Color&#8208;Tunability based on Solvent&#8208;Induced Electrostatic Potential Distribution of Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The red delayed fluorescence polymer incorporating tetracoordinate boron were developed to study the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior. Modulating the emission wavelength of polymer depends on the solvent's electronic effects, which induce the equilibrium of the electrostatic potential distribution of fluorophore, as well as the strong intramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Tuning full&#8208;color emission of polymers holds significant promise. However, preparing unconventional luminescence polymers with color&#8208;tunability in dilute solution and understanding the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior remains a great challenge. We report two emitters (P1 and P2) incorporating tetracoordinate boron. The P1 with non&#8208;conjugated D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure, exhibited red delayed fluorescence at 645&#8197;nm with quantum yield of 9.15&#8201;% in aggregates. Notably, the emission wavelength of P1 can be tuned from 418 to 588&#8197;nm at different solvent. Similarly, the emission wavelength of P2 can also be adjusted by manipulating the interactions between the solvent and fluorophore. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the B&#8592;N bond and electronic interactions between solvent and fluorophore significantly regulate the equilibrium the electrostatic potential (ESP) and the intramolecular O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions of P1, thereby modulating its emission wavelength. Additionally, these polymers showed excellent potential in fluoride ions detection. This work provides new insights into the complex effects of intermolecular interactions on luminescent properties.

         <title>Benzylic C&#8211;H Radical Sulfation by Persulfates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfation is a highly valuable pathological and physiological process, yet it is often underappreciated considering the rather difficult accessibility of organosulfates. O&#8208;sulfonation (O&#8211;SO3), a conventional and still common way to make organosulfates, restricts its applicability to hydroxyl compounds and therein lies a major challenge of library construction. Here, we describe a benzylic C&#8211;H radical sulfation with persulfates via C&#8211;O bond formation. This strategy leverages modular control over the reactivity of persulfates and the stability of sulfate radicals by coutercations. K+/NH4+ stabilized sulfate radicals act as the oxidant to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals from substrates, and activation of persulfates by NBu4+ provides O&#8211;O resource pool to facilitate C&#8211;OSO3&#8208; bond formation via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (SH2) process.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Construction of 2,6&#8208;Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octanes by Harnessing the Potential of an&#160;3&#8208;Oxindolium Ion Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to its structural complexity and intrinsic sensitivity of bridged aminal junction, 2,6&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (2,6&#8208;DABCO) has remained a highly desirable target in synthetic chemistry. However, the asymmetric access to this unit is still insufficient and hampered by the need for meticulously created functionalities for intricate double aza&#8208;cyclizations. Herein, we have developed a novel enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective protocol to access polycyclic chiral 2,6&#8208;DABCOs under metal&#8208;free conditions. This domino process involves the amine&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation between glutaraldehyde and 2&#8208;arylindol&#8208;3&#8208;ones, followed by an acid&#8208;mediated Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction/intramolecular aza&#8208;cyclization cascade sequence with tryptamine by trapping of in situ generated 3&#8208;oxindolium ion intermediate for the first time. Overall, 2,6&#8208;DABCOs fused with medicinally relevant scaffolds were isolated with good yield and excellent stereoselectivity by constructing five new bonds and four stereocenters in a one&#8208;pot operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Controlled DNA Frameworks for Sensitive Detection and Specific Isolation of Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;affinity, specific, and sensitive probes are crucial for the specific recognition and identification of tumor cells from complex matrices. Multivalent binding is a powerful strategy, but the irrational spatial distribution of the functional moieties may reduce the probe performance. Here, we constructed a Janus DNA triangular prism nanostructure (3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3) for sensitive detection and specific isolation of tumor cells. Benefiting from spatial features of the triangular prism, the fluorescence intensity induced by 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 was almost 4 times that of the monovalent structure. Moreover, the DNA triangular prisms were connected to form hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand multivalent DNA triangular prism structures (Zy1&#8208;MTP), in which the fluorescence intensity and affinity were increased to 9&#8208;fold and 10&#8208;fold of 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3, respectively. Furthermore, 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 and Zy1&#8208;MTP were combined with magnetic beads, and the latter showed higher capture efficiency (&gt; 90%) in whole blood. This work provides a new strategy for the efficient capture of rare cells in complex biological samples.</dc:description>

         <title>A Covalent Triazine Framework for Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalysts, performing selective organic transformations, are increasing the applicability of photocatalytic reactions due to their ability to merge traditional photocatalysis with structured pores densely decorated with catalytic moiety for efficient mass and charge transfer, as well as added recyclability. We herein disclose a porous crystalline covalent triazine framework (CTF)&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalyst that exhibits excellent photoredox properties for different hydrofunctionalization reactions such as hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination and hydroazidations. The high oxidizing property of this CTF enables the activation of styrenes, followed by regioselective C&#8208;N and C&#8208;O bond formation at ambient conditions. A change in the physicochemical and optoelectronic properties of the CTF, upon protonation during catalysis, lies at the basis of its photocatalytic properties. This allows us to obtain hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination, and hydroazidations from a myriad of electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic approach is further extended to late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active molecules. Finally, detailed characterizations of the CTF and further mechanistic investigations provides mechanistic insights in these reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>n&#8208;Type conjugated polymers featuring low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are essential for achieving high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). However, the synthesis of acceptors with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics presents a significant challenge. Herein, a peripheral functionalization strategy is employed on the widely used tricyclic framework anthracene by introducing dual N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2/B(CN)2 groups to enhance its electron&#8208;withdrawing capability. This approach successfully navigates synthetic challenges, leading to the development of two novel acceptor building blocks: DBNF and DBNCN. Compared to the counterparts with a single N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2/B(CN)2 moiety, DBNF and DBNCN exhibit an extended &#960;&#8208;backbone, enhanced molecular packing, and improved electron&#8208;withdrawing properties. Utilizing these innovative acceptor monomers, copolymers, PDBNF and PDBNCN, are synthesized, which exhibit considerably suppressed LUMO &#8776; &#8211;4.0 eV. The deep LUMO of PDBNF together with its favourable bimodal packing orientation leads to remarkable electron mobility of 3.04 cm&#178; V&#8315;&#185; s&#8315;&#185; with improved stability in OTFTs. Importantly, efficient n&#8208;doping in OTEs is achieved with PDBNCN, exhibiting exceptional conductivity of 95.5 S cm&#8315;&#185; and a maximum power factor of 147.8 &#956;W m&#8315;&#185; K&#8315;&#178;&#8212;among the highest reported for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy Dissipation and Toughening of Covalent Networks via a Sacrificial Conformation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent polymer networks find wide utility in diverse engineering applications owing to their desirable stiffness and resilience. However, the rigid covalent chemical structure between crosslinking points imposes limitations on enhancing their toughness. Although the incorporation of sacrificial chemical bonds has shown promise in improving toughness through energy dissipation, composite networks struggle to maintain both rapid recovery and stiffness. Consequently, a significant challenge persists in achieving a covalent network that combines high strength, stiffness, toughness, and fast recovery performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel sacrificial structure termed "sacrificial conformation." In this approach, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin is covalently embedded into the network skeleton as the sacrificial conformation element.&#160; Compared to traditional covalent networks (LCN), well&#8208;designed cyclodextrin&#8208;embedded covalent network (CCN) exhibit a 100&#8208;fold increase in Young's modulus and a 60&#8208;fold increase in toughness. Importantly, CCN maintains excellent elasticity, ensuring swift recovery after deformation. This sacrificial conformational strategy enables efficient energy dissipation without necessitating the rupture of chemical bonds, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional approaches. This advancement holds great promise for the design and fabrication of advanced elastomers and hydrogels with superior mechanical properties and dynamic behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Circular Multivalent Nanobody&#8208;Targeting Chimeras (mNbTACs) for Multireceptor&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multispecific therapeutics hold significant promise in drug delivery, protein degradation, and cell recruitment to address clinical issues of tumor heterogeneity, resistance, and immune evasion. However, their modular engineering remains challenging. We developed a targeted degradation platform, termed multivalent nanobody&#8208;targeting chimeras (mNbTACs), by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. The homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208; mNbTACs specifically recognized membrane targets in a multivalent manner and simultaneously recruited scavenger receptors to favor clathrin&#8208;/caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of multiple proteins with high efficiency and selectivity. We demonstrated that a bispecific doxorubicin&#8208;loaded mNbTAC, named&#160;Doxo&#8208;mvNbsPPH, passively accumulated at tumor sites, specifically interacted with PD&#8208;L1&#160;and HER2&#160;targets, and was rapidly transported into lysosome, inducing potent immunogenic cell death and alleviating immune checkpoint evasion. The synergistic boosting of innate and adaptive immunity promoted the infiltration and proliferation of CD8+&#160;T cells in tumor microenvironment (an 11&#8208;fold increase) with high toxicity and low exhaustion, eventually enhancing antitumor efficacy. Our mNbTAC platform provides multispecific therapeutics with variable valences and programmed species, whereas it induces targeted protein degradation through multireceptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation without the need for lysosome&#8208;targeting receptors, representing a general and modular tool to harness extracellular proteome for disease treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient transition from stable to dissipative assemblies in response to the spatiotemporal availability of a chemical fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transition from inactive to active matter implies a transition from thermodynamically stable to energy&#8208;dissipating structures. Here, we show how the spatiotemporal availability of a chemical fuel causes a thermodynamically stable self&#8208;assembled structure to transiently pass to an energy&#8208;dissipating state. The system relies on the local injection of a weak affinity phosphodiester substrate into an agarose hydrogel containing surfactant&#8208;based structures templated by ATP. Injection of substrate leads to the inclusion of additional surfactant molecules in the assemblies leading to the formation of catalytic hotspots for substrate conversion. After the local disappearance of the substrate as a result of chemical conversion and diffusion the assemblies spontaneously return to the stable state, which can be reactivated upon the injection of a new batch of fuel. The study illustrates how a dissipating self&#8208;assembled system can cope with the intermittent availability of chemical energy without compromising long&#8208;term structural stability.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#8208;Site Engineering with Thiophene&#8208;Based Ammonium for High&#8208;Efficiency 2D/3D Tin Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TTin halide perovskites are the most promising candidate materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) thanks to their low toxicity and ideal bandgap energies. The introduction of 2D/3D mixed perovskite phases in tin&#8208;based PSCs (TPSCs) has proven to be the most effective approach to improving device efficiency and stability. However, a 2D perovskite phase normally shows relatively low carrier mobility, which will be unfavorable for carrier transfer in the devices. In this work, we used a thiophene&#8208;based cation 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (3&#8208;TEA) as a spacer to form a novel 2D perovskite phase in TPSCs, which shows the most promising effect on the performance enhancement in comparison with other cations like 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (2&#8208;TEA) and benzene&#8208;based 2&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (PEA). Theoretical calculations reveal that 3&#8208;TEA enables the most compact crystal packing of [SnI6]4&#8208; octahedral layers, resulting in the lowest hole effective mass and formation energy in the 2D phase. This effect significantly enhances device efficiency and stability by facilitating more efficient carrier transfer within the 2D phase. These findings indicate that thiophene&#8208;based 2D perovskites are well&#8208;suited for high&#8208;performance TPSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Acetylene Bridge in Intramolecular Singlet Fission: A Boon or A Nuisance?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various analogues of the alkylsilylacetylene group are frequently used as auxiliary groups to enhance the solubility and stability of the acene dimer core, widely used as platforms to investigate intramolecular singlet fission (iSF) mechanisms. However, while in the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers they are primarily auxiliary groups, these are essential fragments of the bridging units in 6,6&#8217;/5,5&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers, the two preferred choices for dimerization. The starkly different iSF dynamics observed in the two variants raise the question of what role the acetylene bridges play. Here, we systematically designed a set of (oligo&#8208;)para&#8208;phenylene bridged 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked pentacene dimers with an additional acetylene fragment in the bridging unit to mimic the structure of 6,6&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers. Contrasting the results with previously reported analogous 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked and 6,6&#8217;&#8208;linked pentacene dimers reveals that the acetylene bridges contribute to significant conformational freedom. This effect provides a mechanism to promote spin evolution within the triplet pair to achieve free triplets but also offers new parasitic pathways for triplet&#8208;pair recombination, revealing that this structural motif can be both a boon and a nuisance. Additionally, our analysis reveals that these bridges directly modify the electronic states, highlighting significant pitfalls of the standard chromophore&#8208;bridge&#8208;chromophore framework used to design and interpret photophysics of iSF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Trifluorooxygenate Anion [OF3]&#8722;: Spectroscopic Evidence for a Binary, Hypervalent Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Experimental evidence for hypervalent compounds of second&#8208;row elements is still scarce in literature. Here, we present the first report of the long&#8208;sought binary hypervalent trifluorooxygenate anion [OF3]&#8722;. It was isolated in solid Ne matrices under cryogenic conditions after reacting oxygen difluoride with free fluoride ions from laser ablation of alkali metal fluorides MF (M = Li&#8211;Cs). As predicted by VSEPR theory and calculations at the CCSD(T) level, and confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy as well as isotopic labeling, [OF3]&#8722; exhibits a C2v&#8208;symmetric T&#8208;shaped structure with one short and two long O&#8208;F bond distances. Analysis of the natural local molecular orbitals shows the presence of 2c&#8208;2e bond and one 3c&#8208;4e bond. Natural resonance theory indicates the importance of the stability of [OF2]&#8226;&#8722; for the stability of [OF3]&#8722;. Although free [OF2]&#8226;&#8722; was not detected, the species MOF2 (M = Na&#8211;Cs) could be observed in the same experiments, which are best described as contact ion pairs of M+[OF2]&#8226;&#8722;.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence from BN&#8208;&#65279;Substituted Xanthene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emissive organic materials are predominantly fluorescent and there is significant interest in realizing and understanding examples that defy this paradigm and exhibit phosphorescence under ambient conditions. Organic room temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) offers the long&#8208;lived excited states and bathochromically&#8208;shifted emission maxima of phosphorescence without the use of potentially toxic and expensive transition metals. Most ORTP materials rely on well&#8208;studied structural motifs that include aryl carbonyls, sulfones, and heavy main group elements. We report the unexpected ORTP of a series of heavy atom&#8208;free BN&#8208;substituted xanthene derivatives. The creation of heteroatom&#8208;rich scaffolds, combined with stabilizing C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions in the solid&#8208;state, resulted in oxygen&#8208;tolerant heavy atom&#8208;free organic phosphorescence without relying on the use of cryogenic temperatures, polymer matrices, or host&#8208;guest interactions. The observation of ORTP in these simple systems sets a blueprint for the further development of heavy atom&#8208;free organic phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>Interception of Alkynyl Tetracoordinate Borons with Sulfur Electrophiles beyond the Zweifel Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zweifel reaction is a powerful strategy to construct olefins from alkenyl tetracoordinate borons in organoboron chemistry, however, it usually only involves one functional group migration and then undergoes an elimination process affording alkenes or alkynes exclusively. Herein, we disclose several intriguing interception of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons with sulfur electrophiles. Wherein, the substituted benzothiophenes are accessed by consecutive 1,2&#8208;migrations and intramolecular electrophilic substitution, meanwhile, the challenging and elusive five/four&#8208;membered boracycles are easily assembled, and an approach to alkenyl sulfides with good stereoselectivity was developed as well. Moreover, by adding readily available deuterium sources, the tetrasubstituted deuterated alkenyl sulfides with high deuteration rates are constructed. These protocols not only improve atom economy by prohibiting the elimination of Zweifel intermediate, but also enriches the reaction modes of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons achieving versatile value&#8208;added sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Mechanistic investigations illustrate that dichlorosulfoxide (SOCl2) and dialkylaminosulfur trifluoride&#8208;type reagents (DAST&#8208;type) as surfur sources could promote dual 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of alkynyl tetracoordinate borons, which are distinct from traditional Zweifel reaction, and the regulation of steric hindrance could also make four&#8208;membered boracycles and alkenyl sulfides feasible. And these transformations feature novel reaction modes and unusual reaction mechanisms with valuable products in high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of interfaces remains a critical and challenging aspect in the pursuit of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (HBPDC) is incorporated as an interfacial layer between SnO2 and perovskite layers in PSCs. The two carboxylic acid moieties on HBPDC bind to SnO2 through esterification, while its nitrogen atoms, possessing lone electron pairs, interact with uncoordinated lead (Pb2+) atoms through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. This dual functionality enables simultaneous passivation of surface defects on both the SnO2 and buried perovskite layers. In addition, the electron&#8208;deficient nature of HBPDC enhances interfacial energy band alignment and facilitates electron transfer from the perovskite to SnO2. Furthermore, the incorporation of HBPDC strengthens the interfacial adhesion, improving mechanical reliability. As a result, the PSCs exhibited an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41% under standard AM 1.5G conditions, along with remarkable environmental stability.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Aldimine Umpolung/6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization Cascade to Access Tetracyclic Dihydrochromeno Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The umpolung of aldimines using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) is less explored compared to the established polarity reversal of aldehydes. Described herein is an NHC&#8208;catalyzed imine umpolung /6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization cascade, which leads to the atom&#8208; and pot&#8208;economic synthesis of biologically important dihydrochromeno indoles. For the first time, the nucleophilic aza&#8208;Breslow intermediates have been intercepted with unactivated alkynes. Preliminary mechanistic and DFT studies shed light on the role of the phenolic &#8208;OH moiety in promoting the addition of the aza&#8208;Breslow intermediate to the unactivated alkyne via an intramolecular proton transfer in a stepwise manner. DFT studies also support the regioselectivity preference for the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization pathway, leading to the exclusive formation of the indole products. Moreover, a comparison of Gibbs free energies provides insight into a thermodynamically preferred 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization over a competing oxa&#8208;Michael pathway. Further, this strategy is applied to the formal synthesis of a Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor in a step&#8208;economical method.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Redox Reactions of Silver Hexacyanoferrate Prussian Blue Analogue Enable Superior Electrochemical Performance for Zinc&#8208;ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been employed as host materials of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), however, they suffer from low capacity and poor cycling stability due to limited electron transfer and the presence of interstitial water in PBAs. Herein, a vacancy and water&#8208;free silver hexacyanoferrate K0.95Ag3.05Fe(CN)6 (AgHCF&#8208;3) was synthesized by adjusting the ratio of K and Ag in the framework. It offers nearly four electrons involving two sequential redox reactions, namely, Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ag+/Ag0, to deliver a large capacity of 179.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 mA g&#8208;1 with Coulomb efficiency of ~100%. The Zn//AgHCF&#8208;3 cell delivers an estimated energy density of 200 Wh kg&#8208;1, surpassing reported PBAs&#8208;based ZIBs. The formation of Ag0 in the cycling process merits favorable rate performance of AgHCF&#8208;3 (156.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 200 mA g&#8208;1 with 80.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles). This investigation paves new pathways for high&#8208;capacity PBA cathodes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials via host&#8208;guest doped method receive considerable attention in the fields of optoelectronics, bioimaging, and information encryption. Despite many host&#8208;guest doped materials with excellent RTP properties have been developed, their luminous mechanism is still limited. Here, a series of host&#8208;guest doped materials, using Benzophenone as the host and quinone compounds as the guests, were constructed to investigate the effect of the triplet energy gap (&#916;ET) between the host and guest on triplet states population. The guest&#8217;s triplet state is proposed to be a &#8220;triplet energy reservoir&#8221;, gathering the triplet excitons to emit RTP when &#916;ET&#160;is large and returning triplet excitons to the host when &#916;ET&#160;is small. By combining the results of steady&#8208;state and delayed emission spectra, time&#8208;resolved transient absorption, and theoretical calculations, A bidirectional energy transfer process is proved, which are triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer and reverse triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer processes. The thermal equilibrium of these two energy transfer processes can be regulated by the &#916;ET&#160;and temperature. The potential applications of these RTP properties are also realized in data encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work provides valuable insight into the design of host&#8208;guest doped materials based on energy transfer mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable, High&#8208;Yield Monolayer MXene Preparation from Multilayer MXene for Many Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXene (Ti3C2Tx) is renowned for its exceptional conductivity and hydrophilicity;&#160;however,&#160;the low yield of monolayers hinders its industrial scalability. Herein, we&#160;present a strategy to substantially enhance the monolayer yield by disrupting the&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bonding cage confinement of multilayer MXene using high&#8208;temperature ultrasound,&#160;challenging&#160;the conventional belief that monolayer MXene can only be prepared at lower temperatures. At approximately&#160;70 &#176;C, the weakened hydrogen bonding&#160;between the oxygen&#8208;containing terminal groups of multilayer MXene and surrounding water molecules weakens&#160;the hydrogen&#8208;bond cage confinement. This&#160;enables ultrasonic cavitation to generate more microbubbles that&#160;penetrate the interlayers of multilayer MXene,&#160;resulting&#160;in gentle and thorough delamination into larger monolayer nanosheets.&#160;Achieving up to a 95%&#160;yield in just tens of&#160;minutes,&#160;these nanosheets exhibit properties comparable&#160;to those produced&#160;by&#160;traditional ice&#8208;bath methods. Furthermore, the high&#8208;concentration MXene ink produced on a large scale using this high&#8208;yield approach&#160;exhibits excellent printing and processing&#160;capabilities, and the corresponding&#160;products showcase superior infrared stealth and Joule heating characteristics. This work addresses a key&#160;technical bottleneck in&#160;MXene production, paving the way for its extensive technological and industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Planar Core Based Spiro&#8208;Type Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Dopant&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z&#8208;W&#8208;03, a quasi&#8208;planar spiro&#8208;type hole&#8208;transporting materials, has been developed to enhance the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells. This improvement is achieved through defect passivation, Fermi&#8208;level splitting, and intermolecular stacking. An undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device with interface modification can achieve an efficiency of 22.92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting material (HTMs) are crucial for obtaining the stability and high efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs relied on the use of 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) exhibit inferior intrinsic and ambient stability due to the p&#8208;dopant and hydrophilic Li&#8208;TFSI additive. In this study, a new spiro&#8208;type HTM with a critical quasi&#8208;planar core (Z&#8208;W&#8208;03) is developed to improve both the thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The results suggest that the planar carbazole structure effectively passivates the trap states compared to the triphenylamine with a propeller&#8208;like conformation in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. This passivation effect leads to the shallower trap states when the quasi&#8208;planar HTMs interact with the Pb&#8208;dimer. Consequently, the device using Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 achieves a higher Voc of 1.178&#8197;V compared to the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD's 1.155&#8197;V, resulting in an enhanced efficiency of 24.02&#8201;%. In addition, the double&#8208;column &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 results in high hole mobility (~10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) even without p&#8208;dopant. Moreover, when the surface interface is modified, the undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device can achieve an efficiency of nearly 23&#8201;%. Compared to the PSCs using spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, those with Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 exhibit enhanced stability under N2 and ambient conditions. This superior performance is attributed to the quasi&#8208;planar core structure and the presence of multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular stacking in Z&#8208;W&#8208;03. The multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular contacts of HTMs can improve the hole hopping transport. Therefore, it is imperative to focus on further molecular structure design and optimization of spiro&#8208;type HTMs incorporating quasi&#8208;planar cores and carbazole moieties for the commercialization of PSCs.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts Allenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. Using racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile, this stereoconvergent reaction resulted in 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.).







Abstract
The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts (FC) allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This enantioconvergent reaction utilizes racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile and shows compatibility with a variety of electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes. The resulting highly enantioenriched (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.) 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, are obtained with complete regiocontrol &#8211; both on (hetero)arenes as well as on the allenylic fragment. This protocol allows for the enantioselective formal introduction of a 4&#8208;carbon alkyl chain into (hetero)arenes, along with the creation of a benzylic stereocenter. Judicious synthetic elaborations not only lead to formal enantioselective FC alkylation products of less electron&#8208;rich arenes but also of substituted arenes in ortho&#8208; and even meta&#8208;selective fashion. An intramolecular version of this FC allenylation is shown to proceed with promising enantioselectivity under the same catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) of racemic allenylic alcohols in this reaction.

The resulting highly enantioenriched (up to &amp;gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.) 1,1-disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, are obtained with complete regiocontrol &#8211; both on (hetero)arenes as well as on the allenylic fragment. This protocol allows for the enantioselective formal introduction of a 4-carbon alkyl chain into (hetero)arenes, along with the creation of a benzylic stereocenter. Judicious synthetic elaborations not only lead to formal enantioselective FC alkylation products of less electron-rich arenes but also of substituted arenes in &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;- and even &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-selective fashion. An intramolecular version of this FC allenylation is shown to proceed with promising enantioselectivity under the same catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) of racemic allenylic alcohols in this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex RNA Based PROTAC Enables Targeted Degradation of RNA Binding Protein FMRP for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel PROTAC composed of G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) and a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide enables targeted degradation of RNA binding protein FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in cancer cell. The degradation of FMRP does not directly kill the cancer cell but changes its secretion pattern, leading to more CCL7 and less IL&#8208;33, PROS1 and exosomes. This change facilitates CD8 T cells infiltrating into the tumor and inhibits the tumor growth.







Abstract
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein (RBP), is aberrantly hyper&#8208;expressed in human tumors and plays an essential role in tumor invasion, metastasis and immune evasion. However, there is no small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for FMRP so far. In this study, we developed the first FMRP&#8208;targeting degrader based on PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology and constructed a heterobifunctional PROTAC through linking a FMRP&#8208;targeting G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) to a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide (named as sc1&#8208;VHLL). Sc1&#8208;VHLL specifically degraded endogenous FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in both mouse and human cancer cells. The FMRP degradation significantly changed the secretion pattern of cancer cells, resulting in higher expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine and smaller amounts of immunomodulatory contents. Furthermore, sc1&#8208;VHLL, when encapsulated into ionizable liposome nanoparticles (LNP), efficiently targeted tumor site and degraded FMRP in cancer cells. In CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, FMRP degradation within tumors substantially promoted the infiltration of lymphocytes and CD8 T cells and reduced the proportion of Treg cells, reshaping the proinflammatory tumor microenvironment and accordingly transforming cold tumor into hot tumor. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, sc1&#8208;VHLL based treatment remarkably inhibited the tumor growth.

         <title>Improving Active Site Local Proton Transfer in Porous Organic Polymers for Boosted Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By functionalizing active molecular units instead of organic linkers, we synthesized a Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymer with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local active sites. The resulted porous material shows unparalleled high activities for oxygen electrocatalysis among reported molecule&#8208;based frameworks. This work thus presents a new strategy to functionalize porous organic polymers for boosted catalytic performances.







Abstract
Improving proton transfer is vital for electrocatalysis with porous materials. Although several strategies are reported to assist proton transfer in channels, few studies are dedicated to improving proton transfer at the local environments of active sites in porous materials. Herein, we report on new Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) with improved proton transfer for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By tuning the pore sizes and installing proton relays at Co corrole sites, we designed and synthesized POP&#8208;2&#8208;OH with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local Co active sites. This POP shows remarkable activity for both electrocatalytic ORR with E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs RHE and OER with &#951;10=255&#8197;mV. Therefore, this work is significant to present a strategy to improve active site local proton transfer in porous materials and highlight the key role of such structural functionalization in boosting oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>Isolable Si=B Analogue of a Vinyl Halide: A Building Block for Facile Access toward Silicon&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonded Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide which acts as a useful building block for difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access Si=B double bonded species were synthesized by a formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a Si(0) complex. The adjacent Br group and the vacant 3p(Si) orbital serves as reaction sites toward neutral and anionic nucleophiles for late&#8208;stage electronic tuning and synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a cyclopropene.







Abstract
Compared to the outstanding development in the synthesis of Si&#8722;B single bonded species, borylsilanes and their application to organic synthesis, the chemistry of Si=B double bonded species, borasilenes and boratasilenes have only made little progress, first of all, due to the difficulties in accessing such double bonds. Herein we report the synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide, a bromoboratasilene, via formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a monoatomic Si(0) complex, using a dihaloborane as the borylene source. The treatment of bromoboratasilene toward neutral or anionic Lewis bases gives access to new boratasilenes, all of which were proved to possess significant Si=B double bond character by XRD analysis and DFT calculations. These results demonstrate exciting strategies to synthesize new types of Si=B double bonded species which should further progress the chemistry of boron, silicon&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Mitigating Intraphase Catalytic&#8208;Domain Transfer via CO2 Laser for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroconversion and Zn&#8208;Nitrate Battery Behavior</title>

         <dc:description>
CoFe Prussian blue analogs are transformed into CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts via CO2 laser irradiation, achieving high NH3 production rates from electrochemical nitrate reduction with excellent stability, thereby positioning the zinc&#8208;nitrate battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.







Abstract
Developing sustainable energy solutions is critical for addressing the dual challenges of energy demand and environmental impact. In this study, a zinc&#8208;nitrate (Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722;) battery system was designed for the simultaneous production of ammonia (NH3) via the electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) and electricity generation. Continuous wave CO2 laser irradiation yielded precisely controlled CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoFe2O4@NC) hollow nanocubes from CoFe Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) as the integral electrocatalyst for NO3RR in 1.0&#8197;M KOH, achieving a remarkable NH4+ production rate of 10.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.47&#8197;V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode with exceptional stability. In situ and ex situ methods revealed that the CoFe2O4@NC surface transformed into high&#8208;valent Fe/CoOOH active species, optimizing the adsorption energy of NO3RR (*NO2 and *NO species) intermediates. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations validated the possible NO3RR pathway on CoFe2O4@NC starting with NO3&#8722; conversion to *NO2 intermediates, followed by reduction to *NO. Subsequent protonation forms the *NH and *NH2 species, leading to NH3 formation via final protonation. The Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery utilizing the CoFe2O4@NC cathode exhibits dual functionality by generating electricity with a stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.38&#8197;V versus Zn/Zn2+ and producing NH3. This study highlights the innovative use of CO2 laser irradiation to transform Prussian blue analogs into cost&#8208;effective catalysts with hierarchical structures for NO3RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion, positioning the Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.

         <title>Allostery at a Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Harboring an Intermolecular Motional Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular dynamic networks allow for regulation of protein function by dynamic allostery, but it has been unclear whether such networks can be positively modulated through protein&#8208;protein association. It is now shown that the formation of a protein&#8208;protein interface can motionally couple distant sites, turning preexisting structures into functional networks.







Abstract
Motional properties of proteins govern recognition, catalysis, and regulation. The dynamics of tightly interacting residues can form intramolecular dynamic networks, dependencies fine&#8208;tuned by evolution to optimize a plethora of functional aspects. The constructive interaction of residues from different proteins to assemble intermolecular dynamic networks is a similarly likely case but has escaped thorough experimental assessment due to interfering association/dissociation dynamics. Here, we use fast&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state 15N R1&#961; NMR relaxation dispersion aided by molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations to mechanistically assess the hierarchy of individual &#956;s timescale motions arising from a crystal&#8208;crystal contact, in the absence of translational motion. In contrast to the monomer, where particular mutations entail isolated perturbations, specific intermolecular interactions couple the motional properties between distant residues in the same protein. The mechanistic insights obtained from this conceptual work may improve our understanding on how intramolecular allostery can be tuned by intermolecular interactions via assembly of dynamic networks from previously isolated elements.

         <title>Integration of Plasmonic Ag(I) Clusters and Fe(II) Porphyrinates into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupling with Photosynthesis of Pure H2O2</title>

Integrating Ag(I) clusters as oxidative sites and Fe porphyrinates as reductive sites into a metal&#8211;organic framework for artificial photosynthetic overall reaction to yield CO and pure 0.1&#8197;mM H2O2.







Abstract
Efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with the photosynthesis of pure H2O2 is a challenging and significant task. Herein, using classical CO2 photoreduction site iron porphyrinate as the linker, Ag(I) clusters were spatially separated and evenly distributed within a new metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), namely Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe. With water as electron donors, Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe exhibited remarkable performances in artificial photosynthetic overall reaction with CO yield of 36.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, as well as H2O2 evolution rate of 35.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Since H2O2 in the liquid phase can be more readily separated from the gaseous products of CO2 photoreduction, high&#8208;purity H2O2 with a concentration up to 0.1&#8197;mM was obtained. Confirmed by theoretical calculations and the established energy level diagram, the reductive iron(II) porphyrinates and oxidative Ag(I) clusters within an integrated framework functioned synergistically to achieve artificial photosynthesis. Furthermore, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurements revealed that the robust connection of Ag(I) clusters and iron porphyrinate ligands facilitated efficient charge separation and rapid electron transfer, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Development of Macrocyclic Neurotensin Receptor Type&#8201;2 (NTS2) Opioid&#8208;Free Analgesics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MD01&#8208;67 is a macrocyclic analog designed to selectively target the neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2), identified through an in&#8208;depth SAR study. Based on NT(7&#8211;12), in which Ile12 was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine, followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization using ring&#8208;closing metathesis, this constrained peptide exerts non&#8208;opioid analgesic action and no opioid&#8208;related adverse effects, thus representing a new therapeutic option for pain management.







Abstract
The opioid crisis has highlighted the urgent need to develop non&#8208;opioid alternatives for managing pain, with an effective, safe, and non&#8208;addictive pharmacotherapeutic profile. Using an extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship approach, here we have identified a new series of highly selective neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2) macrocyclic compounds that exert potent, opioid&#8208;independent analgesia in various experimental pain models. To our knowledge, the constrained macrocycle in which the Ile12 residue of NT(7&#8211;12) was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization is the most selective analog targeting NTS2 identified to date (Ki 2.9&#8197;nM), showing 30,000&#8208;fold selectivity over NTS1. Of particular importance, this macrocyclic analog is also able to potentiate the analgesic effects of morphine in a dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent manner. Exerting complementary analgesic actions via distinct mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, NTS2&#8208;selective macrocycles can therefore be exploited as opioid&#8208;free analgesics or as opioid&#8208;sparing therapeutics, offering superior pain relief with reduced adverse effects to pain patients.

         <title>Photocleavable Protecting Groups Using a Sulfite Self&#8208;Immolative Linker for High Uncaging Quantum Yield and Aqueous Solubility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are used to silence the activity of a payload and subsequently release this payload at a desired time and place using light irradiation. A fundamental property of PPGs crucial for their application is their efficiency of payload release, governed by the photochemical Quantum Yield (QY). Here we report a new strategy to improve the QY of PPGs through using a new sulfite self&#8208;immolative linker resulting in a five&#8208; to six&#8208;fold improved QY while simultaneously improving aqueous solubility.







Abstract
Using light as an external stimulus to control (bio)chemical processes offers many distinct advantages. Most importantly, it allows for spatiotemporal control simply through operating the light source. Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are a cornerstone class of compounds that are used to achieve photocontrol over (bio)chemical processes. PPGs are able to release a payload of interest upon light irradiation. The successful application of PPGs hinges on their efficiency of payload release, captured in the uncaging Quantum Yield (QY). Heterolytic PPGs efficiently release low pKa payloads, but their efficiency drops significantly for payloads with higher pKa values, such as alcohols. For this reason, alcohols are usually attached to PPGs via a carbonate linker. The self&#8208;immolative nature of the carbonate linker results in concurrent release of CO2 with the alcohol payload upon irradiation. We introduce herein novel PPGs containing sulfites as self&#8208;immolative linkers for photocaged alcohol payloads, for which we discovered that the release of the alcohol proceeds with higher uncaging QY than an identical payload released from a carbonate&#8208;linked PPG. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncaging of the sulfite&#8208;linked PPGs results in the release of SO2 and show that the sulfite linker improves water solubility as compared to the carbonate&#8208;based systems.

         <title>A Macrocyclic Hybrid PET/MRI Probe for Quantitative Perfusion Imaging In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the integration of PET and MRI in molecular imaging has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. We have developed a hybrid PET/MRI probe, [18F][Gd(FL1)], which is exceptionally stable, rapidly synthesized, efficiently radiolabeled, and allows simultaneous PET/MR imaging. The potential for in vivo application is demonstrated by quantitative characterization of tissue and renal clearance in mice.







Abstract
Perfusion dynamics play a vital role in delivering essential nutrients and oxygen to tissues while removing metabolic waste products. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) use contrast agents to visualize perfusion and clearance patterns; however, each technique has specific limitations. Hybrid PET/MRI combines the quantitative power and sensitivity of PET with the high functional and anatomical detail of MRI and holds great promise for precision in molecular imaging.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates that the integration of PET and MRI in molecular imaging has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. We have developed a hybrid PET/MRI probe, [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F][Gd(&lt;b&gt;FL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;)], which is exceptionally stable, rapidly synthesized, efficiently radiolabeled, and allows simultaneous PET/MR imaging. The potential for in vivo application is demonstrated by quantitative characterization of tissue and renal clearance in mice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfusion dynamics play a vital role in delivering essential nutrients and oxygen to tissues while removing metabolic waste products. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) use contrast agents to visualize perfusion and clearance patterns; however, each technique has specific limitations. Hybrid PET/MRI combines the quantitative power and sensitivity of PET with the high functional and anatomical detail of MRI and holds great promise for precision in molecular imaging. However, the development of dual PET/MRI probes has been hampered by challenging synthesis and radiolabeling. Here, we present a novel PET/MRI probe, [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F][Gd(&lt;b&gt;FL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Oxidation of Acyclic 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl Alkenes as Limiting Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed method for highly enantioselective allylic C&#8722;H oxidation of acyclic alkenes is reported. Using this method, mixtures of E/Z&#8208;alkenes undergo photoinduced allylic oxidation with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. Importantly, the C&#8722;H substrates are used as limiting reagents. The method displays good functional group tolerance and is amenable to late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a simple copper&#8208;catalyzed method for enantioselective allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation of unsymmetrical acyclic alkenes, specifically 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl alkenes. The C&#8722;H substrates are used in limiting amounts, and the products are obtained with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. The method exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and E/Z&#8208;alkene mixtures are suitable C&#8722;H substrates. The transformation is enabled by light irradiation, which sustains the enantioselective copper catalysis by photoinduced oxidant homolysis.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Buckybowls: Synthesis and Selective Transformations Toward Chiral and Nonlinear Optical Polycycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;buckybowls, spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs), are synthesized by fusing together two dichalcogenasumanenes. Selective transformations of a series of doped spiro&#8208;buckybowls: in the S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE the thiophene is oxidized and the product shows strong emission; ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzenes in the Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE provides a chiral polycycle; the covalent adduct of the Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 displays second&#8208;harmonic generation.







Abstract
Integration of spirocycles with buckybowls is a promising strategy to construct three&#8208;dimensional (3D) curved &#960;&#8208;systems and to endow distinctive physicochemical features arising from buckybowls. Herein, a series of carbon&#8208;bridged spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs) were synthesized by combining 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene and dichalcogenasumanenes (DCSs). It is found that spiro&#8208;conjugation plays an important role in the geometric and electronic structures of spiro&#8208;HSEs. The bowl depth of DCSs moiety becomes larger in the spiro&#8208;HSEs. Owing to the Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect, two DCSs segments of spiro&#8208;HSEs have different bowl depths accompanied with the unequal distribution of charge in radical cation state. Taking advantage of the typical reactions of DCSs, selective transformations of spiro&#8208;HSEs have been adopted in accordance to the nature of chalcogen atoms (S, Se, Te) to bestow the value&#8208;added functionalities. The emissive property is enhanced by converting the thiophene rings of S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE into thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides. A chiroptical polycycle could be produced by ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzene of Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE. The covalent adduct of Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 forms non&#8208;centrosymmetric halogen&#8208;bonded networks, resulting in the high performance second&#8208;order nonlinear optics (NLO).

         <title>Interface Synergy of Exposed Oxygen Vacancy and Pd Lewis Acid Sites Enabling Superior Cooperative Photoredox Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a highly efficient interface synergy strategy that integrates exposed VO sites with surface Pd Lewis acid sites to ensure effective adsorption and activation of both coupling partners, o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols, with the synergistic interaction between VO and Pd enhancing interfacial charge transfer, thereby achieving the highest performance so far in the field of photoredox mediated benzimidazole synthesis.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven cross&#8208;coupling of o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols has emerged as an alternative for the synthesis of bio&#8208;active benzimidazoles. However, tackling the key problem related to efficient adsorption and activation of both coupling partners over photocatalysts towards activity enhancement remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate an efficient interface synergy strategy by coupling exposed oxygen vacancies (VO) and Pd Lewis acid sites for benzimidazole and hydrogen (H2) coproduction over Pd&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanospheres with the highest photoredox activity compared to previous works so far. The results show that the introduction of VO optimizes the energy band structure and supplies coordinatively unsaturated sites for adsorbing and activating ethanol molecules, affording acetaldehyde active intermediates. Pd acts as a Lewis acid site, enhancing the adsorption of alkaline amine molecules via Lewis acid&#8208;base pair interactions and driving the condensation process. Furthermore, VO and Pd synergistically promote interfacial charge transfer and separation. This work offers new insightful guidance for the rational design of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts with interface synergy at the molecular level towards the high&#8208;performance coproduction of renewable fuels and value&#8208;added feedstocks.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Doped Carbon Support Enables Superfast Oxygen Reduction Kinetics by Breaking the Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of tune the electrocatalytic microenvironment via the introduction of C&#8722;F bonds can effectively break the scaling relationship between *OOH and *OH, and facilitate the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2, thereby resulting in significantly improving the performance of oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;established that Pt&#8208;based catalysts suffer from the unfavorable linear scaling relationship (LSR) between *OOH and *OH (&#916;G(*OOH)=&#916;G(*OH)+3.2&#177;0.2&#8197;eV) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), resulting in a great challenge to significantly reduced ORR overpotentials. Herein, we propose a universal and feasible strategy of fluorine&#8208;doped carbon supports, which optimize interfacial microenvironment of Pt&#8208;based catalysts and thus significantly enhance their reactive kinetics. The introduction of C&#8722;F bonds not only weakens the *OH binding energy, but also stabilizes the *OOH intermediate, resulting in a break of LSR. Furthermore, fluorine&#8208;doped carbon constructs a local super&#8208;hydrophobic interface that facilitates the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2. Electrochemical tests show that the F&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Pt catalysts exhibit over 2&#8208;fold higher mass activities than those without F modification. More importantly, those catalysts also demonstrate excellent stability in both rotating disk electrode (RDE) and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) tests. This study not only validates the feasibility of tuning the electrocatalytic microenvironment to improve mass transport and to break the scaling relationship, but also provides a universal catalyst design paradigm for other gas&#8208;involving electrocatalytic reactions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reactions. By employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox approach, coupling of aryl&#8208; and alkenyl iodides with acetone cyanohydrin generates the aryl&#8208; and vinyl nitriles efficiently.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reaction by employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation utilizes acetone cyanohydrin as a nucleophilic cyanide source to convert simple aryl and alkenyl iodides into the corresponding nitriles. Combined experimental and computational studies highlighted the crucial role of cationic silver salts in activating the stable (P,N)&#8208;AuCN complex towards the oxidative addition of aryl iodides to subsequently generate key aryl&#8208;Au(III) cyanide complexes.

         <title>Enhancing d/p&#8208;2&#960;* Orbitals Hybridization via Strain Engineering for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice strain regulates the orbitals hybridization between metal sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics.







Abstract
The photoconversion of CO2 into valuable chemical products using solar energy is a promising strategy to address both energy and environmental challenges. However, the strongly adsorbed CO2 frequently impedes the seamless advancement of the subsequent reaction by significantly increasing the reaction activation energy. Here, we present a BiFeO3 material with lattice strain that collaboratively regulates the d/p&#8208;2&#960;* orbitals hybridization between metal sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics. Quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculation reveals that the optimized Fe sites enhance the adsorption and activation effect of CO2, and continuous internal electrons are rapidly transferred to the reaction sites and injected into the surface *CO2 and *COOH under the condition of illumination, which promotes the rapid formation and stability of *COOH. Certainly, the performance of CO2 photoreduction to CO is improved by 12.81&#8208;fold compared with the base material. This work offers a new perspective for the rapid photoreduction process of strongly adsorbed CO2.

         <title>Abnormal Gas Generation during First Discharge Process of Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was discovered that sodium&#8208;ion batteries exhibit significantly different gas evolution behavior during discharge compared to the charging gas evolution observed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries during formation. This difference primarily arises from the high specific surface area and unique porous structure of the hard carbon anode in sodium ion batteries, which facilitate a specific adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior of CO2 gas.







Abstract
In recent years, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in&#8208;depth analysis of the two&#8208;dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Bioorthogonal Chemistry Altered Natural Killer Cell Activity for Boosted Adoptive Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;harvesting porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed natural killer (NK) cells were constructed for adoptive cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. The porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (NK@p&#8208;Fe) could generate active doxorubicin to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells, as well as immune agonists for activating NK cells and reshaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for NK cell infiltration.







Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell&#8208;based immunotherapy has received much attention in recent years. However, its practical application is still suffering from the decreased function and inadequate infiltration of NK cells in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors. Herein, we construct light&#8208;responsive porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (denoted as NK@p&#8208;Fe) for cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. By installing cholesterol&#8208;modified porphyrin Fe molecules on the NK cell surface, a catalytic array with light&#8208;harvesting capabilities is formed. This functionality transforms NK cells into cellular factories capable of catalyzing the production of active agents in a light&#8208;controlled manner. NK@p&#8208;Fe can generate the active antineoplastic drug doxorubicin through bioorthogonal reactions to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Beyond drug synthesis, NK@p&#8208;Fe can also bioorthogonally catalyze the production of the FDA&#8208;approved immune agonist imiquimod (IMQ). The activated immune agonist plays a dual role, inducing dendritic cell maturation for NK cell activation and reshaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment for NK cell infiltration. This work represents a paradigm for the modulation of adoptive cell behaviors to boost cancer immunotherapy by bioorthogonal catalysis.

         <title>Precise Regulation of the Reverse Intersystem Crossing Pathway by Hybridized Long&#8208;Short Axis Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules have experienced great success in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their outstanding quantum efficiencies and narrow full width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs). However, the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates of MR&#8208;TADF emitters are usually small, which will lead to relatively long triplet exciton lifetime and severe efficiency roll&#8208;off. Here, we report an effective molecular design strategy to introduce multichannel RISC pathways and thus increase RISC rates without compromising the color fidelity and emission efficiency by the &#8220;hybridized long&#8208;short axis (HLSA)&#8221; strategy. The TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN shows a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, rapid RISC rate of 1.4 &#215; 105 s&#8208;1, narrow FWHM of 23 nm, and small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.06 eV in solution. The non&#8208;sensitized OLED based on TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN exhibits a narrowband emission with the FWHM of 31 nm, in company with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.9%. Notably, the device exhibits the low efficiency roll&#8208;off as the EQEs maintain 34.8% and 21.8% at 100 and 1000 cd m&#8208;2, respectively, representing the best performance for single&#8208;host OLEDs based on the BCzBN skeleton. This study provides a fresh and promising approach to realize high&#8208;performance OLEDs with high color purity and remarkable device efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared Activatable Copper Nanoplatforms Synergize with the 5&#8208;Azacytidine Prodrug to Potentiate Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cuproptosis, a newly discovered cell death modality, is gaining recognition for its crucial role in antitumor therapy. Here, we demonstrated that Ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a key gene involved in cuproptosis, is negatively correlated with malignancy and T&#8208;cell exhaustion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Based on these findings, we developed near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled nanoparticles (NPs), CuD@PM, which can selectively deliver copper to HNSCC cells and induce cuproptosis in the presence of microneedles loaded with triacetylated azacitidine (TAc&#8208;AzaC) and 808 nm laser irradiation. Intravenous administration of these NPs significantly suppressed tumor growth in HNSCC animal models and enhanced the antitumor immune response. The NIR&#8208;controlled activation of cuproptosis offers great potential as a safe, targeted, and image&#8208;guided antitumor therapy for HNSCC.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Diborylation and Silaboration of Azoarenes: A Simple Photoinduced Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diborylation of the N=N double bond of azoarenes has been achieved using a commercially available diboron reagent, B2cat2 [bis(catecholato)diboron]. By utilizing the photo&#8208;switchable nature of azoarenes under blue&#8208;LED light irradiation, an uncatalyzed diborylation and silaboration yielded a broad range of functionalized hydrazine derivatives. The mechanistic origin validates the importance of cis configuration, which is corroborated by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>AdvancedEutectogel Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance and Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite ongoing challenges, achieving further breakthroughs in the development of gel polymer electrolytes with a wide temperature range, excellent liquid retention capability and enhanced anode compatibility in flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries (FZABs) remains a significant objective. This study presents a significant advancement in the development of choline chloride/ethylene glycol&#8208;polyvinyl alcohol (ChCl/EG&#8208;PVA) eutectogel electrolyte, tailored for high&#8208;performance operation across a wide temperature range. Systematic in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical simulations confirm the formation of robust hydrogen bonding and denser polymer cross&#8208;linked networks within the prepared eutectogel, leading to enhanced liquid retention ability (93.7% after 96 h exposure to air) and the ion transport capacity (ionic conductivity of 171.3 mS cm&#8208;1). Additionally, the zincophilicity nature of the choline cation in eutectogel effectively suppresses dendrites growth. The assembled FZAB utilizing this eutectogel electrolyte achieves a peak power density of 109.3 mW cm&#8208;2 and a cycle life of 90 h. Notably, the power density of FZAB is maintained as high as 38.2 mW cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;40 oC and 63.2 mW cm&#8208;2 at 50 oC, demonstrating its prominent suitability for applications in extreme temperature conditions. The design of eutectogel provides a novel way to achieve the high&#8208;performance FZAB.</dc:description>

         <title>Actuation Performance and Versatility of Photothermally Driven Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photomechanical crystals exhibit mechanical motion upon light irradiation and may thus find applications as actuators. Over the last decades, many photomechanical organic crystals have been developed, commonly via photochemical reactions, particularly photoisomerization. However, photochemical crystal actuation is associated with several drawbacks, including a limited number of available crystals, slow actuation speed (&lt; 5 Hz), and narrow wavelength range (&lt; 550 nm). Such constraints have hindered the widespread use of crystals as actuation materials. In this minireview, we focus on crystal actuation by employing more universal physical phenomena (the photothermal effect and photothermally resonated natural vibration) and quantitatively evaluate actuation performance. Both mechanisms, particularly the latter, outperformed conventional photomechanical crystal activation in terms of both speed (maximum: 1,350 Hz) and the useful wavelength range (ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared). The oscillation frequencies of the crystals exceeded those of polymers, efficiently filling the gap between soft and hard materials. Both the photothermal effect and natural vibration can actuate any crystal that absorbs light. These two versatile physical actuation mechanisms could expand 40 years of research on photomechanical crystals&#8212;which had been based on photochemical reactions&#8212;from the realm of chemistry into engineering and lead to their practical applications in actuators and soft robots.</dc:description>

         <title>Arenicolide Family Macrolides Provide a New Therapeutic Lead Combating Multidrug&#8208;resistant Tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) and extensively drug&#8208;resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) poses a significant threat to health globally. During searching for new chemical entities regulating MDR&#8208; and XDR&#8208;Mtb, chemical investigation of the black oil beetle gut bacterium Micromonospora sp. GR10 led to the discovery of eight new members of arenicolides along with the identification of arenicolide A (Ar&#8208;A, 1), which was a previously reported macrolide with incomplete configuration. Genomic analysis of the bacterial strain GR10 revealed their putative biosynthetic pathway. Quantum mechanics&#8208;based computation, chemical derivatizations, and bioinformatic analysis established the absolute stereochemistry of Ar&#8208;A and arenicolides D&#8208;K (Ar&#8208;D&#8208;K, 2&#8208;9) completely for the first time. Biological studies of 1&#8208;9 revealed their antimicrobial activity against MDR and XDR strains of Mtb. Ar&#8208;A had the most potent in vitro antimicrobial efficacy against MDR&#8208; and XDR&#8208;Mtb. Mechanistically, Ar&#8208;A induced ATP depletion and destabilized Mtb cell wall, thereby inhibiting growth. Notably, Ar&#8208;A exerted a significant antimicrobial effect against Mtb in macrophages, was effective in the treatment of Mtb infections, and showed a synergistic effect with amikacin (AMK) in a mouse model of MDR&#8208;Mtb lung infection. Collectively, our findings indicate Ar&#8208;A to be a promising drug lead for drug&#8208;resistant tuberculosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Unclicking the Click: A Depolymerizable Clicked Polymer via Two Consecutive Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a clicked polymer that can be depolymerized by a declicking reaction. A designed dipeptide monomer, upon heating its crystals, underwent a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition polymerization to form a triazoline&#8208;linked polymer, which upon further heating, underwent a remarkable SCSC denitrogenation, resulting in an imine&#8208;linked polymer quantitatively. As both the TEAC polymerization and the denitrogenation occurred in SCSC fashion, the structures of the triazoline&#8208;linked polymer and the imine&#8208;linked polymer could be determined at atomic resolution by SCXRD. Acid hydrolysis of the imine&#8208;linked polymer leads to quantitative depolymerization yielding a dipeptide, showcasing the degradability and depolymerizability of such polymers. This solid&#8208;state click polymerization and denitrogenation yielding depolymerizable polymer is attractive over the usual click polymers that cannot be unclicked.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular Redox Environment Determines Cancer&#8208;normal Cell Selectivity of Selenium Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elucidating the chemical structure and intracellular action mechanisms is still the critical limit for the clinical translation of nanomedicines. Intracellular redox environments originating from cell metabolism are key factors affecting internalized drug efficacy. Herein, we engineer Se&#8208;Se/Se&#8208;S bond to assemble selenium nanoclusters with intracellular redox environment&#8208;driven selective structure. Chemical structure analysis reveals that, the bonding of sulfur atom in intermediates to the two neighboring or interposition selenium atoms in selenium rings is the key internal driving force for nanoparticle cluster formation. This nanocluster can be predominantly transformed to selenocysteine to facilitate selenoproteins synthesis in normal cells, while metabolize to cytotoxic SeO32&#8208; based on the oxidative intracellular redox environment of cancer cells. Resultantly, selenium nanoclusters exhibit significant cell proliferation inhibition ability to cancer cells and impressive safety to normal cells. Taken together, this study not only clarifies the chemical nature of the atom engineering of selenium nanocluster, but also elucidates its intracellular redox environment&#8208;oriented anticancer mechanism.</dc:description>

Herein, we engineer Se-Se/Se-S bond to assemble selenium nanoclusters with intracellular redox environment-driven selective structure. Chemical structure analysis reveals that, the bonding of sulfur atom in intermediates to the two neighboring or interposition selenium atoms in selenium rings is the key internal driving force for nanoparticle cluster formation. This nanocluster can be predominantly transformed to selenocysteine to facilitate selenoproteins synthesis in normal cells, while metabolize to cytotoxic SeO32- based on the oxidative intracellular redox environment of cancer cells. Resultantly, selenium nanoclusters exhibit significant cell proliferation inhibition ability to cancer cells and impressive safety to normal cells. Taken together, this study not only clarifies the chemical nature of the atom engineering of selenium nanocluster, but also elucidates its intracellular redox environment-oriented anticancer mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Mechanical Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Stiffens Tumor Cells to Potentiate Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor progression is associated with tumor&#8208;cell softening. Improving the stiffness of the tumor cells can make them more vulnerable to lymphocyte&#8208;mediated attack. Tumor cell membranes typically exhibit higher cholesterol levels than normal cells, making tumor cells soft. Herein, we demonstrate a mechanical immune checkpoint inhibitor (MICI) formulated by cyclodextrin (CD) lipids and fusogenic lipids. Through fusing CD lipids into the tumor cell membrane using a fusogenic liposome formulation, the cholesterol in the plasma membrane is reduced due to the specific host&#8211;guest interactions between CD lipid and cholesterol. As a result, tumor cells are stiffened, and the activation of lymphocytes (including NK and cytotoxic effector T cells) is improved when contacting the stiffened tumor cells, characterized by robust degranulation and effector cytokine production. Notably, this treatment has negligible influence on the infiltration and proliferation of lymphocytes in tumor tissues, confirming that the enhanced antitumor efficacy should result from activating a specific number of lymphocytes caused by direct regulation of the tumor cell stiffness. The combination of MICIs and clinical immunotherapies enhances the lymphocyte&#8208;mediated antitumor effects in two tumor mouse models, including breast cancer and melanoma. Our research also reveals an unappreciated mechanical dimension to lymphocyte activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Crucial of Spatial Al Distribution to Realize Precise Alkali&#8208;Treatment for Target Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing mesoporous structure within zeolites by alkali&#8208;treatment is an effective protocol to improve their diffusion properties. However, undesirable changes in Br&#246;nsted acid site (BAS) densities always offset this advantage in acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions. In this context, the crucial roles of spatial aluminum&#160;distribution were unraveled during alkali&#8208;treatment of MFI zeolite and the desirable BAS density was achieved in obtained hierarchical samples for the target reactions. Various characterization methods, particularly the multiple one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning (MAS) NMR techniques, were performed to track the alkali&#8208;treatment processes. For the sample with a more uniform spatial Al distribution, more tetrahedral Al sites would fall off and migrate around the Si&#8208;OH in zeolite as Al(OH)4&#8208;. Those re&#8208;deposited Al(OH)4&#8208; sites were easily transformed into NMR&#8208;invisible Al sites during the calcination process, which contributed negligibly to both Br&#246;nsted and Lewis acidities, thus being referred to&#8220;acid&#8208;free&#8221;Al species. While most tetrahedral Al sites were preserved after the alkali&#8208;treatment of sample with non&#8208;uniform Al distribution and the BAS density gradually increased with treatment time. According to the requirements of typical acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions, such as catalytic cracking of 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene and methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins, the desired hierarchical zeolite catalysts were developed by matching the amounts of extracted Si and generated&#8220;acid&#8208;free&#8221;Al during the precise alkali&#8208;treatment.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Real&#8208;time monitoring of molecular transformations is crucial for advancements in biotechnology. In this study, we introduce a novel self&#8208;assembling 19F&#8208;labeled nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probe that disassembles upon interaction with various nucleotides. This interaction not only activates the 19F signals but also produces distinct signatures for each specific component, thereby enabling precise identification and quantification of molecules in evolving samples. We demonstrate the capability of this probe for real&#8208;time monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and screening potential enzyme inhibitors. These applications highlight the probe's significant potential in enzyme analysis, drug development, and disease diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery, Total Synthesis, and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Evaluation of Naturally Occurring Naphthopyrone&#8208;Macrolide Hybrids as Potent NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, gymnoasins A&#8208;C, were discovered from an Antarctic fungus, and biomimetic asymmetric synthesis of gymnoasin A was achieved. Gymnoasin A significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, providing a valuable new drug lead for the development of novel therapeutics targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome.







Abstract
Numerous clinical disorders have been linked to the etiology of dysregulated NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain&#8208;containing protein 3) inflammasome activation. Despite its potential as a pharmacological target, modulation of NLRP3 activity remains challenging. Only a sparse number of compounds have been reported that can modulate NLRP3 and none of them have been developed into a commercially available drug. In this research, we identified three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, gymnoasins A&#8208;C (1&#8211;3), with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, from an Antarctic fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. HDN17&#8208;895, which represent the first naturally occurring naphthopyrone&#8208;macrolide hybrids. Additionally, biomimetic synthesis of gymnoasin A (1) was also achieved validating the chemical structure and affording ample amounts of material for exhaustive bioactivity assessments. Biological assays indicated that 1 could significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, representing a valuable new lead compound for the development of novel therapeutics with the potential to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome.

         <title>Photocatalytic Direct Para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Amination of Benzyl Alcohols: Selectivity Independent of Side Substituents</title>

A photocatalytic para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H amination of benzyl alcohols whose reactivity and site selectivity are independent of existing side substituents is disclosed.







Abstract
Aminoarenes are important molecules for broad applications in nearly all modern industries that involve chemicals. Direct and site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond amination of arenes provides the most efficient and convenient method to prepare aminoarenes. A main challenge is to selectively install the amino group (or other functional groups) to the distal para&#8208;carbon of arenes (especially multi&#8208;substituted arenes) during the C&#8722;H bond functionalization events. Herein, we address this problem by designing a new strategy via a sequential radical dearomatization/radical amination/rearomatization process for para&#8208;selective amination of benzyl alcohols. The para&#8208;selectivity of our reaction is completely independent of the electronic and steric properties of the other substituents of the arene substrates. Aminoarenes with many substituents (up to full substitution) and diverse substitution patterns, including those difficult to synthesize previously, could be readily prepared using our protocols. Further exploration of the current strategy shall lead to other challenging C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes.

         <title>In vivo Metabolic Sensing of Hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate in Mice Using a Recyclable Perfluorinated Iridium Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange Catalyst</title>

Hyperpolarization enhances pyruvate signal, enabling real&#8208;time metabolic flux monitoring by MRI. Our study presents a novel method, achieving a 22% increase in hyperpolarized in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate's enhancement using Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) with a perfluorinated Iridium catalyst in a fluorinated solvent/methanol blend. This catalyst enables easy separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and allowing in vivo metabolic sensing in human pancreatic xenografts.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time visualization of metabolic processes in vivo provides crucial insights into conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), by amplifying the signal of pyruvate molecules through hyperpolarization, enables non&#8208;invasive monitoring of metabolic fluxes, aiding in understanding disease progression and treatment response. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) presents a simpler, cost&#8208;effective alternative to dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, eliminating the need for expensive equipment and complex procedures. We present the first in vivo demonstration of metabolic sensing in a human pancreatic cancer xenograft model compared to healthy mice. A novel perfluorinated Iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend facilitated this breakthrough with a 1.2&#8208;fold increase in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate SABRE hyperpolarization. The perfluorinated moiety allowed easy separation of the heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;containing catalyst from the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate target. The perfluorinated catalyst exhibited recyclability, maintaining SABRE&#8208;SHEATH activity through subsequent hyperpolarization cycles with minimal activity loss after the initial two cycles. Remarkably, the catalyst retained activity for at least 10&#8197;cycles, with a 3.3&#8208;fold decrease in hyperpolarization potency. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study encourages wider adoption of SABRE hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate MR for studying in vivo metabolism, aiding in diagnosing stages and monitoring treatment responses in cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Harnessing Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions for Water&#8208;Lean Solvation Chemistry: Achieving High&#8208;Stability Zn Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate with high permanent dipole moments effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, forming a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+ and improved interfacial characteristics of electrodes, thus improving the Zn plating/stripping reversibility.







Abstract
The reversibility and stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are largely limited by water&#8208;induced interfacial parasitic reactions. Here, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate (DP) is introduced to tailor primary solvation sheath and inner&#8208;Helmholtz configurations for robust zinc anode. Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, DP with high permanent dipole moments can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Thus, interfacial side reactions can be suppressed through a shielding effect. Meanwhile, lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of DP also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Thus, these merits endow the Zn anode with a high&#8208;stability performance exceeds 3800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Cu batteries. Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH4V4O10 cell maintains 80.3&#8201;% of initial discharge capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4&#8201;% against to the initial capacity during the self&#8208;discharge characterizations.

A highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described, which provides an expedient route to the preparation of polysubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive manifold.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described. Herein, critical challenges including site&#8208; and chemoselectivity control are well addressed through C&#8722;H thianthrenation and C&#8722;S alkenylation, thereby providing an expedient access to stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive fashion. Indeed, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille&#8208;alkenylation of poly(pseudo)halogenated arenes displays privileged capability to differentiate C&#8722;S over C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl bonds, as well as oxygen&#8208;based triflates (C&#8722;OTf), tosylates (C&#8722;OTs), carbamates and sulfamates under mild reaction conditions. Sequential and multiple cross&#8208;couplings via selective C&#8722;X functionalization should be widely applicable for increasing functional molecular complexity. Modular installation of stereospecific alkene motifs into pharmaceuticals illustrated the synthetic application of the present protocol in drug discovery.

         <title>Deciphering Pauling's Third Rule: Uncovering Strong Anharmonicity and Exceptionally Low Thermal Conductivity in TlAgSe for Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can provide structural instability required to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity. TlAgSe shows low lattice thermal conductivity and promising thermoelectric performance due to strong anharmonicity and correlated atomic rattling because of Pauling's third rule.







Abstract
The elucidation of chemical bonding, coupled with an exploration of the correlated dynamics of constituent atoms, is essential for unravelling the underlying mechanism responsible for low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) exhibited by a crystalline solid, which is essential for thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. In this regard, Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can bring about the lattice instability required to suppress the &#954;L. Here, we demonstrate the presence of such instability in a ternary selenide, TlAgSe, leading to a ultra&#8208;low &#954;L of 0.17&#8197;W/m.K at 573&#8197;K. Our study reveals the instability arising from Ag&#8722;Ag repulsion within edge&#8208;shared AgSe4 tetrahedra through investigation of the local structure using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and supported by first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations. We observe correlation between weakening in the Ag and the Tl&#8208;sublattice, providing direct experimental evidence of Pauling's third empirical rule. The correlated rattling of Ag and Tl induces a highly anharmonic lattice and low energy optical phonons, resulting in suppressed sound velocity and ultralow &#954;L in TlAgSe. The electronic origin of soft and anharmonic lattice is the presence of filled antibonding states in the valence band near the Fermi level constructed by Ag(4d)&#8722;Se(4p) and Tl(6s)&#8722;Se(4p) interactions. This work demonstrates that the evidence of dynamic distortion in a crystal lattice is governed by the third empirical rule given by Pauling, which can act as a potential new strategy for diminishing &#954;L in crystalline solids.

         <title>Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Tin(II) Oxidation for Efficient Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

Benzaldehyde oxime is introduced into the mixed Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite precursor to inhibit the oxidation of Sn(II), which can also regulate the crystallization and improve the electronic structure of the perovskite film, ultimately resulting in enhanced long&#8208;term stability and performance of devices.







Abstract
Despite numerous studies have reported the inhibition of tin (II) oxidation in mixed tin&#8208;lead halide perovskite, there remains a dearth of mechanistic information regarding how tin (II) undergoes oxidation in the precursor solution, particularly in terms of the involvement of DMSO. We here take advantage of density functional theory (DFT) to uncover that SnI2 can coordinate with DMSO and react with singlet oxygen, resulting in the generation of Sn (IV). Moreover, our DFT simulations reveal that benzaldehyde oxime (BZHO) competes with SnI2 in reacting with oxygen through the Alder&#8208;ene reaction, hence effectively restraining the oxidation of tin (II), which is further verified by several experimental characterizations. Besides, the introduction of BZHO has also regulated the crystallization of the perovskite film and modified the electronic structure of the perovskite surface. As a result, the perovskite solar cells with the addition of BZHO demonstrate superior performance and operational stability, retaining 82&#8201;% of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination for 800&#8197;hours. Furthermore, the efficiency of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells treated with BZHO reached 26.76&#8201;%. Therefore, this work presents a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;performance and stable all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.

         <title>Scalable and Sustainable Zinc (II) Ions&#8208;Glue&#8208;Assisted Conversion of Biomass Waste Bits into Carbon Aerogels for Efficient Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a new strategy for carbon aerogel generation by cross&#8208;linking biomass bits with zinc ionic glue. Zn2+ ions as the glue cleavage cellulose hydrogen bonds of natural biomass, then facilitate dehydration crosslinking reaction between cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin for re&#8208;constructing the whole block structure. This strategy provides a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective way for large&#8208;scale preparation and application of aerogel materials, which will open up a range of applications relevant to extraction separation, catalysis, insulation, and other fields.







Abstract
Carbon aerogels (CAs) have garnered significant attention due to their multifunctional applications. Biomass waste, abundantly generated by agriculture and industry, serves as a primary carbon source. However, developing a facile, sustainable, and efficient method to produce CAs from biomass waste remains challenging. In this study, a one&#8208;step Zn2+ ion&#8208;glue&#8208;assisted carbonization technique was developed to produce large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance CAs. Various biomass materials (wood bits, peanut shells, bamboo bits, and straw waste) were treated in a molten salt system (ZnCl2/KCl) at 300&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h to obtain large&#8208;block CAs derived from biomass bits. Zn2+ ions cleave cellulose hydrogen bonds in natural biomass, facilitating the dehydration crosslinking reaction among cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, thus reconstructing the entire block structure. The resulting CAs exhibited high porosity (95&#8201;%) and low density (0.078&#8197;g/cm3). Numerous hydroxyl and carbonyl groups were preserved during the low&#8208;temperature treatment, facilitating chemical modification for diverse applications. For instance, amidoxime functionalized CAs were utilized as filters for selective and highly efficient extraction of U(VI) from wastewater. The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency reached 801.2&#8197;mg/g and 95&#8201;% with a flux rate of 6.1&#215;103&#8197;L/m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h.

         <title>A Photocaged Microtubule&#8208;Stabilising Epothilone Allows Spatiotemporal Control of Cytoskeletal Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocaged epothilone has been developed to fill the unmet need for a high&#8208;performance optically triggered microtubule (MT) stabiliser. A one&#8208;pot synthesis from commercial epothilone delivered CouEpo, whose 100&#8208;fold bioactivity turn&#8208;on upon visible&#8208;light photouncaging led to sub&#8208;nanomolar potency, allowing high spatial and temporal resolution control of MT structure and dynamics in live cells during GFP imaging.







Abstract
The cytoskeleton is essential for spatial and temporal organisation of a wide range of cellular and tissue&#8208;level processes, such as proliferation, signalling, cargo transport, migration, morphogenesis, and neuronal development. Cytoskeleton research aims to study these processes by imaging, or by locally manipulating, the dynamics and organisation of cytoskeletal proteins with high spatiotemporal resolution: which matches the capabilities of optical methods. To date, no photoresponsive microtubule&#8208;stabilising tool has united all the features needed for a practical high&#8208;precision reagent: a low potency and biochemically stable non&#8208;illuminated state; then an efficient, rapid, and clean photoresponse that generates a high potency illuminated state; plus good solubility at suitable working concentrations; and efficient synthetic access. We now present CouEpo, a photocaged epothilone microtubule&#8208;stabilising reagent that combines these needs. Its potency increases approximately 100&#8208;fold upon irradiation by violet/blue light to reach low&#8208;nanomolar values, allowing efficient photocontrol of microtubule dynamics in live cells, and even the generation of cellular asymmetries in microtubule architecture and cell dynamics. CouEpo is thus a high&#8208;performance tool compound that can support high&#8208;precision research into many microtubule&#8208;associated processes, from biophysics to transport, cell motility, and neuronal physiology.

         <title>Enzyme Machinery for Bacterial Glucoside Metabolism through a Conserved Non&#8208;hydrolytic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway of glucoside conversion in four steps is widely conserved in bacteria and is encoded from a discrete genomic locus (GUL). The GUL pathways involve metallocenter lyases that cleave C3&#8208;oxidized glucosides with broad specificity and hydrate the resulting glycal elimination product. The structural and mechanistic basis for these reactions is presented, and GUL genomic diversity in bacteria is explored.







Abstract
The flexible acquisition of substrates from nutrient pools is critical for microbes to prevail in competitive environments. To acquire glucose from diverse glycoside and disaccharide substrates, many free&#8208;living and symbiotic bacteria have developed, alongside hydrolysis, a non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway comprised of four biochemical steps and conferred from a single glycoside utilization gene locus (GUL). Mechanistically, this pathway integrates within the framework of oxidation and reduction at the glucosyl/glucose C3, the eliminative cleavage of the glycosidic bond and the addition of water in two consecutive lyase&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, based on study of enzymes from the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we reveal a conserved Mn2+ metallocenter active site in both lyases and identify the structural requirements for specific catalysis to elimination of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides and water addition to the resulting 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;glycal product, yielding 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucose. Extending our search of GUL&#8208;encoded putative lyases to the human gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, we discover a Ca2+ metallocenter active site in a putative glycoside hydrolase&#8208;like protein and demonstrate its catalytic function in the eliminative cleavage of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides of opposite (&#945;) anomeric configuration as preferred by the A. tumefaciens enzyme (&#946;). Structural and biochemical comparisons reveal the molecular&#8208;mechanistic origin of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucoside lyase stereo&#8208;complementarity. Our findings identify a basic set of GUL&#8208;encoded lyases for glucoside metabolism and assign physiological significance to GUL genetic diversity in the bacterial domain of life.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Silylene&#8208;Supported Aluminium Atoms with Aluminylene and Alane Character</title>

         <dc:description>
A transient aluminylene intermediate supported by a pincer bis&#8208;silylene ligand is proposed to form from the reduction of its iodide precursor. It rapidly dimerizes in a [2+2] cycloaddition to give the isolable Si2Al2 heterocycle. In the presence of Fe0, the aluminylene can be stabilized as a dative AlI&#8594;Fe0 type complex. The Fe0&#8208;aluminylene complex transforms in solution to foster a silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated Fe0 complex.







Abstract
The suitability of electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;silylenes, specifically the neutral chelating [SiII(Xant)SiII] ligand (SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si, Xant=9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) and the anionic [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]&#8722; pincer ligand (NAcrid=2,7,9,9&#8208;tetramethylacridane), has been successfully probed to stabilize monovalent bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;supported aluminium complexes (aluminylenes). At first, the unprecedented aluminium(III) iodide precursors [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlI2+ I&#8722; 1 and [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]AlI2 2 were synthesized using AlI3 and [SiII(Xant)SiII] or [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Li(OEt2)], respectively, and structurally characterized. While reduction of 1 with KC8 led merely to unidentified products, the dehalogenation of 2 afforded the dimer of the desired {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} aluminylene with a four&#8208;membered SiIV2AlIII2 ring. Remarkably, the proposed aluminylene intermediates [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlII and {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} could be produced through reaction of 1 and 2 with Collman's reagent, K2Fe(CO)4, and trapped as AlI:&#8594;Fe(CO)4 complexes 5 and 6, respectively. While 6 is stable in solution, 5 loses one CO ligand in solution to afford the silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated iron(0) complex 7 from an intramolecular substitution reaction. The electronic structures of the novel compounds were investigated by Density Functional Theory calculations.

         <title>Molecular Recognition in Mechanochemistry: Insights from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemically&#8208;induced molecular recognition processes have been studied by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy using &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA), serine, and alanine as representative substrates. To disentangle different mechanochemical effects, a mixer mill and a resonant acoustic mixer were applied as mixing devices.







Abstract
Molecular&#8208;recognition events are highly relevant in biology and chemistry. In the present study, we investigated such processes in the solid state under mechanochemical conditions using the formation of racemic phases upon reacting enantiopure entities as example. As test systems, &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA) and the amino acids serine and alanine were used. The effects of ball&#8208;milling and resonant acoustic mixing (RAM) on the formation of racemic phases were probed by using solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In a mixer mill, a highly efficient and fast racemic phase formation occurred for both TFLA and the two amino acids. RAM led to the racemic phase for TFLA also, and this process was facilitated upon employing pre&#8208;milled enantiopure entities. In contrast, under comparable conditions RAM did not result in the formation of racemic phases for serine and alanine.

         <title>Highly Tough Slide&#8208;Crosslinked Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) was meticulously designed and prepared for lithium metal batteries. The incorporation of the slide&#8208;ring structure endows SCGPE with excellent toughness and superior electrochemical properties. This structure provides fast Li+ ion transport pathways while restricting the mobility of TFSI&#8722; anions, thereby promoting uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) hold great promise for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. However, conventional GPEs hardly resists lithium dendrites growth and maintains long&#8208;term cycling stability of the battery due to its poor mechanical performance. Inspired by the slide&#8208;ring structure of polyrotaxanes (PRs), herein we developed a dynamic slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) with extraordinary stretchability of 970.93&#8201;% and mechanical strength of 1.15&#8197;MPa, which is helpful to buffer the volume change of electrodes and maintain mechanical integrity of the battery structure during cycling. Notably, the PRs structures can provide fast ion transport channels to obtain high ionic conductivity of 1.73&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the strong polar groups in SCGPE restrict the free movement of anions to achieve high lithium&#8208;ion transference number of 0.71, which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Benefiting from these features, the constructed Li|SCGPE&#8208;3|LFP cells exhibit ultra&#8208;long and stable cycle life over 1000 cycles and high&#8208;capacity retention (89.6&#8201;% after 1000 cycles). Even at a high rate of 16&#8197;C, the cells deliver a high capacity of 79.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The slide&#8208;crosslinking strategy in this work provides a new perspective on the design of advanced GPEs for LMBs.

         <title>Hexa&#8208;atom Pt Catalyst Fabricated by a Ligand Engineering Strategy for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an atomically precise supported Pt6 nanocluster catalyst (Pt6/OCNT) was designed by the ligand engineering strategy. The well&#8208;defined Pt6/OCNT, with fully exposed Pt sites and unique electronic structures, showed superior acidic hydrogen oxidation performance with the highest mass activity compared to those of the corresponding Pt SAC (Pt1/OCNT) and Pt/C.







Abstract
Atomically precise supported nanocluster catalysts (APSNCs), which feature exact atomic composition, well&#8208;defined structures, and unique catalytic properties, offer an exceptional platform for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship at the atomic level. However, fabricating APSNCs with precisely controlled and uniform metal atom numbers, as well as maintaining a stable structure, remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable dispersion and easy aggregation during synthetic and catalytic processes. Herein, we developed an effective ligand engineering strategy to construct a Pt6 nanocluster catalyst stabilized on oxidized carbon nanotubes (Pt6/OCNT). The structural analysis revealed that Pt6 nanoclusters in Pt6/OCNT were fully exposed and exhibited a planar structure. Furthermore, the obtained Pt6/OCNT exhibited outstanding acidic HOR performances with a high mass activity of 18.37&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 along with excellent stability during a 24&#8197;h constant operation and good CO tolerance, surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the unique geometric and electronic structures of Pt6 nanoclusters on OCNT altered the hydrogen adsorption energies on catalytic sites and thus lowered the HOR theoretical overpotential. This work presents a new prospect for designing and synthesizing advanced APSNCs for efficient energy electrocatalysis.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; along with excellent stability during a 24&#8197;h constant operation and good CO tolerance, surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the unique geometric and electronic structures of Pt&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters on OCNT altered the hydrogen adsorption energies on catalytic sites and thus lowered the HOR theoretical overpotential. This work presents a new prospect for designing and synthesizing advanced APSNCs for efficient energy electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Polyrotaxane Networks with Collective Motions of Multiple Main&#8208;Chain Mechanical Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the microscopic collective motion of mechanical bonds in Type&#8208;II main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane (PR) backbones and the macroscopic mechanical performance of the resulting PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs) have been investigated. The synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of the PRMINs.







Abstract
Type&#8197;I main&#8208;chain polyrotaxanes (PRs) with multiple wheels threaded onto the axle are widely employed to design slide&#8208;ring materials. However, Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PRs with axles threading into the macrocycles on the polymer backbones have rarely been studied, although they feature special topological structures and dynamic characteristics. Herein, we report the design and preparation of Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs), based on which the relationship between microscopic motion of mechanical bonds on the PRs and macroscopic mechanical performance of materials has been revealed. The representative PRMIN&#8208;2 exhibits a robust feature in tensile tests with high stretchability (1680&#8201;%) and toughness (47.5&#8197;MJ/m3). Moreover, it also has good puncture performance with puncture energy of 22.0&#8197;mJ. Detailed rheological measurements and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation reveal that the embedded multiple [2]rotaxane mechanical bonds on the PR backbones of PRMINs could undergo a synergistic long&#8208;range sliding motion under external force, with the introduction of collective dangling chains into the network. As a result, the synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of PRMINs.

         <title>An Active and Regenerable Nanometric High&#8208;Entropy Catalyst for Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high&#8208;entropy nanoparticles, Pt atoms are fully isolated to form atomically dispersed Pt sites through coordination with other metals, exhibiting higher propane dehydrogenation activity and resistance to sintering. The formation of high&#8208;entropy structures enables reversible regeneration of the catalyst during oxidative and reductive treatments.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is crucial for propylene production, but commercially employed Pt&#8208;based catalysts face susceptibility to deactivation due to the Pt sintering during reaction and regeneration steps. Here, we report a SiO2 supported nanometric (MnCoCuZnPt) high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst with high activity and stability. The catalyst exhibited a super high propane conversion of 56.6&#8201;% with 94&#8201;% selectivity of propylene at 600&#8201;&#176;C. The propylene productivity reached 68.5&#8197;molC3H6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, nearly three times that of Pt/SiO2 (23.5&#8197;molC3H6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) under a weight hourly space velocity of 60&#8197;h&#8722;1. In a high&#8208;entropy nanoparticle, Pt atoms were atomically dispersed through coordination with other metals and exhibited a positive charge, thereby showcasing remarkable catalytic activity. The high&#8208;entropy effect contributes to the catalyst a superior stability with a low deactivation constant of 0.0004&#8197;h&#8722;1 during 200&#8197;hours of reaction under the industrial gas composition at 550&#8201;&#176;C. Such high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst is easy regenerated through simple air combustion of deposited coke. After the fourth consecutive regeneration cycle, satisfactory catalytic stability was observed, and the element distribution of spent catalysts almost returned to their initial state, with no detectable Pt sintering. This work provides new insights into designing active, stable, and regenerable novel PDH catalysts.

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Perylene&#8208;Diimide Polymer as Universal Cathode Interlayer for Conventional, Inverted, and Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymer PPDINN was designed and synthesized by utilizing oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) as linkage, exhibiting pronounced n&#8208;doping effect, improved film&#8208;forming ability and good solvent resistance of the polymer film. By using PPDINN as cathode interlayer, excellent photovoltaic performances were achieved in conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells.







Abstract
As a class of predominantly used cathode interlayers (CILs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI)&#8208;based polymers exhibit intriguing characteristics of excellent charge transporting capacity and suitable energy levels. Despite that, PDI&#8208;based CILs with satisfied film&#8208;forming ability and adequate solvent resistance are rather rare, which not only limits the further advance of OSC performances but also hinders the practical use of PDI CILs. Herein, we designed and synthesized two non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymers for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in diverse types of OSCs. The utilization of oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) linkage enhanced the n&#8208;doping effect of PDI polymers, leading to an improved ability of the CIL to reduce work function and improve electron transporting capability. Moreover, the introduction of the non&#8208;ionic OEG chain effectively improve the wetting property and solvent resistance of PDI polymers, so the PPDINN CIL can withstand diverse processing conditions in fabricating different OSCs, including conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated devices. The binary OSC with conventional structure using PPDINN CIL showed a PCE of 18.6&#8201;%, along with an improved device stability. Besides, PPDINN is compatible with the large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating technique, and a PCE of 16.6&#8201;% was achieved in the 1&#8208;cm2 OSC where a blade&#8208;coated PPDINN was used.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular Duplexes Displaying Duplex&#8208;to&#8208;Duplex Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular duplexes stabilized by up to 10 hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs between indolocarbazole and pyridine units have been investigated. In the presence of water, these duplexes transform into hydrated duplexes with water molecules inserted into the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in an all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing manner. The two distinct forms can be reversibly switched through temperature changes, with characteristic signals observed spectroscopically.







Abstract
Synthetic duplexes with high stabilities have promising potential for mimicking biomolecular functions and developing supramolecular smart materials. Herein, we describe the synthesis and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of molecular duplexes derived from indolocarbazole&#8211;pyridine (I&#8722;P) oligomers. These duplexes adopt nonclassical helical structures, stabilized by I&#8722;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in anhydrous chlorinated solvents. Notably, the longest duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 displays remarkable stability, forming twenty hydrogen bonds; its exchange energy barrier was determined to be &#916;G&#8800;=22.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous (CDCl2)2. Upon the addition of water, a hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was formed, with one water molecule inserted between each I&#8722;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pair. The Hill coefficient (n) for this process is 6.1, demonstrating extremely positive cooperativity. Conversely, the hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was completely converted into the original anhydrous duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 when the temperature was increased. Interconversion between these two distinct duplexes can be repeatedly carried out by varying the temperature. Furthermore, reversible switching between hetero&#8208;duplexes and homo&#8208;duplexes was also demonstrated by controlling the temperature, with concomitant changes in the characteristic emission signals.

Herein, we describe the synthesis and stimuli-responsive properties of molecular duplexes derived from indolocarbazole&#8211;pyridine (I&#8722;P) oligomers. These duplexes adopt nonclassical helical structures, stabilized by I&#8722;P hydrogen-bonding pairs in anhydrous chlorinated solvents. Notably, the longest duplex &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (11-mer)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; displays remarkable stability, forming twenty hydrogen bonds; its exchange energy barrier was determined to be &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;=22.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 75&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous (CDCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Upon the addition of water, a hydrated duplex &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (11-mer)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8835;10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was formed, with one water molecule inserted between each I&#8722;P hydrogen-bonding pair. The Hill coefficient (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) for this process is 6.1, demonstrating extremely positive cooperativity. Conversely, the hydrated duplex &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (11-mer)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8835;10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was completely converted into the original anhydrous duplex &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (11-mer)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when the temperature was increased. Interconversion between these two distinct duplexes can be repeatedly carried out by varying the temperature. Furthermore, reversible switching between hetero-duplexes and homo-duplexes was also demonstrated by controlling the temperature, with concomitant changes in the characteristic emission signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Se&#8208;dopant Modulated Selective Co&#8208;Insertion of H+ and Zn2+ in MnO2 for High&#8208;Capacity and Durable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Selenium doping significantly boosts both the capacity and structural stability of MnO2 as the cathode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In situ spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that this improvement results from reduced interaction between Zn2+ ions and the MnO2 host, as well as increased interaction between H+ ions and MnO2. These factors alleviate lattice strain during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation and suppress the formation of the ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;product. Moreover, modified Mn&#8722;O bond lengths upon Zn2+ insertion help alleviate Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, easing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion.







Abstract
MnO2 is commonly used as the cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The strong Coulombic interaction between Zn ions and the MnO2 lattice causes significant lattice distortion and, combined with the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, results in Mn2+ dissolution and structural collapse. While proton intercalation can reduce lattice distortion, it changes the electrolyte pH, producing chemically inert byproducts. These issues greatly affect the reversibility of Zn2+ intercalation/extraction, leading to significant capacity degradation of MnO2. Herein, we propose a novel method to enhance the cycling stability of &#948;&#8208;MnO2 through selenium doping (Se&#8722;MnO2). Our work indicates that varying the selenium doping content can regulate the intercalation ratio of H+ in MnO2, thereby suppressing the formation of ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;products. Se doping mitigates the lattice strain of MnO2 during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation by reducing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion, modifying Mn&#8722;O bond length upon Zn2+ insertion, and alleviating Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect. The optimized Se&#8722;MnO2 (Se concentration of 0.8&#8197;at.%) deposited on carbon nanotube demonstrates a notable capacity of 386&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with exceptional long&#8208;term cycle stability, retaining 102&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 capacity after 5000 cycles at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Spatioselective Occlusion of Copolymer Nanoparticles within Calcite Crystals Generates Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials with Controlled Internal Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

This study provides a powerful yet straightforward way to regulate the internal composition and structure of a single calcite crystal, generating a series of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials where the organic additives are preferentially distributed within specific regions of the inorganic host crystals.







Abstract
Efficient occlusion of particulate additives into a single crystal has garnered an ever&#8208;increasing attention in materials science because it offers a counter&#8208;intuitive yet powerful platform to make crystalline nanocomposite materials with emerging properties. However, precisely controlling the spatial distribution of the guest additives within a host crystal remains highly challenging. We herein demonstrate a unique, straightforward method to engineer the spatial distribution of copolymer nanoparticles within calcite (CaCO3) single crystals by judiciously adjusting initial [Ca2+] concentration used for the calcite precipitation. More specifically, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is employed to synthesize well&#8208;defined and highly anionic poly(3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium)41&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)500 [PSPMA41&#8208;PBzMA500] diblock copolymer nanoparticles, which are subsequently used as model additives during the growth of calcite crystals. Impressively, such guest nanoparticles are preferentially occluded into specific regions of calcite depending on the initial [Ca2+] concentration. These unprecedented phenomena are most probably caused by dynamic change in electrostatic interaction between Ca2+ ions and PSPMA41 chains based on systematic investigations. This study not only showcases a significant advancement in controlling the spatial distribution of guest nanoparticles within host crystals, enabling the internal structure of composite crystals to be rationally tailored via a spatioselective occlusion strategy, but also provides new insights into biomineralization.

         <title>Metabolic Response to Small Molecule Therapy in Colorectal Cancer Tracked with Raman Spectroscopy and Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite advances in cancer therapies, effective screening tools that a priori predict treatment efficacy remain underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy to evaluate metabolic changes at the single cell level in response to cytostatic inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells. Classical machine learning approaches applied to Raman data allowed for the differentiation of responders and nonresponders of treatment and a scoring model that could be generalized to new treatment combinations.







Abstract
Despite numerous screening tools for colorectal cancer (CRC), 25&#8201;% of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease. Novel diagnostic technologies that are early, accurate, and rapid are imperative to assess the therapeutic efficacy of clinical drugs and identify new biomarkers of treatment response. Here Raman spectroscopy (RS) was used to track metabolic reprogramming in KRAS&#8208;mutant HCT116 and SW837 cells, and KRAS wild&#8208;type CC cells. RS combined with multivariate analysis methods distinguished nonresponsive, partially responsive, and responsive cells treated with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody for EGFR inhibition, sotorasib, a clinically approved KRAS inhibitor, and various doses of trametinib, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. Cells treated with a combination of subtoxic doses of trametinib and BKM120, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, showed a synergistic response between the two pathways. Using a supervised machine learning regression model, we established a scoring methodology trained to a priori predict therapeutic response to new treatment combinations. RS metabolites were verified with mass spectrometry, and enrichment pathways were identified, including amino acid, purine, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism that differentiated monotherapy from combination therapy. Our approach may ultimately be applicable to patient&#8208;derived primary cells and cultures of patient tumors to predict effective drugs for individualized care.

         <title>Hierarchical Dual&#8208;Mode Efficient Tunable Afterglow via J&#8208;Aggregates in Single&#8208;Phosphor&#8208;Doped Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coexistence of isolated states and J&#8208;aggregate states in a single&#8208;phosphor&#8208;doped polymeric system has enabled hierarchical dual&#8208;mode organic persistent luminescence to be achieved. The doped polymeric system generates a two&#8208;step temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color with excitation&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsiveness.







Abstract
The development of polymer&#8208;based persistent luminescence materials with color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow and multiple responses is highly desirable for applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, flexible displays, and data&#8208;storage.

     alt="Hierarchical Dual-Mode Efficient Tunable Afterglow via J-Aggregates in Single-Phosphor-Doped Polymer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coexistence of isolated states and J-aggregate states in a single-phosphor-doped polymeric system has enabled hierarchical dual-mode organic persistent luminescence to be achieved. The doped polymeric system generates a two-step temperature-dependent afterglow color with excitation- and humidity-responsiveness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of polymer-based persistent luminescence materials with color-tunable organic afterglow and multiple responses is highly desirable for applications in anti-counterfeiting, flexible displays, and data-storage. However, achieving efficient persistent luminescence from a single-phosphor system with multiple responses remains a challenging task. Herein, by doping 9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (PI2) into an amorphous polyacrylamide matrix, a hierarchical dual-mode emission system is developed, which exhibits color-tunable afterglow due to excitation-, temperature-, and humidity-dependence. Notably, the coexistence of the isolated state and J-aggregate state of the guest molecule not only provides an excitation-dependent afterglow color, but also leads to a hierarchical temperature-dependent afterglow color resulting from different thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) behaviors of the isolated and aggregated states. The complex responsiveness based on the hierarchical dual-mode emission can serve for security features through inkjet printing and ink-writing. These findings may provide further insight into the regulated persistent luminescence by isolated and aggregated phosphors in doped polymer systems and expand the scope of stimuli-responsive organic afterglow materials for broader applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Embedding Single Pd Atoms on NiGa Intermetallic Surfaces for Efficient and Selective Alkyne Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pd is embedded onto the NiGa intermetallic surface to promote alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenations as exemplified by acetylene hydrogenation here. The synergistic effect of single&#8208;atom Pd with the neighbouring Ni sites is shown to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Catalytic removal of alkynes is essential in industry for producing polymer&#8208;grade alkenes from steam cracking processes. Non&#8208;noble Ni&#8208;based catalysts hold promise as effective alternatives to industrial Pd&#8208;based catalysts but suffer from low activity. Here we report embedding of single&#8208;atom Pd onto the NiGa intermetallic surface with replacing Ga atoms via a well&#8208;defined synthesis strategy to design Pd1&#8722;NiGa catalyst for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The fabricated Pd1Ni2Ga1 ensemble sites deliver remarkably higher specific mass activity under superb alkene selectivity of &gt;96&#8201;% than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts under industry&#8208;relevant conditions. Integrated experimental and computational studies reveal that the single&#8208;atom Pd synergizes with the neighbouring Ni sites to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption. Such synergistic effects confer the single&#8208;atom Pd on the NiGa intermetallic with a Midas touch for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation, providing an effective strategy for stimulating low active Ni&#8208;based catalysts for other selective hydrogenations in industry.

A unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, via regulation of solvation chemistry and addition of functional additives. As a result, liquid LIBs exhibited enhanced performance at ultrahigh temperatures at&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance and temperature&#8208;resistant lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &gt;60&#8201;&#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration. However, their applications were largely impeded by the poor electrochemical performance and unsatisfying safety issues, which were induced by the severe side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes at high temperatures. Herein, with the synergetic effects of solvation chemistry and functional additive in the elaborately designed weakly solvating electrolyte, a unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, which would effectively inhibit the constant decomposition of electrolytes and dissolution of transition metal ions, thus highly enhancing the high&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance. As a result, both cathodes and anodes, without compromising their low&#8208;temperature performance, can operate at temperatures &#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C, with excellent capacity retentions of 96.1&#8201;% after 500 cycles and 93.5&#8201;% after &#8805;200 cycles, respectively, at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Ah&#8208;level LiCoO2||graphite full cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.3&#8197;V also exhibited superior temperature&#8208;resistance with a capacity retention of 89.9&#8201;% at temperature as high as 120&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the fully charged pouch cells exhibited highly enhanced safety, demonstrating their potentials in practical applications at ultrahigh temperatures.

         <title>Small, Fluorinated Mn2+ Chelate as an Efficient 1H and 19F MRI Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Placed at an appropriate and controlled distance from the paramagnetic Mn2+ ion, 19F atoms in MnL1 experience adequate acceleration of their longitudinal relaxation, while the line&#8208;broadening effect remains moderate. This allows for efficient visualization of this small paramagnetic complex both in 19F and 1H MRI, also in the living mouse.







Abstract
We explore the potential of fluorine&#8208;containing small Mn2+ chelates as alternatives to perfluorinated nanoparticles, widely used as 19F MRI probes. In MnL1, the cyclohexanediamine skeleton and two piperidine rings, involving each a metal&#8208;coordinating amide group and an appended CF3 moiety, provide high rigidity to the complex. This allows for good control of the Mn&#8722;F distance (rMnF=8.2&#177;0.2&#8197;&#197; determined from 19F relaxation data), as well as for high kinetic inertness (a dissociation half&#8208;life of 1285&#8197;h is estimated for physiological conditions). The paramagnetic Mn2+ leads to a ~150&#8208;fold acceleration of the longitudinal 19F relaxation, with moderate line&#8208;broadening effect, resulting in T2/T1 ratios of 0.8 (9.4&#8197;T). Owing to its inner sphere water molecule, MnL1 is a good 1H relaxation agent as well (r1=5.36&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K, 20&#8197;MHz). MnL1 could be readily visualized in 19F MRI by using fast acquisition techniques, both in phantom images and living mice following intramuscular injection, with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and short acquisition times. While applications in targeted imaging or cell therapy monitoring require further optimisation of the molecular structure, these results argue for the potential of such small, monohydrated and fluorinated Mn2+ complexes for combined 19F and 1H MRI detection.

The short atomic distance and the short&#8208;range cationic order of Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom enable the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O radicals, promoting an effective oxygen evolution reaction via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism.







Abstract
A novel Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is synthesized by a facile ion&#8208;exchange method by incorporating Ir in SrMnO3, which yields an extremely high activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ion exchange process occurs in a self&#8208;limitation way, which favors the formation of Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom in the IrMnO9 unit. The incorporation of Ir modulates the electronic structure of both Ir and Mn, thereby resulting in a shorter distance of the Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.41&#8197;&#197;) than the Mn&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.49&#8197;&#197;). The modulated Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom enables the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O intermediates, thus facilitating the direct coupling of the two adsorbed *O intermediates to release O2 via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism. Electrochemical tests reveal that the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 exhibits a superior OER's activity with a low overpotential of 207&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and achieves a mass specific activity of 1100&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 at 1.5&#8197;V. The proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer with the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 catalyst exhibits a low electrolysis voltage of 1.63&#8197;V at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a stable 2000&#8208;h operation with a decay of only 15&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Nanoribbon: Preparation, Single&#8208;Crystal Structure with Chinese Luban Lock Configuration, and Photocatalytic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal structure of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) with a width of ca. 6&#8197;nm has been shown to exhibit a multiple &#8220;mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon&#8221; like joint 3D network similar to the Chinese traditional Luban lock configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in the metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot tandem hydrogen evolution reaction and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of diphenylacetylene derivatives.







Abstract
The multiple mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint parts are the core factors to provide the structural stability and diversity of Chinese Luban locks; however, constructing such structures is very challenging. Herein, single crystals of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) are prepared through the assembly of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;vinylenedipyridine (BYE), and phenylboronic acid (BA) together through dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;27 has a covalent organic nanoribbon structure, where each nanoribbon forms multiple and tight &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with four neighboring others to generate a Luban lock&#8208;like configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkynes in series to produce olefins without any additional photosensitizers and co&#8208;catalysts (metal&#8208;free).

         <title>Quantification of Charge Transport and Mass Deprivation in Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Kinetically&#8208;Stable Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermodynamics descriptor, separation factor of solid electrolyte interphase (SSEI) for designing desirable SEI chemistry, is established on the energy of Li+ diffusion (&#916;VLi), electron tunneling (&#934;e), solvent adsorption (Es), and desolvation processes (&#916;Ed), and thus the kinetic stability of charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and mass (solvent) deprivation through SEI layer at low temperatures could be quantitatively evaluated.







Abstract
Graphite (Gr)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries with admirable electrochemical performance below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C are desired but are hindered by sluggish interfacial charge transport and desolvation process. Li salt dissociation via Li+&#8208;solvent interaction enables mobile Li+ liberation and contributes to bulk ion transport, while is contradictory to fast interfacial desolvation. Designing kinetically&#8208;stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) without compromising strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction is expected to compatibly improve interfacial charge transport and desolvation kinetics. However, the relationship between physicochemical features and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetics properties of SEI remains vague. Herein, we propose four key thermodynamics parameters of SEI potentially influencing low&#8208;temperature electrochemistry, including electron work function, Li+ transfer barrier, surface energy, and desolvation energy. Based on the above parameters, we further define a novel descriptor, separation factor of SEI (SSEI), to quantitatively depict charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and solvent deprivation processes at Gr/electrolyte interface. A Li3PO4&#8208;based, inorganics&#8208;enriched SEI derived by Li difluorophosphate (LiDFP) additive exhibits the highest SSEI (4.89&#215;103) to enable efficient Li+ conduction, e&#8722; blocking and rapid desolvation, and as a result, much suppressed Li&#8208;metal precipitation, electrolyte decomposition and Gr sheets exfoliation, thus improving low&#8208;temperature battery performances. Overall, our work originally provides visualized guides to improve low&#8208;temperature reaction kinetics/thermodynamics by constructing desirable SEI chemistry.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Synergistically Boost Carbonylation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

The 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM5&#8208;TF catalyst (where TF indicates template&#8208;free synthesis), featuring spatially adjacent mononuclear Fe and Cu within ZSM&#8208;5 channels, achieves an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C&#8212;more than threefold higher than previous catalysts. The Fe&#8722;Cu synergistic effect promotes the C&#8722;C coupling of &#8901;CH3 radical with CO by retarding the oxidation progress for high&#8208;efficient formation of acetic acid.







Abstract
The direct liquid&#8208;phase oxidative carbonylation of methane, utilizing abundant natural gas, offers a mild and straightforward alternative. However, most catalysts proposed for this process suffer from low acetic acid yields due to few active sites and rapid C1 oxygenate generation, impeding their industrial feasibility. Herein, we report a highly efficient 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM&#8208;5&#8208;TF (TF denotes template&#8208;free synthesis) catalyst featuring exclusively mononuclear Fe and Cu anchored in the ZSM&#8208;5 channels. Under optimized conditions, the catalyst achieved an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C, tripling the previous records of 12.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Comprehensive characterization, isotope&#8208;labeled experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process, promoting C&#8722;C coupling for effective acetic acid synthesis. Furthermore, the methyl&#8208;group carbon in acetic acid originates solely from methane, while its carbonyl&#8208;group carbon is derived exclusively from CO, rather than the conversion of other C1 oxygenates. The proposed bimetallic catalyst design not only overcomes the limitations of current catalysts but also generalizes the oxidative carbonylation of other alkanes, demonstrating promising advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Comprehensive characterization, isotope-labeled experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process, promoting C&#8722;C coupling for effective acetic acid synthesis. Furthermore, the methyl-group carbon in acetic acid originates solely from methane, while its carbonyl-group carbon is derived exclusively from CO, rather than the conversion of other C1 oxygenates. The proposed bimetallic catalyst design not only overcomes the limitations of current catalysts but also generalizes the oxidative carbonylation of other alkanes, demonstrating promising advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Kinetics of Anionic Redox in O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 through Controlled P2 Intergrowth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphasic recombination is an effective strategy to boost the electrochemical properties of sodium layered oxides. Here, we deploy a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in the manganese&#8208;enriched O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 model compound with the overall composition maintained, enabling a high energy density to be achieved.







Abstract
Anionic redox chemistry can surpass theoretical limits of conventional layered oxide cathodes in energy density. A recent model system of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2, demonstrated full anionic redox capacity but is limited in reversibility and kinetics due to irreversible structural rearrangement and oxygen loss. Solutions to these issues are missing due to the challenging synthesis. Here, we harness the unique structural richness of sodium layered oxides and realize a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in this model compound with the overall composition maintained. The resulted O3 with 27&#8201;% P2 intergrowth structure delivers an excellent initial Coulombic efficiency of 87&#8201;%, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;rich NMCs. This improvement is attributed to the effective suppression of irreversible oxygen release and structural changes, evidenced by operando Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Diffraction. The as&#8208;prepared intergrowth material, based on the environmentally benign Mn, exhibits a reversible capacity of 226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at C/20 rate with excellent cycling stability stemming from the redox reactions of oxygen and manganese. Our work isolates the role of P2 structural intergrowth and thereby introduces a novel strategy to enhance the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox reactions in sodium layered cathodes without compromising capacity.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Induced Rh Monocoodination on Diphosphine Ligand Enables Catalytic Hydroformylation of Aliphatic Olefins at Room Temperature and Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Zr&#8208;MOF, constructed from a conventional chelated diphosphine ligand underwent post&#8208;modification to afford a monophosphine Rh catalyst, which display exceptionally high regioselectivity, reactivity and recyclability in hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins at room temperature and pressure. The structural transformation of the reactive Rh species within the framework during catalysis is elucidated through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Persistent challenges in hydroformylation of olefins include controlling regioselectivity, particularly for short aliphatic olefins and conducting reactions under ambient conditions. We report here the synthesis of monophosphine&#8211;Rh complexes on a typical chelated diphosphine ligand mediated by a Zr&#8208;MOF through isolating a pair of phosphorus atoms. We demonstrate that single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction can elucidate the structural transformation of the Rh catalyst during olefin hydroformylation, providing valuable information on active site reconstruction during catalysis. The Rh&#8208;MOF catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in the hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins with linear to branched ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1. Due to the framework&#8216;s capacity to adsorb and concentrate gases, the catalytic reactions occur under room temperature and pressure, eliminating the need for the high temperature and pressures typically required in homogeneous systems. This study show that Zr&#8211;MOF can be a unique platform for synthesizing unusual catalytic species that cannot exist in solutions for meaningful chemical transformations and elucidate valuable structural information pertaining to metal&#8208;based catalysis.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Tethered (cAAC)&#8212;Copper Complexes: Reactivity for Hydride Transfer and Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acidic borane was introduced into the secondary coordination sphere of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) copper complexes, including a cuprous hydride. In contrast to non&#8208;tethered borane capped copper hydrides, the borane&#8208;tethered variant exhibits strong hydricity, attributed to relief of ring&#8208;strain, and improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
We present a series of borane&#8208;tethered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC)&#8208;copper complexes, including a borane&#8208;capped Cu(I) hydride. This hydride is unusually hydridic and reacts rapidly with both CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenol at room temperature. Its reactivity is distinct from variants without a tethered borane, and the underlying principles governing the enhanced hydricity were evaluated experimentally and theoretically. These stoichiometric results were extended to catalytic CO2 hydrogenation, and the borane&#8208;tethered (intramolecular) system exhibits ~3&#8208;fold enhancement relative to an intermolecular system.

         <title>Spirobipyridine Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of spirobipyridine ligands has been developed to achieve remote site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of alkaloids for iridium catalysis. The &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; in ligands facilitates specific C&#8722;H bonds of multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives towards the metal center via non&#8208;covalent interactions, while simultaneously blocking other sites. Notably, this approach is applicable to a broad range of alkaloids with diverse functional groups.







Abstract
The selective borylation of specific C&#8722;H bonds in organic synthesis remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a novel spirobipyridine ligand that features a binaphthyl backbone. This ligand facilitates the iridium&#8208;catalyzed selective C&#8722;H borylation of benzene derivatives. The ligand is designed with &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; substituents that allow vicinal di&#8208; or multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives to approach metal center and effectively block other reactive sites by non&#8208;covalent interactions with substrates. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful selective distal C&#8722;H activation of various alkaloids and its broad compatibility with functional groups.

         <title>Large Molecular Rotation in Crystal Changes the Course of a Topochemical Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction from a Predicted Polymerization to an Unexpected Intramolecular Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular arrangement in crystals can in general be used reliably to predict the product of a topochemical reaction. When there is sufficient free&#8208;space and flexibility, molecules in crystal can make large motions prior to topochemical reaction leading to a different arrangement and yield unexpected products.

A designed anthracene&#8208;based monomer for topochemical Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition polymerization crystallized with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement of molecules, as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The diene and dienophile units of adjacent monomer molecules are aligned at an average distance of 4.6&#8197;&#197;, suggesting a favorable crystalline arrangement for their intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reaction to form a linear polymer. Surprisingly, heating the monomer crystals at a temperature above 125&#8201;&#176;C resulted in the formation of intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadduct, which could be characterized by various spectroscopy and SCXRD analysis. Various time&#8208;dependent studies such as NMR, PXRD, and DSC, studies established that the reaction followed topochemical pathway. Schmidt's topochemical postulates are generally used to predict the topochemical reactivity and product, by analyzing the crystal structure of the reactant. Though the crystal arrangement predicted polymerization, upon heating, the molecule avoided this pathway by undergoing a large rotation to form an intramolecular cycloadduct. Theoretical calculations supported the feasibility of the rotation, exploiting the flexibility of the molecule and voids present. These findings caution that the reliance on Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reactions may sometimes be misleading, especially in heat&#8208;induced reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Molecular arrangement in crystals can in general be used reliably to predict the product of a topochemical reaction. When there is sufficient free-space and flexibility, molecules in crystal can make large motions prior to topochemical reaction leading to a different arrangement and yield unexpected products. Our results cautions that the prediction of product structures based on the crystal structure can be misleading.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Ring Mobility on the Macroscopic Properties of Doubly Threaded Slide&#8208;Ring Gel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gels (dt&#8208;SRGs) exhibit enhanced swelling, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics on account of the mobility of their crosslinking rings. dt&#8208;SRG with larger rings exhibit softer mechanical properties and faster stress relaxation. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of dt&#8208;SRGs can be adjusted by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility through remetalation.







Abstract
The integration of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) into polymeric materials has led to the development of mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs). One class of MIPs that have gained attention in recent years are slide&#8208;ring gels (SRGs), which are generally accessed by crosslinking rings on a main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane. The mobility of the interlocked crosslinking moieties along the polymer backbone imparts enhanced properties onto these networks. An alternative synthetic approach to SRGs is to use a doubly threaded ring as the crosslinking moiety, yielding doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gel networks (dt&#8208;SRGs). In this study, a photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread was used to assemble a series of metal&#8208;templated pseudo[3]rotaxane crosslinkers that allow access to polymer networks that contain doubly threaded interlocked rings. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of these dt&#8208;SRGs with varying size of the ring crosslinking moieties were investigated and compared to an entangled gel (EG) prepared by polymerizing the metal complex of the photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread, and a corresponding covalent gel (CG). Relative to the EG and CG, the dt&#8208;SRGs exhibit enhanced swelling behavior, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics. In addition, the macroscopic properties of dt&#8208;SRGs could be altered by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility in the structure through remetalation, highlighting the impact of the mobility of the crosslinks.

         <title>Biomimetic Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Pendant Groups for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microenvironment near the catalytic sites in covalent organic frameworks is tuned with different pendant groups to improve the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The COF with electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) near the active site exhibited superior CO2RR activity and selectivity, compared with the COF with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way of converting CO2 into value&#8208;added products using renewable energy, whose activity and selectivity can be in principle maneuvered by tuning the microenvironment near catalytic sites. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for tuning the microenvironment of CO2RR by learning from the natural chlorophyll and heme. Specifically, the conductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by piperazine serve as versatile supports for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), and the pendant groups modified on the COFs can be readily tailored to offer different push&#8208;pull electronic effects for tunable microenvironment. As a result, while all the COFs exhibit high chemical structure stability under harsh conditions and good conductivity, the addition of &#8722;CH2NH2 can greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of CO2RR. As proven by experimental characterization and theoretical simulation, the electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) not only reduces the surface work function of COF, but also improves the adsorption energy of the key intermediate *COOH, compared with the COFs with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH) near the active sites. This work provides insights into the microenvironment modulation of CO2RR electrocatalysts at the molecular level.

         <title>Unconventional Electrocatalytic CO Conversion to C2 Products on Single&#8208;Atomic Pd&#8722;Agn Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to the non&#8208;*CO adsorption on Ag surface or over&#8208;strong *CO adsorption on multiple Pd atoms, the single Pd atoms surrounded with multiple Ag sites (denoted as the Pd&#8722;Agn structure) in the Pd1Ag10 catalyst allow to tune the *CO adsorption behavior to promote the *CO surface coverage, and enable efficient C&#8722;C coupling between a Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and a Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) adsorption sites.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO or CO2 into C2+ products has mostly been focused on Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Although Ag has also been predicted as a possible catalyst for the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion from the thermodynamic point of view, however, due to its weak CO binding strength, CO rapidly desorbs from the Ag surface rather than participates in deep reduction. In this work, we demonstrate that single&#8208;atomic Pd sites doped in Ag lattice can tune the CO adsorption behavior and promote the deep reduction of CO toward C2 products. The monodispersed Pd&#8722;Agn sites enable the CO adsorption with both Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) configurations, which can increase the CO coverage and reduce the C&#8722;C coupling energy barrier. Under room temperature and ambient pressure, the Pd1Ag10 alloy catalyst exhibited a total CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Faradaic efficiency of ~37&#8201;% at &#8722;0.83&#8197;V, with appreciable current densities and electrochemical stability, thus featuring unconventional non&#8208;Cu electrocatalytic CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion capability.

         <title>Selectivity Descriptors of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Aromatics Process over 3&#8208;Dimensional Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts were established in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics reaction over ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11 zeolites via strategically integrating operando UV/Visible spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and controlled catalytic experiments. This work emphasizes the significance of the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity.







Abstract
The zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics (MTA) process is a promising avenue for industrial decarbonization. This process predominantly utilizes 3&#8208;dimensional 10&#8208;member ring (10&#8208;MR) zeolites like ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11, chosen for their confinement effect essential for aromatization. Current research mainly focuses on enhancing selectivity and mitigating catalyst deactivation by modulating zeolites&#8242; physicochemical properties. Despite the potential, the MTA technology is at a low Technology Readiness Level, hindered by mechanistic complexities in achieving the desired selectivity towards liquid aromatics. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes a roadmap for MTA catalysis by strategically combining controlled catalytic experiments with advanced characterization methods (including operando conditions and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy). It identifies the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity.

     alt="Selectivity Descriptors of Methanol-to-Aromatics Process over 3-Dimensional Zeolites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts were established in methanol-to-aromatics reaction over ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 zeolites via strategically integrating operando UV/Visible spectroscopy, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and controlled catalytic experiments. This work emphasizes the significance of the descriptor-role of Koch-carbonylated intermediates, longer-chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zeolite-catalyzed methanol-to-aromatics (MTA) process is a promising avenue for industrial decarbonization. This process predominantly utilizes 3-dimensional 10-member ring (10-MR) zeolites like ZSM-5 and ZSM-11, chosen for their confinement effect essential for aromatization. Current research mainly focuses on enhancing selectivity and mitigating catalyst deactivation by modulating zeolites&#8242; physicochemical properties. Despite the potential, the MTA technology is at a low Technology Readiness Level, hindered by mechanistic complexities in achieving the desired selectivity towards liquid aromatics. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes a roadmap for MTA catalysis by strategically combining controlled catalytic experiments with advanced characterization methods (including operando conditions and &#8220;mobility-dependent&#8221; solid-state NMR spectroscopy). It identifies the descriptor-role of Koch-carbonylated intermediates, longer-chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity. Understanding these selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts is vital, potentially advancing other zeolite-catalyzed emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reducing Dielectric Confinement Effect Enhances Carrier Separation in Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By substituting the A&#8208;site ions of two&#8208;dimensional OIHPs, we prepared two perovskites with different dielectric constants. Compared with (PEA)2PbBr4, (EOA)2PbBr4 has a larger dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]4&#8722; layers, exhibiting a small excitonic binding energy than (PEA)2PbBr4, which promotes the charge transfer and separation. Furthermore, we also demonstrates the application in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) with alternating structure of the organic and inorganic layers have a natural quantum well structure. The difference of dielectric constants between organic and inorganic layers in this structure results in the enhancement of dielectric confinement effect, which exhibits a large exciton binding energy and hinders the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Herein, a strategy to reduce the dielectric confinement effect by narrowing the dielectric difference between organic amine molecule and [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedron is put forward. The Ethanolamine (EOA) contains hydroxyl groups, resulting in the positive and negative charge centers of O and H non&#8208;overlapping, which generated a larger polarity and dielectric constant. The reduced dielectric constant produces a smaller exciton binding energy (71.03&#8197;meV) of (C2H7NO)2PbBr4 ((EOA)2PbBr4) than (C8H11N)2PbBr4 ((PEA)2PbBr4 (156.07&#8197;meV), and promotes the dissociation of electrons and holes. The increasing of lifetime of photogenerated carrier in (EOA)2PbBr4 are proved by femtosecond transient absorption spectra. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also indicated that the small energy shift of the total density of states (DOS) between the C/H/N and the Pb/Br in (EOA)2PbBr4 favors the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, this work demonstrates the application of (PEA)2PbBr4 and (EOA)2PbBr4 in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>A Highly Stable and Non&#8208;Flammable Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

In this work, we report a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. Due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are regarded as one of the next&#8208;generation electrolytes to promote the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their unparalleled advantages compared to both liquid electrolytes and solid electrolytes. However, its application in LMBs is limited by electrode interface compatibility. Here, we introduce a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based DEE induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. We confirmed that the DMMN molecule can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI by the interaction between the N atom and Li+, and form the hydrogen bond with TFSI&#8722; anion, which can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI to form DEE. More importantly, due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility. Polymer electrolytes based on this DEE exhibit high ionic conductivity (0.67&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), high oxidation voltage (5.0&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), favorable interfacial stability, and nonflammability. Li&#8214;LFP and Li&#8214;NCM811 full batteries utilizing this DEE polymer electrolyte exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate performance at high rates. Therefore, the new DMMN&#8208;based DEE overcomes the limitations of traditional electrolytes in electrode interface compatibility and opens new possibilities for improving the performance of LMBs.

         <title>In Vivo Synthetic Anticancer Approach by Resourcing Mouse Blood Albumin as a Biocompatible Artificial Metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), capable of in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, were prepared using circulating albumin in the bloodstream, through the reaction with a ruthenium catalyst. The in situ prepared ArM was transported to the cancer and catalyzed a reaction with proapoptotic peptides, effectively suppressing cancer proliferation.







Abstract
Methods for producing drugs directly at the cancer site, particularly using bioorthogonal metal catalysts, are being explored to mitigate the side effects of therapy. Albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) catalyze reactions in living mice while protecting the catalyst in the hydrophobic pocket. Here, we describe the in situ preparation and application of biocompatible tumor&#8208;targeting ArMs using circulating albumin, which is abundant in the bloodstream. The ArM was formed using blood albumin through the intravenous injection of ruthenium conjugated with an albumin&#8208;binding ligand; the tumor&#8208;targeting unit was conjugated to the ArM using its catalytic activity, and the ArM was transported to the cancer site. The delivered ArM catalyzed a second tagging reaction of the proapoptotic peptide on the cancer surface, successfully suppressing cancer proliferation. This approach, which efficiently leveraged the persisting reactivity twice in vivo, holds promise for future in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis utilizing endogenous albumin.

         <dc:description>
Desymmetrization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutanols via asymmetric Cu&#8208;catalyzed borylation creates axially chiral allylboranes in high enantiomeric ratio for both enantiomers. The axial&#8208;to&#8208;chiral transfer is possible through diastereoconvergent allylation with aldehydes, proving the preference for the same diastereoisomeric homoallylic alcohol, creating two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymemtric center with stereoretention for both enantiomers.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic borylation of 3,3&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutan&#8208;1&#8208;ols renders axially chiral allylborane systems, with high asymmetric induction for both enantiomers, by precise selection of the cis or trans substrate. The enantioenriched alkylidenecyclobutanes served as chiral platform to prove the conceptually challenging transference of the axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality through two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymmetric carbon generated via diastereoconvergent allylation of aldehydes, without enantioselective erosion.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Deracemization Enabled Enantioselective and Modular Access to Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a novel photoredox catalytic strategy for deracemization of axially chiral molecules, overcoming the challenge of relying on energy transfer mechanisms for chiral center removal that necessitate feedstocks with low triplet energy levels. This strategy has been verified by the precise synthesis of valuable and hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic deracemization is highly esteemed as an ideal tool for organic synthesis due to its exceptional atom economy and synthetic efficiency. Consequently, successful instances of deracemization of allenes have been established, where the activated energy of photosensitizer should surpass that of the substrates, representing an intrinsic requirement. Accordingly, this method is not applicable for axially chiral molecules with significantly high triplet energies. In this study, we present a photoredox catalytic deracemization approach that enables the efficient synthesis of valuable yet challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones. The substrate scope is extensive, allowing for both 3&#8208;axis and unmet 1&#8208;axis assembly through facile oxidation of diverse central chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones that can be easily prepared and achieve enantiomer enrichment via deracemization. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of photosensitizer selection in attaining excellent chemoselectivity and highlight the indispensability of a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid in enabling highly enantioselective protonation to accomplish efficient deracemization.

         <title>Highly Reversible Sodium&#8208;ion Storage in A Bifunctional Nanoreactor Based on Single&#8208;atom Mn Supported on N&#8208;doped Carbon over MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional nanoreactor of single&#8208;atom Mn supported on N&#8208;doped carbon is constructed over MoS2 nanosheets. It facilitates the reversible conversion of MoS2 during sodium storage by not only confining the volume change and agglomeration of discharge products but also providing catalytic Mn&#8722;N4 sites for the charging process.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type electrode materials have gained massive research attention in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but their limited reversibility hampers practical use. Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoreactor to boost highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage, wherein a record&#8208;high reversible degree of 85.65&#8201;% is achieved for MoS2 anodes. Composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported single atom Mn (NC&#8208;SAMn), this bifunctional nanoreactor concurrently confines active materials spatially and catalyzes reaction kinetics. In situ/ex situ characterizations including spectroscopy, microscopy, and electrochemistry, combined with theoretical simulations containing density functional theory and molecular dynamics, confirm that the NC&#8208;SAMn nanoreactors facilitate the electron/ion transfer, promote the distribution and interconnection of discharging products (Na2S/Mo), and reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier. As a result, the nanoreactor&#8208;promoted MoS2 anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a capacity retention of 99.86&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates the superiority of bifunctional nanoreactors with two&#8208;dimensional confined and catalytic effects, providing a feasible approach to improve the reversibility for a wide range of conversion&#8208;type electrode materials, thereby enhancing the application potential for long&#8208;cycled SIBs.

         <title>Modulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States of Multiple Resonance Emitters via Intramolecular Covalent Bond Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular Scholl reaction of two adjacent 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in an oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole forms a multiple resonance (MR) emitter m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz with a [1,4]&#8208;diazocine&#8208;embedded core. Here, the charge&#8208;transfer excited state of the MR emitter is modulated by intramolecular covalent bond locking, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of the organic electroluminescent material.







Abstract
Advanced multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with high efficiency and color purity have emerged as a research focus in the development of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we disclose an approach to modulate the charge&#8208;transfer excited states of MR emitters via intramolecular covalent bond locking. This strategy can promote the evolution of strong intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) states into weak ICT states, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of emitters. To modulate the ICT intensity, two octagonal rings are introduced to yield molecule m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz. Compounds m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit bright light&#8208;green and green fluorescence in toluene, with emission maxima of 504 and 513&#8197;nm, and FWHMs of 28 and 34&#8197;nm, respectively. Sensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing emitters m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit green emission with peaks of 508 and 520&#8197;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.12, 0.65) and (0.19, 0.69), and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.2&#8201;% and 32.6&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Healable, Recyclable, and Upcyclable Gel Membranes for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

This study details the synthesis of an ionogel membrane with copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ionic liquids, enhancing its mechanical strength, self&#8208;healing, recycling, and upcycling capabilities. These enhancements, combined with superior carbon dioxide selectivity, affirm its potential as a sustainable, high&#8208;performance material for efficient gas separation.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are prized for their selective dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to their widespread use in ionogel membranes for gas separation. Despite their advantages, creating sustainable ionogel membranes with high IL contents poses challenges due to limited mechanical strength, leakage risks, and poor recyclability. Herein, we leverage copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ILs to develop ionogel membranes with high mechanical strength, zero leakage, and excellent self&#8208;healing and recycling capabilities. These membranes exhibit superior ideal selectivity for gas separation compared to other reported ionogel membranes, achieving a CO2/nitrogen selectivity of 61.7 and a CO2/methane selectivity of 24.6, coupled with an acceptable CO2 permeability of 186.4 Barrer. Additionally, these gas separation ionogel membranes can be upcycled into ionic skins for sensing applications, further enhancing their utility. This research outlines a strategic approach to molecularly engineer ionogel membranes, offering a promising pathway for developing sustainable, high&#8208;performance materials for advanced gas separation technologies.

         <title>Rapid Aminations of Functionalized Aryl Fluorosulfates in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminations of aryl fluorosulfates, an alternative non&#8208;PFAS pseudohalide, using a novel Pd oxidative addition complex, has been demonstrated. This complex substitutes PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, operates efficiently under aqueous micellar conditions, and is compatible with diverse coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, under mild and environmentally benign conditions.







Abstract
Aryl fluorosulfates of varying complexities have been used in amination reactions in water using a new Pd oxidative addition complex (OAC&#8208;1) developed specifically to match the needs of the fine chemicals industry, not only in terms of functional group tolerance, but also reflecting time considerations associated with these important C&#8722;N couplings. Also especially noteworthy is that they replace both PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, which are today out of favor due to recent government regulations. The new complex based on the BippyPhos ligand is used at low loadings and under aqueous micellar conditions. Moreover, it is easily prepared and stable to long term storage. DFT calculations on the OAC precatalyst compare well with the X&#8208;ray structure of the crystals with &#960;&#8208;complexation to the aromatic system of the ligand and also confirm the NMR data showing a mixture of conformers in solution that differ from the X&#8208;ray structure in rotation of the phenyl and t&#8208;butyl ligand substituents. An extensive variety of coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, readily participate under mild and environmentally responsible reaction conditions.

         <title>Reproducing Reaction Mechanisms with Machine&#8208;Learning Models Trained on a Large&#8208;Scale Mechanistic Dataset</title>

Machine learning models trained on mechanistic datasets created using expert reaction templates demonstrate the ability to successfully predict known reaction mechanisms. This study illustrates how such mechanistic models can explain how reaction outcomes are produced, recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents, and suggest potential side products and impurities.







Abstract
Mechanistic understanding of organic reactions can facilitate reaction development, impurity prediction, and in principle, reaction discovery. While several machine learning models have sought to address the task of predicting reaction products, their extension to predicting reaction mechanisms has been impeded by the lack of a corresponding mechanistic dataset. In this study, we construct such a dataset by imputing intermediates between experimentally reported reactants and products using expert reaction templates and train several machine learning models on the resulting dataset of 5,184,184&#8197;elementary steps. We explore the performance and capabilities of these models, focusing on their ability to predict reaction pathways and recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of mechanistic models in predicting impurities, often overlooked by conventional models. We conclude by evaluating the generalizability of mechanistic models to new reaction types, revealing challenges related to dataset diversity, consecutive predictions, and violations of atom conservation.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Realized in a Single Lead Halide Perovskite across the Visible&#8208;Light Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;full &#8208;spectrum emissions are achieved in a single component 2D lead halide perovskites by applying hydrostatic pressure.This work establishes a new pathway to achieve the PL full&#8208;spectrum emission and provide valuable insights into the relationship between the HP&#8208;PL emissions and high&#8208;pressure phase transitions.







Abstract
The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full&#8208;spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620&#8197;nm, in a single&#8208;component two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)2PbBr4 (ETA+=(HO)(CH2)2NH3+), is reported, achieved through high&#8208;pressure treatment. A pressure&#8208;induced phase transition occurs upon compression, transforming the crystal structure from an orthorhombic phase under ambient conditions to a monoclinic structure at high pressure. This phase transition driven by the adaptive and dynamic configuration changes of organic amine cations enables an effective and continuous narrowing of the band gap in this halide crystal. The hydrogen bonding interactions between inorganic layers and organic amine cations (N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds) efficiently modulate the organic amine cations penetration and the octahedral distortion. Consequently, this phenomenon induces a phase transition and results in red&#8208;shifted PL emissions, leading to the near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum emission. This work opens a possibility for achieving wide PL emissions with coverage across the visible light spectrum by employing high pressure in single halide perovskites.

         <title>Mixed Crystalline Covalent Heptazine Frameworks with Built&#8208;in Heterojunction Structures towards Efficient Photocatalytic Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

A mixed crystalline m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 constructed by PHI network and internally embedded phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine framework (CHF&#8722;Ph) is synthesized via an in situ strategy. PHI and CHF&#8722;Ph form built&#8208;in type II heterojunction, and m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 has smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI. The hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic formic acid dehydrogenation reaches a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which surpasses most of the other organic photocatalysts.







Abstract
Covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) are widely utilized in the recent years as potential photocatalysts. However, their limited conjugated structures, low crystallinity and small surface areas have restricted the practical photocatalysis performance. Along this line, we report herein the synthesis of a kind of mixed crystalline CHF (m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1) with built&#8208;in heterojunction structure, which can efficiently catalyze the formic acid dehydrogenation by visible light driven photocatalysis. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is synthesized from 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine and dicyanobenzene (DCB) in the molten salts, in which DCB plays as organic molten co&#8208;solvent to promote the rapid and ordered polymerization of 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is formed by embedding phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine (CHF&#8722;Ph) units in the poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) network similar to doping. The CHF&#8722;Ph combined with PHI form an effective type II heterojunction structure, which promote the directional transfer of charge carriers. And the integration of CHF&#8722;Ph makes m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 have smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI, the charge carriers are more easily dissociated to form free electrons, resulting in higher utilization efficiency of the carriers. The largest hydrogen evolution rate reaches a value of 42.86&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which surpasses the majority of other organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Bilateral Embedded Anchoring via Tailored Polymer Brush for Large&#8208;Area Air&#8208;Processed Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistical manipulation strategy of bilateral embedded anchoring by planting polymer brush in the inorganic HTL is important to realize air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs and the highly desirable for large&#8208;area devices. The efficiencies of the achieved air&#8208;processed large&#8208;area blue PeLEDs reached 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glove box.







Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) that can be air&#8208;processed promises the development of displaying optoelectronic device, while is challenged by technical difficulty on both the active layer and hole transport layer (HTL) caused by the unavoidable humidity interference.

&lt;p&gt;A synergistical manipulation strategy of bilateral embedded anchoring by planting polymer brush in the inorganic HTL is important to realize air-processed blue PeLEDs and the highly desirable for large-area devices. The efficiencies of the achieved air-processed large-area blue PeLEDs reached 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure-bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glove box.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) that can be air-processed promises the development of displaying optoelectronic device, while is challenged by technical difficulty on both the active layer and hole transport layer (HTL) caused by the unavoidable humidity interference. Here, we propose and validate that, planting the polymer brush with tailored functional groups in inorganic HTL, provides unique bilateral embedded anchoring that is capable of simultaneously addressing the n phases crystallization rates in the active layer as well as the deteriorated particulate surface defects in HTL. Exemplified by zwitterionic polyethyleneimine-sulfonate (PEIS) in present study, its implanting in NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; HTL offers abundant nuclei sites of amino and sulfonate groups that balance the growth rate of different n phases in quasi-2D perovskite films. Moreover, the PEIS effectively nailed the interfacial contact between perovskite and NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduced the particulate surface defects in HTL, leading to the enhanced PLQY and stability of large-area blue perovskite film in ambient air. By virtue of these merits, present work achieves the first demonstration of the air-processed blue PeLEDs in large emitting area of 1.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure-bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glovebox.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Isocyanate Synthesis of Covalent Adaptable Networks Based on Dynamic Hindered Urea Bonds: Sequential Polymerization and Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;isocyanate synthetic pathway for dynamic hindered urea bonds was demonstrated using a ring&#8208;opening reaction between thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;one and 1,3&#8208;di(piperidin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)propane. The resulting thiol groups formed covalent adaptable networks (CANs) via click reactions. These CANs can be selectively controlled by activating each dynamic bond, providing multiple pathways for reprocessing, chemical recycling, and reutilization.







Abstract
The development of environmentally sustainable processes for polymer recycling is of paramount importance in the polymer industry. In particular, the implementation of chemical recycling for thermoset polymers via covalent adaptable networks (CANs), particularly those based on the dynamic hindered urea bond (HUB), has garnered intensive attention from both the academic and industrial sectors. This interest stems from its straightforward chemical structure and reaction mechanism, which are well&#8208;suited for commercial polyurethane and polyurea applications. However, a substantial drawback of these CANs is the requisite use of toxic isocyanate curing agents for their synthesis. Herein, we propose a new HUB synthesis pathway involving thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one and a hindered amine. This ring&#8208;opening reaction facilitates the isocyanate&#8208;free formation of a HUB and enables sequential reactions with acrylate and epoxide monomers via thiol&#8211;Michael and thiol&#8211;epoxy click chemistry. The CANs synthesized using this methodology exhibit superior reprocessability, chemical recyclability, and reutilizability, facilitated by specific catalytic and solvent conditions, through the reversible HUB, thiol&#8211;Michael addition, and transesterification processes.

         <title>Four&#8208;Membered Ring&#8208;Embedded Cycloarene Enabling Anti&#8208;Aromaticity and Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene MF2 was synthesized, demonstrating the local anti&#8208;aromaticity and ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit FWHM of only 7&#8197;nm, which sets a new record of FWHM among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules. Here, we provide an innovative design strategy to synthesize ultra&#8208;narrowband emission materials for the OLED display technology.







Abstract
The synthesis of fully fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated cycloarenes embedded with nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene (MF2) was designed and synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond&#8208;linked chiral macrocycle MS2 without two fused four&#8208;membered rings and its linear&#8208;shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer L1 were also synthesized. The pronounced anti&#8208;aromaticity of four&#8208;membered rings significantly adjusts the electronic structures and photophysical properties of cycloarene, resulting in an enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 10.66&#8201;% and 10.74&#8201;% for L1 and MS2, respectively, to 54.05&#8201;% for MF2, which is the highest PLQY among the reported cycloarenes. Notably, owing to the embedded anti&#8208;aromatic four&#8208;membered rings that reduce structural displacements, MF2 exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 7&#8197;nm (0.038&#8197;eV), which sets a new record among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules, and represents the first example of ultra&#8208;narrowband emission in conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) devoid of heteroatoms.

         <title>A Soft, Fatigue&#8208;free, and Self&#8208;healable Ionic Elastomer via the Synergy of Skin&#8208;like Assembly and Bouligand Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of skin&#8208;like functional properties (softness, strain stiffening, self&#8208;healing, and stretchability) together with ultra&#8208;high fracture toughness and fatigue resistance are realized by fusing a unique structural&#8208;compositional design involving dermal binary assembly and Bouligand structure.







Abstract
Soft ionic elastomers that are self&#8208;healable, fatigue&#8208;free, and environment&#8208;tolerant are ideal structural and sensing materials for artificial prosthetics, soft electronics, and robotics to survive unpredictable service conditions. However, most synthetic strategies failed to unite rapid healing, fatigue resistance, and environmental robustness, limited by their singular compositional/structural designs. Here, we present a soft, tough, fatigue&#8208;resistant, and self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer (STFSI elastomer), which fuses skin&#8208;like binary assembly and Bouligand helicoidal structure into a composite of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibers and a supramolecular ionic biopolymer. The interlocked binary assembly enables skin&#8208;like softness, high stretchability, and strain&#8208;adaptive stiffening through a matrix&#8208;to&#8208;scaffold stress transfer. The Bouligand structure contributes to superhigh fracture toughness (101.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2) and fatigue resistance (4937&#8197;J&#8201;m&#8722;2) via mechanical toughening by interlayer slipping and twisted crack propagation path. Besides, the STFSI elastomer is self&#8208;healable through a &#8220;bridging&#8221; method and environment&#8208;tolerant (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, strong acid/alkali, saltwater). To demonstrate the versatile structural and sensing applications, we showcase a safety cushion with efficient damping and suppressed rebounding, and a robotic sensor with excellent fatigue crack tolerance and instant sensation recovery upon cutting&#8208;off damage. Our presented synthetic strategy is generalizable to other fiber&#8208;reinforced tough polymers for applications involving demanding mechanical/environmental conditions.

         <title>MXene Supported Electrodeposition Engineering of Layer Double Hydroxide for Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene is developed as a functional additive for the modified electrodeposition preparation of nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of active materials, the resulting binder&#8208;free layered double hydroxides electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading with high areal capacity and cycling stability.







Abstract
The main challenges faced by aqueous rechargeable nickel&#8208;zinc batteries are their comparatively low energy density and poor cycling stability, mainly due to the limited capacity and reversibility of existing Ni&#8208;based cathodes. Moreover, the preparation procedures of these cathodes are complex and not easily scalable, which makes them less promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Herein, we utilized MXene as a functional additive to effectively improve the electrodeposition preparation of NiCo layered double hydroxides (LDH). Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam (NF) and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of platting product based on MXene additives, the resulting binder&#8208;free NiCo LDH electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading (~65&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with abundant active surface for redox reactions and maintained short transport pathway for ion diffusion and charge transfer. Furthermore, the as&#8208;fabricated alkaline NiCo LDH&#8208;based battery delivers high discharge capacity, up to 20.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), accompanied by remarkable rate performance (9.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or 148&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

&lt;p&gt;MXene is developed as a functional additive for the modified electrodeposition preparation of nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of active materials, the resulting binder-free layered double hydroxides electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading with high areal capacity and cycling stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenges faced by aqueous rechargeable nickel-zinc batteries are their comparatively low energy density and poor cycling stability, mainly due to the limited capacity and reversibility of existing Ni-based cathodes. Moreover, the preparation procedures of these cathodes are complex and not easily scalable, which makes them less promising for large-scale energy storage. Herein, we utilized MXene as a functional additive to effectively improve the electrodeposition preparation of NiCo layered double hydroxides (LDH). Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam (NF) and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of platting product based on MXene additives, the resulting binder-free NiCo LDH electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading (~65&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with abundant active surface for redox reactions and maintained short transport pathway for ion diffusion and charge transfer. Furthermore, the as-fabricated alkaline NiCo LDH-based battery delivers high discharge capacity, up to 20.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), accompanied by remarkable rate performance (9.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 148&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Due to the high structural and chemical stability of MXenes/LDH-based electrode, excellent cycling life can also be achieved with 88.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, ultrahigh areal energy density (31.2&#8197;mWh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and gravimetric energy density (465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) can be simultaneously achieved.

         <title>A General Copper&#8208;Box System for the Asymmetric Arylative Functionalization of Benzylic, Propargylic or Allenylic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general copper&#8208;Box system was reported for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;involved arylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions have recently emerged as an attractive strategy to access valuable aryl&#8208;substituted motifs. However, there still exist several challenges such as limited scope of radical precursors/acceptors, and lack of general asymmetric catalytic systems, especially regarding the multicomponent variants. Herein, we reported a general copper&#8208;Box system for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies imply that the copper/Box complexes play a dual role in both radical generation and ensuing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling. In the cases of 1,3&#8208;enynes, visible&#8208;light irradiation could improve the activity of copper/Box complex toward the initial radical generation, enabling better efficiency match between radical formation and cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Zwitterionic Acridinium Amidate: A Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Radical Catalyst for Photoinduced Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the long and rich history of photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) catalysis, the primary structures of existing catalysts rely on molecular entities containing oxo groups, particularly with aromatic ketones and inorganic polyoxometalates. Here, we disclose zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a photoreactive nitrogen&#8208;centered radical precursors, which exhibit prominent reactivity to cleave aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
The development of small organic molecules that can convert light energy into chemical energy to directly promote molecular transformation is of fundamental importance in chemical science. Herein, we report a zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a catalyst for the direct functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This organic zwitterion absorbs visible light to generate the corresponding amidyl radical in the form of excited&#8208;state triplet diradical with prominent reactivity for hydrogen atom transfer to facilitate C&#8722;H alkylation with a high turnover number. The experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the noncovalent interactions between the anionic amidate nitrogen and a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, such as hexafluoroisopropanol, are crucial for ensuring the efficient generation of catalytically active species, thereby fully eliciting the distinct reactivity of the acridinium amidate as a photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer catalyst.

         <title>Dissecting Exciton Dynamics in pH&#8208;Activatable Long&#8208;Wavelength Photosensitizers for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, and I) was developed by dissecting exciton dynamics, which could be specifically activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) upon 808&#8197;nm laser excitation, enabling fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;modal molecular imaging&#8208;escorted efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;specific activatable long&#8208;wavelength (LW) photosensitizers (PSs) show promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT), such as systemic phototoxicity and shallow tissue penetration. However, their insufficient LW light absorption and low singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934; 1O2) usually require high laser power density to produce thermal energy and synergistically enhance PDT. The strong photothermal radiation causing acute pain significantly reduces patient compliance and hinders the broader clinical application of LW PDT. Through the exciton dynamics dissection strategy, we have developed a series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based LW PSs (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, I), among which the activated LET&#8208;I exhibits strong light absorption at 808&#8197;nm and a remarkable 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in &#934; 1O2 compared to indocyanine green. Transient spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed its significantly promoted intersystem crossing and simultaneously enhanced LW fluorescence emission characteristics. These features enable the activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic dual&#8208;modal imaging&#8208;escorted complete photodynamic eradication of tumors by the folic acid (FA)&#8208;modified LET&#8208;I probe (LET&#8208;I&#8208;FA), under the ultralow 808&#8197;nm laser power density (0.2&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for irradiation, without the need for photothermal energy synergy. This research presents a novel strategy of dissecting exciton dynamics to screen activatable LW PSs for traceable PDT.

         <title>Synergistic Active Heterostructure Design for Enhanced Two Electron Oxygen Reduction via Chemical and Electrochemical Reconstruction of Heterosulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing nickel/indium sulfide heterostructures, we enable enhanced electrochemical and chemical reconstruction processes, resulting in the formation of nickel oxyhydroxides coupled with indium hydroxides. The electrochemical transformation yields abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units, promoting the cooperation of active Ni and In sites, and ultimately leading to improved performance for alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR.







Abstract
Transition metal sulfides, particularly heterostructures, represent a promising class of electrocatalysts for two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), however, understanding the dynamic structural evolution of these catalysts during alkaline ORR remains relatively unexplored. Herein, NiS2/In2.77S4 heterostructure was synthesized as a precatalyst and through a series of comprehensive ex situ and in situ characterizations, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transient photo&#8208;induced voltage measurements, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy, it was revealed that nickel/indium (oxy)hydroxides (NiOOH/In(OH)3) could be evolved from the initial NiS2/In2.77S4 via both electrochemical and chemical&#8208;driven methods. The electrochemical&#8208;driven phase featured abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units at the interfaces of NiOOH/In(OH)3, facilitating a synergistic effect between active Ni and In sites, thus enabling an enhanced alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR capability than that of chemical&#8208;driven process. Remarkably, electrochemically induced NiOOH/In(OH)3 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving H2O2 selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% across the wide potential window (up to 0.4&#8197;V) with a peak selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. Notably, within the three&#8208;electrode flow cell, a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was sustained over 20&#8197;h, together with an impressive Faradaic efficiency of ~90&#8201;% during the whole cycle process.

&lt;p&gt;By constructing nickel/indium sulfide heterostructures, we enable enhanced electrochemical and chemical reconstruction processes, resulting in the formation of nickel oxyhydroxides coupled with indium hydroxides. The electrochemical transformation yields abundant bridging oxygen-deficient [NiO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]-[InO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] units, promoting the cooperation of active Ni and In sites, and ultimately leading to improved performance for alkaline 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal sulfides, particularly heterostructures, represent a promising class of electrocatalysts for two electron oxygen reduction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR), however, understanding the dynamic structural evolution of these catalysts during alkaline ORR remains relatively unexplored. Herein, NiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/In&lt;sub&gt;2.77&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure was synthesized as a precatalyst and through a series of comprehensive ex situ and in situ characterizations, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transient photo-induced voltage measurements, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and spherical aberration-corrected electron microscopy, it was revealed that nickel/indium (oxy)hydroxides (NiOOH/In(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) could be evolved from the initial NiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/In&lt;sub&gt;2.77&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; via both electrochemical and chemical-driven methods. The electrochemical-driven phase featured abundant bridging oxygen-deficient [NiO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]-[InO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] units at the interfaces of NiOOH/In(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, facilitating a synergistic effect between active Ni and In sites, thus enabling an enhanced alkaline 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR capability than that of chemical-driven process. Remarkably, electrochemically induced NiOOH/In(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited exceptional performance, achieving H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of &amp;gt;90&#8201;% across the wide potential window (up to 0.4&#8197;V) with a peak selectivity of &amp;gt;99&#8201;%. Notably, within the three-electrode flow cell, a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; was sustained over 20&#8197;h, together with an impressive Faradaic efficiency of ~90&#8201;% during the whole cycle process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[4]Rhombene: Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Application in Distributed Feedback Lasers With Emission Beyond 830&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphene, [4]rhombene, was synthesized by solution&#8208;phase chemistry and isolated in single&#8208;crystal form. It was successfully applied in solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers, showing emission beyond 830&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Graphene&#8208;like molecules with multiple zigzag edges are emerging as promising gain materials for organic lasers. Their emission wavelengths can vary widely, ranging from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR), as the molecular size increases. Specifically, rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphenes with two pairs of parallel zigzag edges, known as [n]rhombenes, are excellent candidates for NIR lasers due to their small energy gaps. However, synthesizing large&#8208;size rhombenes with emission beyond 800&#8197;nm in solution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthesis of an aryl&#8208;substituted [4]rhombene derivative, [4]RB&#8208;Ar, using a method that combines intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling with Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structure of [4]RB&#8208;Ar was confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the molecule's long axis. Significantly, [4]RB&#8208;Ar demonstrates narrow amplified spontaneous emission at around 834&#8197;nm when dispersed in polystyrene thin films. Moreover, solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers employing [4]RB&#8208;Ar as the active gain material display tunable narrow emissions in the range of 830 to 844&#8197;nm.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process has been reported, providing an economic approach to valuable chiral &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;allylic boronates. Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We herein describe the first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process. The catalytic system, consisting of (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;Segphos and CuBr, could efficiently achieve asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl terminal alkynes, while ligand switching to (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE could result in asymmetric 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization exclusively. In addition, alkyl substituted terminal alkynes, especially industrially relevant acetylene and propyne, were also valid feedstocks for asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization. This protocol is characterized by good functional group tolerance, a broad scope of substrates (&gt;150&#8197;examples), and mild reaction conditions. We also showcase the value of this method in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complicated bioactive molecules and simplifying the synthetic routes toward the key intermediacy of natural product (bruguierol&#8197;A). Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes to access chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides was developed. The key to success was adopting P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand featured with bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes was developed, affording a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides in moderate to good yields with high enantioselectivities. The key to success was introducing bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group into the rigid P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket. By this approach, regio&#8208; or stereo&#8208;convergent synthesis of enantiomeric succinimides from the mixture of olefin isomers was achieved.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Cuprous&#8208;Based Metal Halides with Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Crystal Structure for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halide, (DFPD)CuX2 (where DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium and X&#8722;=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;), was synthesized. Its conduction band displays enhanced dispersive characteristics with a small effective mass, facilitating higher electron mobility and more efficient electrical injection in light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications.







Abstract
Ternary cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halides, represented by cesium copper iodide (e.g., CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5), are garnering increasing interest for light&#8208;emitting applications owing to their intrinsically high photoluminescence quantum yield and direct band gap. Toward electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), it is highly desirable for the light emitters to have a high structural dimensionality as it may favor efficient electrical injection. However, unlike lead&#8208;based halide perovskites whose light&#8208;emitting units can be facilely arranged in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ways, to date, nearly all ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides crystallize into 0D or 1D networks of Cu&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) polyhedra, whereas 3D and even 2D structures remain mostly uncharted. Here, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a new kind of ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides, (DFPD)CuX2 (DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium), which exhibits unique 2D layered crystal structure. Theoretical calculations reveal a highly dispersive conduction band of (DFPD)CuBr2, which is beneficial for charge carrier injection. It is also of particular significance to find that the 2D (DFPD)CuBr2 crystals show appealing properties, including improved ambient stability and an efficient warm white&#8208;light emission, making it a promising candidate for single&#8208;component lighting and display applications.

&lt;p&gt;Ternary cuprous (Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-based metal halides, represented by cesium copper iodide (e.g., CsCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), are garnering increasing interest for light-emitting applications owing to their intrinsically high photoluminescence quantum yield and direct band gap. Toward electrically driven light-emitting diodes (LEDs), it is highly desirable for the light emitters to have a high structural dimensionality as it may favor efficient electrical injection. However, unlike lead-based halide perovskites whose light-emitting units can be facilely arranged in three-dimensional (3D) ways, to date, nearly all ternary Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-based metal halides crystallize into 0D or 1D networks of Cu&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) polyhedra, whereas 3D and even 2D structures remain mostly uncharted. Here, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a new kind of ternary Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-based metal halides, (DFPD)CuX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (DFPD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=4,4-difluoropiperidinium), which exhibits unique 2D layered crystal structure. Theoretical calculations reveal a highly dispersive conduction band of (DFPD)CuBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is beneficial for charge carrier injection. It is also of particular significance to find that the 2D (DFPD)CuBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystals show appealing properties, including improved ambient stability and an efficient warm white-light emission, making it a promising candidate for single-component lighting and display applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phenyl&#8208;Extended Resorcin[4]arenes: Synthesis and Highly Efficient Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of synthetic macrocycles, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), were designed and synthesized. By incorporating unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold, ExR4 exhibited a flexible backbone. Most importantly, ExR4 displayed remarkable potential in constructing adsorptive materials for iodine capture.







Abstract
The continuous exploration of new analogs of calixarenes and pillararenes unlocks infinite opportunities in supramolecular chemistry and materials. In this work, we introduce a new class of macrocycle, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), a unique and innovative design that incorporates unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold. Single&#8208;crystal analysis reveals a chair&#8208;like conformation for per&#8208;methylated ExR4 (Me&#8208;ExR4) and a twisted &#8220;Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight&#8221; shaped conformation for per&#8208;hydroxylated ExR4 (OH&#8208;ExR4). Notably, OH&#8208;ExR4 demonstrates exceptional adsorption capability toward I3&#8722; ions in an aqueous solution, with a rapid kinetic rate of 1.18&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1. Furthermore, OH&#8208;ExR4 shows excellent recyclability and potential as a stationary phase in column setups. The discovery of ExR4 opens up new avenues for constructing new macrocycles and inspires further research in functional adsorption materials for water pollutant removal.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Totally Renewable Liquid Crystal Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Programmability and Reconfigurable Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene&#8208;based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN) is reported. The Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN can be programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv&#8208;LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv&#8208;LCNs are still limited to heat&#8208;assisted programming and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene&#8208;based DCv&#8208;LCN with room&#8208;temperature programmability and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene&#8208;containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water&#8208;activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv&#8208;LCN can be simply programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv&#8208;LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid&#8208;solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv&#8208;LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.

         <title>Shear&#8208;Strained Pd Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd single atoms suspended on interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed by dislocations (Pd&#8722;CuO) were synthesized through low&#8208;temperature heat treatment. Pd&#8722;CuO introduces the dynamic effects of shear stress and carrier formation into Pd single atoms on dislocations, which can promote water activation and facilitate the hydrogenation of nitrate ions to ammonia.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction method (NitRR) is a low&#8208;carbon, environmentally friendly, and efficient method for synthesizing ammonia, which has received widespread attention in recent years. Copper&#8208;based catalysts have a leading edge in nitrate reduction due to their good adsorption of *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surfaces is difficult and insufficient, resulting in a large amount of the by&#8208;product NO2&#8722;. In this work, Pd single atoms suspended on the interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed due to dislocations (Pd&#8722;CuO) were prepared by low temperature treatment, and the Pd single atoms located on the dislocations were subjected to shear stress and the dynamic effect of support formation to promote the conversion of nitrate into ammonia. The catalysis had an ammonia yield of 4.2&#8197;mol.&#8201;gcat&#8722;1.&#8201;h&#8722;1, and a Faraday efficiency of 90&#8201;% for ammonia production at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE. Electrochemical in situ characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the dynamic effects of Pd single atoms and carriers under shear stress obviously promote the production of active hydrogen, reduce the reaction energy barrier of the decision&#8208;making step for nitrate conversion to ammonia, further promote ammonia generation.

Real&#8208;time in vivo metabolic flux tracking in MIA PaCa&#8208;2 human pancreatic xenografts via MRI is made possible with [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate hyperpolarized through Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei (SABRE&#8208;SHEATH). The use of a perfluorinated iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend allowed efficient separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and resulting in a 22&#8201;% increase in the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate signal. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jessica Ettedgui and co&#8208;workers (e202407349).

An organic zwitterion comprising an acridinium cation and an amidate anion directly linked by an N&#8211;N bond was developed by Takeshi Yanai, Olga Garc&#237;a Manche&#241;o, Kohsuke Ohmatsu, Takashi Ooi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404890). With the aid of hexafluoroisopropanol as a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, this zwitterion acts as a trifunctional photocatalyst to achieve efficient functionalization of inert aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds with electron&#8208;deficient olefins under blue&#8208;light irradiation by sequentially engaging in the hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer, single&#8208;electron reduction, and proton transfer.

A pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) is reported by Jing Lin and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202408064). The &#8220;dormant&#8221; PS in normal cells, depicted in gray, transforms into its &#8220;active mode&#8221; (red) upon entering tumor cells through the portal, where it is activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment and generates toxic singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, selectively killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal tissues.

In aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries , additive molecules with high permanent dipole moment can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8211;dipole interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of the additive molecules also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with the exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Details of this research are reported by Jianwei Li, Guoliang Chai et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407439).

         <title>Substituted Maleimides: Self&#8208;Reportable Linkers and Tags in Bioconjugation, Materials Science, and Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted maleimides are a highly modifiable heterocyclic motif and represent a versatile class of site&#8208;selective linkers characterised by their small size and customisable structures. This minireview encapsulates the evolution of substituted maleimides, detailing their synthetic pathways and specific mechanisms that govern fluorescence. The ongoing development of substituted maleimides aims to expand their applications as next&#8208;generation self&#8208;reportable linkers in bioconjugation, materials science, and nanotechnology.







Abstract
Substituted maleimides are customisable fluorescent linkers and probes with adaptable reactivity and optical properties. Their compact nature and tunability has led to their use in various applications. For example, their solvatochromic properties offer real&#8208;time feedback on linking chemistry and environmental changes, essential for applications in material labelling, drug delivery, and nanoparticle functionalisation. This review focusses on developing, synthesising, and modifying substituted maleimides as environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent linkers and probes. It delves into their photophysical dynamics and strategic applications, highlighting their significant contributions to macromolecule conjugation and the development of self&#8208;reporting materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review starts with a discussion on the diversity of artificial polymerizations, including those triggered by exogenous and endogenous stimuli, as well as those that occur spontaneously. The review also systematically summarizes the biomedical application scenarios of artificial polymerization including but not limited to safeguarding cells, modulating biological events, improving diagnostic performance, and enhancing therapeutic efficacy.







Abstract
Within living organisms, numerous nanomachines are constantly involved in complex polymerization processes, generating a diverse array of biomacromolecules for maintaining biological activities. Transporting artificial polymerizations from lab settings into biological contexts has expanded opportunities for understanding and managing biological events, creating novel cellular compartments, and introducing new functionalities. This review summarizes the recent advancements in artificial polymerizations, including those responding to external stimuli, internal environmental factors, and those that polymerize spontaneously. More importantly, the cutting&#8208;edge biomedical application scenarios of artificial polymerization, notably in safeguarding cells, modulating biological events, improving diagnostic performance, and facilitating therapeutic efficacy are highlighted. Finally, this review outlines the key challenges and technological obstacles that remain for polymerizations in biological organisms, as well as offers insights into potential directions for advancing their practical applications and clinical trials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer in a [NiFe] Hydrogenase Opens a Photochemical Shortcut for Catalytic Dihydrogen Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic studies performed at different temperatures and illumination conditions revealed light&#8208;driven and temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer processes in a thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase, thereby demonstrating the potential of manipulating biocatalytic dihydrogen cleavage with light.







Abstract
[NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible cleavage of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons. Here, we have studied the impact of temperature and illumination on an oxygen&#8208;tolerant and thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase by IR and EPR spectroscopy. Equilibrium mixtures of two catalytic [NiFe] states, Nia&#8208;C and Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, were found to drastically change with temperature, indicating a thermal exchange of electrons between the [NiFe] active site and iron&#8208;sulfur clusters of the enzyme. In addition, IR and EPR experiments performed under illumination revealed an unusual photochemical response of the enzyme. Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, a fully reduced hydride intermediate of the catalytic cycle, was found to be reversibly photoconverted into another catalytic state, Nia&#8208;L. In contrast to the well&#8208;known photolysis of the more oxidized hydride intermediate Nia&#8208;C, photoconversion of Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217; into Nia&#8208;L is an active&#8208;site redox reaction that involves light&#8208;driven electron transfer towards the enzyme's iron&#8208;sulfur clusters. Omitting the ground&#8208;state intermediate Nia&#8208;C, this direct interconversion of these two states represents a potential photochemical shortcut of the catalytic cycle that integrates multiple redox sites of the enzyme. In total, our findings reveal the non&#8208;local redistribution of electrons via thermal and photochemical reaction channels and the potential of accelerating or controlling [NiFe] hydrogenases by light.

         <title>Regulating Spin Polarization via Axial Nitrogen Traction at Fe&#8722;N5 Sites Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction for Zn&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the innovative design of a molten salt method, an axial N traction strategy is developed to reduce the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and achieve precise regulation of the atom. The prepared FeN5@DNC material can regulate the formation of *COOH and desorption of *CO in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity and high current density of 99&#8201;%, and running stably in both flow cell and Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with good performance. It provides a new way to realize the precise regulation of M&#8208;NC catalyst materials.







Abstract
Single Fe sites have been explored as promising catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to value&#8208;added CO. Herein, we introduce a novel molten salt synthesis strategy for developing axial nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8208;N5 sites on ultrathin defect&#8208;rich carbon nanosheets, aiming to modulate the reaction pathway precisely. This distinctive architecture weakens the spin polarization at the Fe sites, promoting a dynamic equilibrium of activated intermediates and facilitating the balance between *COOH formation and *CO desorption at the active Fe site. Notably, the synthesized FeN5, supported on defect&#8208;rich in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (FeN5@DNC), exhibits superior performance in CO2RR, achieving a Faraday efficiency of 99&#8201;% for CO production (&#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) in an H&#8208;cell, and maintaining a Faraday efficiency of 98&#8201;% at a current density of 270&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE) in the flow cell. Furthermore, the FeN5@DNC catalyst is assembled as a reversible Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with a cycle durability of 24&#8197;hours. In situ IR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the axial N coordination traction induces a transformation in the crystal field and local symmetry, therefore weakening the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and lowering the energy barrier for *CO desorption.

         <title>A Four&#8208;Coordinate Pr4+ Imidophosphorane Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallographically characterized Pr4+ imidophosphorane complex is presented, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (where tBu=C(CH3)3), which exhibits a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry in the solid state. The complex exhibits remarkable thermal stability, facilitating rigorous physical characterization that demonstrates the isoelectronic Ce3+ and Pr4+ ions exhibit divergent magnetic properties.







Abstract
The imidophosphorane ligand, [NPtBu3]&#8722; (tBu=tert&#8208;butyl), enables isolation of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral, tetravalent praseodymium complex, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (1&#8208;Pr), which is characterized by a suite of physical characterization methods including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance, and L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge spectroscopies. Variable&#8208;temperature direct&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility data, supported by multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations, demonstrate that the electronic structure diverges from the isoelectronic Ce3+ analogue, driven by increased crystal field. The four&#8208;coordinate environment around Pr4+ in 1&#8208;Pr, which is unparalleled in reported extended solid systems, provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay between crystal field splitting and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in a molecular tetravalent lanthanide within a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxy&#8208;Carbonylation of Aryl and Vinyl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides is reported by utilizing a (P,N)&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation operates under mild reaction conditions with low CO pressure (balloon) and exhibits excellent chemoselectivity for C(sp2)&#8722;I bond over other C(sp2)&#8722;X bonds (X=F, Cl, Br, OMs, and OTf).







Abstract
Herein, for the first time, we disclose the gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides utilizing ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. The present methodology is found to be general, efficient, employs mild reaction conditions and showcases a broad substrate scope even with structurally complex molecules. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed mechanistic pathways distinct from those of conventional transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Polyamides via Main&#8208;Chain Modification of Polyethyleneketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a long&#8208;chain polyamide (polyethyleneamide) from polyethylene bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketone) by the oxime formation and the following Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) worked as a reactive promoter of Beckmann rearrangement to achieve high conversion to amide functional group at mild condition without significant decrease of molecular weight. The formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding in amide group is further confirmed.







Abstract
Long&#8208;chain polyamides (polyethyleneamides) were prepared from polyethylenes bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketones) by the oxime formation and successive Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) was utilized as a promoter, which allowed mild conversion of the oxime group in spite of low solubility of the polymers. The polyethyleneamide exhibited different tensile property compared to a commercial HDPE.

         <title>Multiplexed Shortwave Infrared Imaging Highlights Anatomical Structures in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) quantum dots (QDs) across shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) imaging window for in vivo anatomical imaging. With a single color, we visualized tortuous network of lymphatic vessels and semi&#8208;quantitatively tracked lymphatic drainage over time. Combining all three QD colors, we demonstrated multiplexed imaging to highlight overlapping vasculature and lymphatic structures with singular 808&#8197;nm excitation.







Abstract
Multiplexed fluorescence in vivo imaging remains challenging due to the attenuation and scattering of visible and traditional near infrared (NIR&#8208;I, 650&#8211;950&#8197;nm) wavelengths. Fluorescence imaging using shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm, a.k.a. NIR&#8208;II) light enables deeper tissue penetration due to reduced tissue scattering as well as minimal background autofluorescence. SWIR&#8208;emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaks and optical stability are powerful contrast agents, yet few imaging demonstrations exclusively use SWIR emission beyond two&#8208;color imaging schemes. In this study, we engineered three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) core/shell QDs with distinct SWIR emission peaks ranging from 1100&#8211;1550&#8197;nm for simultaneous three&#8208;color imaging in mice. We first use the exceptional photostability of QDs to non&#8208;invasively track lymphatic drainage with longitudinal imaging, highlighting the detailed networks of lymphatic vessels with widefield imaging over a 2 hr period. We then perform multiplexed imaging with all three QDs to distinctly visualize the lymphatic system and spatially overlapping vasculature networks, including clearly distinguishing the liver and spleen. This work establishes optimized SWIR QDs for next generation multiplexed and longitudinal preclinical imaging, unlocking numerous opportunities for preclinical studies of disease progression, drug biodistribution, and cell trafficking dynamics in living organisms.

         <title>Optimizing Upconversion Quantum Yield via Structural Tuning of Dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione Annihilators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) were explored as annihilators for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) &#8208;tovisible upconversion. Unlike most annihilators, DPNDs can be easily functionalized. This allows us to uncover which structural changes increase annihilator performance. Combining beneficial motifs, we synthesize an optimized annihilator with an upconversion quantum yield almost double that of rubrene, the most commonly used NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is a photophysical process in which two low&#8208;energy photons are converted into one higher&#8208;energy photon. This type of upconversion requires two species: a sensitizer that absorbs low&#8208;energy light and transfers its energy to an annihilator, which emits higher&#8208;energy light after TTA. In spite of the multitude of applications of TTA&#8208;UC, few families of annihilators have been explored. In this work, we show dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) can act as annihilators in TTA&#8208;UC. We found that structural changes to DPND dramatically increase its upconversion quantum yield (UCQY). Our optimized DPND annihilator demonstrates a high maximum internal UCQY of 9.4&#8201;%, outperforming the UCQY of commonly used near&#8208;infrared&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator rubrene by almost double.

         <title>2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;Naphthalene Bis(dicarboximide) Cyclophane: A Photofunctional Host for Ambient Delayed Fluorescence in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activating delayed fluorescence from heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under ambient conditions is arduous. Here, we show triplet harvesting via delayed fluorescence in air using a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy forming a rigid host&#8211;guest structure in solution.







Abstract
Harvesting triplet excitons of heavy atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under aerated conditions is challenging due to the quenching of long&#8208;lived triplet states by molecular oxygen and vibrational dissipation. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach of triplet harvesting via mitigating quenching pathways of a triplet harvester. Specifically, we used a host&#8211;guest system based on 2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;derived cyclophane (NBICy) and carbazole derivative (EtCz). Complexation studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis showed the formation of a rigid host&#8211;guest complex (K&#8776;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in CCl4), resulting in triplet&#8208;exciton stabilization under aerated conditions via mitigating vibrational interference and oxygen quenching. Photophysical studies elucidate the delayed fluorescence emission from the charge&#8208;transfer state (1CT) with a quantum yield (QY) of 6&#8211;8&#8201;% under ambient conditions which increased up to 36&#8201;% in an inert atmosphere.

         <title>Constrained Catalytic Itinerary of a Retaining 3,6&#8208;Anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;Galactosidase, a Key Enzyme in Red Algal Cell Wall Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marine bacterial glycoside hydrolase ZgGH129 proceeds via retention of configuration (depicted is the glycosylation step). The Michaelis complex shows substrate distortion, with both homodimer active sites sitting at the base of a deep crevasse. Trapped complexes with bicyclic&#8208;based molecular tools, kinetics and computational modeling establish an ultra&#8208;constrained hydrolysis mechanism in the southern hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere.







Abstract
The marine Bacteroidota Zobellia galactanivorans has a polysaccharide utilization locus dedicated to the catabolism of the red algal cell wall galactan carrageenan and its unique and industrially important &#945;&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactose (ADG) monosaccharide. Here we present the first analysis of the specific molecular interactions that the exo&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;1,3)&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactosidase ZgGH129 uses to cope with the strict steric restrictions imposed by its bicyclic ADG substrate &#8212; which is ring flipped relative to D&#8208;galactose. Crystallographic snapshots of key catalytic states obtained with the natural substrate and novel chemical tools designed to mimic species along the reaction coordinate, together with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics methods and kinetic studies, demonstrate a retaining mechanism where the second step is rate limiting. The conformational landscape of the constrained 3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranose ring proceeds through enzyme glycosylation B1,4&#8594;[E4]&#8800;&#8594;E4/1C4 and deglycosylation E4/1C4&#8594;[E4]&#8800;&#8594;B1,4 itineraries limited to the Southern Hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere. These results demonstrate the conformational changes throughout catalysis in a non&#8208;standard, sterically restrained, bicyclic monosaccharide, and provide a molecular framework for mechanism&#8208;based inhibitor design for anhydro&#8208;type carbohydrate&#8208;processing enzymes and for future applications involving carrageenan degradation. In addition, our study provides a rare example of distinct niche&#8208;based conformational itineraries within the same carbohydrate&#8208;active enzyme family.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Non&#8208;Canonical C17 Sesquiterpenoids Chlororaphen A and B from Pseudomonas Chlororaphis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenes chlororaphen A and B was investigated in isotopic labelling experiments and by DFT calculations. The results revealed unexpected regular scrambling of 13C&#8208;labelling that can be explained through a late&#8208;stage multistep rearrangement. Up to 14 deuterium atoms were incorporated from D2O, setting a new record in terpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
Chlororaphens A and B are structurally unique non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenoids from Pseudomonas chlororaphis that are made by two SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and a type&#8197;I terpene synthase. This study addresses the mechanism of their formation in isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The results demonstrate an astonishing complexity with distribution of labellings within a cyclopentane core that is reversely connected to two acyclic fragments in chlororaphen A and B. In addition, the uptake of up to 14 deuterium atoms from D2O was observed. These findings are explainable by a repeated late stage multistep rearrangement sequence. The absolute configurations of the chlororaphens and their biosynthetic intermediates were elucidated in stereoselective labelling experiments.

         <title>Molecular Editing of Pyrroles to Benzenes/Naphthalenes by N2O Deletion.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular editing reaction for converting pyrrole rings into benzene rings through a sequential pathway of Diels&#8211;Alder and cheletropic reactions was developed. The nitrogen atom in a N&#8208;bridged intermediate is eliminated in the form of N2O by a strain&#8208;releasing pathway, ultimately leading to the formation of substituted benzene and naphthalene derivatives.







Abstract
Molecular editing promises to facilitate the rapid diversification of complex molecular architectures by rapidly and conveniently altering core frameworks. This approach has the potential to accelerate both drug discovery and total synthesis. In this study, we present a novel protocol for the molecular editing of pyrroles. Initially, N&#8208;Boc pyrroles and alkynes are converted into N&#8208;bridged compounds through a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These compounds then undergo deprotection of the Boc group, nitrosylation, and cheletropic N2O extrusion to yield benzene or naphthalene products. By using benzyne as a substrate, this method can be conceptually viewed as a fusion of skeletal editing of the pyrrole ring and site&#8208;selective peripheral editing of the benzene ring. Furthermore, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept protocol has demonstrated its potential to transform the (hetero)arene motif from commercially available drugs, offering the possibility of generating new biologically active compounds.

         <title>Stabilization of the Compressed Planar Benzene Dianion in Inverse&#8208;Sandwich Rare Earth Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, the capture of a planar antiaromatic benzene dianion in between two trivalent rare earth (RE) metal cations, each stabilized by two guanidinate ligands, is reported. The synthesized inverse&#8208;sandwich complexes [{(Me3Si)2NC(NiPr)2}2RE]2(&#181;&#8211;&#414;6:&#414;6&#8211;C6H6), (RE = Y (1), Dy (2), and Er (3)) feature a remarkably planar benzene dianion, previously not encountered for any metal ion prone to low or absent covalency. The &#8208;2 charge localization at the benzene ligand was deduced from the results obtained by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, spectroscopy, magnetometry, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. In the 1H NMR spectrum of the diamagnetic Y complex 1, the equivalent proton resonance of the bridging benzene dianion ligand is drastically shifted to higher field in comparison to free benzene. This and the calculated highly positive Nucleus&#8208;Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) values are attributed to the antiaromatic character of the benzene dianion ligand. &#160;The crucial role of the ancillary guanidinate ligand scaffold in stabilizing the planar benzene dianion conformation was also elucidated by DFT calculations. Remarkably, the planarity of the benzene dianion originates from the stabilization of the &#960;&#8208;type orbitals of the d&#8208;manifold and compression through its strong electrostatic interaction with the two REIII sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Photocatalytic Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer by a Zirconium&#8208;based Molecular Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reductive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) has important energetic implications in numerous synthetic and natural redox processes. The development of catalytic systems that can mediate such transformations has become an attractive target, especially when light is used to generate the reactive species towards solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion. However, such approach becomes challenged by kinetic competition with H2 evolution. Here we describe the excited state reactivity of a molecular Zr&#8208;based platform under visible light irradiation for the efficient reduction of multiple bonds. Mechanistic investigations shine light on a charge separation process that colocalizes an excited electron and an acidic proton to promote selective PCET. We further leveraged this reactivity for the photocatalytic reduction of a variety of organic substrates. Our results demonstrate the promise of this molecular platform to design strong photocatalytic PCET mediators for reductive transformations. More broadly, we also show the potential relevance of PCET mechanisms in the (photo)redox chemistry of Zr&#8208;based molecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Oxidative Catalytic Reactions Triggered by Cavitation Bubbles Confinement on Copper Oxide Microstructured Particles.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient energy transfer management in catalytic processes is crucial for overcoming activation energy barriers while minimizing costs and CO2 emissions. We exploit here a concept of CuO particle design with multiple gas&#8208;stabilizing sites, engineered to function as cavitation nuclei and catalysts. This concept facilitates the selective and efficient acoustic energy transfer directly to the catalyst surface, avoiding the undesired dissipation of acoustic energy into the bulk solution while demonstrating superior cavitation properties at lower acoustic pressure amplitudes. Utilizing a chemical thermometric approach, we demonstrate that the local temperature on the surface of our CuO particles during cavitation bubble implosions can create an effective equivalent temperature of about 360&#176;C. This temperature effect facilitates the efficient catalysis of oxidative reactions using an organic probe molecule. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to assess the decomposition of H2O2 and of pollutant probe molecule on CuO (111). Our work represents a significant advance in sonocatalytic systems, promising efficient energy use in catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Laser&#8208;Driven Modular Precision Chemistry of Graphene Using &#955;3&#8208;iodanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emerging laser writing represents an efficient and promising strategy for covalent two dimensional (2D)&#8208;patterning of graphene yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of applicable reagents. Here, we report a versatile approach for covalent laser patterning of graphene using a family of trivalent organic iodine compounds as effective reagents, allowing for the engraving of a library of functionalities onto the graphene surface. The relatively weak iodine&#8208;centered bonds within these compounds can readily undergo laser&#8208;induced cleavage to in situ generate radicals localized to the irradiated regions for graphene binding, thus completing the covalent 2D&#8208;structuring of this 2D&#8208;film. The tailor&#8208;made attachment of distinct functional moieties with varying electrical properties as well as their thermally reversible binding manner enables programming the surface properties of graphene. With this delicate strategy the bottleneck of a limited scope of functional groups patterned onto the graphene surface upon laser writing is tackled.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Yielding Nanobelt Formation by Chirality&#8208;Assisted Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shape&#8208;persistent Conjugated nanobelts are fascinating synthetic targets. However, in most cases these are made in low overall yields by applying strategies of macrocyclization followed by (multiple) ring fusion reactions for nanobelt formation. Here, we describe the high yielding synthesis of enantiopure chiral nanobelts in 84% yield by applying chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis (CAS). The chiral nanobelts were investigated by UV/vis and CD spectroscopy. By DFT calculations the aromaticity of these structures is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Kinetics through Interfacial Environments Induced Surface Migration of Adsorbed Hydroxyl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing bifunctional sites through heterojunction engineering to accelerate water formation has become a pivotal strategy to improve the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics, which is mainly focused on the synergistic effect of neighboring sites and the energetics of the surface reaction steps. However, the roles of the surface migration of key intermediates that go beyond the bifunctional mechanism limited to neighboring atoms have usually been ignored. Using the heterostructured Ni3C&#8208;Ni catalyst as a model, we found that the rapid surface migration of OHad species from the positively charged Ni3C to the negatively charged Ni component played a decisive role in facilitating water formation. Such unprecedented surface migration of OHad is induced by the large discrepancy between the local surface charge densities and interfacial environments of the Ni3C and Ni components under operating conditions. Benefiting from this, the resultant Ni3C&#8208;Ni exhibited outstanding mass activity for the alkaline HOR, which was approximately 19&#8208;fold and 21&#8208;fold higher than those of Ni and Ni3C, respectively. These findings not only provide novel insights into the alkaline HOR mechanism of heterostructured catalysts but also open new avenues for developing advanced electrocatalysts for alkaline fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Erbium ions are commonly used to extend the photoelectric properties of metal halide perovskites from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency multi&#8208;mode luminescence in a single system is difficult due to the weak absorption associated with forbidden 4f&#8208;4f transitions. In this study, a unique strategy is proposed to adjust multi&#8208;mode luminescence and enhance NIR&#8208;II emission in Cs2NaBiCl6 by incorporating Fe3+ ions. The as&#8208;prepared material demonstrates reversible thermochromism, driven by strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling effect, and exhibits tunable luminescence that can be adjusted by altering excitation energy and temperature. Notably, benefitting from the charge transfer transition of Fe3+&#8208;Cl&#8208; along with the influence of Fe3+ doping on the geometrical and electronic structures, the blue&#8208;excitable (450 nm) NIR&#8208;II emission around 1541 nm from Er3+ is realized for the first time, achieving an intensity 16.7 times higher and a maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 22.5%. This enhancement enables innovative applications such as two&#8208;dimensional information encryption by the multi&#8208;channel cooperative responses and improved NIR imaging. The study highlights the potential of Fe3+ doping in optimizing absorption and multi&#8208;mode luminescence in perovskites, opening avenues for advanced applications in blue&#8208;excitable NIR light emitting diodes, thermometer, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and NIR imaging.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Erbium ions are commonly used to extend the photoelectric properties of metal halide perovskites from visible to near-infrared (NIR) range. However, achieving high-efficiency multi-mode luminescence in a single system is difficult due to the weak absorption associated with forbidden 4f-4f transitions. In this study, a unique strategy is proposed to adjust multi-mode luminescence and enhance NIR-II emission in Cs2NaBiCl6 by incorporating Fe3+ ions. The as-prepared material demonstrates reversible thermochromism, driven by strong electron-phonon coupling effect, and exhibits tunable luminescence that can be adjusted by altering excitation energy and temperature. Notably, benefitting from the charge transfer transition of Fe3+-Cl- along with the influence of Fe3+ doping on the geometrical and electronic structures, the blue-excitable (450 nm) NIR-II emission around 1541 nm from Er3+ is realized for the first time, achieving an intensity 16.7 times higher and a maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 22.5%.
