      <title>A Blinking Mesoporous TiO2&#8208;x Composed of Nanosized Anatase with Unusually Long&#8208;Lived Trapped Charge Carriers</title>
      <dc:description>A novel mesoporous TiO2&#8208;x material that is comprised of small, crystalline, vacancy&#8208;rich anatase nanoparticles that show unique optical, thermal and electronic properties is synthesized using polymer&#8208;derived mesoporous carbon (PDMC) as a template. The PDMC pores serve as physical barriers during the condensation and pyrolysis of a titania precursor, preventing the titania nanoparticles from growing beyond 10 nm in size. Unlike most titania nanomaterials, the particles remain in anatase phase and undergo no transition to rutile phase, and also become catalytically&#8208;active reduced TiO2&#8208;x, during pyrolysis. When exposed to a slow electron beam, the nanoparticles exhibit an unprecedented charge/discharge behavior, continuously lighting up and fading away for an average period of ca. 15 s, for an extended period of time. The nanoparticles also show a 50 nm&#8208;red&#8208;shift in their UV&#8208;vis absorption and long&#8208;lived charge carriers (electrons and holes) at room temperature in the dark, even long after UV irradiation. The potential of the new anatase nanoparticles as photocatalysts is demonstrated using CO2 reduction, in which they show a good activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Adaptive flexible sialylated nanogels as highly potent influenza A virus inhibitors</title>
      <dc:description>Flexible multivalent 3&#8208;D nanosystems which can deform and adapt onto the virus surface via specific ligand&#8208;receptor multivalent interactions can efficiently block the virus adhesion onto the cell. We here report on the synthesis of a 250 nm sized flexible sialylated nanogel which adapts onto the influenza A virus (IAV) surface via multivalent binding of its sialic acid (SA) residues with hemagglutinin spike proteins on the virus surface. We could demonstrate that the high flexibility of SA residues in the flexible nanogel improves IAV inhibition by 400 times as compared to a rigid sialylated nanogel in the hemagglutination inhibition assay. The flexible sialylated nanogel efficiently inhibits the Influenza A/X31 (H3N2) infection with IC50  values in low picomolar concentrations and also blocks the virus entry into MDCK&#8208;II cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Absolute Configuration of Small Molecules by Co&#8208;Crystallization</title>
      <dc:description>The most reliable method to determine the absolute configuration of chiral molecules is X&#8208;ray crystallography, but small molecules can be difficult to crystallize. We report rapid co&#8208;crystallization of tetraaryladamantanes with small molecules as different as n&#8208;decane and nicotine, producing crystals for X&#8208;ray analysis and the assignment of absolute configuration where the molecules are chiral. A screen of 52 diverse compounds gave inclusion in co&#8208;crystals in 88% of all cases and a high resolution structure in 77 % of the cases. Further, starting from three milligrams of analyte, a combination of NMR and an X&#8208;ray crystallography was demonstrated that produces a full structure in less than three days, using an adamantane crystallization chaperone that encapsulates the analyte at room temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultrahighly Branched Main&#8208;Chain&#8208;Functionalized Polyethylenes via Inverted Insertion Selectivity</title>
      <dc:description>Branched polyolefin microstructures resulting from &#8216;chain walking&#8217; are a fascinating feature of late transition metal catalysts, but so far it has not been demonstrated how any desirable branched polyolefin microstructures can be generated hereby. We show how ultrahighly&#8208;branched polyethylenes with exclusively methyl&#8208;branches (220 Me/1000 C) and very high molecular weights (~10  6  g mol  &#8208;1  ), that reach the branch density and microstructure of commercial ethylene&#8208;propylene elastomers, can be generated from ethylene alone. At the same time polar groups on the main chain can be generated by in&#8208;chain incorporation of methyl acrylate. Key is a novel rigid environment in an &#945;&#8208;diimine Pd(II) catalyst with a steric constraint that allows for excessive chain walking and branching, but restricts branch formation to methyl branches, hinders chain transfer to afford a living polymerization, and inverts the regioselectivity of acrylate insertion to a 1,2&#8208;mode.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct observation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>The mechanism of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), which overcomes the common aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) problem in organic optoelectronics, is revealed by monitoring the real time structural evolution and dynamics of electronic excited state with frequency and polarization resolved ultrafast ultraviolet/infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. The formation of Woodward&#8208;Hoffmann cyclic intermediates upon ultraviolet excitation is observed within picoseconds in dilute solutions of AIE molecule tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivatives but not in their respective solid. The ultrafast excited state cyclization by crossing a conical intersection (CI) provides an efficient nonradiative relaxation pathway in solutions. Without such a reaction mechanism, the electronic excitation is preserved in the molecular solids and the molecule fluoresces efficiently, aided by the very slow intermolecular charge and energy transfers due to the well separated molecular packing arrangement in solids. The mechanisms can be general for tuning the properties of chromophores in different phases for various important applications.</dc:description>

Intermetallic compounds with the well&#8208;defined crystal and electronic structures as well as particular chemical bonding features are suggested here to act as precursors for new composite materials with attractive catalytic properties.

      <title>The Enantioselective Preparation of Arenes with &#946;&#8208;Stereogenic Centers: Confronting the 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Olefin Problem Using CuH/Pd Cooperative Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Arenes with &#946;&#8208;stereogenic centers are important substructures in pharmaceuticals and natural products. Their synthesis traditionally involves two separate and individually challenging steps: enantioselective synthesis of a chiral main&#8208;group organometallic complex and subsequent cross&#8208;coupling with an aryl electrophile. We describe the development of asymmetric anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroarylation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins by dual palladium and copper hydride catalysis as a convenient and significantly more general alternative. This reaction is an efficient one&#8208;step process that addresses several limitations of the stepwise approaches. The use of cesium benzoate as a base and a common phosphine ligand for both the Cu&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalyzed processes were important discoveries that allowed these challenging olefin substrates to be efficiently transformed to products. A variety of aryl bromide coupling partners, including numerous heterocycles, were coupled with 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes to generate arenes with &#946;&#8208;stereogenic centers. Finally, the effect of the level of olefin substitution on reaction yield and enantioselectivity has been investigated.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Halide perovskites show incredible photovoltaic power conversion efficiency coupled with several hundreds of hours of device stability for finely tuned material compositions. It is expected to employ such a successful photovoltaic material in (photo)electrochemical(PEC) systems, including solar water splitting.

Here we report a vacancy ordered halide perovskite, Cs  2  PtI  6  , which shows extraordinary stability in ambient (1 year), aqueous medium of extreme acidic (pH 1), basic (pH 13) and electrochemical reduction conditions. We investigated their electrochemical and photoelectrochemical redox processes under various pH and applied potentials, and employed them as electrocatalyst&#160;and photoanode&#160;for hydrogen production and water oxidation respectively. The catalyst remains intact for at least 100 cycles of electrochemical cycling and six hours of hydrogen production at pH 1. The Cs  2  PtI  6  was employed as photoanode for PEC water oxidation and at pH 11, the material displayed photocurrent of 0.8 mA cm  &#8208;2  under simulated AM1.5G sunlight.

      <title>Fast and Stable N&#8208;Terminal Cysteine Modification via Thiazolidino Boronate Mediated Acyl Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>We report herein a novel conjugation chemistry of N&#8208;terminal cysteines (NCys) that proceeds with fast kinetics and exquisite selectivity, allowing facile modification of NCys&#8208;bearing proteins in complex biological milieu. This new NCys conjugation proceeds with  a thiazolidine boronate (TzB) intermediate  that results from fast (  k  2  : ~5000 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1) and reversible conjugation of NCys with 2&#8208;formylphenylboronic acid (FPBA). We have designed a FPBA derivative that upon TzB formation elicits an intramolecular acyl transfer to give N&#8208;acyl thiazolidines. In contrast to the quick hydrolysis of TzB, the N&#8208;acylated thiazolidines exhibit robust stability under physiologic conditions. The utility of the TzB mediated NCys conjugation is demonstrated by rapid and non&#8208;disruptive labeling of two enzymes.

      <title>Precision Conjugation: An Emerging Tool for Generating Protein&#8208;Polymer Conjugates</title>
      <dc:description>Protein&#8208;polymer conjugates are increasingly applied to biomedicine due to a unique combination of the biological activity from the proteins and the multifunctionality and flexibility from the polymers. However, traditional protein&#8208;polymer conjugation techniques suffer from some unavoidable drawbacks, including non&#8208;specificity and low efficiency. In this minireview, we discuss a new approach based on &#8220;  Precision Conjugation  &#8221; to the construction of the next&#8208;generation protein&#8208;polymer conjugates in a better controlled, more efficient, and tailorable fashion for broad and advanced applications. In illustrating the concept, we highlight two general methodologies known as site&#8208;specific in situ growth (SIG) and intrinsically&#8208;disordered polypeptide fusion (IPF), with a focus on the in situ, efficient, and controllable formation of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates.

      <title>Shedding Light on the Diverse Reactivity of an Al(I) Compound with N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
      <dc:description>The aluminum (I) compound NacNacAl (  1  ) shows diverse and substrate&#8208;controlled reactivity in reactions with  N  &#8208;heterocycles. DMAP, a basic substrate in which the 4&#8208;position is blocked, induces rearrangement of NacNacAl by shifting a hydrogen atom from the methyl group of the NacNac backbone to the aluminum center. In contrast, CH activation of the methyl group of 4&#8208;picoline takes place to produce a species with a reactive terminal methylene. Reaction of  1  with 3,5&#8208;lutidine results in the first example of an uncatalyzed, room temperature cleavage of an sp  2  C&#8208;H bond (in the 4&#8208;position) by Al(I). Another reactivity mode was observed for quinoline which undergoes 2,2&#8217;&#8208;coupling. Finally, reaction with phthalazine produces the product of N&#8208;N bond cleavage.</dc:description>

      <title>Selection of DNA&#8208;encoded Dynamic Chemical Libraries for Direct Inhibitor Discovery</title>
      <dc:description>Dynamic combinatorial library (DCL) is a powerful tool for ligand discovery in biomedical research; however, the development of DCL has been hampered by its low diversity. Recently, the concept of DNA encoding has been employed in DCL to create DNA&#8208;encoded dynamic libraries (DEDLs); however, all current DEDLs are limited to fragment identification, and a challenging process of fragment linking is required after selection. We report an anchor&#8208;directed DEDL approach that can identify full ligand structures from large&#8208;scale DEDLs. This method is also able to convert unbiased libraries to focused ones targeting specific protein classes. We demonstrated this method by selecting DEDLs against five proteins, and novel inhibitors have been identified for all targets. Notably, several selective BD1/BD2 inhibitors were identified from the selections against BRD4 (bromodomain 4), an important anti&#8208;cancer drug target. This work may provide a broadly applicable method for inhibitor discovery.</dc:description>

      <title>Bridge Bonded Oxygen Ligands between Approximated FeN4 Sites Confer the Catalysts with High ORR Performance</title>
      <dc:description>The applications of the most promising Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts are prohibited by their limited intrinsic activity. Manipulating the Fe energy level through anchoring electron withdrawing ligands is found effective in boosting the catalytic performance. However, such regulation remains  elusive  as the ligands are only uncontrollably introduced owning to their energetically instable nature. Here we report a rational manipulation strategy for introducing axial bonded O to the Fe sites, attained through hexa&#8208;coordinating Fe with oxygen functional groups in the precursor. Moreover, the O modifier is stabilized by forming the Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Fe bridge bond, with the approximation of two FeN  4  sites. The energy level modulation thus created confers the sites with an intrinsic activity over 10 times higher than the normal FeN  4  site. Our finding opens up a novel strategy to manage coordination environment at atomic scale towards high activity ORR catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Centimeter&#8208;sized Single Crystal of Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Perovskites Incorporating Straight Chain Symmetric Diammonium Ion for Efficient X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) AA&#8242;n&#8722;1MnX3n+1 type halide perovskites incorporating straight chain symmetric diammonium cations define a new type of structure that holds potential of both highly efficient charge transport and high environmental stability. Unfortunately, their optoelectronic properties are largely unexplored and there is lack of high quality single crystals in large dimension for practical application. Here, we ventured into synthesizing centimeter&#8208;sized AA&#8242;n&#8722;1MnX3n+1 type perovskite BDAPbI4 (BDA = NH3C4H8NH3) single crystal and reported its charge transport properties under X&#8208;ray excitation. The crystals were grown via a modified temperature crystallization method. It is found that the crystal shows a staggered configuration of the [PbI6]4&#8208; layers, a bandgap of 2.37 eV and a low trap density of 3.1 &#215; 109 cm&#8208;3. The single crystal X&#8208;ray detector exhibits an excellent sensitivity of 242 &#181;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 under the 10 V bias (0.31 V &#956;m&#8208;1), a detection limit as low as 430 nGyair s&#8208;1, ultra&#8208;stable response current, a stable baseline with the lowest dark current drift of 6.06 &#215;10&#8208;9 nA cm&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 V&#8208;1, and rapid response time of &#964;rise = 7.3 ms and &#964;fall = 22.5 ms. The effective synthesis method and excellent charge transport properties of AA&#8242;n&#8722;1MnX3n+1 type 2D perovskite single crystals make them promising candidates for the next generation of optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Photoinduced Olefin Diamination with Alkylamines</title>
      <dc:description>Vicinal diamines are ubiquitous materials in organic and medicinal chemistry, and methods for their preparation are of relevance to a broad range of chemical applications. The direct coupling of olefin and amine building blocks would represent an ideal approach to construct these motifs. However, alkene diamination remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in organic synthesis, especially when two different amine components need to be introduced. Here we report a general strategy for the direct and selective assembly of vicinal 1,2&#8208;diamines using readily available olefin and amine building blocks. This mild and straightforward approach exploits the  in situ  formation and photoinduced activation of  N  &#8208;chloroamines leading to aminium radicals that enable efficient alkene aminochlorination. Owing to the ambiphilic nature of the b &#8208;chloroamines accessed, conversion into tetra&#8208;alkyl aziridinium ions was possible, thus enabling diamination by regioselective ring&#8208;opening with both primary and secondary amines. Overall, this strategy streamlines the preparation of vicinal diamines from current multi&#8208;step sequences to a single chemical transformation. This operationally simple process has broad functional group compatibility and enables the use of advanced building blocks for the preparation of drug&#8208;like small molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Emergence of Radical&#8208;Stabilizing Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a New Type of Radio&#8208;Photoluminescence Dosimeter</title>
      <dc:description>Radio&#8208;photoluminescence (RPL) materials display a distinct phenomenon of radiation induced permanent luminescence center, therefore finding critical applications in detection of ionizing radiation doses. The current inventory of RPL materials have been limited to a small range of metal ion doped inorganic materials with several demerits while old strategy for finding new RPL materials is serendipitous and challenging. Here we document the RPL property in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) for the first time by accumulating the X&#8208;ray induced free radicals on the organic linker, which are subsequently stabilized in the conjugated fragment in the structure while the metal center act as the X&#8208;ray attenuator. These radicals afford new emission features in both UV&#8208;excited and X&#8208;ray excited luminescence spectra, allowing for the establishment of linear relationships between radiation dose and the normalized intensity of the new emission feature. The MOF based RPL materials exhibit advantages in the dose detection range, reusability, emission stability, and energy threshold. Based on a comprehensive electronic structure and energy diagram study, a rational design philosophy and a substantial candidate expansion of RPL materials with application potentials can be anticipated.</dc:description>

      <title>Precise control over kinetics of molecular assembly for producing particles with tunable sizes and crystalline forms</title>

      <title>Heteroatom dopants&#8208;promoted two&#8208;electron O2 reduction for photocatalytic production of H2O2 on polymeric carbon nitride</title>
      <dc:description>Polymeric carbon nitride modified with selected heteroatom dopants in a cyclic melon was prepared and used as a model photocatalyst to identify and understand the key mechanisms required for efficient photoproduction of H  2  O  2  via selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The photochemical production of H  2  O  2  was achieved at a millimolar level per hour under visible light irradiation along with 100% apparent quantum yield (in 360&#8208;450 nm region) and 96% selectivity in an electrochemical system (0.1 V vs. RHE). Spectroscopic analysis in spatiotemporal resolution and theoretical calculations revealed that the synergistic association of alkali and sulfur dopants in polymeric matrix promoted the interlayer charge separation and polarization of trapped electrons for preferable oxygen capture and reduction in ORR kinetics. This work highlights the key features that are responsible for controlling the photocatalytic activity and selectivity toward the two&#8208;electron ORR, which should be the basis of further development of solar H  2  O  2  production.</dc:description>

      <title>A Multitargeted Approach in the Discovery of an Organorhodium Anticancer Agent Based On Vorinostat as a Potent Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor</title>
      <dc:description>The combination of more than one bioactive moiety in a mulitargeted anticancer agent may result in synergistic activity of its components. Using this concept, bioorganometallic compounds were designed to feature a metal center, a 2&#8208;pyridinecarbothioamide (PCA), and a hydroxamic acid, which is found in the anticancer drug vorinostat (SAHA). The organometallics showed inhibitory activity in the nanomolar range against histone deacetylases (HDACs) as the key target for SAHA. In particular, Rh complex  4c  was a potent inhibitor of HDAC6 over HDAC1 and HDAC8. While especially  4c  was highly cytotoxic in human cancer cells, it showed low toxicity in hemolysis studies and zebrafish, demonstrating the role of the metal center. For  4c  , a slightly reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) was established, which was upregulated by SAHA. This indicates that the new organometallics display different modes of action than their components, supporting the development of non&#8208;conventional anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Sequential and timely combination of cancer nanovaccine with immune checkpoint blockade effectively inhibits tumor growth and relapse</title>
      <dc:description>Cancer nanovaccines that use nanomaterials as antigens and/or adjuvant&#8208;delivering carriers can induce tumor antigen&#8208;specific T cell immunity and have shown potential as therapeutic modalities in in vivo animal models. Moreover, the addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy to cancer nanovaccines can further potentiate the antitumor efficacy of the latter. However, little effort has been made to develop an optimal treatment regimen based on treatment sequence and the timing of each modality. The present study describes a small lipid nanoparticle (SLNP)&#8208;based nanovaccine platform and a new combination treatment regimen. Tumor antigen&#8208;displaying, CpG adjuvant&#8208;embedded SLNPs (OVAPEP&#8208;SLNP@CpG) were prepared from biocompatible phospholipids and a cationic cholesterol derivative. The resulting nanovaccine showed highly potent antitumor efficacy in both prophylactic and therapeutic E.G7 tumor models. However, this vaccine simultaneously induced T cell exhaustion by elevating PD&#8208;L1 expression, leading to tumor recurrence. Thus, the nanovaccine was combined with simultaneous anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody treatment, but the therapeutic efficacy of this regimen was comparable to that of the nanovaccine alone. Finally, mice that showed a good therapeutic response after the first cycle of immunization with the nanovaccine underwent a second cycle of immunization together with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 therapy, resulting in effective suppression of tumor relapse. These findings suggest that the antitumor efficacy of combinations of nanovaccines with ICB therapy is dependent on treatment sequence and the timing of each modality.</dc:description>

      <title>Prey for the Proteasome: Targeted Protein Degradation &#8211; A Medicinal Chemist&#180;s Perspective</title>
      <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation (TPD), the ability to control a proteins fate by triggering its degradation in a highly selective and effective manner, has created tremendous excitement in chemical biology and drug discovery within the past decades. The TPD field is spearheaded by small molecule induced protein degradation with molecular glues and proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) paving the way to expand the druggable space and to create a new paradigm in drug discovery.

      <title>On the Dynamic Interaction of n&#8208;Butane with Imidazolium&#8208;based Ionic Liquids</title>
      <dc:description>The impact of a reactant from the gas phase on the surface of a liquid and its transfer through this gas/liquid interface are crucial for various concepts applying ionic liquids (ILs) in catalysis. We investigated the first step of the adsorption dynamics of n&#8208;butane on a series of 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ILs ([C  n  C  1  Im][Tf  2  N]; n = 1, 2, 3, 8). Using a supersonic molecular beam in ultra&#8208;high vacuum, the trapping of n&#8209;butane on the frozen ILs was determined as a function of surface temperature, between 90 and 125&#160;K. On the C  8  &#8208; and C  3  &#8208;ILs, n&#8208;butane adsorbs at 90&#160;K with an initial trapping probability of ~0.89. The adsorption energy increases with increasing length of the IL alkyl chain, whereas the ionic headgroups seem to interact only weakly with n&#8208;butane. The absence of adsorption on the C  1  &#8208; and C  2  &#8208;ILs is attributed to a too short residence time on the IL surface to form nuclei for condensation even at 90&#160;K.</dc:description>

      <title>High Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with the Polymer Acceptor Synthesized via a Random Ternary Copolymerization Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we demonstrated a simple random ternary copolymerization strategy to synthesize a series of polymer acceptors PTPBT&#8208;ET  x  by polymerizing a small molecule acceptor unit modified from Y6 with thiophene connecting unit and controlled amount of 3&#8208;ethylesterthiophene (ET) unit. Compared PTPBT of only Y6&#8208;like units and thiophene units, PTPBT&#8208;ET  x  (where x represents the molar ratio of ET unit) with incorporating ET unit in the ternary copolymers show up&#8208;shifted LUMO energy level, increased electron mobility and improved blend morphology in the blend film with polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T. And the all&#8208;PSC based on PBDB&#8208;T:PTPBT&#8208;ET  0.3  achieved high power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 12.5%. In addition, the PTPBT&#8208;ET  0.3  based all&#8208;PSC device also exhibits long&#8208;term photostability over 300 hours. These results demonstrate that the random ternary copolymerization of a small molecule acceptor unit with a third functional unit is a simple but effective strategy to develop efficient polymer acceptors for all&#8208;PSCs.</dc:description>

      <title>N2 Electroreduction to NH3 via Selenium Vacancy&#8208;Rich ReSe2 Catalysis at an Abrupt Interface</title>
      <dc:description>Vacancy engineering has been proved repeatedly as an adoptable strategy to boost electrocatalysis, while its poor selectivity restricts the usage in nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) as overwhelming competition from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

      <title>Can Lithium Metal Anode Cycle at 90&#176;C in Liquid Electrolyte?</title>
      <dc:description>Stable operation at elevated temperature is necessary for lithium (Li) metal anode as the promising anode for next&#8208;generation batteries in diversified scenarios. However, Li metal anode generally undergoes poor performances and even safety concerns at high temperature (&gt; 55&#176;C) due to the thermal instability of electrolyte and solid electrolyte interphase in a routine liquid electrolyte. Herein a Li metal anode working at an elevated temperature of 90&#176;C is demonstrated in a thermal&#8208;stable electrolyte. In Li | LiFePO4 battery working at 90&#176;C, Li metal anode undergoes 100 cycles compared with 10 cycles in a practical carbonate electrolyte. During the formation of solid electrolyte interphase, the independent and incomplete decomposition of Li salts and solvents aggravate. Some unstable intermediate decomposition products emerge at 90&#176;C, degenerating the uniformity of Li deposition. This work not only demonstrates a working Li metal anode at 90&#176;C, but also provides fundamental understanding of solid electrolyte interphase and Li deposition at elevated temperature for rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Helical Toroids Self&#8208;Assembled from a Binary System of Polypeptide Homopolymer and Its Block Copolymer</title>
      <dc:description>Toroids and helices are fundamental geometrical structures in nature. Polymers can self&#8208;assemble into various nanostructures, including both toroids and helices; however, nanostructures combining toroidal and helical morphologies, i.e.,  helical toroids, are rarely observed. Herein, we report that a binary system containing polypeptide homopolymer and its block copolymer can hierarchically self&#8208;assemble into uniform helical nanotoroids in solution. The formation of the helical toroids is a successive two&#8208;step process. First, the homopolymers aggregate into fibrils and convolve into toroids, resembling the toroidal condensation of DNA chains. Second, the block copolymers self&#8208;assemble on the homopolymer toroids resulting in helical surface patterns. Additionally, the chirality of the surface helical patterns can be varied by the chirality of the polypeptide block copolymers.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Here, we report surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering&#8208;chiral anisotropy (SERS&#8208;ChA) effect that combines chiral discrimination and surface Raman scattering enhancement on chiral nanostructured Au films (CNAFs) equipped in the normal Raman scattering Spectrometer. The CNAFs provided remarkably higher enhancement factors of Raman scattering (EFs) for particular enantiomers, and the SERS intensity was proportional to the enantiomeric excesses (  ee)  values. Except for molecules with mesomeric species, all of tested enantiomers exhibited high SERS&#8208;ChA asymmetry factors (  g  ), ranging between 1.34 and 1.99 regardless of polarities, sizes, chromophores, concentrations and&#160;  ee  .

      <title>Observation of Transition&#8208;Metal Boron Triple Bonds in IrB2O&#8211; and ReB2O&#8211;</title>
      <dc:description>Multiple bonds between boron and transition metals are known in many borylene (:BR) complexes via metal dp &#174; BR back donation, despite the electron&#8208;deficiency of boron. Electron&#8208;precise metal&#8208;boron triple bond was first observed in BiB2O&#8211; [Bi&#8801;B&#8208;B&#8801;O]&#8211;, in which both boron atoms can be viewed as being engaged in sp hybridization and the [B&#8208;BO]&#8211; fragment is isoelectronic to a carbyne (CR). To search for the first electron&#8208;precise transition&#8208;metal&#8208;boron triple bond species, we have produced IrB2O&#8211; and ReB2O&#8211; and investigated them by photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum calculations. Well&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectra are combined with ab initio calculations to elucidate the structures and bonding in the two clusters. We find IrB2O&#8211; has a closed&#8208;shell bent structure (Cs, 1A'), with BO&#8211; coordinated to an Ir&#8801;B unit, (&#8211;OB)Ir&#8801;B, whereas ReB2O&#8211; is found to be linear (C&#8734;, 3S&#8211;) with an electron&#8208;precise Re&#8801;B triple bond, [Re&#8801;B&#8208;B&#8801;O]&#8211;.

      <title>A Physical Model for Understanding the Activation of MoS2 Basal&#8208;plane Sulfur Atoms for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Weak binding of hydrogen atoms to the 2H&#8208;MoS  2  basal plane renders MoS  2  inert as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Transition metal doping can activate neighboring sulfur atoms in the MoS  2  basal plane to bind hydrogen more strongly. Our density functional theory&#8208;based studies show strong variation in the degree of activation by dopants across the 3d transition metal series (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). To understand the trends in activation, we propose a theoretical model based on the electronic promotion energy required to convert the full valence shell of a local sulfur atom to be partially open and therefore ready to bond with a hydrogen atom. In general, the promotion is achieved through an electron transfer from the sulfur to neighboring metal atom sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate a specific, electronic&#8208;structure based descriptor for hydrogen binding strength: D  dp  , the local interband energy separation between the lowest empty d&#8208;states on the dopant metal atoms and occupied p&#8208;states on S. This model can be used to provide guidelines for chalcogen activation in future catalyst design based on doped transition metal dichalcogenides.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8211;organic Layers Derived Atomically Thin Bismuthene for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction to Liquid Fuel</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to valuable fuels is appealing for CO2 fixation and energy storage. However, the development of electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity in a wide potential window is challenging. Herein, atomically thin bismuthene (Bi&#8208;ene) is pioneeringly obtained via an  in situ  electrochemical transformation process from ultrathin bismuth&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic layers. The few&#8208;layer Bi&#8208;ene, which possesses a great mass of exposed active sites with high intrinsic activity, simultaneously exhibit considerable high selectivity (~100%), large partial current density and pretty good stability in a record wide potential window exceeding 0.35 V toward formate production. Furthermore, it even can deliver extraordinary current densities exceed 300.0 mA cm&#8208;2 without compromising selectivity in a flow cell reactor. Furthermore, by virtue of  in situ  ATR&#8208;IR spectra and DFT analysis, a new HCO3&#8208; participated reaction mechanism for formate generation was firstly unveiled, which brings new fundamental understanding of CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic Dehydrogenative Cyclization of o&#8208;Teraryls under pH&#8208;Neutral and Oxidant&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>Here we disclose a cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative cyclization of  o  &#8208;teraryls. In stark contrast to the established methods such as the Scholl or Mallory reactions, this protocol does not require any strong acids or oxidants, showing high atom economy and a broad substrate scope. It operates at near room temperature with light as the source of energy. Acid or oxidant&#8208;sensitive functional groups, such as 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl, unprotected benzyl alcohol, silyl ether and thiophene, are tolerated. Remarkably, aryls with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and electron&#8208;poor heteroarenes, such as pyridine and pyrimidine, can also react. Preliminary mechanistic study reveals that hydrogen gas is released during the reaction, and both light and the cobalt catalyst are important for the dehydrogenation step.</dc:description>

      <title>Production of Hydrogen Peroxide by Photocatalytic Processes</title>
      <dc:description>
Peroxide from sunlight: The production of H2O2 by photocatalysis is a sustainable process, since it uses water and oxygen as the source materials and solar light as the energy. Encouraging processes have been developed in the last decade for the photocatalytic production of H2O2, and these are discussed in this Review.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has received increasing attention because it is not only a mild and environmentally friendly oxidant for organic synthesis and environmental remediation but also a promising new liquid fuel. The production of H2O2 by photocatalysis is a sustainable process, since it uses water and oxygen as the source materials and solar light as the energy. Encouraging processes have been developed in the last decade for the photocatalytic production of H2O2. In this Review we summarize research progress in the development of processes for the photocatalytic production of H2O2. After a brief introduction emphasizing the superiorities of the photocatalytic generation of H2O2, the basic principles of establishing an efficient photocatalytic system for generating H2O2 are discussed, highlighting the advanced photocatalysts used. This Review is concluded by a brief summary and outlook for future advances in this emerging research field.

      <title>Unusual Through&#8208;Space Interactions between Oxygen Atoms that Mediate Inverse Morphochromism of an AIE Luminogen</title>
      <dc:description>
Close O&#8722;O contacts make me redder: The tetrafurylethene AIE luminogen has a strong red morphochromism going from the aggregate to the crystalline phase (27&#8197;nm). This is due to unusually short O&#8722;O contacts that are facilitated by circularly delocalized &#960; electron density between the furan rings.







Abstract
We have studied the photophysics of tetrafurylethene, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen with exceptionally short intramolecular O&#8722;O distances of 2.80&#8197;&#197; and a significant red&#8208;shifted morphochromism (27&#8197;nm) when going from the aggregate to the crystal. The short O&#8722;O distances, which are substantially smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04&#8197;&#197;), are due to the fact that the oxygen atoms act as an electronic bridge connecting the furan rings on opposite ends of the central double bond, giving rise to a circular delocalization of the &#960;&#8208;electron density across the rings. In the excited state the O&#8722;O distance is further reduced to 2.70&#8197;&#197;; the increased O&#8722;O interaction causes a narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, resulting in the red morphochromism of the emission. Our results show the structural origin of the red&#8208;shifted emission lies in close O&#8722;O contacts, paving the way for understanding the clusteroluminescence of oxygen&#8208;rich non&#8208;conjugated systems that emit visible light.

The short O&#8722;O distances, which are substantially smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04&#8197;&#197;), are due to the fact that the oxygen atoms act as an electronic bridge connecting the furan rings on opposite ends of the central double bond, giving rise to a circular delocalization of the &#960;&#8208;electron density across the rings. In the excited state the O&#8722;O distance is further reduced to 2.70&#8197;&#197;; the increased O&#8722;O interaction causes a narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, resulting in the red morphochromism of the emission. Our results show the structural origin of the red&#8208;shifted emission lies in close O&#8722;O contacts, paving the way for understanding the clusteroluminescence of oxygen&#8208;rich non&#8208;conjugated systems that emit visible light.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unraveling Dual Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Behavior in Steric&#8208;Hindrance Photochromic System for Super Resolution Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual AIE behavior: The steric&#8208;hindrance photochromic system efficiently regulates the intramolecular rotational/vibrational magnitude and intermolecular stacking to tune aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) activity. The off&#8208;to&#8208;on fluorescent photoswitch is successfully established in super resolution imaging.







Abstract
Unprecedented dual aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior based on a steric&#8208;hindrance photochromic system is presented, with incorporation one or two bulky aryl groups, resulting in different flexibleness. The dual AIE behavior of open and closed isomers can be explained by restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR), restriction of intramolecular vibration (RIV), and intermolecular stacking. The large bulky benzothiophene causes restricted rotation, enhancing the emission of open form in solution and weak &#960;&#8211;&#960; molecular packing, thereby efficiently enhancing the luminescence performance in the solid state. With incorporation of two large bulky benzothiophene groups, BBTE possesses the most outstanding AIE activity, undergoing highly efficient and reversible off&#8208;to&#8208;on fluorescence in film upon alternating UV and visible light irradiation along with excellent fatigue resistance. The off&#8208;to&#8208;on fluorescent photoswitch is successfully established in super resolution imaging.

      <title>Oppositely Charged Ti3C2Tx MXene Membranes with 2D Nanofluidic Channels for Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
      <dc:description>
Into the blue: Osmotic energy, known as &#8220;blue energy&#8221;, is derived by capturing this salinity gradient energy between sea water and fresh water. Negatively and positively charged lamellar MXene membranes with confined 2D nanofluidic channels give high&#8208;efficient osmotic energy harvesting, with a high output power density of 4.6&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 by mixing artificial sea water (SW) and river water (RW), which is close to the commercialization benchmark (5&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2).







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based reverse electrodialysis (RED) is considered as the most promising technique to harvest osmotic energy. However, the traditional membranes are limited by high internal resistance and low efficiency, resulting in undesirable power densities. Herein, we report the combination of oppositely charged Ti3C2Tx MXene membranes (MXMs) with confined 2D nanofluidic channels as high&#8208;performance osmotic power generators. The negatively or positively charged 2D MXene nanochannels exhibit typical surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport and show excellent cation or anion selectivity. By mixing the artificial sea water (0.5&#8201;m NaCl) and river water (0.01&#8201;m NaCl), we obtain a maximum power density of ca. 4.6&#8197;Wm&#8722;2, higher than most of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generators, and very close to the commercialization benchmark (5&#8197;Wm&#8722;2). Through connecting ten tandem MXM&#8208;RED stacks, the output voltage can reach up 1.66&#8197;V, which can directly power the electronic devices.

      <title>Diverse Nanoassemblies of Graphene Quantum Dots and Their Mineralogical Counterparts</title>
      <dc:description>
Complex structures from nanoparticles are found in rocks, soils, and sea sediments but the mechanisms of their formation are poorly understood. It is shown that graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can assemble into complex structures driven by coordination interactions with metal ions commonly present in the environment and play a special role in Earth's history, such as Fe3+ and Al3+.







Abstract
Complex structures from nanoparticles are found in rocks, soils, and sea sediments but the mechanisms of their formation are poorly understood, which causes controversial conclusions about their genesis. Here we show that graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can assemble into complex structures driven by coordination interactions with metal ions commonly present in environment and serve a special role in Earth's history, such as Fe3+ and Al3+. GQDs self&#8208;assemble into mesoscale chains, sheets, supraparticles, nanoshells, and nanostars. Specific assembly patterns are determined by the effective symmetry of the GQDs when forming the coordination assemblies with the metal ions. As such, maximization of the electronic delocalization of &#960;&#8208;orbitals of GQDs with Fe3+ leads to GQD&#8208;Fe&#8208;GQD units with D2 symmetry, dipolar bonding potential, and linear assemblies. Taking advantage of high electron microscopy contrast of carbonaceous nanostructures in respect to ceramic background, the mineralogical counterparts of GQD assemblies are found in mineraloid shungite. These findings provide insight into nanoparticle dynamics during the rock formation that can lead to mineralized structures of unexpectedly high complexity.

      <title>High&#8208;Curvature Transition&#8208;Metal Chalcogenide Nanostructures with a Pronounced Proximity Effect Enable Fast and Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
The needle has landed: CdS nanostructures with sharp tips can generate large electric fields that lead to increased CO2 concentrations for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The localized electric fields are significantly enhanced when two nanoneedles are in close proximity. These advantages result in CO2 electrocatalytic reduction with a 95.5&#177;4.0&#8201;% CO Faraday efficiency.







Abstract
A considerable challenge in the conversion of carbon dioxide into useful fuels comes from the activation of CO2 to CO2.&#8722; or other intermediates, which often requires precious&#8208;metal catalysts, high overpotentials, and/or electrolyte additives (e.g., ionic liquids). We report a microwave heating strategy for synthesizing a transition&#8208;metal chalcogenide nanostructure that efficiently catalyzes CO2 electroreduction to carbon monoxide (CO). We found that the cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoneedle arrays exhibit an unprecedented current density of 212&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 95.5&#177;4.0&#8201;% CO Faraday efficiency at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE; without iR correction). Experimental and computational studies show that the high&#8208;curvature CdS nanostructured catalyst has a pronounced proximity effect which gives rise to large electric field enhancement, which can concentrate alkali&#8208;metal cations resulting in the enhanced CO2 electroreduction efficiency.

The main&#8208;group age: The past decade has revealed main&#8208;group&#8208;element compounds that display transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity in stoichiometric and even catalytic transformations. Cornella and co&#8208;workers have now reported a bismuth complex that catalyzes fluoroarene formation from aryl boronate esters, a reaction that is almost unprecedented in transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

      <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling in Organic Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Taking the shortcut: Examples of tunneling by second&#8208;row atoms are increasing and the limits are being expanded. This Minireview summarizes recent examples of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling, highlights unique approaches for its detection, and describes computational efforts toward its prediction. Common features of these reactions and future challenges are discussed.







Abstract
In the past few years, numerous investigations have been reported on the role of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling in the area of pericyclic reactions, &#960;&#8208;bond&#8208;shifting, and other processes. These studies illustrate unique strategies for the experimental detection of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling and the increased use of calculations to predict it. This Minireview focuses primarily on carbon tunneling in ground&#8208;state processes but also highlights nitrogen tunneling and the first example of excited&#8208;state heavy&#8208;atom tunneling. Salient features of these reactions along with potential limitations are discussed, as well as challenges and directions for future investigation.

      <title>Free&#8208;Standing CoO&#8208;POM Janus&#8208;like Ultrathin Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Van der Waals integration of ultrathin Janus&#8208;like 2D heterostructures can also be achieved in a single step through a solution&#8208;based approach. The structural configuration can be simply changed by proper selection of solvents. Such a heteromaterial has tunable properties and can be used as an advanced oxidation catalyst.







Abstract
A single&#8208;step solution&#8208;based strategy is used to obtain 2D Janus&#8208;like free&#8208;standing ultrathin nanosheets build from two structurally unrelated species, that is, polyoxomolybdate (POM) and CoO. A controlled 2D&#8208;to&#8208;1D morphological transition was achieved by judiciously adjusting the solvent choice. These POM&#8208;CoO heterostructures can behave as an ideal catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene. Benefiting from their amphiphilic nature, these 2D POM&#8208;CoO nanosheets have also been used as surfactant to emulsify immiscible solvents. It is anticipated that structurally diverse polyoxometalates will offer promise as design elements for variety of structurally and compositionally tunable van der Waals integrated heteromaterials having a broad range applications.
