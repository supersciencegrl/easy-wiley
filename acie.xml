         <title>Metal&#8208;Corrole&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating molecular catalysts into designed frameworks often enables improved catalysis. Compared with porphyrin&#8208;based frameworks, metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based frameworks have been rarely developed, although monomeric metal corroles are usually more efficient than porphyrin counterparts for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report on metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) as ORR and OER electrocatalysts.&#160;M&#8208;POPs&#160;(M = Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) were synthesized by coupling metal 10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;(4&#8208;iodophenyl)corrole with tetrakis(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)methane. Compared with metal corrole monomers,&#160;M&#8208;POPs&#160;displayed significantly enhanced&#160;catalytic activity and stability.&#160;Co&#8208;POP&#160;outperformed other&#160;M&#8208;POPs&#160;by achieving four&#8208;electron ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87 V vs RHE and reaching&#160;10 mA/cm2&#160;OER current density at 340 mV overpotential. This work is unparalleled to develop and explore metal&#8208;corrole&#8208;based POPs as electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Degradation of Polyethylene Terephthalate Using a Phase&#8208;Transitional Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is utilized as one of the most popular consumer plastics worldwide, but difficulties associated with recycling PET have generated a severe environmental crisis with most PET ending its lifecycle in landfills. We report that zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) UiO&#8208;66 deconstructs waste PET into the building blocks terephthalic acid (TA) and mono&#8208;methyl terephthalate (MMT) within 24 hours at 260 &#176;C (total yield of 98% under 1 atm H  2  and 81% under 1 atm Ar). Extensive structural characterization studies reveal that during the degradation process, UiO&#8208;66 undergoes an intriguing transformation into MIL&#8208;140A, which is another Zr&#8208;MOF that shows good catalytic activity toward PET degradation under similar reaction conditions. These results illustrate the diversity of applications for Zr&#8208;MOFs and establish MOFs as a new class of polymer degradation catalysts with the potential to address long&#8208;standing challenges associated with plastic waste.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hierarchical (Macro)molecular Assembly Assisted by Donor&#8208;Acceptor Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions Exhibiting Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This communication reveals co&#8208;assembly of an electron&#8208;deficient naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI)&#8208;appended polyurethane (P1) and electron&#8208;rich pyrene (Py), forming an organogel with prominent room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity. In a non&#8208;polar medium, intra&#8208;chain hydrogen&#8208;bonding among the urethane groups of P1 produces a folded structure with an array of the NDIs in the periphery, which intercalate Py by charge&#8208;transfer (CT)&#8208;interaction. Such CT&#8208;complexation enables slow crystallization of the peripheral hydrocarbons, causing gelation with nanotubular morphology, in which the wall consists of the alternating NDI&#8208;Py stack. Such D&#8208;A assembly exhibits ferroelectricity (saturation polarization  P  s  ~ 0.8 &#181;C/cm  2  and coercive field  E  c  ~ 8 kV/cm at 500V and 10Hz frequency) with Curie temperature (  T  c  ) of ~ 350 K, which can be related to the disassembly of the CT&#8208;complex. In the absence of Py, P1 forms spherical aggregates, showing dielectric behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Blue Afterglow through Molecular Fusion for Bio&#8208;applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Afterglow materials have drawn considerable attention due to their attractive luminescent properties. However, the low&#8208;efficient luminescence in aqueous environment limits their applications in life sciences. Here, we developed a molecular fusion strategy to improve the afterglow efficiency in the photochemical afterglow materials. By fusing a cache unit with an emitter, we obtained a blue afterglow system with a quantum yield up to 2.59%. It was 162 times higher than the traditional physical mixing system and more than an order of magnitude larger than the covalent coupling system. High&#8208;efficient afterglow nanoparticles were obtained and utilized for bio&#8208;imaging with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of 131, and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) of &#946;&#8208;hCG with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.34 mIU/mL. This paves a new way for high&#8208;efficiency afterglow materials construction and expands the luminescence reporter candidates for disease diagnosis and bio&#8208;imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Based Plasmonic Nanodevice for Cascade Signal Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the creation of self&#8208;assembled nanodevices with specific biological functions, one of the fundamental challenges is amplifying initial, faint signals that cannot be detected or transmitted directly. Herein, we describe a DNA circuit&#8208;aided, dynamic DNA origami plasmonic nanodevice that converts trace stimuli signals to detectable NIR CD responses.







Abstract
Here, we describe a DNA circuit&#8208;aided, origami nanodevice&#8208;based plasmonic system, which performs DNA&#8208;regulated, cascade amplification of faint chemical/biological signals. In this system, two gold&#8208;nanorods (GNRs) are co&#8208;assembled onto a DNA lock&#8208;containing, tweezer&#8208;like DNA origami template. Logic circuits serve as recognition and amplification elements for specific messengers, producing DNA keys for driving conformational changes of the plasmonic nanodevices. In the presence of input signals including nucleic acids, adenosines, chiral tyrosinamides or specific receptors expressed by tumor cells, the plasmonic nanodevices can be activated to perform dynamic structural motions, reporting robust responses via plasmonic circular dichroism (CD) spectral changes. This DNA nanodevice&#8208;based system provides a different design to enrich the strategies for constructing synthetic nanomachines, enabling the customized bottom&#8208;up nanostructure construction for sensitive biological signaling.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Controlled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Allylation of Unactivated Electron&#8208;Deficient Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed benzylic allylation and benzylation of 14 types of unactivated heterocyclic aromatic compounds is described. The selective deprotonation of benzylic sites is hypothesized to be controlled by the original coordination of a heterocyclic nitrogen to Zn(TMP)2. In addition to the pro&#8208;nucleophiles, readily available bromide and chloride electrophiles could be used.







Abstract
Heterocycles are widespread in pharmaceuticals but methods for their transition metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization remain limited. This report describes a general, mild, and effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed benzylic allylation and benzylation of 14 types of heterocyclic aromatic compounds, including pyridines, pyrazines, pyrimidines, pyridazines, triazines, benzimidazoles, oxazoles, thiazoles, as well as 3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;indoles. The exquisite selectivity for benzylic sites at the 2&#8208;position is hypothesized to be controlled by coordination of a heterocyclic nitrogen to Zn(TMP)2 subverting generally presumed pKa&#8217;s of benzylic protons. Furthermore, the broad range of heterocyclic substrates, the diversity of electrophiles, and excellent functional group compatibility suggest its future application to synthesis of complex molecules and library diversification in drug discovery.

&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed benzylic allylation and benzylation of 14 types of unactivated heterocyclic aromatic compounds is described. The selective deprotonation of benzylic sites is hypothesized to be controlled by the original coordination of a heterocyclic nitrogen to Zn(TMP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition to the pro-nucleophiles, readily available bromide and chloride electrophiles could be used.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed (4+1) Cycloaddition between Benzocyclobutenones and Styrene&#8208;Type Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual (4+1), instead of a normal (4+2), cycloaddition has been developed between benzocyclobutenones and styrene&#8208;type alkenes via the Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C activation, which provides a distinct one&#8208;carbon ring expansion approach to access multi&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;indanones.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a unique one&#8208;carbon ring&#8208;expansion strategy to access multi&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;indanones from benzocyclobutenones and styrene&#8208;type olefins. The use of a cationic &#8220;ligandless&#8221; rhodium catalyst was the key for both high reactivity and selectivity towards the (4+1) product. Broad functional group tolerance, a good substrate scope, and scalability have been demonstrated. Computation studies reveal that the origin of the (4+1) selectivity is due to a facile &#946;&#8208;H elimination pathway that reduces the overall barrier of the turnover&#8208;limiting C&#8722;C reductive elimination step.

         <title>Photoaffinity Capture Compounds to Profile the Magic Spot Nucleotide Interactomes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular fishing: A family of trifunctional photoaffinity capture compounds enables the identification of putative Magic Spot Nucleotide receptors by a chemoproteomics approach. The resulting datasets cover several bacterial species, correlate with distinct nucleotide phosphorylation patterns and represent high&#8208;value starting points for future investigations into the complex stringent response mechanism.







Abstract
Magic Spot Nucleotides (MSN) regulate the stringent response, a highly conserved bacterial stress adaptation mechanism, enabling survival under adverse external challenges. In times of antibiotic crisis, a detailed understanding of stringent response is essential, as potentially new targets for pharmacological intervention could be identified. In this study, we delineate the MSN interactome in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium applying a family of trifunctional photoaffinity capture compounds. We introduce MSN probes covering a diverse phosphorylation pattern, such as pppGpp, ppGpp, and pGpp. Our chemical proteomics approach provides datasets of putative MSN receptors both from cytosolic and membrane fractions that unveil new MSN targets. We find that the activity of the non&#8208;Nudix hydrolase ApaH is potently inhibited by pppGpp, which itself is converted to pGpp by ApaH. The capture compounds described herein will be useful to identify MSN interactomes across bacterial species.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Macrocycles through Asymmetric Electrophilic Aromatic Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles has been developed through enantioselective electrophilic aromatic aminations with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A wide array of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles bearing ansa chains with varied length (12&#8208;member to 19&#8208;member) and various functional groups were generated using this method with high to excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
An efficient approach for asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles (paracyclophanes) has been disclosed through enantioselective electrophilic aromatic aminations with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A wide range of chiral macrocycles bearing varied ring sizes (16 to 23&#8208;membered) and functional group&#8208;containing ansa chains were readily afforded using this method, with excellent yields and high enantioselectivities (23 examples, up to 99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er). Experimental studies and DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism and origin of stereoselectivities of these reactions. Preliminary utilization of the planar&#8208;chiral macrocycle as chiral organocatalyst showcased the potential applications of these novel chiral skeletons.

         <title>Glutathione Depletion&#8208;Induced Activation of Dimersomes for Potentiating the Ferroptosis and Immunotherapy of &#8220;Cold&#8221; Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vesicles based on cinnamaldehyde dimers (CDC dimersomes) were prepared to enhance the ferroptosis and immunotherapy of &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. The dimersomes depleted intracellular glutathione (GSH) by in&#8197;situ Michael addition and underwent breakage during GSH depletion, which promoted the release of the drug contained inside the vesicle and switching &#8220;ON&#8221; of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes.







Abstract
The abundant glutathione (GSH) in &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors weakens ferroptosis therapy and the immune response. Inspired by lipids, we fabricated cinnamaldehyde dimers (CDC) into lipid&#8208;like materials to form dimersomes capable of depleting GSH and delivering therapeutics to potentiate the ferroptosis and immunotherapy of breast cancer. The dimersomes exhibited superior storage stability for over one year. After reaching the tumor, they quickly underwent breakage in the cytosol owing to the conjugation of hydrophilic GSH on CDC by Michael addition, which not only triggered the drug release and fluorescence switch &#8220;ON&#8221;, but also led to the depletion of intracellular GSH. Ferroptosis was significantly enhanced after combination with sorafenib (SRF) and elicited a robust immune response in&#8197;vivo by promoting the maturation of dendritic cells and the priming of CD8+ T cells. As a result, the CDC@SRF dimersomes cured breast cancer in all the mice after four doses of administration.

         <title>A Hybrid Halide Perovskite Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MLAPbBr4 (MLA=melamine) features a layered perovskite structure consisting of highly distorted PbBr6 octahedra and planar MLA+ cations. As a result, it exhibits large birefringence up to 0.322@550&#8197;nm. This birefringence makes MLAPbBr4 capable of easily dividing incident light into two polarized rays (e&#8208;ray and o&#8208;ray).







Abstract
Birefringent crystals that can modulate the polarization of light play a significant role in modern optical devices including polarizing microscopes, optical isolators, and achromatic quarter&#8208;wave plates. To date, commercial birefringent crystals are exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds. Here we report a new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide, MLAPbBr4 (MLA=melamine), which features a (110)&#8208;oriented layered perovskite structure. Although the 6s2 lone&#8208;pair electrons of Pb2+ cations are stereochemically inert, MLAPbBr4 exhibits a birefringence of 0.322@550&#8197;nm, which exceeds those of all commercial birefringent crystals. The first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that this birefringence should be ascribed to the highly dislocated &#960;&#8208;conjugation of MLA cations and high distortion of PbBr6 octahedra. This work highlights the persistently neglected great potential of hybrid halide perovskites as birefringent crystals.

&lt;p&gt;MLAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (MLA=melamine) features a layered perovskite structure consisting of highly distorted PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra and planar MLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations. As a result, it exhibits large birefringence up to 0.322@550&#8197;nm. This birefringence makes MLAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; capable of easily dividing incident light into two polarized rays (e-ray and o-ray).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birefringent crystals that can modulate the polarization of light play a significant role in modern optical devices including polarizing microscopes, optical isolators, and achromatic quarter-wave plates. To date, commercial birefringent crystals are exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds. Here we report a new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide, MLAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (MLA=melamine), which features a (110)-oriented layered perovskite structure. Although the 6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lone-pair electrons of Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations are stereochemically inert, MLAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a birefringence of 0.322@550&#8197;nm, which exceeds those of all commercial birefringent crystals. The first-principles calculations reveal that this birefringence should be ascribed to the highly dislocated &#960;-conjugation of MLA cations and high distortion of PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra. This work highlights the persistently neglected great potential of hybrid halide perovskites as birefringent crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibition of Alkali Metal Reduction of 1&#8208;Adamantanol by London Dispersion Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
London dispersion (LD) effects limit the reduction of 1&#8208;adamantanol, despite the use of excess alkali metals Li, Na and K. An unusual sodium complex featuring the adamantoxide and two datively&#8208;coordinated 1&#8208;adamantanol molecules was isolated. This structure showed that the adamantyl moieties cluster together on one&#8208;side of the NaO3 plane, and featured many intramolecular close contacts, as a result of the LD&#8208;effects present.







Abstract
A series of alkali metal 1&#8208;adamantoxide (OAd1) complexes of formula [M(OAd1)(HOAd1)2], where M=Li, Na or K, were synthesised by reduction of 1&#8208;adamantanol with excess of the alkali metal. The syntheses indicated that only one out of every three HOAd1 molecules was reduced. An X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the sodium derivative shows that the complex features two unreduced HOAd1 donors as well as the reduced alkoxide (OAd1), with the Ad1 fragments clustered together on the same side of the NaO3 plane, contrary to steric considerations. This is the first example of an alkali metal reduction of an alcohol that is inhibited from completion due to the formation of the [M(OAd1)(HOAd1)2] complexes, stabilized by London dispersion effects. NMR spectroscopic studies revealed similar structures for the lithium and potassium derivatives. Computational analyses indicate that decisive London dispersion effects in the molecular structure are a consequence of the many C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interactions between the OAd1 groups.

A genetically encoded N2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;lysine (CATK) permits a spontaneous, quantitative, site&#8208;specific inter&#8208;strand crosslinking with a proximal Tyr in a small antibody&#8208;mimetic protein, generating a novel protein topology accompanied by improved cellular uptake and enhanced proteolytic resistance.







Abstract
Here we report the design of N2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;lysines (CATKs) and their site&#8208;specific incorporation into proteins via genetic code expansion. When introduced into the protein dimer interface, CATKs permitted spontaneous, proximity&#8208;driven, site&#8208;selective crosslinking to generate covalent protein dimers in living cells, with phenyl&#8208;bearing CATK&#8208;1 exhibiting high reactivity toward the proximal Lys and Tyr. Furthermore, when introduced into the N&#8208;terminal &#946;&#8208;strand of either a single&#8208;chain VHH antibody or a supercharged monobody, CATK&#8208;1 enabled site&#8208;specific, inter&#8208;strand, orthogonal crosslinking with a proximal Tyr located on the opposing &#946;&#8208;strand. Compared with a non&#8208;crosslinked monobody, the orthogonally crosslinked monobody displayed improved cellular uptake and enhanced proteolytic stability against an endosomal enzyme. The robust crosslinking reactivity of CATKs should facilitate the design of novel protein topologies with improved physicochemical properties.

         <title>Steric Modulation of Spiro Structure for Highly Efficient Multiple Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating a three&#8208;dimensional spiro unit into multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters, the device efficiency is increased to nearly 1.5&#8197;times that of the unhindered emitter. Notably, the linkage pattern with spatial interaction and hindrance can maintain the narrow FWHM and curb unfavorable redshifts at a high doping ratio.







Abstract
A multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecule with a fused, planar architecture tends to aggregate at high doping ratios, resulting in broad full width at half maximum (FWHM), redshifting electroluminescence peaks, and low device efficiency. Herein, we propose a mono&#8208;substituted design strategy by introducing spiro&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;bifluorene (SBF) units with different substituted sites into the MR&#8208;TADF system for the first time. As a classic steric group, SBF can hinder interchromophore interactions, leading to high device efficiency (32.2&#8211;35.9&#8201;%) and narrow&#8208;band emission (&#8776;27&#8197;nm). Particularly, the shield&#8208;like molecule, SF1BN, seldom exhibits a broadened FWHM as the doping ratio rises, which differs from the C3&#8208;substituted isomer and unhindered parent emitter. These results manifest an effective method for constructing highly efficient MR&#8208;TADF emitters through a spiro strategy and elucidate the feasibility for steric modulation of the spiro structure in &#960;&#8208;framework.

         <title>Investigation of Carboxylic Acid Isosteres and Prodrugs for Inhibition of the Human SIRT5 Lysine Deacylase Enzyme**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A SAR study of mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors of the sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) hydrolase, containing isosteres of an essential carboxylic acid moiety, furnished heterocycles with excellent potency and slow, tight&#8208;binding kinetics against the enzyme. Evaluation of selected compounds in cells revealed that transient masking of the heterocycle provided improved inhibitors with a high level of target engagement in cultured cells.







Abstract
Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) is a protein lysine deacylase enzyme that regulates diverse biology by hydrolyzing &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyacyllysine posttranslational modifications in the cell. Inhibition of SIRT5 has been linked to potential treatment of several cancers but potent compounds with activity in cells have been lacking. Here we developed mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors that incorporate isosteres of a carboxylic acid residue that is important for high&#8208;affinity binding to the enzyme active site. By masking of the tetrazole moiety of the most potent candidate from our initial SAR study, we achieved potent and cytoselective growth inhibition for the treatment of SIRT5&#8208;dependent leukemic cancer cell lines in culture. Thus, we provide an efficient, cellularly active small molecule that targets SIRT5, which can help elucidate its function and potential as a future drug target. This work shows that masked isosteres of carboxylic acids are viable chemical motifs for the development of inhibitors that target mitochondrial enzymes, which may have applications beyond the sirtuin field.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;(carbone) Pincer Ligand and Its Coordinative Behavior toward Multi&#8208;Metallic Configurations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable bis&#8208;(carbone) pincer ligand was prepared and its structural characterization reported. With a total of five electron pairs available, this new pincer framework was studied for its coordinative behavior, enabling the formation of trinuclear heterometallic complexes.







Abstract
Carbones are divalent carbon(0) species that contain two lone pairs of electrons. Herein, we have prepared the first known stable and isolable free bis&#8208;(carbone) pincer framework with a well&#8208;defined solid&#8208;state structure. This bis&#8208;(carbone) ligand is an effective scaffold for forming monometallic (Ni and Pd) and trinuclear heterometallic complexes with Au&#8722;Pd&#8722;Au, Au&#8722;Ni&#8722;Au, and Cu&#8722;Ni&#8722;Cu configurations. Sophisticated quantum&#8208;theoretical analyses found that the metal&#8211;metal interactions are too weak to play a significant role in upholding these multi&#8208;metallic configurations; rather, the four lone pairs of electrons within the bis&#8208;(carbone) framework are the main contributors to the stability of the complexes.

         <title>Sustainable Thioetherification via Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Photoactivation Using Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex thioetherification was developed using simple organic compounds (thianthrenium salts and thiols) and visible&#8208;light irradiation under open&#8208;to&#8208;air conditions. This protocol allows the retention of the C&#8722;X bond, as well as the late&#8208;stage thioetherification of biomolecules.







Abstract
The synthesis of sulfides has been widely studied because this functional subunit is prevalent in biomolecules and pharmaceuticals, as well as being a useful synthetic platform for further elaboration. Thus, various methods to build C&#8722;S bonds have been developed, but typically they require the use of precious metals or harsh conditions. Electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex photoactivation strategies have emerged as versatile and sustainable ways to achieve C&#8722;S bond formation, avoiding challenges associated with previous methods. This work describes an open&#8208;to&#8208;air, photoinduced, site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H thioetherification from readily available reagents via EDA complex formation that tolerates a wide range of different functional groups. Moreover, C(sp2)&#8722;halogen bonds remain intact using this protocol, allowing late&#8208;stage installation of the sulfide motif in various bioactive scaffolds, while allowing yet further modification through more traditional C&#8722;X bond cleavage protocols. Additionally, various mechanistic investigations support the envisioned EDA complex scenario.

         <title>Strong Circularly&#8208;polarized Room&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence from a Feasibly Separable Scaffold of Bidibenzo[b,d]furan with Locked Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel accessible scaffold featuring circularly&#8208;polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is attractive but challenging. Herein, we reported a new feasibly separable bidibenzo[  b  ,  d  ]furan compound with strong circularly&#8208;polarized RTP when doping into the rigid polymer matrix. The simple silica&#8208;gel column can separate the absolute chiral R&#8208;isomer with excellent chiroptical properties. The experimental data reveal that the treated films exhibit an RTP efficiency of 14.8%, the largest dissymmetric factor of 0.12, the longest lifetime of 0.56 s under ambient conditions. It is found that reducing the nonradiative decays boosts the intrinsic circularly&#8208;polarized RTP emission. The impressive results indicate that the locked axial chirality skeleton endows the potential of achieving superior circularly&#8208;polarized emission for the small organic optoelectronic molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Myrioneuron alkaloid (&#177;)&#8208;myrioneurinol was synthesized in 14 steps from a readily available compound. The synthesis features efficient sequential [2+2] cycloaddition/retro&#8208;Mannich fragmentation/Mannich reaction to assemble the tricyclic core of myrioneurinol.







Abstract
A concise total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;myrioneurinol has been achieved in 14 steps. An efficient AgSbF6/t&#8208;BuCl&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the alkynone&#8208;tethered enamine was developed to prepare the highly strained cyclobutene. It was used in combination with a subsequent retro&#8208;Mannich fragmentation/Mannich reaction to efficiently construct the tricyclic core of myrioneurinol.

         <dc:description>Constructing well&#8208;designed catalysts to accelerate OER catalytic activity and alleviate the charge overpotential is prevailing for achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O  2  batteries. Herein, we report a concept on engineering the e  g  occupancy of Pt with M alloying (M=Au, Ru) to tune the charge overpotentials for achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O  2  batteries. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy results coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the highly electronegative Au can capture more e  g  electrons from Pt, leading to less e  g  electrons of Pt in PtAu than that in PtRu. The lower e  g  occupancy of Pt atoms in PtAu alloys entails the upward shift of Pt  d  band, which causes a strong binding strength towards the intermediates (LiO  2  ), thereby decreasing the OER energy barrier. As a consequence, the Li&#8208;O  2  battery with PtAu cathode delivers a low charge overpotential of 0.36 V and superior cycle life of 220 cycles at a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g  &#8208;1  , which is among the best in the reported noble metal&#8208;based cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrically Switchable Polymer Brushes for Protein Capture and Release in Biological Environments**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
pH&#8208;responsive polymer brushes are presented that are compatible with electrochemical control. The brushes can be reversibly switched between protein binding and repelling states at fully physiological conditions with respect to salt, pH and buffering capacity. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle experiments are shown for applications such as non&#8208;fouling, patterning and controlled release of proteins in biological environments.







Abstract
Interfaces functionalized with polymers are known for providing excellent resistance towards biomolecular adsorption and for their ability to bind high amounts of protein while preserving their structure. However, making an interface that switches between these two states has proven challenging and concepts to date rely on changes in the physiochemical environment, which is static in biological systems. Here we present the first interface that can be electrically switched between a high&#8208;capacity (&gt;1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2) multilayer protein binding state and a completely non&#8208;fouling state (no detectable adsorption). Switching is possible over multiple cycles without any regeneration. Importantly, switching works even when the interface is in direct contact with biological fluids and a buffered environment. The technology offers many applications such as zero fouling on demand, patterning or separation of proteins as well as controlled release of biologics in a physiological environment, showing high potential for future drug delivery in vivo.

Switching is possible over multiple cycles without any regeneration. Importantly, switching works even when the interface is in direct contact with biological fluids and a buffered environment. The technology offers many applications such as zero fouling on demand, patterning or separation of proteins as well as controlled release of biologics in a physiological environment, showing high potential for future drug delivery in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revisiting the Bonding Model for Gold(I) Species: The Importance of Pauli Repulsion Revealed in a Gold(I)&#8208;Cyclobutadiene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel AuI&#8208;cyclobutadiene complex for which reduced Pauli repulsion yields an &#951;1 instead of &#951;4&#8208;coordination is presented. This combined experimental and theoretical study motivates a reformulation of the gold(I)&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ligand bonding model to include Pauli repulsion as a key element. Further analysis of gold(I)&#8208;alkynes corroborates this conclusion.







Abstract
Understanding the bonding of gold(I) species has been central to the development of gold(I) catalysis. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of the first gold(I)&#8208;cyclobutadiene complex, accompanied with bonding analysis by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy decomposition analysis methods. Analysis of possible coordination modes for the new species not only confirms established characteristics of gold(I) bonding, but also suggests that Pauli repulsion is a key yet hitherto overlooked element. Additionally, we obtain a new perspective on gold(I)&#8208;bonding by comparison of the gold(I)&#8208;cyclobutadiene to congeners stabilized by p&#8208;, d&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals. Consequently, we refine the gold(I) bonding model, with a delicate interplay of Pauli repulsion and charge transfer as the key driving force for various coordination motifs. Pauli repulsion is similarly determined as a significant interaction in AuI&#8208;alkyne species, corroborating this revised understanding of AuI bonding.

         <title>In Vitro Biosynthesis of the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor Verifies the Proposed Biosynthetic Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FeGP cofactor is the prosthetic group of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. The in vitro biosynthesis of this cofactor from synthesized precursors using the cell extract of a mutated strain of Methanococcus maripaludis provided evidence for the biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor from 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinols, an organic CO donor, and/or CO and other substances. This method paves the way to analyze the biosynthetic machinery of this H2&#8208;activation cofactor.







Abstract
In the FeGP cofactor of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, low&#8208;spin FeII is in complex with two CO ligands and a pyridinol derivative; the latter ligates the iron with a 6&#8208;acylmethyl substituent and the pyridinol nitrogen. A guanylylpyridinol derivative, 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;guanylyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol (3), is produced by the decomposition of the FeGP cofactor under irradiation with UV&#8208;A/blue light and is also postulated to be a precursor of FeGP cofactor biosynthesis. HcgC and HcgB catalyze consecutive biosynthesis steps leading to 3. Here, we report an in vitro biosynthesis assay of the FeGP cofactor using the cell extract of the &#916;hcgB&#916;hcgC strain of Methanococcus maripaludis, which does not biosynthesize 3. We chemically synthesized pyridinol precursors 1 and 2, and detected the production of the FeGP cofactor from 1, 2 and 3. These results indicated that 1, 2 and 3 are the precursors of the FeGP cofactor, and the carboxy group of 3 is converted to the acyl ligand.

         <title>Nature of the Active Sites of Copper Zinc Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect between Cu and Zn enabling optimal adsorption of CO is reported. Through high throughput screening for optimal CO adsorption, two types of active sites were identified that effectively facilitated the C&#8722;C coupling, thus boosting the electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ products.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2ER) to multi&#8208;carbon chemical feedstocks over Cu&#8208;based catalysts is of considerable attraction but suffers with the ambiguous nature of active sites, which hinder the rational design of catalysts and large&#8208;scale industrialization. This paper describes a large&#8208;scale simulation to obtain realistic CuZn nanoparticle models and the atom&#8208;level structure of active sites for C2+ products on CuZn catalysts in CO2ER, combining neural network based global optimization and density functional theory calculations. Upon analyzing over 2000 surface sites through high throughput tests based on NN potential, two kinds of active sites are identified, balanced Cu&#8722;Zn sites and Zn&#8208;heavy Cu&#8722;Zn sites, both facilitating C&#8722;C coupling, which are verified by subsequent calculational and experimental investigations. This work provides a paradigm for the design of high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;based catalysts and may offer a general strategy to identify accurately the atomic structures of active sites in complex catalytic systems.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Silver&#8208;Catalyzed [3+3] Cycloaddition and Kinetic Resolution of Azomethine Imines with Activated Isocyanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective [3+3] cycloaddition of activated isocyanides with azomethine imines is reported for the first time. Under silver catalysis, a series of bicyclic 1,2,4&#8208;triazines were obtained in high yields with high stereoselectivities. The versatility of this system was further demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules and the kinetic resolution of racemic azomethine imines.







Abstract
In contrast to the well&#8208;established [3+2] cycloaddition reactions, the catalytic enantioselective [3+n] (n&#8805;3) cycloaddition reaction of activated isocyanides for the preparation of six&#8208;membered or larger ring systems has remained underdeveloped. Herein, we report the first example of highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective [3+3] cycloaddition of activated isocyanides with azomethine imines. By employing silver catalysis, a wide range of biologically important bicyclic 1,2,4&#8208;triazines were obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with good to excellent stereoselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, 99&#8201;% ee). In addition, the same catalytic system could be applied to both the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules and the kinetic resolution of racemic azomethine imines, further highlighting its versatility and synthetic utility.

         <title>White&#8208;Light Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence from a Chiral Copper(I) Coordination Polymer through Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of chiral CuI coordination polymers (1&#8208;P/M) were produced from achiral precursors by crystallization&#8208;driven symmetry&#8208;breaking assembly.

Abstract
Achieving white&#8208;light emission, especially white circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from a single&#8208;phase material is challenging. Herein, a pair of chiral CuI coordination polymers (1&#8208;M and 1&#8208;P) have been prepared by the asymmetrical assembly of achiral ligands and Cu2I2 clusters. The compounds display dual emission bands and can be used as single&#8208;phase white&#8208;light phosphors, achieving a &#8220;warm&#8221;&#8208;white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode with an ultra&#8208;high color rendering index (CRI) of 93.4 and an appropriate correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3632&#8197;K. Meanwhile, corresponding CPL signals with maximum dissymmetry factor |glum|=8&#215;10&#8722;3 have been observed. Hence, intrinsic white&#8208;light emission and CPL have been realized simultaneously in coordination polymers for the first time. This work gains insight into the nature of chiral assembly from achiral units and offers a prospect for the development of single&#8208;phase white&#8208;CPL materials.

         <title>Ultrafast Electrothermal Flow&#8208;Enhanced Magneto Biosensor for Highly Sensitive Protein Detection in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast magneto biosensor, which employs AC electrothermally driven flow (ACEF) for accelerated mass transport and enhanced immunocomplex formation, is developed for highly sensitive protein measurement in whole blood samples.







Abstract
Current diagnostic tests for sensitive protein detection rely on immunological techniques, such as ELISA, which require sample purification, multiple washing steps and lengthy incubation, hindering their use for rapid testing. Here, we report a simple electrothermal flow&#8208;enhanced biosensor for ultrafast, high sensitivity measurements of protein biomarkers in whole blood. Magnetic nanobeads dually&#8208;labeled with a detection antibody and enzyme reporter are used to form immunocomplexes with the target protein, which are readily transported to the sensor via magnetic concentration. The incorporation of electrothermal flows enhances immunocomplex formation, allowing for rapid and sensitive detection without requiring blood purification or lengthy incubation. Proof of concept was carried out using Plasmodium falciparum histidine&#8208;rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a malaria parasite biomarker, which could be detected at concentrations as low as 5.7&#8197;pg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 (95&#8197;fM) in whole blood in 7&#8197;min. The speed, sensitivity and simplicity of this device make it attractive for rapid diagnostic testing.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activatable Spherical Nucleic Acids for Conditional Control of Protein Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light activatable spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) were designed to achieve programmable optical control of protein activity. The SNAs remain inert and can be remotely activated by NIR irradiation to function as an enzyme inhibitor, while addition of antidote DNA could further reverse the regulation function.







Abstract
Optical control of protein activity represents a promising strategy for precise modulation of biological processes. We report rationally designed, aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) capable of noninvasive and programmable regulation of target protein activity by deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. The photoresponsive SNAs are constructed by integrating activatable aptamer modules onto the surface of upconversion nanoparticles. The SNAs remain inert but can be remotely reverted by NIR light irradiation to capture the target protein and thus function as an enzyme inhibitor, while introduction of antidote DNA could further reverse their inhibition functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of the SNAs as controllable anticoagulants for the NIR light&#8208;triggered regulation of thrombin function. Ultimately, the availability of diverse aptamers would allow the design to regulate the activities of various proteins in a programmable manner.

         <dc:description>
Treating a super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole with 2&#8197;equivalents of cis&#8208;protected [M(dppp)(OTf)2] as the metal corners (M=Pt, Pd; dppp=1,3&#8208;(bis&#8208;diphenylphosphino)propane) has led to the formation of a dinuclear metallobridged cavitand. Inclusion complexes of the metallocavitand are formed as single conformers and the dimensions of their open portals are dependent of the included guests.







Abstract
A super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole equipped with four oxazolo[4,5&#8208;b]pyrazinyl units at its upper rim is reported. Its PtII/PdII&#8208;metallobridged cavitand counterparts were obtained by treatment with 2&#8197;equiv of cis&#8208;protected metal corners, [M(dppp)(OTf)2] (dppp=1,3&#8208;(bis&#8208;diphenylphosphino)propane). The metal corners arranged their axial phenyl substituents near the aromatic walls of the cavitand leading to the formation of inclusion complexes as single conformers. We characterized the inclusion complexes in solution using NMR spectroscopy. Selected complexes were also characterized in the gas&#8208;phase and in the solid&#8208;state using mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The dimensions of the open portals of the dinuclear complexes were found to be dependent on the included guest. The results of DFT calculations served to explain the dissimilar complexation&#8208;induced shifts observed in the dinuclear inclusion complexes with mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;formamide guests.

         <title>Visualizing Proteins in Mammalian Cells by 19F NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional 19F spectra of proteins can be easily detected in mammalian cells in contrast to 2D 1H&#8208;15N HSQC spectra that can be rendered invisible by interactions with cellular components. Importantly, distances can be measured by 19F PREs for proteins in their cellular milieu, paving the way for studying structure and dynamics while proteins perform their function.







Abstract
In&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to investigate protein behavior in physiologically relevant environments. Although proven valuable for disordered proteins, we show that in commonly used 1H&#8208;15N HSQC spectra of globular proteins, interactions with cellular components often broaden resonances beyond detection. This contrasts 19F spectra in mammalian cells, in which signals are readily observed. Using several proteins, we demonstrate that surface charges and interaction with cellular binding partners modulate linewidths and resonance frequencies. Importantly, we establish that 19F paramagnetic relaxation enhancements using stable, rigid Ln(III) chelate pendants, attached via non&#8208;reducible thioether bonds, provide an effective means to obtain accurate distances for assessing protein conformations in the cellular milieu.

         <title>Endo&#8208;M Mediated Chemoenzymatic Approach Enables Reversible Glycopeptide Labeling for O&#8208;GlcNAcylation Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;GlcNAc moieties can be efficiently ligated with long glycans using an Endo&#8208;M mutant, and the attached glycans can be reversibly removed by wild&#8208;type Endo&#8208;M/S to restore the O&#8208;GlcNAc moiety. By combining this reversible chemoenzymatic labeling and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) method, a tag&#8208;free O&#8208;GlcNAc glycopeptide enrichment approach was developed.







Abstract
To selectively enrich O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) peptides in their original form from complex samples, we report the first reversible chemoenzymatic labeling approach for proteomic analysis. In this strategy, the O&#8208;GlcNAc moieties are ligated with long N&#8208;glycans using an Endo&#8208;M mutant, which enables the enrichment of the labeled glycopeptides by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The attached glycans on the enriched glycopeptides are removed by wild&#8208;type Endo&#8208;M/S to restore the O&#8208;GlcNAc moiety. Compared with classic chemoenzymatic labeling, this approach enables the tag&#8208;free identification, and eliminates the interference of bulky tags in glycopeptide detection. This approach presents a unique avenue for the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation to promote its mechanism research.

         <title>Synthetic Cells: From Simple Bio&#8208;Inspired Modules to Sophisticated Integrated Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review highlights strategies used to build synthetic cells and organelles from scratch. These cell&#8208;like materials, which mimic the structure and function of natural cells, represent the next generation of biologically inspired smart systems. The discussion begins by describing basic functions and components, such as energy supply and compartmentalization, and evolves into systems with an increasing degree of sophistication.







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology is the science of building systems that mimic the structure and function of living cells from scratch. To do this, researchers combine tools from chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry to develop functional and structural building blocks to construct synthetic cell&#8208;like systems. The many strategies and materials that have been developed in recent decades have enabled scientists to engineer synthetic cells and organelles that mimic the essential functions and behaviors of natural cells. Examples include synthetic cells that can synthesize their own ATP using light, maintain metabolic reactions through enzymatic networks, perform gene replication, and even grow and divide. In this Review, we discuss recent developments in the design and construction of synthetic cells and organelles using the bottom&#8208;up approach. Our goal is to present representative synthetic cells of increasing complexity as well as strategies for solving distinct challenges in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology.

         <title>A Kinetic and Fluorogenic Enhancement Strategy for Labeling of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel acridine&#8211;tetrazine probe &#8220;PINK&#8221; was designed to overcome previous shortcomings of bioorthogonal labeling within tightly packed chromatin of living cells. High&#8208;affinity intercalation of the probe enhances its inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with vinyl&#8208;modified nucleic acids in both a kinetic and fluorogenic manner to allow for a &#8220;mix and measure&#8221; assay for DNA replication and RNA synthesis in living cells.







Abstract
Chemical modification of nucleic acids in living cells can be sterically hindered by tight packing of bioorthogonal functional groups in chromatin. To address this limitation, we report here a dual enhancement strategy for nucleic acid&#8208;templated reactions utilizing a fluorogenic intercalating agent capable of undergoing inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions with DNA containing 5&#8208;vinyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine (VdU) or RNA containing 5&#8208;vinyl&#8208;uridine (VU). Reversible high&#8208;affinity intercalation of a novel acridine&#8211;tetrazine conjugate &#8220;PINK&#8221; (KD=5&#177;1&#8197;&#956;M) increases the reaction rate of tetrazine&#8211;alkene IEDDA on duplex DNA by 60&#8201;000&#8208;fold (590&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) as compared to the non&#8208;templated reaction. At the same time, loss of tetrazine&#8211;acridine fluorescence quenching renders the reaction highly fluorogenic and detectable under no&#8208;wash conditions. This strategy enables live&#8208;cell dynamic imaging of acridine&#8208;modified nucleic acids in dividing cells.

         <title>Enhancing Circulation and Tumor Accumulation of Carboplatin via an Erythrocyte&#8208;Anchored Prodrug Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The short circulatory half&#8208;lives and low tumor accumulation of carboplatin greatly limit the drug&#8217;s efficacy in vivo. Herein, we address these challenges by using a prodrug strategy and present the rational design of a novel platinum(IV) anticancer prodrug that can hitchhike on erythrocytes. This prodrug, designated as ERY1&#8208;Pt(IV), can bind to erythrocytes efficiently and stably, possessing a circulatory half&#8208;life 18.5 times longer than that of carboplatin in mice. This elongated circulatory half&#8208;life enables platinum to accumulate at levels 7.7 times higher than with carboplatin, with steady levels in the tumors. As a consequence, the ERY1&#8208;Pt(IV) prodrug is proved to exhibit significantly enhanced antitumor activity and reduced side effects compared with carboplatin. Collectively, our novel approach highlights an efficient strategy to utilize intrinsic erythrocytes as auto&#8208;binding carriers to enhance the tumor accumulation and subsequent antitumor efficacy of platinum drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Acyclic (L)&#8208;Threoninol Nucleic Acid Four Way Junction with High Stability in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligonucleotides are increasingly being used as a programmable connection material to assemble molecules and proteins in well&#8208;defined structures. For the application of such assemblies for in vivo diagnostics or therapeutics it is crucial that the oligonucleotides form highly stable, non&#8208;toxic, and non&#8208;immunogenic structures. Only few oligonucleotide derivatives fulfil all of these requirements. Here we report on the application of acyclic L&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (aTNA) to form a four&#8208;way junction (4WJ), that is highly stable and enables facile assembly of components for in vivo treatment and imaging. The aTNA 4WJ is serum stable, shows no non&#8208;targeted uptake or cytotoxicity, and invokes no innate immune response. As a proof of concept, we modify the 4WJ with a cancer&#8208;targeting and a serum half&#8208;life extension moiety and show the effect of these functionalized 4WJs in vitro and in vivo respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Phase Magnetic Mechanistic Study of Ni&#8208;seamed Pyrogallol[4]arene Nanocapsules Reveal Presence of Novel Cylindrical and Spherical species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The magnetic properties of nickel&#8208;seamed  C  &#8208;pyrogallol[4]arene (PgC3Ni) hexamers and dimers are studied for the first time in solution. The combination of small&#8208;angle neutron scattering and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer measurements of the solution species reveal their paramagnetic and weakly antiferromagnetic behaviour. Surprisingly, the magnetic results indicated the presence of an unprecedented 13 &#197;&#8208;radius species, larger than both the dimeric and hexameric nanocapsules with both octahedral and square planar metal centers. To confirm the presence of this novel species, we performed a mechanistic study of PgC3Ni as a function of temperature and solvent and deduced the presence of two additional new species: (a) an 11 &#197; cylinder with Ni atoms seaming the tubular framework and (b) an 8 &#197;&#8208;radius sphere with non&#8208;interacting Ni centers located within the internal cavity. Select parameters that shift the equilibrium towards desired species are also identified.</dc:description>

To confirm the presence of this novel species, we performed a mechanistic study of PgC3Ni as a function of temperature and solvent and deduced the presence of two additional new species: (a) an 11 &#197; cylinder with Ni atoms seaming the tubular framework and (b) an 8 &#197;-radius sphere with non-interacting Ni centers located within the internal cavity. Select parameters that shift the equilibrium towards desired species are also identified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Stacked Porous Organic Molecular Framework for Selective Separation of Aromatics and Cyclic Aliphatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective separation using porous adsorbents is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to traditional separation techniques. Stacked porous organic molecular frameworks (POMF) capable of noncovalent &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. Here we report a robust porous molecular crystal (  TAPM&#8208;1  ), which is stabilized by multiple intermolecular &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. With its long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;stacking,  TAPM&#8208;1  has excellent hydrophobicity, thermostability, recyclability, and high selectivity for aromatics over the corresponding cyclic aliphatics. This enables  TAPM&#8208;1  to serve as the stationary phase in the high&#8208;resolution gas chromatographic separation of benzene and cyclohexane or toluene and methylcyclohexane.</dc:description>

         <title>Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes: Synthesis, Structures, and Ring Reconstruction via Atom Transfer under Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monoazadichalcogenasumanenes was synthesized that are deep &#960;&#8208;bowls with the bowl&#8208;depth reaching up to 0.95&#8197;&#197;, and thus exceeding that of corannulene. They undergo ring reconstruction under acidic conditions, as a result of protonation&#8208;induced chalcogen atom transfer.







Abstract
Buckybowls have unique properties that can be tailored by embedding main&#8208;group elements into their &#960;&#8208;scaffolds. Herein, a synthetic approach is developed for producing monoazadichalcogenasumanenes (4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b, 6&#8201;a/6&#8201;b, 7&#8201;a/7&#8201;b) derived from sumanene by replacing its three benzylic carbons with one nitrogen and two chalcogen atoms (S for 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b, Se for 6&#8201;a/6&#8201;b, Te for 7&#8201;a/7&#8201;b). Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes are deeper &#960;&#8208;bowls than trichalcogensumanenes as the C&#8722;N bond is much shorter than C&#8722;X (X=S, Se, Te). The bowl&#8208;depth of 4&#8201;b (0.95&#8197;&#197;) is greater than that of corannulene (0.85&#8197;&#197;). The nitrogen atom donates electron density to the entire &#960;&#8208;system that makes monoazadichalcogenasumanenes electron&#8208;rich. They undergo ring reconstruction of chalcogenophene ring via transferring a chalcogen atom from one molecule to another under acidic conditions. The nitrogen and chalcogen atoms play crucial role on this reaction.

         <title>Hydrazone and Oxime Olefination via Ruthenium Alkylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olefination of carbon&#8211;heteroatom double bonds is a powerful approach to access highly functionalized olefins. An approach is reported here that uses air&#8208;stable and commercially available ruthenium alkylidenes to promote C=N/olefin ring closure. The enabling strategy for this reaction is the use of hydrazones and oximes as readily accessible substrates that preferentially react with ruthenium alkylidenes, even in the presence of carbonyl groups.







Abstract
We describe the development of an efficient method for the olefination of hydrazones and oximes. The key design approach that enables this transformation is tuning of the energy/polarity of C=N &#960;&#8208;bonds by employing heteroatom functionalities (NR2, OR). The resulting hydrazones or oximes facilitate olefination with ruthenium alkylidenes. Through this approach, we show that air&#8208;stable, commercially available ruthenium alkylidenes provide access to functionalized alkenes (20 examples) in ring&#8208;closing reactions with yields up to 88&#8201;%.

         <title>X&#8208;ray Electron Density Study of the Chemical Bonding Origin of Glass Formation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical bonding difference between the glass&#8208;forming Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni MOF and the isostructural thermally decomposing Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni was investigated by 25&#8197;K X&#8208;ray electron density analysis, and multi&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography establishing the correlation between chemical bonding and meltability in MOFs. Then systematic tuning of the thermal stability with Co doping was demonstrated in a series of CoxZn1&#8722;x&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni (x=0.3&#8211;0.003) MOF solid solutions.







Abstract
Glass&#8208;forming metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have novel applications, but the origin of their peculiar melting behavior is unclear. Here, we report synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction electron densities of two zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), the glass&#8208;forming Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni and the isostructural thermally decomposing Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni. Electron density analysis shows that the Zn&#8722;N bonds are more ionic than the Co&#8722;N bonds, which have distinct covalent features. Variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectra reveal the onset of significant imidazolate bond weakening in Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni above 673&#8197;K. Melting can be controlled by tuning the metal&#8211;ligand and imidazole bonding strength as shown from thermal analysis of nine solid&#8208;solution CoxZn1&#8722;x&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni (x=0.3 to 0.003) MOFs, and a mere 4&#8201;% Co&#8208;doping into Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni results in thermal decomposition instead of melting. The present findings demonstrate the key role of the metal&#8211;ligand bonds and imidazolate bonds in controlling the delicate balance between melting and decomposition processes in this class of ZIF compounds.

         <title>Asymmetric Redox Allylic Alkylation to Access 3,3&#8242;&#8208;Disubstituted Oxindoles Enabled by Ni/NHC Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and nickel cooperative catalysis enables asymmetric redox allylic alkylation to access 3,3&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The feasibility of cooperative catalysis between chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes and nickel in asymmetric reactions has been demonstrated convincingly. The high efficiency of this catalytic system enables the asymmetric allylic alkylation of isatin&#8208;derived enals with allylic carbonates and [3+3] annulation with racemic vinyl epoxides to provide straightforward access to highly enantioenriched 3,3&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles.

     alt="Asymmetric Redox Allylic Alkylation to Access 3,3&#8242;-Disubstituted Oxindoles Enabled by Ni/NHC Cooperative Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral N-heterocyclic carbene and nickel cooperative catalysis enables asymmetric redox allylic alkylation to access 3,3&#8242;-disubstituted oxindoles with high enantioselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feasibility of cooperative catalysis between chiral N-heterocyclic carbenes and nickel in asymmetric reactions has been demonstrated convincingly. The high efficiency of this catalytic system enables the asymmetric allylic alkylation of isatin-derived enals with allylic carbonates and [3+3] annulation with racemic vinyl epoxides to provide straightforward access to highly enantioenriched 3,3&#8217;-disubstituted oxindoles. The great practicality of this method in organic synthesis has been showcased by facile product modification and enantioselective synthesis of the key building block to access (&#8722;)-debromoflustramine B.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Design Strategy Enabling the Synthesis of Hydrolysis&#8208;Resistant, Water&#8208;Stable Titanium(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thorough characterization of aqueous stable bidentate chelate systems with Ti4+ including speciation, DFT, and structural characterization of key complexes is reported. Hexadentate analogs of the high&#8208;performing bidentate chelators were also assessed and were assessed for the potential use in kit&#8208;based PET imaging with 45Ti4+.







Abstract
Despite its prevalence in the environment, the chemistry of the Ti4+ ion has long been relegated to organic solutions or hydrolyzed TiO2 polymorphs. A knowledge gap in stabilizing molecular Ti4+ species in aqueous environments has prevented the use of this ion for various applications such as radioimaging, design of water&#8208;compatible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and aqueous&#8208;phase catalysis applications. Herein, we show a thorough thermodynamic screening of bidentate chelators with Ti4+ in aqueous solution, as well as computational and structural analyses of key compounds. In addition, the hexadentate analogues of catechol (benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol) and deferiprone (3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;pyridone), TREN&#8208;CAM and THPMe respectively, were assessed for chelation of the 45Ti isotope (t1/2=3.08&#8197;h, &#946;+=85&#8201;%, E&#946;+=439&#8197;keV) towards positron emission tomography (PET) imaging applications. Both were found to have excellent capacity for kit&#8208;formulation, and [45Ti]Ti&#8208;TREN&#8208;CAM was found to have remarkable stability in vivo.

         <title>Light&#8208;Enhanced Osmotic Energy Harvester Using Photoactive Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework membrane has been fabricated by a facile cathodic deposition method. The high ion selectivity and permeability endow the MOF membrane with a great performance in osmotic energy harvesting, and this performance can be further improved by the photoactive porphyrin ligands upon light irradiation.







Abstract
High ion selectivity and permeability, as two contradictory aspects for the membrane design, highly hamper the development of osmotic energy harvesting technologies. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with ultra&#8208;small and high&#8208;density pores and functional surface groups show great promise in tackling these problems. Here, we propose a facile and mild cathodic deposition method to directly prepare crack&#8208;free porphyrin MOF membranes on a porous anodic aluminum oxide for osmotic energy harvesting. The abundant carboxyl groups of the functionalized porphyrin ligands together with the nanoporous structure endows the MOF membrane with high cation selectivity and ion permeability, thus a large output power density of 6.26&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 is achieved. The photoactive porphyrin ligands further lead to an improvement of the power density to 7.74&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 upon light irradiation. This work provides a promising strategy for the design of high&#8208;performance osmotic energy harvesting systems.

         <title>Cooperative Assembly of 2D&#8208;MOF Nanoplatelets into Hierarchical Carpets and Tubular Superstructures for Advanced Air Filtration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework, DUT&#8208;134(Cu), nanoparticles self&#8208;assemble into carpet&#8208;like mesocrystals offering enhanced accessibility of open metal sites for air&#8208;filtration applications.







Abstract
Clean air is an indispensable prerequisite for human health. The capture of small toxic molecules requires the development of advanced materials for air filtration. Two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials offer highly accessible surface areas but for real&#8208;world applications their assembly into well&#8208;defined hierarchical mesostructures is essential. DUT&#8208;134(Cu) ([Cu2(dttc)2]n, dttc=dithieno[3,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate]) is a metal&#8211;organic framework forming platelet&#8208;shaped particles, that can be organized into complex structures, such as millimeter large free&#8208;standing layers (carpets) and tubes. The structured material demonstrates enhanced accessibility of open metal sites and significantly enhanced H2S adsorption capacity in gas filtering tests compared with traditional bulk analogues.

         <title>Aromaticity and Extrusion of Benzenoids Linked to [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;: Clar Has the Answer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clar has the answer! Clar's &#960;&#8208;sextets justify the reason why the linked system of [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and benzenoid drives to extrusion in the case of naphthalene or anthracene, but not for benzene, pyrene or perylene.







Abstract
Benzene and pyrene can be synthetically linked to [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; keeping their aromaticity. In contrast, naphthalene and anthracene are extruded in the same reaction. We have proven that extrusion is only favorable if the number of Clar's &#960;&#8208;sextets remains constant. Thus, Clar has the answer to whether an attached polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon to [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; is extruded or not.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminate Catalyzes the Dehydrocoupling of Phenylphosphine Borane to High Molar Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphosphinoboranes are an emerging class of p&#8208;block element&#8208;based polymers. To date, their synthesis with high molecular weights was reserved for catalysts featuring transition metals. Calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate is introduced as the first transition metal&#8208;free catalytic system for the dehydropolymerization of phenylphosphine borane. Initial mechanistic investigations indicate metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity of the aluminate.







Abstract
High molar weight polyphosphinoboranes represent materials with auspicious properties, but their preparation requires transition metal&#8208;based catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Polyphosphinoboranes are an emerging class of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-block element-based polymers. To date, their synthesis with high molecular weights was reserved for catalysts featuring transition metals. Calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate is introduced as the first transition metal-free catalytic system for the dehydropolymerization of phenylphosphine borane. Initial mechanistic investigations indicate metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity of the aluminate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High molar weight polyphosphinoboranes represent materials with auspicious properties, but their preparation requires transition metal-based catalysts. Here, calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate is shown to induce the dehydropolymerization of phosphine boranes to high molar mass polyphosphinoboranes (up to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=43&#8201;000&#8197;Da). Combined GPC and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P DOSY NMR spectroscopic analyses, quantum chemical computations, and stoichiometric reactions disclose a P&#8722;H bond activation by the cooperative action of the square-planar aluminate and the electron-rich ligand framework. This first transition metal-free catalyst for P&#8722;B dehydrocoupling overcomes the problem of residual &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-block metal impurities in the resulting polymers that might interfere with the reproducibility of the properties for this emerging class of inorganic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mediating Oxidation of Thioethers with Iodine&#8212;A Mild and Versatile Pathway to Trigger the Formation of Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for the formation of peptide hydrogels utilizing a mediating redox reaction based on the oxidation of thioethers with iodine is presented. Protons generated during oxidation trigger the efficient hydrogelation of peptides from alkaline precursor solutions.







Abstract
The development of redox&#8208;triggerable peptide hydrogels poses fundamental challenges, since the highly specific peptide architectures required inevitably limit the versatility of such materials. A powerful, yet rarely applied approach to bypass those barriers is the application of a mediating redox reaction to gradually decrease the pH during hydrogel formation. We report a versatile strategy to trigger the formation of peptide hydrogels from readily accessible acid&#8208;triggerable gelators by generating protons by oxidation of thioethers with triiodide. Adding thiodiglycol as a readily available thioether auxiliary to the basic precursor solution of a peptide gelator efficiently yielded hydrogels after mixing with triiodide, as studied in detail for Nap&#8208;FF and demonstrated for other peptides. Furthermore, incorporation of the thioether moiety in the gelator backbone via the amino acid methionine, as shown for the tailormade Nap&#8208;FMDM peptide, reduces the number of required additives.

         <title>Histidine&#8208;Mediated Ion Specific Effects Enable Salt Tolerance of a Pore&#8208;Forming Marine Antimicrobial Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) preferentially permeate prokaryotic membranes via electrostatic binding and membrane remodeling.&#160;Such action is drastically suppressed by high salt due to increased electrostatic screening, thus it is puzzling how marine AMPs can possibly work.&#160;We examine as a model system piscidin&#8208;1, a histidine&#8208;rich marine AMP, and show that ion&#8208;histidine interactions play unanticipated roles in membrane remodeling at high salt: Histidines can simultaneously hydrogen&#8208;bond to a phosphate and coordinate with an alkali metal ion to neutralize phosphate charge, thereby facilitating multidentate bonds to lipid headgroups in order to generate saddle&#8208;splay curvature, a prerequisite to pore&#8208;formation. A comparison among Na  +  , K  +  , and Cs  +  &#160;indicates that histidine&#8208;mediated salt tolerance is ion specific. We conclude that histidine plays a unique role in enabling protein/peptide&#8208;membrane interactions that occur in marine or other high&#8208;salt environment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Lewis pair polymerization has demonstrated its uniuqe advantages and powerful capability in polymer synthesis. Here we employ strong nucleophilic  N  &#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) and bulky organoaluminum to construct frustrated Lewis pair, which can realize the compounded sequence control copolymerization (CSC) and self&#8208;assembly the mixture of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate and fluoride&#8208;functionalized methacrylate into diblock copolymers (di&#8208;BCPs) nano&#8208;assemblies through polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly in one&#8208;pot, single&#8208;step manner within minutes. These di&#8208;BCPs were characterized by  1H and  13C NMR, GPC, DSC, and TEM. By utilizing appropriate solvophilic block and solvophobic block, such Lewis pair polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy enables the expeditious, room&#8208;temperature synthesis of di&#8208;BCP nanoparticles with different morphologies, including spheres, worms, vesicles, and even fibers, thus suggesting the great application potential of such method in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Partners in Asymmetric Catalysis Copolymerization: Highly Enantioselective and Controllable at Enhanced Temperatures and Low Loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent enantioselectivity, activity and no transesterification side reactions were achieved in the asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxides and anhydrides at low catalyst loadings or/and enhanced temperatures via intramolecularly bimetallic and multichiral synergistic catalysis.







Abstract
Asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxide and anhydride is a powerful strategy for preparing various isotactic polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers. However, the previous binary systems suffered from slow rates at low loadings, poor enantioselectivities and transesterification reactions at enhanced temperatures. Herein, we report novel dinuclear aluminium complexes with multiple chiralities and ammonium salts anchored on ligand frameworks. These bifunctional catalysts exhibit high activities and enantioselectivities for epoxides/anhydrides copolymerizations at harsh conditions via intramolecularly synergistic catalysis, affording polyesters with unprecedented molecular weights and narrow distributions. Notably, no transesterification reactions were observed, significantly different from the binary catalyst/cocatalyst pairs. This study represents a rare example regarding temperature&#8208;independent asymmetric induction for preparing chiral polymers from achiral monomers.

         <title>Synthesis of FeIII and FeIV Cyanide Complexes Using Hypervalent Iodine Reagents as Cyano&#8208;Transfer One&#8208;Electron Oxidants</title>

         <dc:description>
Cyano &#955;3&#8208;iodanes react with iron(II) and iron(III) complexes as cyano&#8208;transfer one&#8208;electron oxidants. This approach enables the straightforward synthesis of iron(III) and iron(IV) cyanide complexes, which have been thoroughly characterized by spectroscopic methods, including X&#8208;ray diffraction, EPR, M&#246;ssbauer and NMR spectroscopies and computational methods.







Abstract
We disclose a new reactivity mode for electrophilic cyano &#955;3&#8208;iodanes as group transfer one&#8208;electron oxidants to synthesize FeIII and FeIV cyanide complexes. The inherent thermal instability of high&#8208;valent FeIV compounds without &#960;&#8208;donor ligands (such as oxido (O2&#8722;), imido (RN2&#8722;) or nitrido (N3&#8722;)) makes their isolation and structural characterization a very challenging task. We report the synthesis of an FeIV cyanide complex [(N3N&#8242;)FeCN] (4) by two consecutive single electron transfer (SET) processes from FeII precursor [(N3N&#8242;)FeLi(THF)] (1) with cyanobenziodoxolone (CBX). The FeIV complex can also be prepared by reaction of [(N3N&#8242;)FeIII] (3) with CBX. In contrast, the oxidation of FeII with 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(1H)&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole (CDBX) enables the preparation of FeIII cyanide complex [(N3N&#8242;)FeIII(CN)(Li)(THF)3] (2&#8208;LiTHF). Complexes 4 and 2&#8208;LiTHF have been structurally characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their electronic structure has been examined by M&#246;ssbauer, EPR spectroscopy, and computational analyses.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd(0) catalysts featuring phosphorous&#8208;based monodentate ligands can detour the reactivity of carbonyl&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) from standard (3+2) cycloadditions towards tandem cycloisomerization / cross&#8208;coupling processes. This new reactivity lies on the formation of key &#960;&#8208;allyl oxapalladacyclic intermediates, which are subsequently trapped with external nucleophilic partners, instead of undergoing canonical C&#8208;O reductive eliminations. Importantly, the use of imine&#8208;tethered ACP&#8217;s is also feasible. Therefore, the method provides a straightforward and stereoselective entry to a wide variety of highly functionalized cyclic alcohols and amines.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Although bowl&#8208;shaped N&#8208;pyrrolic polycyclic aromatic

hydrocarbons (PAHs) can achieve excellent electron&#8208;donating ability,

their application for optoelectronics is hampered by typically low

we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of curved and

fully conjugated nitrogen&#8208;doped PAHs. Through structural

modifications to the electron&#8208;accepting moiety, we are able to switch

the mechanism of luminescence between TADF and RTP, and to tune

the overall PLQY in the range from 9% to 86%. As a proof of concept,

we constructed solid&#8208;state OLED devices which has not been

explored so far in the context of concave N&#8208;doped systems being

TADF/RTP emitters. The best&#8208;performing dye, possessing peripheral

trifluoromethyl group adjacent to phenazine acceptor, exhibits yellow

to orange emission with a maximum external EL quantum efficiency

(EQE) of 12%, which is the highest EQE in an curved D&#8208;A embedded

N&#8208;PAH to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Bearing Macrocyclic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand: Improved Stability and Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formation of sterically hindered C&#8211;C double bonds via catalytic olefin metathesis is considered a very challenging task for Ru catalysts. This limitation led to the development of specialised catalysts bearing sterically reduced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands that are very active in such transformations, yet significantly less stable as compared to general purpose catalysts. To decrease the small&#8208;size NHC catalysts susceptibility to decomposition, a new NHC ligand was designed, in which two sterically reduced aryl arms were tied together by a C&#8208;8 alkene chain. The installation of this macrocyclic ligand on the ruthenium centre led to the formation of an olefin metathesis catalyst (trans&#8208;Ru6). Interestingly, this complex undergoes transformation into an isomer bearing two Cl ligands in the cis arrangement (cis&#8208;Ru6). These two isomeric complexes exhibit similarly high thermodynamic stability, yet different application profiles in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new efficient synthetic route for preparation of adamantyl&#8208;enolether as precursors for dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores was developed. The synthesis is convergent, using an unusual Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction employing a stannane&#8208;enolether, to directly afford adamantyl&#8208;enolether. The scope of this synthetic route is broad since a large number of haloaryl substrates are either commercially available or easily accessible.







Abstract
Adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane luminophores are an important class of chemiluminescent molecular probes for diagnostics and imaging. We have developed a new efficient synthetic route for preparation of adamantyl&#8208;enolether as precursors for dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores. The synthesis is convergent, using an unusual Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction employing a stannane&#8208;enolether, to directly afford adamantyl&#8208;enolether. In a following simple step, the dioxetane is obtained by oxidation of the enolether precursor with singlet&#8208;oxygen. The scope of this synthetic route is broad since a large number of haloaryl substrates are either commercially available or easily accessible. Such a late&#8208;stage derivatization strategy simplifies the rapid exploration of novel luminogenic molecular structures in a library format and simplifies the synthesis of known dioxetane luminophores. We expect that this new synthetic strategy will be particularly useful in the design and synthesis of yet unexplored dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Pt1&#8208;CuO Catalyst for Boosting Acetone Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly active single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and identifying their intrinsic active sites in oxidizing industrial hazardous hydrocarbons are challenging prospects. Tuning the electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs) is valid for modulating the catalytic performance of SACs. Herein, we propose that the EMSIs modulation of a Pt1&#8208;CuO SAC significantly promotes its activity in acetone oxidation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of highly active single-atom catalysts (SACs) and identifying their intrinsic active sites in oxidizing industrial hazardous hydrocarbons are challenging prospects. Tuning the electronic metal-support interactions (EMSIs) is valid for modulating the catalytic performance of SACs. Herein, we propose that the EMSIs modulation of a Pt1-CuO SAC significantly promotes its activity in acetone oxidation. This EMSI is determined to promote the charge redistribution through the unified Pt&#8722;O&#8722;Cu moieties, which modulates the d-band structure of atomic Pt sites, and strengthens the adsorption and activation of reactants. The positively charged Pt atoms are superior for activating acetone at low temperatures, then the stretched Cu&#8722;O bonds in-turn facilitate the activation of lattice oxygens to participate in the followed oxidation. We strongly consider that this work will guide researchers to engineer efficient SACs in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation Using Silyl&#8208;Bipyridine Pincer Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NNSi pincer ligands served as suitable ligands for iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation. Among them, a phenanthroline&#8208;based ligand was shown to be an excellent one. The formation of an iridium complex bearing a quinoline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand from [IrCl(cod)]2 was observed, and the catalytic activity of the complex was demonstrated.







Abstract
New ligands for the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of aliphatic compounds were established. In sharp contrast to 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and 6&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives bearing a hydrosilylmethyl group (which would give a thermally stable NNSi pincer complex) served as suitable ligands for the reaction. Among them, a phenanthroline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand was shown to be an excellent ligand, and various aliphatic compounds were efficiently converted to the corresponding borylated products using the Ir/NNSi pincer catalyst system. The NNSi pincer ligand showed unique selectivity and enabled the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation using pinacolborane [H&#8722;B(pin)] instead of B2(pin)2. The formation of an iridium complex bearing a quinoline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand from [IrCl(cod)]2 was observed, and the catalytic activity of the complex was demonstrated.

         <title>syn&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Chiral Terminal Allylic Alcohols with a Titanium Salalen Catalyst and Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of chiral secondary allylic alcohols, one substrate enantiomer is predominantly converted to the anti&#8208;epoxy alcohol. We herein report the first highly syn&#8208;selective epoxidation of terminal allylic alcohols using a titanium salalen complex as catalyst, at room temperature, and aqueous hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. With enantiopure terminal allylic alcohols as substrates, the epoxy alcohols were obtained with up to 98 % yield and up to &gt; 99:1 dr (syn). Catalyst loadings as low as&#160;1 mol % can be applied without eroding the syn&#8208;diastereoselectivity. Modification of the allylic alcohol to an ether does not affect the diastereoselectivity either [&gt; 99:1 dr (syn)]. Inverting the catalyst configuration leads to the anti&#8208;product, albeit at lower dr (ca. 20:1). The synthetic potential is demonstrated by a short, gram&#8208;scale preparation of a tetrahydrofuran building block with three stereo&#172;centers, involving two titanium salalen catalyzed epoxidation steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Enlightening the &#8220;Spirit Molecule&#8221;:&#160;Photomodulation of the 5&#8208;HT2A Receptor by a Light&#8208;Controllable N,N&#8208;Dimethyltryptamine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Classical psychedelics are a group of hallucinogens which trigger non&#8208;ordinary states of consciousness through activation of the 5&#8208;HT  2A  receptor (5&#8208;HT  2A  R) in the brain. However, the exact mechanism of how 5&#8208;HT  2A  R agonism alters perception remains elusive. When studying receptor signaling, tools which work at the same spatiotemporal resolution as the receptor are exceptionally useful. To create such a tool, we designed a set of photoswitchable ligands based on the classical psychedelic  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethyltryptamine (DMT). By incorporation of the DMT&#8208;indole ring into the photoswitchable system, we obtained red&#8208;shifted ligands which can be operated with visible light. Among these azo&#8208;DMTs, compound  2h  (&#8220;Photo&#8208;DMT&#8221;) stands out as its  cis  isomer exhibits DMT like activity while the  trans  isomer acts as weak partial agonist. Such a  cis  &#8208;on &#8220;efficacy switch&#8221; substantially expands the pharmacological toolbox to investigate the complex mechanisms of 5&#8208;HT  2A  R signaling.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thirteen palladium&#8208;ligand assemblies with different structures and topologies were investigated for the ability to bind lithium ions. In one case, the addition of LiBF4 resulted in a profound structural rearrangement, converting a dincluclear [Pd2L4]2 complex into a low&#8208;symmetry [Pd4L8]8+ assembly with two binding pockets for solvated LiBF4 ion pairs. The rearrangement could only be induced by Li+, indicating highly specific host&#8208;guest interaction. A structural analysis of the [Pd4L8]8+ &#160;receptor revealed a compact structure with multiple intramolecular interactions, reminiscent of what is seen for natural and synthetic foldamers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elucidating electrofluorochromism phenomena at the molecular level is essential for understanding and improving the performance of optoelectronic devices. Here we report the strongly charge&#8208;state&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) of vanadyl phthalocyanine. We describe vibrationally resolved absorption and laser&#8208;induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra of samples comprising both the neutral molecule (VOPc  &#8226;  , a stable radical) and its cation isolated in 5 K neon matrices. Ionization of the essentially non&#8208;emissive VOPc  &#8226;  forms a high&#8208;spin diradical cation (VOPc  +&#8226;&#8226;  ) which shows profound PL in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral range. This has implications for future NIR&#8208;emitting electro&#8208;optical devices based on this commonly available chromophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of a Hydrido&#8208; and Imido&#8208;Bridged Dinuclear Ytterbium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trivalent rare&#8208;earth metal hydrido and imido complexes are of versatile reactivity, and many such complexes have been synthesized. However, no example of a rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands has been reported. Herein, we report the first rare&#8208;earth metal complex bearing both hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;ligands, namely hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex. The complex was synthesized via an unprecedented redox reaction of divalent rare&#8208;earth metal hydrido complex with azido compound. DFT calculation indicated that the N  2  release from azido compound in the presence of ytterbium(II) is a kinetically facile process because of the synergistic effects of the two metal centers. The reactivity of the hydrido&#8208; and imido&#8208;bridged dinuclear ytterbium(III) complex was also explored, which showed the redox, addition and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendrite issues for Zn anodes in  a  flexible cell configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key application of aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;based batteries (RZBs) is flexible and wearable energy storage devices (FESDs). Current studies and optimizations of Zn anodes have not considered the special flexible working modes. In this study, we present the Zn accumulation on the folded line and curve areas. The correlation between the bending radius and the lifespan of symmetric cells is proposed. Interface contact of hydrogel electrolytes when working in a bending mode is another key factor affecting cell lifespan. After detailed analysis, the ideal cell configuration is to apply hydrogel electrolytes with suitable chemistry, satisfactory mechanical properties, and high adhesivity. Based on the criteria, a water in salt (WIS) hydrogel is proposed to satisfy those criteria and demonstrate highly stable cell performance. This work has provided a brand&#8208;new perspective toward Zn anode research and is a good starting point to propel the development of FESDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Adaptive Capillarity Enabling Densified 3D Printing for&#160;Ultra&#8208;High Areal and Volumetric Energy Density&#160;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endowing supercapacitors with higher energy density is of great practical significance but remains extremely challenging.&#160;In this work, an innovative densified 3D printing enabled by a surface adaptive capillarity strategy is proposed for the first time.&#160;The printable ink formulated with pyrrole surface&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide renders the printed electrodes excellent surface tension regulability to the subsequent capillary densification, creating an intensely condensed electrode with well&#8208;maintained structural integrity.&#160;Furthermore, simultaneous in&#8208;situ nitrogen doping and hierarchical micro&#8208;meso porosity are readily realized upon post&#8208;carbonization, encouraging enhanced capacitance and fast reaction dynamics.&#160;As a result, the printed symmetric supercapacitor delivers a double leap in areal and volumetric energy densities in both aqueous and organic electrolytes, a rarely achieved yet gravely desired attribute for 3D printed energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Thermal Expansion in Supramolecular Halogen&#8208;Bonded Mixed Cocrystals through Synthetic Feed and Dynamic Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over thermal expansion (TE) behaviors in solid materials is often accomplished by modifying the molecules or intermolecular interactions within the solid. Here, we use a mixed cocrystal approach and incorporate molecules with similar chemical structures, but distinct functionalities. Development of mixed cocrystals is at a nascent stage, and here we describe the first mixed cocrystals sustained by one&#8208;dimensional halogen bonds. Within each mixed cocrystal, the halogen&#8208;bond donor is fixed, while the halogen&#8208;bond acceptor site contains two molecules in a variable ratio. X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrates isostructurality across the series, and SEM&#8208;EDS shows equal distribution of heavy atoms and similar atomic compositions across all mixed cocrystals. The acceptor molecules differ in their ability to undergo dynamic motion in the solid state. The synthetic equivalents of motion capable and incapable molecules were systematically varied to yield direct tunabililty in TE behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite&#8208;Based Heterojunction Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With fascinating photophysical properties and strong potential to utilize solar energy, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have become a prominent feature within photocatalysis research. However, the effectiveness of single MHP photocatalysts is relatively poor. The introduction of a second component to form a heterojunction represents a well&#8208;established route to accelerate carrier migration and boost reaction rates, thus increasing the photoactivity. Recently, there have been several scientific advances related to the design of MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts, including Schottky, type&#8208;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. In this Review, we systematically discuss and critically appraise recent developments in MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysis. In addition, the techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are evaluated and we conclude by briefly outlining the ongoing challenges and future directions for promising photocatalysts based on MHP heterojunctions.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Mediated Biosynthesis of Semiconductor Nanocrystals for Photocatalytic NAD(P)H Regeneration and Chiral Amine Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of predesigned bioengineered proteins for self&#8208;grown nanomaterials is a promising strategy that opens new scientific directions for biotic&#8208;abiotic nano&#8208;bio hybrid configurations. The unique properties of nanomaterials can alter the original biological paradigm to allow novel metabolic routes or new activation triggers. In this work, we present a synthetic methodology for self&#8208;grown cadmium sulfide quantum dots in a 12&#8208;mer bioengineered stable protein 1 under ambient conditions. The sized controlled crystalline QDs are characterized and utilized for NADPH regeneration that is in turn used for the activation of the imine reductase enzyme. The presented nano&#8208;bio hybrid system enables the production of a single enantiomeric product that is required for the pharmaceutical industry. Our designed system presents superior activity and can continuously operate for at least 22hrs with 82% conversion efficiency. The obtained results may lay the foundations for future nano&#8208;bio hybrid systems that can operate both  in vitro  and  in vivo  .</dc:description>

         <title>BN&#8208;Anthracene for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Optoelectronic Materials through Periphery Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable synthetic accomplishments in creating diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with B&#8208;N bonds (BN&#8208;PAHs), their optoelectronic applications have been less exploited. Herein, we report the achievement of high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors based on existing BN&#8208;PAHs through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy. Tetraphenyl&#8208; and diphenyl&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;anthracenes (TPBNA and DPBNA, respectively) are designed and synthesized. DPBNA exhibits the highest hole mobility of 1.3 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, significantly outperforming TPBNA and all the reported BN&#8208;PAHs. Remarkably, this is the first BN&#8208;PAH with mobility over 1 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , which is a benchmark value for practical applications as compared with amorphous silicon. Furthermore, high&#8208;performance phototransistors based on DPBNA are also demonstrated, implying the high potential of BN&#8208;PAHs for optoelectronic applications when the &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy is implemented.</dc:description>

         <title>The Orbital Origins of Chemical Bonding in Ge&#8722;Sb&#8722;Te Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uncovering the peculiar chemical bonding of phase&#8208;change materials is essential to understand their unique physical properties. For the first time ever, Richard Dronskowski et&#8197;al. analyze in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115778) the wavefunctions of these rather covalent materials in terms of interacting atomic orbitals, mirroring independent analyses of their projected force constants. All these materials breaking the octet rule clearly evidence electron&#8208;rich multicenter interactions, similar yet different from the molecular case.

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Supported Gold Nanoparticles as a Superior Catalyst for Nitrous Oxide Production via Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A game of two halves: Direct ammonia oxidation unlocks a pathway towards affordable and efficient production of nitrous oxide, a highly promising agent for selective oxidation reactions, but necessitates the development of suitable catalysts. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200772), Javier P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the synergistic interaction between Au nanoparticles and CeO2 support results in a material with unprecedented levels of N2O selectivity and productivity, far surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems.

         <title>Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of N&#8208;Propargylamides and Their Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;controlled polymerization of non&#8208;conjugated acetylenes is a challenging subject. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117234), Tsuyoshi Taniguchi, Katsuhiro Maeda et&#8197;al. report that unique heptaaryl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;hexatrienylrhodium(I) complexes induce living polymerization of non&#8208;conjugated acetylenes such as N&#8208;propargylamides. This method enables controlling molecular weights of the resultant polymers and the synthesis of telechelic polymers and block copolymers based on poly(N&#8208;propargylamide)s.

         <title>Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Guided Photothermal Immunotherapy Based on a Versatile NIR&#8208;II Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic photothermal immunotherapy has captured extensive attention given the mutually strengthening therapeutic outcomes towards both original tumor and abscopal tumor. Herein, a versatile theranostic agent with aggregation&#8208;induced emission tendency, namely TPA&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ, is elaborately designed and prepared by recommending benzo[c]thiophene unit as a building block, and allows to simultaneously possess fluorescence imaging (FLI) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), photothermal imaging (PTI), and thermal tumoricidal functions. Further experiments validate that TPA&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ nanoparticles&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) can not only remarkably destroy primary tumor but also enhance the immunogenicity for further suppressing the growth of tumor in the distant sites. Furthermore, PTT combining programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) antibody prominently prevent the metastasis and recurrence of cancer by potentiating the effect of immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>gem  &#8208;Difluoromethylene moieties are attractive in medicinal chemistry due to their ability to mimic other more ubiquitous functional groups. Thus, effective asymmetric methods for their construction are highly desirable, especially for the industrial production of chiral drugs. Using a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition between substituted&#8208;2&#8208;alkylidenetrimethylene carbonates and  gem  &#8208;difluoroalkyl ketones, we were able to easily access chiral 1,3&#8208;dioxanes that contain a tetrasubstituted difluoroalkyl stereogenic center in cyclic and acyclic skeletons. A novel phosphoramidite ligand, which contains a bulky 1,1&#8208;dinaphthylmethanamino moiety, was developed to provide the products in high yield with excellent enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity. Strikingly, the  gem  &#8208;difluoro substitution pattern promotes the reaction, and pentafluoroethylketone, an  &#945;  ,  &#945;  &#8208;difluorinated  &#946;  &#8208;ketoester, and a  &#946;  &#8208;ketosulfone are suitable substrates for this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Transmetalation between Copper and Palladium Nanoparticle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;mediated phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu to the Pd surface affords a novel mechanism for transmetalation, enabling wavelength&#8208;tunable cross&#8208;coupling and homo&#8208;coupling reaction pathway control. C&#8208;C bond forming Sonogashira coupling and Glaser coupling reactions in O2 atmosphere are efficiently driven by visible light over heterogeneous Cu and Pd nanoparticles as a mixed catalyst without base or other additives. The reaction pathway can be controlled by switching the excitation wavelength. Shorter wavelengths (400&#8211;500 nm) give the Glaser homo&#8208;coupling diyne, whereas longer wavelength irradiation (500&#8211;940 nm) significantly increases the degree of cross&#8208;coupling Sonogashira coupling products. The ratio of the activated intermediates of alkyne to the iodobenzene is wavelength dependent and this regulates transmetalation. This wavelength&#8208;tunable reaction pathway is a novel way to optimize the product selectivity in important organic syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Zeolitic Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel zeolite&#8208;like materials with large channel windows and high stability is of importance but remains a tremendous challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a 3D covalent organic framework with zeolitic network, namely the zeolitic organic framework (ZOF). By combining two kinds of tetrahedral building blocks with fixed or relatively free bond angles, ZOF&#8208;1 with the zeolitic  crb  net has been successfully synthesized. Its structure was determined by the single&#8208;crystal 3D electron diffraction technique. Remarkably, ZOF&#8208;1 shows high chemical stability, large pore size (up to 16 &#197;), and excellent specific surface area (~ 2785 m  2  /g), which is superior to its analogues with the same network, including traditional aluminosilicate zeolites and zeolitic imidazole frameworks. This study thus opens a new avenue to construct zeolite&#8208;like materials with pure organic frameworks and will promote their potential applications in adsorption and catalysis for macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Cyanine J&#8208;type Aggregate Nanoparticles with Enhanced Photosensitization for Mitochondria&#8208;targeting Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanines have been widely used as the photosensitizers (PSs) in biomedical field, but controlling their molecular aggregates in nanoparticles (NPs) remains a major challenge. Moreover, the impact of aggregate behaviors of cyanines on the photosensitization is still unclear. Herein, the first anionic cyanine PSs based on tricyanofuran end group have been designed by achieving supramolecular J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs via counterion engineering. Our results indicate that J&#8208;type aggregates in NPs can not only bring significantly red&#8208;shifted emission, negatively charged surface, and high photostability, but also enable a significant increase in singlet oxygen generation efficiency by 5&#8208;fold compared to that in the nonaggregate state, providing strong experimental evidence for the superiority of J&#8208;aggregates in enhancing photosensitization. Thus, combined with the mitochondria&#8208;targeting ability, the J&#8208;type aggregate NPs show remarkable  in vivo  antitumor phototheranostic efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced, Sole&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed, Directed C&#8211;H Functionalization: Metal&#8208;Substrate Bound Complexes as Light&#8208;Harvesting Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H functionalization represents one of the most rapidly advancing areas on organic synthesis and is regarded as one of the key concepts to minimize the ecologic and economic footprint of organic synthesis. The ubiquity and low reactivity of C&#8211;H bonds in organic molecules however poses several challenges, which in turn often necessitates harsh reaction conditions to achieve this goal and it is highly desirable to achieve C&#8211;H functionalization reactions under mild conditions. Recently, several reports uncovered a conceptually new approach towards C&#8211;H functionalization, where a single transition metal complex can be used as both photosensitizer and catalyst to promote C&#8211;H bond functionalization in the absence of an exogeneous photosensitizer.

The ubiquity and low reactivity of C&#8211;H bonds in organic molecules however poses several challenges, which in turn often necessitates harsh reaction conditions to achieve this goal and it is highly desirable to achieve C&#8211;H functionalization reactions under mild conditions. Recently, several reports uncovered a conceptually new approach towards C&#8211;H functionalization, where a single transition metal complex can be used as both photosensitizer and catalyst to promote C&#8211;H bond functionalization in the absence of an exogeneous photosensitizer. In this minireview, we will provide an overview on recent achievements in C&#8211;H functionalization reactions with an emphasis on the photochemical modulation of the reaction mechanism using such catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extended Conjugation Attenuates the Quenching of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emitters by Photocyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we expose how the antagonistic relationship between solid&#8208;state luminescence and photocyclization of oligoaryl alkenes chromophores is modulated by the conjugation length of their alkenyl backbones. Heptaaryl cycloheptatriene molecular rotors exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics. We show that their emission is turned off upon breaking the conjugation of the cycloheptatriene by epoxide formation. While this modification is deleterious to photoluminescence, it enables formation of extended polycyclic frameworks by Mallory reactions. We exploit this dichotomy (i) to manipulate emission properties in a controlled manner and (ii) as a synthetic tool to link together pairs of phenyl rings in a specific sequence. This method to alter the tendency of oligoaryl alkenes to undergo photocyclization can inform the design of solid&#8208;state emitters that avoid this quenching mechanism, while also allowing selective cyclization in syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Carbosilylation of &#945;&#8208;Olefins with C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp) Bond Formation Involving Silylium&#8208;Ion Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A regioselective addition of alkynylsilanes across unactivated terminal alkenes is reported. The reaction is initiated by capture of a sterically unhindered silylium ion by a silylated phenylacetylene derivative to form a bis(silylated) ketene&#8208;like carbocation. This in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated key intermediate is virtually the actual catalyst that maintains the catalytic cycle by a series of electrophilic addition reactions of silylium ions and &#946;&#8208;silicon&#8208;stabilized carbocations. The computed reaction mechanism is fully consistent with the experimental findings. This unprecedented two&#8208;component carbosilylation establishes a C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp) bond and a C(sp3)&#8211;Si bond in atom&#8208;economic fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Monooxygenation of Phenols: Evidence for a Mononuclear Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three Cu(I) salts with the very weakly coordinating anion [Al(pftb)4]&#8208; (pftb = OC(CF3)3) including the unique, linear [Cu(NEt3)2]+&#8208;cation were synthesized and examined as catalysts for the conversion of monophenols to o&#8208;quinones. 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol (DTBP&#8208;H) as well as, in case of the most active catalyst, five additional different monophenols served as substrates. The activities of these Cu(I) salts towards monooxygenation of DTBP&#8208;H were compared to those of [Cu(CH3CN)4]X salts with &#8220;classic&#8221; anions ([BF4]&#8208;, [OTf]&#8208;, [PF6]&#8208;), revealing an anion effect on the activity of the catalyst and a ligand effect on the reaction rate. A drastic acceleration of the reaction rate was obtained by employing Cu(II)&#8208;semiquinone complexes as catalysts, indicating that formation of a Cu(II) complex precedes the actual catalytic cycle. This and further observations indicate that the oxygenation of monophenols in the title system does not follow a dinuclear, but a mononuclear pathway analogous to that of topaquinone cofactor biosynthesis in amine oxidase.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Sensitized by a Chromium(III) Complex via an Underexplored Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (sTTA&#8208;UC) mainly relies on precious metal complexes thanks to their high intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiencies, excited state energies, and lifetimes, while complexes of abundant first&#8208;row transition metals were only rarely utilized and with often moderate UC quantum yields. [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ (bpmp = 2,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)pyridine) containing earth&#8208;abundant chromium possesses an absorption band suitable for green light excitation, a doublet excited state energy matching the triplet energy of 9,10&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), a close to millisecond excited state lifetime, and high photostability. Combined ISC and doublet&#8208;triplet energy transfer from excited [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ to DPA gives 3DPA with close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield. TTA of 3DPA furnishes green&#8208;to&#8208;blue UC with a quantum yield of 12.0% (close to the theoretical maximum). Sterically less&#8208;hindered anthracenes undergo a [4+4] cycloaddition with [Cr(bpmp)2]3+ and green light.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Construction of Biomimetic Nanosensors for Electrochemical Monitoring of Intracellular Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile and large&#8208;scale synthesis of biomimetic molecular catalyst modified nanowires provides an innovative perspective for simple and stable construction of functionalized electrochemical nanosensors. Such nanosensors enable the sensitive and selective detection of diverse biomolecules, and for the first time achieve real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of intracellular glutathione levels and its redox homeostasis in single living cells.







Abstract
The current strategies for nanoelectrode functionalization usually involve sophisticated modification procedures, uncontrollable and unstable modifier assembly, as well as a limited variety of modifiers. To address this issue, we propose a versatile strategy for large&#8208;scale synthesis of biomimetic molecular catalysts (BMCs) modified nanowires (NWs) to construct functionalized electrochemical nanosensors. This design protocol employs an easy, controllable and stable assembly of diverse BMCs&#8208;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) composites on conductive NWs. The intrinsic catalytic activity of BMCs combined with outstanding electron transfer ability of conductive polymer enables the nanosensors to sensitively and selectively detect various biomolecules. Further application of sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine functionalized nanosensors achieves real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of intracellular glutathione levels and its redox homeostasis in single living cells for the first time.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Degradable Vinylic Polymer&#8208;Based Latexes via Aqueous Radical Emulsion Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emulsion copolymerization of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) with either styrene, n&#8208;butyl acrylate or a mixture of both was carried out in water using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as surfactant and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. Stable waterborne particles of vinylic polymers (blue) bearing cleavable thioester units (red) along the chains were obtained. The polymer chains were degraded to oligomers using a strong base (1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) or isopropylamine.







Abstract
Aqueous emulsion copolymerizations of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) were performed with n&#8208;butyl acrylate (BA), styrene (S) and a combination of both. In all cases, stable latexes were obtained in less than two hours under conventional conditions; that is in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) used as surfactant and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. A limited solubility of DOT in BA was observed compared to S, yielding to a more homogeneous integration of DOT units in the PS latex. In both cases, the copolymer could be easily degraded under basic conditions.

     alt="One-Step Synthesis of Degradable Vinylic Polymer-Based Latexes via Aqueous Radical Emulsion Polymerization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emulsion copolymerization of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane-5-thione (DOT) with either styrene, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butyl acrylate or a mixture of both was carried out in water using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as surfactant and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. Stable waterborne particles of vinylic polymers (blue) bearing cleavable thioester units (red) along the chains were obtained. The polymer chains were degraded to oligomers using a strong base (1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene) or isopropylamine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous emulsion copolymerizations of dibenzo[c,e]oxepane-5-thione (DOT) were performed with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butyl acrylate (BA), styrene (S) and a combination of both. In all cases, stable latexes were obtained in less than two hours under conventional conditions; that is in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) used as surfactant and potassium persulfate (KPS) as initiator. A limited solubility of DOT in BA was observed compared to S, yielding to a more homogeneous integration of DOT units in the PS latex. In both cases, the copolymer could be easily degraded under basic conditions. Emulsion terpolymerization between DOT, BA and S allowed us to produce stable latexes not only composed of degradable chains but also featuring a broad range of glass transition temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards a Systematic Understanding of the Influence of Temperature on Glycosylation Reactions</title>

Automated probing of temperature effects on glycosyl donor activation helped to unravel the structure&#8211;reactivity relationship. Temperature adjustments halved the amount of building block required for a model glycan synthesis.







Abstract
Glycosidic bond formation is a continual challenge for practitioners. Aiming to enhance the reproducibility and efficiency of oligosaccharide synthesis, we studied the relationship between glycosyl donor activation and reaction temperature. A novel semi&#8208;automated assay revealed diverse responses of members of a panel of thioglycosides to activation at various temperatures. The patterns of protecting groups and the thiol aglycon combine to cause remarkable differences in temperature sensitivity among glycosyl donor building blocks. We introduce the concept of donor activation temperature to capture experimental insights, reasoning that glycosylations performed below this reference temperature evade deleterious side reactions. Activation temperatures enable a simplified temperature treatment and facilitate optimization of glycosyl donor usage. Isothermal glycosylation below the activation temperature halved the equivalents of building block required in comparison to the standard &#8220;ramp&#8221; regime used in solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide synthesis to&#8208;date.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Fluorescent Block Copolymer Micelles with Responsive Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The encapsulation of Schiff base&#8208;like zinc(II) complexes into micelles derived from polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) diblock copolymers that offer coordination sites was investigated. Incorporation and ligation results in strongly emissive micelles with enhanced quantum yields and thermal stability compared to the neat complex in pyridine. The responsivity towards medium and acidity was utilized to design a turn&#8208;on emission sensor material upon micelle formation.







Abstract
Responsive fluorescent materials offer a high potential for sensing and (bio&#8208;)imaging applications. To investigate new concepts for such materials and to broaden their applicability, the previously reported non&#8208;fluorescent zinc(II) complex [Zn(L)] that shows coordination&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on emission was encapsulated into a family of non&#8208;fluorescent polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP) diblock copolymer micelles leading to brightly emissive materials. Coordination&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on emission upon incorporation and ligation of the [Zn(L)] in the P4VP core outperform parent [Zn(L)] in pyridine solution with respect to lifetimes, quantum yields, and temperature resistance. The quantum yield can be easily tuned by tailoring the selectivity of the employed solvent or solvent mixture and, thus, the tendency of the PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP diblock copolymers to self&#8208;assemble into micelles. A medium&#8208;dependent off&#8211;on sensor upon micelle formation could be established by suppression of non&#8208;micelle&#8208;borne emission background pertinent to chloroform through controlled acidification indicating an additional pH&#8208;dependent process.

         <title>Multifunctional Wearable Silver Nanowire Decorated Leather Nanocomposites for Joule Heating, Electromagnetic Interference Shielding and Piezoresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional wearable silver nanowire decorated leather (AgNW/leather) nanocomposites with integrated capabilities of Joule heating, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and piezoresistive sensing are fabricated via a facile vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration process. The resultant AgNW/leather nanocomposites show promising application potentials for next&#8208;generation wearable electronic devices in energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence, etc.







Abstract
Multifunctional wearable electronic devices based on natural materials are highly desirable for versatile applications of energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence. Herein, multifunctional wearable silver nanowire decorated leather (AgNW/leather) nanocomposites with hierarchical structures for integrated visual Joule heating, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and piezoresistive sensing are fabricated via the facile vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration process. The AgNWs penetrate the micro&#8208;nanoporous structures in the corium side of leather constructing highly&#8208;efficient conductive networks. The resultant flexible and mechanically strong AgNW/leather nanocomposites exhibit extremely low sheet resistance of 0.8&#8197;&#937;/sq, superior visual Joule heating temperatures up to 108&#8201;&#176;C at low supplied voltage of 2.0&#8197;V due to efficient energy conversion, excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of &#8776;55&#8197;dB and outstanding piezoresistive sensing ability in human motion detection. This work demonstrates the fabrication of multifunctional AgNW/leather nanocomposites for next&#8208;generation wearable electronic devices in energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence, etc.

         <title>A TMEDA&#8211;Iron Adduct Reaction Manifold in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Historically, the role of TMEDA in iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling has been disputed due to a lack of insight into the iron species present during catalysis. In this report, low&#8208;temperature synthesis, freeze&#8208;trapped 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and chemical&#8208;quenched GC analysis were utilized to identify highly reactive and selective TMEDA&#8208;ligated iron species responsible for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling catalysis.







Abstract
Herein, we expand the current molecular&#8208;level understanding of one of the most important and effective additives in iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). Focusing on relevant phenyl and ethyl Grignard reagents and slow nucleophile addition protocols commonly used in effective catalytic systems, TMEDA&#8208;iron(II)&#8208;aryl intermediates are identified via in situ spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and detailed reaction studies to be a part of an iron(II)/(III)/(I) reaction cycle where radical recombination with FePhBr(TMEDA) (2Ph) results in selective product formation in high yield. These results differ from prior studies with mesityl Grignard reagent, where poor product selectivity and low catalytic performance can be attributed to homoleptic iron&#8211;ate species. Overall, this study represents a critical advance in how amine additives such as TMEDA can modulate selectivity and reactivity of organoiron species in cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Logical Analysis of Multiple Single&#8208;Nucleotide&#8208;Polymorphisms with Programmable DNA Molecular Computation for Clinical Diagnostics</title>

A general DNA computational strategy for automatically correlating detected single nucleotide mutation (including insertions, deletions and SNPs) based information to phenotypic outcomes by integration of multiplexed sensing and logical analysis is reported.







Abstract
Analyzing complex single&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;polymorphism (SNP) combinations in the genome is important for research and clinical applications, given that different SNP combinations can generate different phenotypic consequences. Recent works have shown that DNA&#8208;based molecular computing is powerful for simultaneously sensing and analyzing complex molecular information. Here, we designed a switching circuit&#8208;based DNA computational scheme that can integrate the sensing of multiple SNPs and simultaneously perform logical analysis of the detected SNP information to directly report clinical outcomes. As a demonstration, we successfully achieved automatic and accurate identification of 21 different blood group genotypes from 83 clinical blood samples with 100&#8201;% accuracy compared to sequencing data in a more rapid manner (3&#8197;hours). Our method enables a new mode of automatic and logical sensing and analyzing subtle molecular information for clinical diagnosis, as well as guiding personalized medication.

         <title>Encoding Enantiomeric Molecular Chiralities on Graphene Basal Planes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral graphene is directly prepared by transferring the chiral structural conformation from chiral conjugated amino acids onto the graphene basal plane through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction followed by thermal fusion. The chiral graphene is characterized using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy as well as spectroscopic techniques and demonstrated to be useful as electrode in electrochemical enantioselective recognition.







Abstract
Graphene has demonstrated broad applications due to its prominent properties. Its molecular structure makes graphene achiral. Here, we propose a direct way to prepare chiral graphene by transferring chiral structural conformation from chiral conjugated amino acids onto graphene basal plane through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction followed by thermal fusion. Using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy, we estimated an areal coverage of the molecular imprints (chiral regions) up to 64&#8201;% on the basal plane of graphene (grown by chemical vapor deposition). The high concentration of molecular imprints in their single layer points to a close packing of the deposited amino acid molecules prior to &#8220;thermal fusion&#8221;. Such &#8220;molecular chirality&#8208;encoded graphene&#8221; was tested as an electrode in electrochemical enantioselective recognition. The chirality&#8208;encoded graphene might find use for other chirality&#8208;related studies and the encoding procedure might be extended to other two&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>Drastic Events and Gradual Change Define the Structure of an Active Copper&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Alumina Catalyst for Methanol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of the high performance of the extensively used copper&#8208;zinc&#8208;alumina (CZA) catalyst for methanol synthesis is still unknown. How the catalyst is treated before use strongly determines its ultimate performance. Here, using combined operando X&#8208;ray methods the evolution of the industrial CZA catalysts is followed and key events that define the final structure are identified.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;zinc&#8208;alumina (CZA) catalyst is one of the most important catalysts. Nevertheless, understanding of the complex CZA structure is still limited and hampers further optimization. Critical to the production of a highly active and stable catalyst are optimal start&#8208;up procedures in hydrogen. Here, by employing operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction, we follow how the industrial CZA precursor evolves into the working catalyst. Two major events in the activation drastically alter the copper&#8208; and zinc&#8208;containing components in the CZA catalyst and define the final working catalyst structure: the reduction of the starting copper(II) oxide, and the ripening and re&#8208;oxidation of zinc oxide upon the switch to catalytic conditions. These drastic events are also accompanied by other gradual, structural changes. Understanding what happens during these events is key to develop tailored start&#8208;up protocols that are aimed at maximal longevity and activity of the catalysts.

         <title>Macrocyclic Polyoxometalates: Selective Polyanion Binding and Ultrahigh Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion templation using polyoxometalates can be a very effective approach to construct large macrocycles that have unique solid&#8208;state and solution properties. The {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle selectively binds the Preyssler polyanion in solution. It forms a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8211;guest complex that shows ultrahigh solid&#8208;state proton conductivities (1.7&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 368&#8197;K and 90&#8201;% RH) thanks to the presence of an extended hydrogen bonding network.







Abstract
The rational development of an anion templation strategy for the construction of macrocycles has been historically limited to small anions, but large polyoxoanions can offer unmatched structural diversity and ample binding sites. Here we report the formation of a {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle by using the Preyssler anion, [NaP5W30O110]14&#8722; ({P5W30}), as a supramolecular template. The {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle displays selective anion binding behavior in solution. In the solid state, the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8211;guest complex, {P5W30}2&#8834;{Mo22Fe8}, transports protons more effectively, through an extended hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, than a related 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex where the guest is completely encapsulated. The results highlight the great potential this anion templation approach has in producing macrocyclic systems for selective anion recognition and proton conduction purposes.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework (COF) Derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: Unraveling Fundamental Kinetic and Structural Parameters of the Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8211;nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C) is an efficient catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO, yet methods to evaluate the number of active Ni sites on the surface and turnover frequency remained elusive. Herein, a set of COF&#8208;derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C candidates is synthesized and a comprehensive analysis is undertaken to quantify the active Ni sites, addressing the relation between synthesis parameters, apparent reactivity, active site density, and turnover frequency.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a potential approach to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals using electricity as feedstock. Abundant and affordable catalyst materials are needed to upscale this process in a sustainable manner. Nickel&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C) is an efficient catalyst for CO2 reduction to CO, and the single&#8208;site Ni&#8722;Nx motif is believed to be the active site. However, critical metrics for its catalytic activity, such as active site density and intrinsic turnover frequency, so far lack systematic discussion. In this work, we prepared a set of covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;derived Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts, for which the Ni&#8722;Nx content could be adjusted by the pyrolysis temperature. The combination of high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure evidenced the presence of Ni single&#8208;sites, and quantitative X&#8208;ray photoemission addressed the relation between active site density and turnover frequency.

The combination of high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure evidenced the presence of Ni single-sites, and quantitative X-ray photoemission addressed the relation between active site density and turnover frequency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystallization&#8208;Driven Controlled Two&#8208;Dimensional (2D) Assemblies from Chromophore&#8208;Appended Poly(L&#8208;lactide)s: Highly Efficient Energy Transfer on a 2D Surface</title>

Crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of poly(L&#8208;lactides) (PLLAs) end&#8208;capped with distinct dipolar chromophores enable their controlled two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies with programmed shape, size and emission. Co&#8208;crystallization and sequential &#8220;living&#8221; CDSA between donor&#8208; and acceptor&#8208;dye&#8208;capped PLLAs yielded diamond&#8208;shaped co&#8208;platelets and segmented block co&#8208;platelets with efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer on the 2D surface.







Abstract
A rational approach towards precision two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of poly(L&#8208;lactides) (PLLAs), end&#8208;capped with dipolar dyes like merocyanine (MC) or naphthalene monoimide (NMI) and hydrophobic pyrene (PY) or benzene (Bn) is described. PLLA chains crystallize into diamond&#8208;shaped platelets in isopropanol, which forces the terminal dyes to assemble into a 2D array on the platelet surface by either dipolar interactions or &#960;&#8208;stacking and exhibit tunable emission. Dipolar dyes play a critical role in imparting colloidal stability and structural uniformity to the 2D crystals, which is partly compromised for hydrophobic ones. Co&#8208;crystallization between NMI&#8208; and PY&#8208;labeled PLLAs yields similar diamond&#8208;shaped co&#8208;platelets with highly efficient (&#8776;80&#8201;%) F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer on the 2D surface. Further, the &#8220;living&#8221; CDSA method confers enlarged, segmented block co&#8208;platelets using one of the homopolymers as &#8220;seed&#8221; and the other as &#8220;unimer&#8221;.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks via a Polycondensation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 3D crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) were synthesized by a reversible/irreversible polycondensation approach by using Td symmetrical tetrahedral amidine hydrochloride and aldehyde. The 3D CTFs adopt ctn topology, and have moderate crystallinity, relatively large surface area (ca. 2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), high CO2 uptake capacity (23.61&#8197;wt.%), and excellent thermal and chemical stability.







Abstract
The growth of crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) is still considered as a great challenge due to the less reversible covalent bonds of triazine linkages. The research studies of crystalline CTFs to date have been limited to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures, and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crystalline CTFs have never been reported before. Herein we report the design and synthesis of two 3D crystalline CTFs, termed 3D CTF&#8208;TPM and 3D CTF&#8208;TPA through a reversible/irreversible polycondensation approach. The targeted 3D CTFs adopt ctn topology, and show moderate crystallinity, relatively large surface area (ca. 2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high CO2 uptake capacity (23.61&#8197;wt.%). Moreover, these 3D CTFs exhibit ultrastability in the presence of boiling water, strong acid (1&#8197;M HCl) and strong base (1&#8197;M NaOH). This contribution represents the first report of 3D crystalline CTFs, which not only extends their structural diversity but also offers a synthetic strategy and structural basis for expanding practical applications of CTF materials.

         <title>A Metallofullertube of Ce2@C100 with a Carbon Nanotube Segment: Synthesis, Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance and Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end&#8208;caps was synthesized and characterized. Notably, Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 shows high single&#8208;molecule conductivity and unique supramolecular assembly.







Abstract
Tubular fullerenes can be considered as end&#8208;capped carbon nanotubes with accurate structure, which are promising nanocarbon materials for advanced single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100, which has a tubular C100 cage with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end&#8208;caps. As there are structure correlations between tubular Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 and spherical Ce2@Ih&#8208;C80, their structure&#8211;property relationship has been compared by means of experimental and theoretical methods. Notably, single&#8208;molecule conductance measurement determined that the conductivity of Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 was up to eight times larger than that of Ce2@Ih&#8208;C80. Furthermore, supramolecular assembly of Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 and a [12]CPP nanohoop was investigated, and theoretical calculations revealed that metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 adopted a &#8220;standing&#8221; configuration in the cavity of [12]CPP. These results demonstrate the special nature of this kind of metallofullertube.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Carbon Electrocatalyst: Marked ORR Activity in Acidic Media without the Contribution from Metal Sites?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;doped hollow and hierarchically porous carbon nanocage catalyst having a noncovalently bonded N&#8208;deficient/N&#8208;rich layered heterostructure exhibits excellent ORR performance in both alkaline and acidic media without significant contributions by negligble amounts of Fe (0&#8211;0.08&#8197;wt.%) owing to the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer and accelerated electron/mass transfer in the hierarchically porous structure.







Abstract
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalysts have been demonstrated to be the most promising substitutes for benchmark Pt/C catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report that N&#8208;doped carbon materials with trace amounts of iron (0&#8211;0.08&#8197;wt.&#8201;%) show excellent ORR activity and durability comparable and even superior to those of Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic media without significant contribution by the metal sites. Such an N&#8208;doped carbon (denoted as N&#8208;HPCs) features a hollow and hierarchically porous architecture, and more importantly, a noncovalently bonded N&#8208;deficient/N&#8208;rich heterostructure providing the active sites for oxygen adsorption and activation owing to the efficient electron transfer between the layers. The primary Zn&#8208;air battery using N&#8208;HPCs as the cathode delivers a much higher power density of 158&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the maximum power density in the H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell reaches 486&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is comparable to and even better than those using conventional Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts at cathodes.

Such an N-doped carbon (denoted as N-HPCs) features a hollow and hierarchically porous architecture, and more importantly, a noncovalently bonded N-deficient/N-rich heterostructure providing the active sites for oxygen adsorption and activation owing to the efficient electron transfer between the layers. The primary Zn-air battery using N-HPCs as the cathode delivers a much higher power density of 158&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the maximum power density in the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fuel cell reaches 486&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is comparable to and even better than those using conventional Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts at cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Basis for Chaperone&#8208;Independent Ubiquitination of Tau Protein by Its E3 Ligase CHIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NMR&#8208;based structural investigation of the Tau&#8211;CHIP complex revealed a multi&#8208;domain, dynamic interaction that explains the origin of the multiple&#8208;site ubiquitination of Tau operated by CHIP, as well as the ability of this ligase to modify Tau in the absence of chaperones.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;site ubiquitination of Tau protein found in Alzheimer's disease filaments hints at the failed attempt of neurons to remove early toxic species. The ubiquitin&#8208;dependent degradation of Tau is regulated in vivo by the E3 ligase CHIP, a quality controller of the cell proteome dedicated to target misfolded proteins for degradation. In our study, by using site&#8208;resolved NMR, biochemical and computational methods, we elucidate the structural determinants underlying the molecular recognition between the ligase and its intrinsically disordered substrate. We reveal a multi&#8208;domain dynamic interaction that explains how CHIP can direct ubiquitination of Tau at multiple sites even in the absence of chaperones, including its typical partner Hsp70/Hsc70. Our findings thus provide mechanistic insight into the chaperone&#8208;independent engagement of a disordered protein by its E3 ligase.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Targeted Delivery of an Immune Stimulant that Selectively Reactivates Exhausted CAR T Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chronic exposure of CAR T cells to tumor antigens can lead to CAR T cell exhaustion and tumor expansion. To reverse this exhaustion, we have developed two orthogonal strategies to target a potent TLR7 agonist specifically to exhausted CAR T cells. We demonstrate here that both strategies rejuvenate exhausted CAR T cells, leading to dramatic reduction in T cell exhaustion markers (PD&#8208;1+Tim&#8208;3+) and shrinkage of CAR T cell resistant tumors.







Abstract
Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have demonstrated significant promise in suppressing hematopoietic cancers, their applications in treating solid tumors have been limited by onset of CAR T cell exhaustion that accompanies continuous CAR T cell exposure to tumor antigen. To address this limitation, we have exploited the abilities of recently designed universal CARs to bind fluorescein and internalize a fluorescein&#8208;TLR7 agonist conjugate by CAR&#8208;mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate here that anti&#8208;fluorescein CAR&#8208;mediated uptake of a fluorescein&#8208;TLR7&#8208;3 conjugate can reactivate exhausted CAR T cells, leading to dramatic reduction in T cell exhaustion markers (PD&#8208;1+Tim&#8208;3+) and shrinkage of otherwise resistant tumors without inducing systemic activation of the immune system. We conclude that CAR T cell exhaustion can be reversed by administration of a CAR&#8208;targeted TLR7 agonist, thereby enabling the CAR T cells to successfully treat solid tumors without incurring the systemic toxicity that commonly accompanies administration of nontargeted TLR7 agonists.

         <title>Control of Hot Carrier Relaxation in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Using Damping Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model for the damping of the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling in all&#8208;inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) was proposed by considering the mechanical resistance of the ligands. Correspondingly the hot carrier cooling process was slowed down by 3&#8208;fold in CsPbBr3 PeNCs by tuning the rigidity of the layer of organic capping ligands.







Abstract
In photon&#8208;conversion processes, rapid cooling of photo&#8208;induced hot carriers is a dominant energy loss channel. We herein report a 3&#8208;fold reduced hot carrier cooling rate in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals capped with a cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane shell in comparison to single alkyl&#8208;chain oleylamine ligands. Relaxation of hot charge carriers depends on the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling (CPC) process as an important channel to dissipate energies in nanostructured perovskite materials. The CPC strengths in the two samples were measured through cryogenic photoluminescence spectroscopic measurements. The effect of organic ligands on the CPC in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals is elucidated based on a damped oscillation model. This supplements the conventional polaron&#8208;based CPC model, by involving a damping effect on the CPC from the resistance of the ligands against nanocrystal lattice vibrations. The model also accounts for the observed linear temperature&#8208;dependence of the CPC strength. Our work enables predictions about the effect of the ligands on the performance of perovskite nanocrystals in future applications.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Tuned Molecular Packing Allows Concurrently Boosted Photoacoustic Imaging and NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process to enhance the NIR&#8208;II FLI and PAI brightness of an organic semiconducting nanoparticle concurrently by 4.6 and 1.4&#8197;times, respectively, is described by tuning the molecular packing in the aggregated state of NPs, which provides a new strategy to develop multi&#8208;modal phototheranostic materials for more capable clinical applications.







Abstract
It is generally considered that photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI) cannot be enhanced concurrently, as they are dependent on competitive photophysical processes at the single&#8208;molecule level. Herein, we reveal that BDTR9&#8208;OC8 and BDTR9&#8208;C8, which have identical &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones but are substituted by side chains of different rigidity, show distinct phototheranostic properties in the aggregated state. The NIR&#8208;II FLI and PAI brightness of BDTR9&#8208;C8 nanoparticles are enhanced by 4.6 and 1.4&#8197;times compared with BDTR9&#8208;OC8 nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations and GIWAXS analysis revealed that BDTR9&#8208;C8 with rigid side chains shows a relative amorphous condensed state, which will benefit the efficient transportation of photo&#8208;generated excitons and phonons, subsequently enhancing the FLI and PAI signals. Besides, both nanoparticles exhibit excellent photothermal conversion efficiency due to their strong light&#8208;harvesting capability and are considered effective photothermal therapy materials. This work provides an illuminating strategy for material design in the future.

         <title>Protein Ligation and Labeling Enabled by a C&#8208;Terminal Tetracysteine Tag</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy, based on the regioselective S&#8208;cyanylation and hydrazinolysis at a C&#8208;terminal tetracysteine fusion tag, affording the expressed protein &#945;&#8208;hydrazides is reported. It overcomes some of the major limitations of present expressed protein ligation techniques, and thus significantly complements the chemical protein synthesis toolbox.







Abstract
The hydrazinolysis of S&#8208;cyanylated peptide provides an alternative way to afford protein &#945;&#8208;hydrazide, a key reagent used in native chemical ligation (NCL), without the aid of any inteins or enzymes. The currently used non&#8208;selective S&#8208;cyanylation, however, allows no other cysteine in the protein besides the one at the cleavage site. Herein, we report a regioselective S&#8208;cyanylation and hydrazinolysis strategy achieved via the fusion of a tetracysteine tag to the C&#8208;terminal of the protein of interest. We term it tetracysteine enabled protein ligation (TCEPL). While highly selective, the strategy is applicable for proteins expressed as inclusion bodies, and this was showcased by the efficient semi&#8208;synthesis of an iron&#8208;sulfur protein rubredoxin and the catalytic and hinge domains of matrix metalloprotease&#8208;14 (MMP&#8208;14) containing 207&#8197;amino acid residues. Furthermore, the TCEPL strategy was exploited for protein C&#8208;terminal labeling with amino reagents bearing a variety of functional groups, demonstrating its versatility and generality.

&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy, based on the regioselective S-cyanylation and hydrazinolysis at a C-terminal tetracysteine fusion tag, affording the expressed protein &#945;-hydrazides is reported. It overcomes some of the major limitations of present expressed protein ligation techniques, and thus significantly complements the chemical protein synthesis toolbox.

         <title>Interfacial Manganese&#8208;Doping in CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets by Employing a Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immiscible bi&#8208;phasic post&#8208;synthetic strategy for MnX2 (X=Br, Cl) doping in CsPbX3 perovskite nanoplatelets (NPls) is reported. The shuttle role of the electron&#8208;donor oleylamine at the water&#8211;hexane interface is the underlying reason for the MnX2 transport from the polar to nonpolar phase and its delivery to the NPls. Moreover, the halide anion plays an essential role in maintaining an appropriate radius of Mn2+ for the perovskite crystal structure.







Abstract
Mn&#8208;doping in cesium lead halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPls) is of particular importance where strong quantum confinement plays a significant role towards the exciton&#8211;dopant coupling. In this work, we report an immiscible bi&#8208;phasic strategy for post&#8208;synthetic Mn&#8208;doping of CsPbX3 (X=Br, Cl) NPls. A systematic study shows that electron&#8208;donating oleylamine acts as a shuttle ligand to transport MnX2 through the water&#8211;hexane interface and deliver it to the NPls. The halide anion also plays an essential role in maintaining an appropriate radius of Mn2+ and thus fulfilling the octahedral factor required for the formation of perovskite crystals. By varying the thickness of parent NPls, we can tune the dopant incorporation and, consequently, the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;dopant energy transfer process in doped NPls. Time&#8208;resolved optical measurements offer a detailed insight into the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;dopant energy transfer process. This new approach for post&#8208;synthetic cation doping paves a way towards exploring the cation exchange process in several other halide perovskites at the polar&#8211;nonpolar interface.

         <title>Mechanism of Spatial and Temporal Control in Precision Cyclic Vinyl Polymer Synthesis by Lewis Pair Polymerization</title>

Spatiotemporal control in cyclic polymer synthesis: Lewis pair polymerization controls where and when cyclization takes place to afford precision cyclic vinyl homo and block copolymers.







Abstract
In typical cyclic polymer synthesis via ring&#8208;closure, chain growth and cyclization events are competing with each other, thus affording cyclic polymers with uncontrolled molecular weight or ring size and high dispersity. Here we uncover a mechanism by which Lewis pair polymerization (LPP) operates on polar vinyl monomers that allows the control of where and when cyclization takes place, thereby achieving spatial and temporal control to afford precision cyclic vinyl polymers or block copolymers with predictable molecular weight and low dispersity (&#8776;1.03). A combined experimental and theoretical study demonstrates that cyclization occurs only after all monomers have been consumed (when) via conjugate addition of the propagating chain end to the specific site of the initiating chain end (where), allowing the cyclic polymer formation steps to be regulated and executed with precision in space and time.

         <title>A Nuclear&#8208;Targeted AIE Photosensitizer for Enzyme Inhibition and Photosensitization in Cancer Cell Ablation</title>

         <dc:description>
A nuclear&#8208;targeted material MeTPAE with AIE characteristics was developed. MeTPAE can not only interact with HDACs to inhibit cell proliferation, but also damage telomere and nucleic acids precisely through photodynamic treatment. The cocktail strategy of MeTPAE caused obvious cell cycle arrest and showed excellent photodynamic therapy (PDT) anti&#8208;tumor activity, which offered new opportunities for the effective treatment of malignant tumors.







Abstract
The nucleus is considered the ideal target for anti&#8208;tumor therapy because DNA and some enzymes in the nucleus are the main causes of cell canceration and malignant proliferation. However, nuclear target drugs with good biosafety and high efficiency in cancer treatment are rare. Herein, a nuclear&#8208;targeted material MeTPAE with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics was developed based on a triphenylamine structure skeleton. MeTPAE can not only interact with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to inhibit cell proliferation but also damage telomere and nucleic acids precisely through photodynamic treatment (PDT). The cocktail strategy of MeTPAE caused obvious cell cycle arrest and showed excellent PDT anti&#8208;tumor activity, which offered new opportunities for the effective treatment of malignant tumors.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclophenacene&#8208; and Chiral&#8208;Type Cyclophenylene&#8208;Naphthylene Belts</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a [20]cyclophenacene&#8208;type cyclophenylene&#8208;naphthylene (CPN) belt and the enantioselective synthesis of chiral&#8208;type CPN belts have been achieved by the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of naphthalene&#8208;embedded cyclic polyynes. However, the synthesis of a depth&#8208;expanded CPN belt was unsuccessful. Theoretical calculations clarified that the reactivity depends on the stability of the transition state which is subject to ring strain.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a [20]cyclophenacene&#8208;type cyclophenylene&#8208;naphthylene (CPN) belt and the enantioselective synthesis of chiral&#8208;type CPN belts (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) by the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of naphthalene&#8208;embedded cyclic polyynes. The synthesis of a depth&#8208;expanded CPN belt was also attempted, but the final intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition was unsuccessful. Theoretical calculations clarified that the reactivity depends on the stability of the transition state in the initial oxidative cycloaddition step which is subject to molecular strain. The cylindrical structures of these CPN belts were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. As a result of &#960;&#8208;extension through the introduction of naphthalenes in the chiral&#8208;type CPN belts, the anisotropy dissymmetry factors of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence are amplified compared with the corresponding zigzag&#8208;type chiral cyclophenylene belts.

         <title>Advancing the Development of Recyclable Aromatic Polyesters by Functionalization and Stereocomplexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploitation of epoxides as building blocks enabled the preparation of a series of recyclable aromatic polyesters with functionalizable moieties, which has driven a wide array of post&#8208;polymerization modifications toward access of value&#8208;added materials. Stereocomplexed polymers were formed with enhanced thermal stability and crystallinity, and random copolymers displayed polyolefin&#8208;like mechanical performance.







Abstract
The development of innovative synthetic polymer systems to overcome the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer's depolymerizability and performance properties is in high demand for advanced material applications and sustainable development. In this contribution, we prepared a class of aromatic cyclic esters (M1&#8211;M5) from thiosalicylic acid and epoxides by facile one&#8208;pot synthesis. Ring&#8208;opening polymerization of Ms afforded aromatic polyesters P(M)s with high molecular weights and narrow dispersities. The physical and mechanical properties of P(M)s can be modulated by stereocomplexation and regulation of the side&#8208;chain flexibility of the polymers, ultimately achieving high&#8208;performance properties such as high thermal stability and crystallinity (Tm up to 209&#8201;&#176;C), as well as polyolefin&#8208;like high mechanical strength, ductility, and toughness. Furthermore, the functionalizable moieties of P(M)s have driven a wide array of post&#8208;polymerization modifications toward access to value&#8208;added materials. More importantly, the P(M)s were able to selectively depolymerize into monomers in excellent yields, thus establishing its circular life cycle.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Coal&#8208;Bed Methane Purification with Record CH4/N2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of nickel&#8208;based coordination networks with different pore environments was synthesized. These porous materials could be used for coal&#8208;bed methane purification with exceptional separation performance.







Abstract
The enrichment and purification of coal&#8208;bed methane provides a source of energy and helps offset global warming. In this work, we demonstrate a strategy involving the regulation of the pore size and pore chemistry to promote the separation of CH4/N2 mixtures in four nickel&#8208;based coordination networks, named Ni(ina)2, Ni(3&#8208;ain)2, Ni(2&#8208;ain)2, and Ni(pba)2, (where ina=isonicotinic acid, 3&#8208;ain=3&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid, 2&#8208;ain=2&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid, and pba=4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzoic acid). Among them, Ni(ina)2 and Ni(3&#8208;ain)2 can effectively separate CH4 from N2 with top&#8208;performing performance because of the suitable pore size (&#8776;0.6 and 0.5&#8197;nm) and pore environment. Explicitly, Ni(ina)2 exhibits the highest ever reported CH4/N2 selectivity of 15.8 and excellent CH4 uptake (40.8&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) at ambient conditions, thus setting new benchmarks for all reported MOFs and traditional adsorbents. The exceptional CH4/N2 separation performance of Ni(ina)2 is confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Under different CH4/N2 ratios, Ni(ina)2 selectively extracts methane from the gaseous blend and produces a high purity of CH4 (99&#8201;%). Theoretical calculations and CH4&#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal structure analysis provide critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism. Ni(ina)2 and Ni(3&#8208;ain)2 can form rich intermolecular interactions with methane, indicating a strong adsorption affinity between pore walls and CH4 molecules. Importantly, Ni(ina)2 has good thermal and moisture stability and can easily be scaled up at a low cost ($25 per kilogram), which will be valuable for potential industrial applications. Overall, this work provides a powerful approach for the selective adsorption of CH4 from coal&#8208;bed methane.

         <title>Light&#8208;Powered Ion Pumping in a Cation&#8208;Selective Conducting Polymer Membrane</title>

         <dc:description>
An electrochemically fabricated conducting polymer membrane composed of polystyrene sulfonate anion doped polypyrrole matrices exhibits a cationic selectivity and a light&#8208;responsive surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport. The asymmetric visible irradiation drove the cationic transport against a concentration gradient attributed to the formation of the built&#8208;in electric field, demonstrating an ion&#8208;pumping effect.







Abstract
The simulation of the ion pumping against a proton gradient energized by light in photosynthesis is of significant importance for the energy conversion in a non&#8208;biological environment. Herein, we report light&#8208;powered ion pumping in a polystyrene sulfonate anion (PSS) doped polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymer membrane (PSS&#8208;PPy) with a symmetric geometry. This PSS&#8208;PPy conducting polymer membrane exhibits a cationic selectivity and a light&#8208;responsive surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport attributed to the negatively charged PSS groups. An asymmetric visible irradiation on one side of the PSS&#8208;PPy membrane induces a built&#8208;in electric field across the membrane due to the intrinsic photoelectronic property of PPy, which drives the cationic transport against the concentration gradient, demonstrating an ion&#8208;pumping effect. This work is a prototype that uses a geometry&#8208;symmetric conducting polymer membrane as a light&#8208;powered artificial ion pump for active ion transport, which exhibits potential applications in nanofluidic energy conversion.

         <title>Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H Acylation of Amides and Cascade Cyclization via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyzed remote C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of amides was developed, and also combined with a cascade cyclization. Over 120 functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions. Preliminary mechanistic investigations shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under environmentally benign catalytic conditions remains a challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report an organocatalytic remote C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of amides and cascade cyclization through a radical&#8208;mediated 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene as the catalyst. Notably, a diversity of nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates, including simple linear aliphatic carbamates and ortho&#8208;alkyl benzamides, can be successfully applied to this organocatalytic system. With the established protocol, over 120 examples of functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were easily synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions. The robustness and generality of the organocatalytic strategy were further highlighted by the successful acylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules. Then, the asymmetric control of the radical reaction was attempted and proven feasible by using a newly designed chiral thiazolium catalyst, and moderate enantioselectivity was obtained at the current stage. Preliminary mechanistic investigations including several control reactions, KIE experiments, and computational studies shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.

         <title>Switchable Polymerization Organocatalysis: From Monomer Mixtures to Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of sequence&#8208;controlled block polymers from the monomer mixture comprising O&#8208;carboxyanhydride (OCA) and epoxide has been realized using a Lewis&#8208;pair organocatalyst. The experimental and computational results highlighted the pivotal roles played by the high polymerizability of the OCA monomer for guaranteeing the exquisite sequence selectivity and the synergistic decarboxylation for facilitating the smooth transformation of the chain end from carbonate to alkoxide during the switching period.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot production of sequence&#8208;controlled block copolymer from mixed monomers is a crucial but rarely reached goal. Using a switchable Lewis&#8208;pair organocatalyst, we have accomplished sequence&#8208;selective polymerization from a mixture of O&#8208;carboxyanhydride (OCA) and epoxide. Polymerization of the OCA monomer occurs first and exclusively because of its exceedingly high polymerizability. When OCA is fully consumed, alternating copolymerization of epoxide and CO2 liberated in OCA polymerization is triggered from the termini of the first block. The two polymerizations thus occur in tandem, both in chemoselective fashion, so that a sequence&#8208;controlled block polymer with up to 99&#8201;% CO2 conversion is furnished in this one&#8208;pot protocol. Calculations and experimental results demonstrate a chemoselective and cooperative mechanism, where the high polymerizability of the OCA monomers guarantees exquisite sequence selectivity and the cooperative decarboxylation partly arose from the stabilization effect by triethylborane, which facilitates the smooth transformation of the chain end from carbonate to alkoxide.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Promoted Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Aliphatic Ketoacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and efficient nickel&#8211;phosphine complex has been discovered for the asymmetric hydrogenation of aliphatic ketoacids. A proton promoted the activation of C=O bonds and controlled the stereoselectivity through hydrogen bonds to obtain the corresponding products in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
A robust and highly active homogeneous chiral nickel&#8211;phosphine complex for the asymmetric hydrogenation of aliphatic &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;ketoacids has been discovered. The hydrogenation could proceed smoothly in the presence of 0.0133&#8197;mol% catalyst loading (S/C=7500). The coordination chemistry and catalytic behavior of Ni(OTf)2 with (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE were explored by 1H NMR and HRMS. The mechanistic studies revealed that a proton promoted the activation of the substrate C=O bond and controlled the stereoselectivity through hydrogen bonds. A series of chiral &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;alkyl substituted lactones were obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). In addition, this catalytic system also demonstrated that levulinic acid produced from a biomass feedstock was converted into chiral &#947;&#8208;valerolactone without loss of ee value.

         <title>Local Symmetry Breaking Suppresses Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The globally rock&#8208;salt material AgSbSe2 is found to be locally distorted due to the off&#8208;centering of Sb atoms driven by a stereochemically active 5s2 lone pair of electrons. This local off&#8208;centering plays an important role in suppressing the thermal propagation, resulting in ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in AgSbSe2.







Abstract
Understanding the correlations of both the local and global structures with lattice dynamics is critical for achieving low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) in crystalline materials. Herein, we demonstrate local cationic off&#8208;centring within the global rock&#8208;salt structure of AgSbSe2 by using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis and unravel the origin of its ultralow &#954;lat&#8776;0.4&#8197;W&#8201;mK&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K. The cations are locally off&#8208;centered along the crystallographic 
 direction by about &#8776;0.2&#8197;&#197;, which averages out as the rock&#8208;salt structure on the global scale. Phonon dispersion obtained by density functional theory (DFT) shows weak instabilities that cause local off&#8208;centering distortions within an anharmonic double&#8208;well potential. The local structural distortion arises from the stereochemically active 5s2 lone pairs of Sb. Our findings open an avenue for understanding how the local structure influences the phonon transport and facilitates the design of next&#8208;generation crystalline materials with tailored thermal properties.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed ON&#8208;OFF Switchable Hydrogenation Using a Molecular Shuttle Based on a [2]Rotaxane with a Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular shuttle based on a [2]rotaxane with a phosphine ligand has been applied to the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid esters and aryl enamides. The hydrogenation can be switched ON/OFF efficiently by adjusting the movement of the rotaxane wheels with acid/base. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the formation of inactive RhIII&#8208;hydride species might be the reason for shutdown of the reaction.







Abstract
A novel pH&#8208;responsive molecular shuttle based on a [2]rotaxane with a phosphine ligand has been designed and synthesized. In the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid esters and aryl enamides, ON/OFF&#8208;switchable catalysis was accomplished with high ON/OFF ratios by adjusting the movements of the rotaxane wheels located at the catalyst terminals with acid/base. Mechanistic studies using NMR spectroscopy and quasi in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that RhIII&#8208;hydride species are possibly formed in a H2 atmosphere when the catalyst is in the OFF state. During the reaction, a heterolytic activation of dihydrogen occurs by the interlocked rotaxane dibenzylamine and RhI catalytic center acting as a frustrated Lewis pair. Subsequent homolytic splitting of dihydrogen with the newly formed RhI&#8208;hydride species generates RhIII&#8208;hydride species. These findings show that a substrate&#8208;selective hydrogenation can be achieved by using the OFF&#8208;state catalyst.

         <title>Pure Boric Acid Does Not Show Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For over 100&#8197;years, boric acid (BA) has been known to serve as an excellent glass matrix for luminescent chromophores. However, in contrast to a recent report, pure BA does NOT display RTP when excited at 280&#8197;nm, and it is demonstrated experimentally that it does not absorb at &#955;&gt;200&#8197;nm. Theoretical studies further reveal that pure BA cannot absorb at &#955;&gt;175&#8197;nm. Thus, an impurity must be responsible for the apparent RTP in the previous report.







Abstract
Boric acid (BA) has been used as a transparent glass matrix for optical materials for over 100&#8197;years. However, recently, apparent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from BA (crystalline and powder states) was reported (Zheng et&#8197;al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 9500) when irradiated at 280&#8197;nm under ambient conditions. We suspected that RTP from their BA sample was induced by an unidentified impurity. Our experimental results show that pure BA synthesized from B(OMe)3 does not luminesce in the solid state when irradiated at 250&#8211;400&#8197;nm, while commercial BA indeed (faintly) luminesces. Our theoretical calculations show that neither individual BA molecules nor aggregates would absorb light at &gt;175&#8197;nm, and we observe no absorption of solid pure BA experimentally at &gt;200&#8197;nm. Therefore, it is not possible for pure BA to be excited at &gt;250&#8197;nm even in the solid state. Thus, pure BA does not display RTP, whereas trace impurities can induce RTP.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boric acid (BA) has been used as a transparent glass matrix for optical materials for over 100&#8197;years. However, recently, apparent room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from BA (crystalline and powder states) was reported (Zheng et&#8197;al., &lt;i&gt;Angew. Chem. Int. Ed&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;2021&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;60&lt;/i&gt;, 9500) when irradiated at 280&#8197;nm under ambient conditions. We suspected that RTP from their BA sample was induced by an unidentified impurity. Our experimental results show that pure BA synthesized from B(OMe)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; does not luminesce in the solid state when irradiated at 250&#8211;400&#8197;nm, while commercial BA indeed (faintly) luminesces. Our theoretical calculations show that neither individual BA molecules nor aggregates would absorb light at &amp;gt;175&#8197;nm, and we observe no absorption of solid pure BA experimentally at &amp;gt;200&#8197;nm. Therefore, it is not possible for pure BA to be excited at &amp;gt;250&#8197;nm even in the solid state. Thus, pure BA does not display RTP, whereas trace impurities can induce RTP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An NHC&#8208;organocatalyzed remote C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of amides is developed based on a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer strategy. As reported in the Research Article by Jun&#8208;Long Li et&#8197;al. (e202116629), over 120 functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones were synthesized in up to 99&#8201;% yield under mild conditions. Mechanistic investigations, including control reactions, KIE experiments, and computational studies, shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.

A facile strategy for the controlled synthesis of discrete diamond&#8208;shaped two&#8208;dimensional platelets with tunable surface functionality and luminescence by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of poly(L&#8208;lactides) is described by Anindita Das and Aritra Rajak in their Research Article (e202116572). By two&#8208;component co&#8208; and living&#8208;crystallization techniques, predetermined sequence&#8208;controlled supramolecular organization of two functional dyes on the co&#8208;platelet and block co&#8208;platelet surface, respectively, can be achieved.

A naphthalene&#8208;embedded conjugated nanobelt is an excellent design for achieving the synthesis of cyclophenacene&#8208;type and chiral&#8208;type carbon nanobelts. A cationic rhodium complex catalyst is a powerful tool for the (asymmetric) synthesis of these analogues, as reported by Ken Tanaka and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202200800). In the picture, the three blue belts in the foreground and the rhodium complex in the back represent the cyclophenylene&#8208;naphthylene belts and the key catalyst, respectively.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Based Functional Materials: Important Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses recent developments in the basic knowledge, mechanisms, and CO2 utilization strategies regarding the use of functional materials based on covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse active sites as catalysts. Insight is provided into the challenges and prospects of COF&#8208;based catalysts for the design of the next&#8208;generation photo&#8208;/electrocatalysts for the utilization of CO2.







Abstract
As hot topics in the chemical conversion of CO2, the photo&#8208;/electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and use of CO2 as a supporter for energy storage have shown great potential for the utilization of CO2. However, many obstacles still exist on the road to realizing highly efficient chemical CO2 conversion, such as inefficient uptake/activation of CO2 and mass transport in catalysts. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a kind of porous material, have been widely explored as catalysts for the chemical conversion of CO2 owing to their unique features. In particular, COF&#8208;based functional materials containing diverse active sites (such as single metal sites, metal nanoparticles, and metal oxides) offer great potential for realizing CO2 conversion and energy storage. This Minireview discusses recent breakthroughs in the basic knowledge, mechanisms, and pathways of chemical CO2 conversion strategies that use COF&#8208;based functional catalysts. In addition, the challenges and prospects of COF&#8208;based functional catalysts for the efficient utilization of CO2 are also introduced.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Semisynthesis of Lipidated Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipidation is a co&#8208; and post&#8208;translational modification that is known to influence the structure, function, and localization of peptides and proteins. This Review aims to highlight significant advances in the development of modern synthetic and semisynthetic methods for the generation of homogeneously lipidated proteins that have underpinned the study of the effects of lipid modifications on protein structure and function with unprecedented precision.







Abstract
Lipidation is a ubiquitous modification of peptides and proteins that can occur either co&#8208; or post&#8208;translationally. An array of different lipid classes can adorn proteins and has been shown to influence a number of crucial biological activities, including the regulation of signaling, cell&#8211;cell adhesion events, and the anchoring of proteins to lipid rafts and phospholipid membranes. Whereas nature employs a range of enzymes to install lipid modifications onto proteins, the use of these for the chemoenzymatic generation of lipidated proteins is often inefficient or impractical. An alternative is to harness the power of modern synthetic and semisynthetic technologies to access lipid&#8208;modified proteins in a pure and homogeneously modified form. This Review aims to highlight significant advances in the development of lipidation and ligation chemistry and their implementation in the synthesis and semisynthesis of homogeneous lipidated proteins that have enabled the influence of these modifications on protein structure and function to be uncovered.

         <title>Green Carbon Science: Efficient Carbon Resource Processing, Utilization, and Recycling towards Carbon Neutrality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient utilization and recycling of carbon resources, which contain mainly the elements C, H, and O, is an effective way to minimize CO2 emission. In this Minireview, green carbon science is discussed in combination with related fields, including petroleum refining and the production of liquid fuels, chemicals, and materials from coal, methane, CO2, biomass, and waste plastics.







Abstract
Green carbon science is defined as the &#8220;study and optimization of the transformation of carbon&#8208;containing compounds and the relevant processes involved in the entire carbon cycle from carbon resource processing, carbon energy utilization, CO2 fixation, and carbon recycling to utilize carbon resources efficiently and minimize the net CO2 emission.&#8221;[1] Green carbon science is related closely to carbon neutrality, and relevant fields have developed quickly in the last decade. In this Minireview, we propose the concept of carbon energy index, and the recent progress in petroleum refining, and the production of liquid fuels, chemicals, and materials using coal, methane, CO2, biomass, and waste plastics is highlighted in combination with green carbon science. An outlook for these important fields is provided in the final section.

         <title>Crystalline Neutral Diboron Analogues of Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of isoelectronic cyclopropane analogues, namely NHC&#8208;stabilized diboriranes is described. Featuring van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry and highly strained B2C rings, the diborirane derivatives readily undergo ring&#8208;opening and oxidative functionalization, demonstrating potential for future applications in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Although Schleyer's computations in 1979 predicted that the ground state of the parent diborirane features a planar&#8208;tetracoordinate carbon atom (anti van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry), this work demonstrates that substitution of C coupled with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) coordination provides access to isolable diborirane derivatives 3 and 4 with van't&#8197;Hoff&#8211;Le&#8197;Bel geometry. Species 3 and 4 are isoelectronic with cyclopropane and the highly strained B2C rings feature 2c&#8211;2e bent &#963; bonds. Consequently, the B&#8722;B and B&#8722;C bonds in 3 are cleaved in the presence of hydride, proton, and chalcogens. The former two reactions gave NHC&#8208;coordinated fluorenyldihydridoborane 5 and dichlorofluorenylborane 6, respectively, whereas the latter transformations afforded novel thiaborirane 8 and selenaborirane 9. In addition, transfer hydrogenation of 3 with ammonia borane (H3N&#8901;BH3) led to the formation of (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diborane 7 via selective cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. These reactivities show potential for their future application in organic synthesis.

         <title>Microscopic Mechanism of the Heat&#8208;Induced Blueshift in Phosphors and a Logarithmic Energy Dependence on the Nearest Dopant&#8211;Vacancy Distance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A logarithmic relation governing the structures of phosphors was revealed together with an electron&#8211;phonon coupling mechanism explaining the heat&#8208;induced blueshift (HIB) phenomenon by using a high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles approach. The results shed new light on understanding the general structure problems of defect&#8208;containing systems, and the heat&#8208;induced phenomena of phosphors.







Abstract
Heat&#8208;induced blueshift (HIB) observed in many luminescent materials is a puzzling phenomenon that has remained unexplained for decades. By using the high&#8208;throughput first&#8208;principles calculations and energy&#8208;screening techniques, we generated a number of model structures for five phosphors, RbLi[Li3SiO4]2:Eu2+, Na[Li3SiO4]:Eu2+, K[Li3SiO4]:Eu2+, Sr[LiAl3N4]:Eu2+, and Ca[LiAl3N4]:Eu2+. Our analyses suggest, to a first approximation, a logarithmic energy dependence on the nearest distance between the dopant and the metal&#8208;cation vacancy. By identifying the 
 transition energies from the electronic structures calculated for the screened model structures, we show that the vibration of the Eu2+ ion lying in an asymmetric and anharmonic potential well couples with the electronic states, leading to their HIB phenomena.

The results shed new light on understanding the general structure problems of defect-containing systems, and the heat-induced phenomena of phosphors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heat-induced blueshift (HIB) observed in many luminescent materials is a puzzling phenomenon that has remained unexplained for decades. By using the high-throughput first-principles calculations and energy-screening techniques, we generated a number of model structures for five phosphors, RbLi[Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na[Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, K[Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Sr[LiAl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ca[LiAl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Our analyses suggest, to a first approximation, a logarithmic energy dependence on the nearest distance between the dopant and the metal-cation vacancy. By identifying the 
 transition energies from the electronic structures calculated for the screened model structures, we show that the vibration of the Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion lying in an asymmetric and anharmonic potential well couples with the electronic states, leading to their HIB phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Counting of Molecules in the Halo and Dense&#8208;Core of Nanovesicles by Regulating Dynamics of Vesicle Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doublet spikes induced by chaotropes (SCN&#8722;) are recorded from chromaffin vesicles opening during vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (VIEC). The 1st and 2nd peaks correspond to the oxidization of molecules from the halo and dense&#8208;core, respectively, allowing a molecular count to be obtained independently in these two nanoscopic compartments. The vesicles can be classified into three groups including NDCVs, immature large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs), and mature LDCVs.







Abstract
We report the discovery that in the presence of chaotropic anions (SCN&#8722;) the opening of nanometer biological vesicles at an electrified interface often becomes a two&#8208;step process (around 30&#8201;% doublet peaks). We have then used this to independently count molecules in each subvesicular compartment, the halo and protein dense&#8208;core, and the fraction of catecholamine binding to the dense&#8208;core is 68&#8201;%. Moreover, we differentiated two distinct populations of large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs) and quantified their content, which might correspond to immature (43&#8201;%) and mature (30&#8201;%) LDCVs, to reveal differences in their biogenesis. We speculate this is caused by an increase in the electrostatic attraction between protonated catecholamine and the negatively charged dense&#8208;core following adsorption of SCN&#8722;.

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Helicenes by a Tailored Chiral Benzo[ghi]perylene Trisimide &#960;&#8208;Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes are bound by a newly designed chiral &#960;&#8208;scaffold composed of a perylene trisimide, BINOL and terphenyl subunits. The superb enantiodifferentiation is observable by the naked eye due to the exciplex&#8208;type emission of the homochiral complex.







Abstract
Enantioselective molecular recognition of chiral molecules that lack specific interaction sites for hydrogen bonding or Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions remains challenging. Here we introduce the concept of tailored chiral &#960;&#8208;surfaces toward the maximization of shape complementarity. As we demonstrate for helicenes it is indeed possible by pure van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions (&#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions) to accomplish enantioselective binding. This is shown for a novel benzo[ghi]perylene trisimide (BPTI) receptor whose &#960;&#8208;scaffold is contorted into a chiral plane by functionalization with 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL). Complexation experiments of enantiopure (P)&#8208;BPTI with (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;[6]helicene afforded binding constants of 10&#8201;700&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 550&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively, thereby demonstrating the pronounced enantiodifferentiation by the homochiral &#960;&#8208;scaffold of the BPTI host. The enantioselective recognition is even observable by the naked eye due to a specific exciplex&#8208;type emission originating from the interacting homochiral &#960;&#8208;scaffolds of electron&#8208;rich [6]helicene and electron&#8208;poor BPTI.

This reaction can be accomplished in an enantioselective fashion using a palladium catalyst in combination with MandyPhos. The addition of water results in enhanced chemoselectivity for the conjunctive coupling product relative to the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling product. Transformations of the reaction products were examined as well as application to the synthesis of (+)&#8208;adalinine.

         <title>A Calix[3]acridan&#8208;Based Host&#8211;Guest Cocrystal Exhibiting Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel supramolecular strategy to construct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials has been developed, which has led to the convenient synthesis of a new kind of macrocycle, namely calix[3]acridan. The host&#8211;guest cocrystal formed from calix[3]acridan and 1,2&#8208;dicyanobenzene exhibited efficient TADF with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 70&#8201;% as a result of intense intermolecular charge transfer (ICT).







Abstract
A supramolecular strategy to construct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials through host&#8211;guest charge transfer interactions was proposed. Consequently, a new class of macrocycle namely calix[3]acridan was conveniently synthesized in 90&#8201;% yield. The host&#8211;guest cocrystal formed by calix[3]acridan and 1,2&#8208;dicyanobenzene exhibited efficient TADF properties due to intense intermolecular charge transfer interactions. Moreover, the spatially separated highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital resulted in a very small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap of 0.014&#8197;eV and hence guaranteed an efficient reverse intersystem crossing for TADF. Especially, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 70&#8201;% was achieved, and it represents the highest value among the reported intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor TADF materials.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair in Zeolite Cages for Alkane Activations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The H&#8722;H bond in H2 and C&#8722;H bonds in alkanes (n&#8805;3) can be activated by a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) in zeolites. The FLP consisting of the hydrocarbon pool species (polymethylbenzenium, Lewis acid) and deprotonated zeolites (Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al&#8722;, Lewis base) is the common steady state of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reactions.







Abstract
The frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) concept in homogeneous catalysis was extended to heterogeneous catalysis via the supramolecular system of FLP between deprotonated zeolite framework oxygens and confined carbocations in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefin (MTO) reactions. In this FLP, the polymethylbenzenium (PMB+) functioned as the Lewis acid to accept an electron pair, and the deprotonated framework oxygen site acted as the Lewis base to donate an electron pair. This FLP theoretically demonstrated the ability to undergo H2 heterolysis and alkanes dehydrogenation, and this was further confirmed by gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometer (GC&#8208;MS) catalytic experiments inside FLP&#8208;containing chabazite zeolites. All these findings not only bring new recognition to the carbocation chemistry in zeolite cages but also put forward a new reaction pathway as one part of MTO reactions.

         <title>Supported Lanthanum Borohydride Catalyzes CH Borylation Inside Zeolite Micropores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borylation of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds in benzene with pinacolborane (HBpin), catalyzed by a zeolite&#8208;supported lanthanum borohydride, provides the first demonstration of a promising alternative to late&#8208;metal catalysts. High turnovers and yields are achieved by selective grafting of lanthanum at Br&#248;nsted acid sites and limiting HBpin degradation. C&#8722;H bond activation, likely via the &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis mechanism, is probably the turnover limiting step.







Abstract
The zeolite&#8208;supported lanthanide La(BH4)x&#8208;HY30 catalyzes C&#8722;H borylation of benzene with pinacolborane (HBpin), providing a complementary approach to precious, late transition metal&#8208;catalyzed borylations. The reactive catalytic species are generated from La grafted at the Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in micropores of the zeolite, whereas silanoate&#8208; and aluminoate&#8208;grafted sites are inactive under the reaction conditions. During typical catalytic borylations, conversion to phenyl pinacolborane (PhBpin) is zero&#8208;order in HBpin concentration. A turnover number (TON) of 167 is accessed by capping external silanols, selectively grafting at BAS sites, and adding HBpin slowly to the reaction.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of [3]Radialenes via [1+1+1] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first [1+1+1] cycloaddition reaction has been achieved on the Ag(111) surface to afford the aza[3]radialenes. The chlorine substituents in the isocyanides ensured the selectivity and orientational order of the products via the steric hindrance&#8208;directed molecular assembly.







Abstract
[3]Radialenes are the smallest carbocyclic structures with unusual topologies and cross&#8208;conjugated &#960;&#8208;electronic structures. Here, we report a novel [1+1+1] cycloaddition reaction for the synthesis of aza[3]radialenes on the Ag(111) surface, where the steric hindrance of the chlorine substituents guides the selective and orientational assembling of the isocyanide precursors. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, we determined the atomic structure of the produced aza[3]radialenes. Furthermore, two reaction pathways including synergistic and stepwise are proposed based on density functional theory calculations, which reveal the role of the chlorine substituents in the activation of the isocyano groups via electrostatic interaction.

         <title>NHC Catalysis for Umpolung Pyridinium Alkylation via Deoxy&#8208;Breslow Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC deoxy&#8208;Breslow catalysis offers new umpolung possibilities for electron&#8208;poor arene rings. NHC organocatalysis is largely restricted to aldehydes, with other electrophiles proving difficult to harness. It is shown that a pyridinium system can react successfully with an NHC, enabling intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formation with a Michael acceptor through a deoxy&#8208;Breslow intermediate.







Abstract
Umpolung N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis of non&#8208;aldehyde substrates offers new pathways for C&#8722;C bond formation, but has proven challenging to develop in terms of viable substrate classes. Here, we demonstrate that pyridinium ions can undergo NHC addition and subsequent intramolecular C&#8722;C bond formation through a deoxy&#8208;Breslow intermediate. The alkylation demonstrates, for the first time, that deoxy&#8208;Breslow intermediates are viable for catalytic umpolung of areniums.

         <title>Reactive Extrusion Printing for Simultaneous Crystallization&#8208;Deposition of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable fabrication methods for metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films are crucial for integrating this class of materials with applications. Reactive extrusion printing (REP) co&#8208;delivers reactive inks that rapidly form micron&#8208;thick interconnected nanoparticulate films of Cu3btc2 (HKUST&#8208;1) on&#8208;demand and on&#8208;location.







Abstract
Reactive extrusion printing (REP) is demonstrated as an approach to simultaneously crystallize and deposit films of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Cu3btc2 (btc=1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate), also known as HKUST&#8208;1. The technique co&#8208;delivers inks of the copper(II) acetate and H3btc starting materials directly on&#8208;surface and on&#8208;location for rapid nucleation into films at room temperature. The films were analyzed using PXRD, profilometry, SEM and thermal analysis techniques and confirmed high&#8208;quality Cu3btc2 films are produced in low&#8208;dispersity interconnected nanoparticulate form. The porosity was examined using gas adsorption which showed REP gives Cu3btc2 films with open interconnected pore structures, demonstrating the method bestows features that traditional synthesis does not. REP is a technique that opens the field to time&#8208;efficient large&#8208;scale fabrication of MOF interfaces and should find use in a wide variety of coating application settings.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Imprinting of the Helical Organization in Liquid&#8208;Crystal Networks Using Achiral Monomers and Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>

A method has been developed to make cholesteric liquid&#8208;crystal networks from achiral monomers by irradiation with circularly polarized light. This approach allows simultaneous control over the photoalignment of the mesogens and the photopolymerization of the network.







Abstract
Control over molecular motion is facilitated in materials with highly ordered nanoscale structures. Here we report on the fabrication of cholesteric liquid&#8208;crystal networks by circularly polarized light irradiation, without the need for chiral dopant or plasticizer. The polymer network is obtained by photopolymerization of a smectic achiral diacrylate mesogen consisting of an azobenzene core and discrete oligodimethylsiloxane tails. The synchronous helical photoalignment and photopolymerization originate from the cooperative movement of the mesogens ordered in well&#8208;defined responsive structures, together with the flexibility of the oligodimethylsiloxane blocks. The resulting thin films show excellent thermal stability and light&#8208;induced memory features with reversible responses. Additionally, we demonstrate the fabrication of photo&#8208;patterned films of liquid&#8208;crystal networks with opposite helical senses. These findings provide a new method to make light&#8208;controllable chiroptical materials with exciting applications in optics and photonics.

         <title>Access to a Labile Monomeric Magnesium Radical by Ball&#8208;Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ball&#8208;milling of a magnesium iodide precursor with K/KI gave a mononuclear Mg radical which is stabilized by a CAAC ligand. Although stable in the crystalline state, the complex decomposed rapidly in solution. According to calculations and EPR spectroscopy, most of the spin density is localized on the CAAC ligand.







Abstract
In order to isolate a monometallic Mg radical, the precursor (Am)MgI&#8901;(CAAC) (1) was prepared (Am=tBuC(N&#8208;DIPP)2, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, CAAC=cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene). Reduction of a solution of 1 in toluene with the reducing agent K/KI led to formation of a deep purple complex that rapidly decomposed. Ball&#8208;milling of 1 with K/KI gave the low&#8208;valent MgI complex (Am)Mg&#8901;(CAAC) (2) which after rapid extraction with pentane and crystallization was isolated in 15&#8201;% yield. Although a benzene solution of 2 decomposes rapidly to give Mg(Am)2 (3) and unidentified products, the radical is stable in the solid state. Its crystal structure shows planar trigonal coordination at Mg. The extremely short Mg&#8722;C distance of 2.056(2)&#8197;&#197; indicates strong Mg&#8722;CAAC bonding. Calculations and EPR measurements show that most of the spin density is in a &#960;* orbital located at the C&#8722;N bond in CAAC, leading to significant C&#8722;N bond elongation. This is supported by calculated NPA charges in 2: Mg +1.73, CAAC &#8722;0.82. Similar metal&#8208;to&#8208;CAAC charge transfer was calculated for M0(CAAC)2 and [MI(CAAC)2+] (M=Be, Mg, Ca) complexes in which the metal charges range from +1.50 to +1.70. Although the spin density of the radical is mainly located at the CAAC ligand, complex 2 reacts as a low&#8208;valent MgI complex: reaction with a I2 solution in toluene gave (Am)MgI&#8901;(CAAC) (1) as the major product.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Orthogonal Stiffening of Hydrogel Networks with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 15, April 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's So Clearly Visible: Hydrogels can be formed by exclusively visible&#8208;light irradiation with two colours of light, with each colour allowing mechanical stiffening of the gel independent of the order in which each colour is applied. Driven by mild [2+2] cycloadditions with halochromic properties, the photoreactivity of the reactions in water can be controlled by a photoacid generator.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce the wavelength&#8208;orthogonal crosslinking of hydrogel networks using two red&#8208;shifted chromophores, i.e. acrylpyerene (AP, &#955;activation=410&#8211;490&#8197;nm) and styrylpyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazine (SPP, &#955;activation=400&#8211;550&#8197;nm), able to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition in the visible&#8208;light regime. The photoreactivity of the SPP moiety is pH&#8208;dependent, whereby an acidic environment inhibits the cycloaddition. By employing a spiropyran&#8208;based photoacid generator with suitable absorption wavelength, we are able to restrict the activation wavelength of the SPP moiety to the green light region (&#955;activation=520&#8211;550&#8197;nm), enabling wavelength&#8208;orthogonal activation of the AP group. Our wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photochemical system was successfully applied in the design of hydrogels whose stiffness can be tuned independently by either green or blue light.

         <title>Synthesis of Atropisomeric Two&#8208;Axis Systems by the Catalyst&#8208; Controlled syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;Selective Arene&#8208;Forming Aldol Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous control over the configuration of multiple stereocenters is accomplished by numerous catalytic methods, providing a reliable basis for the synthesis of stereochemically complex targets in isomerically defined form. In contrast, addressing the configurations of multiple stereogenic axes with diastereodivergent catalyst control is thus far only possible by stepwise approaches. Herein we now describe that all four stereoisomers of atropisomeric two&#8208;axis systems are directly tractable by assembling a central aromatic unit of teraryls through an arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation. By using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based ion&#8208;pairing catalysts, the four feasible reaction pathways are differentiated from identical substrates under defined basic conditions without preactivation, thus enabling complete stereodivergence with enantioselectivities of up to 99:1 e.r.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Construction of 1,4&#8208;diamines via Cascade Hydroamination of Methylene Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the widespread existence of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines in bioactive molecules and their applications in asymmetric catalysis, the catalytic and asymmetric synthesis of such structures from readily accessible substrates remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydroamination protocol to construct a wide range of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamine derivatives in high yields with excellent enatioselectivities (up to 95% yield and up to &#65310;99% ee). The use of two hydroxylamine esters containing different functionalized amino groups allowed us to increase the complexity of the final 1,4&#8208;diamine structures. The desired products could be easily transformed into chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines and chiral NH  2  &#8208;Terfenadine. Mechanistic study demonstrates that this reaction proceeds through hydroamination ring&#8208;opening and cascade hydroamination sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of [3]&#8208;Ladderanol through Late&#8208;Stage Organocatalytic Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ladderane phospholipids, with their unusual ladder&#8208;like arrangement of concatenated cyclobutane rings, represent an architecturally unique class of natural products. However, despite their fascinating structure and other necessary impetus, only a few synthetic studies of these molecules have been reported so far. We have now devised a concise total synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol, a component of ladderane phospholipids, using an organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing formal C(sp2)&#8210;H alkylation. Our synthetic strategy rests on the late&#8208;stage introduction of chirality, thus allowing facile access to both enantiomers of [3]&#8208;ladderanol as well as an analogue. This is the first time a desymmetrization strategy is applied to the synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol. The scope of this desymmetrizing C(sp2)&#8210;H alkylation of meso&#8208;cyclobutane&#8208;fused cyclohexenediones is also presented.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of reversible oligomer/polymers is fascinating both from the perspective of the fundamental understanding as well as their applications, ranging from biomedical to self&#8208;healing smart materials. On the other hand, the reactions that occur in single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) fashion offer great details of the structure, geometry and stereochemistry of the product. However, SCSC [2+2] oligomerization is rather difficult and rare. Further, till date there are no reports for a reversible [2+2] oligomerization in SCSC fashion. In this work, four halogen substituted acrylic dienone molecules were deliberately designed and their ability to participate in [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in solid state was studied under visible light. Despite of having the required alignment of double bonds of dienes in all four crystal structures, they found to exhibit variable reactivities given the differences in their weak intermolecular interactions such as halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen, halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions. Notably, one of these materials exhibits reversible oligomerization in SCSC manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Abstraction of Hydrogen Atoms from Water Using Hydroxylated Graphitc Carbon Nitride for Hydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Employing pure water, the ultimate green source of hydrogen donor to initiate chemical reactions that involve a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step is fascinating but challenging due to its large H&#8208;O bond dissociation energy (BDE  H&#8208;O  = 5.1 eV). Many approaches have been explored to stimulate water for hydrogenative reactions, but the efficiency and productivity still require significant enhancement. Here, we show that the surface hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride (gCN&#8208;OH) only requires 2.25 eV to activate H&#8208;O bonds in water, enabling abstraction of hydrogen atoms  via  dehydrogenation of pure water into hydrogen peroxide under visible light irradiation. The gCN&#8208;OH presents a stable catalytic performance for hydrogenative N&#8208;N coupling, pinacol&#8208;type coupling and dehalogenative C&#8208;C coupling, all with high yield and efficiency, even under solar radiation, featuring extensive impacts in using renewable energy for a cleaner process in dye, electronic, and pharmaceutical industries.</dc:description>

         <title>Under&#8208;5&#8208;Minute Immunoblot Assays by Vortex Fluidic Device Acceleration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlocking the potential of personalized medicine in point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings requires a new generation of biomarker and proteomic assays. Ideally, assays could inexpensively perform hundreds of quantitative protein measurements in parallel at the bedsides of patients. This goal greatly exceeds current capabilities. Furthermore, biomarker assays are often challenging to translate from benchtop to clinic due to difficulties achieving and assessing the necessary selectivity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. To address these challenges, we developed an efficient (&lt;5 min), robust (comparatively lower CVs), and inexpensive (decreasing reagent use and cost by &gt;70%) immunoassay method. Specifically, the immunoblot membrane is dotted with the sample and then developed in a vortex fluidic device (VFD) reactor. All assay steps &#8211; blocking, binding, and washing &#8211; leverage the unique thin&#8208;film microfluidics of the VFD. The approach can accelerate direct, indirect, and sandwich immunoblot assays. The applications demonstrated include assays relevant to both the laboratory and the clinic.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Cage Activation of Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite a renaissance in the activation of carborane cages in the past decades, oxidative cage functionalizations generally require stoichiometric amounts of toxic chemical oxidants. In contrast, electrochemical functionalizations enable resource&#8208;economical cage activation.







Abstract
Carboranes are boron&#8211;carbon molecular clusters that possess unique properties, such as their icosahedron geometry, high boron content, and delocalized three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity. These features render carboranes valuable building blocks for applications in supramolecular design, nanomaterials, optoelectronics, organometallic coordination chemistry, and as boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) agents. Despite tremendous progress in this field, stoichiometric chemical redox reagents are largely required for the oxidative activation of carborane cages. In this context, electrosyntheses represent an alternative strategy for more sustainable molecular syntheses. It is only in recent few years that considerable progress has been made in electrochemical cage functionalization of carboranes, which are summarized in this Minireview. We anticipate that electrocatalysis will serve as an increasingly powerful stimulus within the current renaissance of carborane electrochemistry.

         <title>High&#8208;Potential Cathodes with Nitrogen Active Centres for Quasi&#8208;Solid Proton&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly proposed 2,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene bis((ethylsulfonyl)amide) (HDC) can deliver a high working potential and stable cycle performance over 2000&#8197;cycles in a stainless&#8208;steel case based on a nitrogen active centre.







Abstract
Although proton&#8208;ion batteries have received considerable attention owing to their reliability, safety, toxin&#8208;free nature, and low cost, their development remains in the early stages because of lacking proper electrolytes and cathodes for facilitating a high output voltage and stable cycle performance. We present a novel cathode based on active nitrogen centre, which provides a flat discharge plateau at 1&#8197;V with a capacity of 115&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent stability. Moreover, a quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte was developed to overcome the issue of corrosion, broaden the potential window of the electrolyte, and prevent the active material from dissolving. While using the unique as&#8208;developed electrolyte, the newly designed cathode retained 89.67&#8201;% of its original capacity after 2000&#8197;cycles. Finally, we demonstrated the excellent cycle performance of the as&#8208;developed metal&#8208;free, flexible, soft&#8208;packed battery. Notably, even when a portion of the battery was cut off, it continued to function normally.

         <title>4&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Butyric Acid&#8208;Assisted In Situ Passivation Strategy for Superstable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite CsPbX3 Quantum Dots in Polar Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method to significantly improve the stability of the CsPbX3 (CPX) QDs via in situ crystallization with synergistic effects of BBA and OLA in polar solvent is proposed. The results not only provide a viable design strategy to synthesize all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CPX QDs with strong stability against the attack of polar solvents but also shed more light on their surface chemistry.







Abstract
A crucial challenge is to develop an in situ passivation treatment strategy for CsPbX3 (CPX, X=Cl, Br, and I) quantum dots (QDs) and simultaneously retain their luminous efficiency and wavelength. Here, a facile method to significantly improve the stability of the CPX QDs via in situ crystallization with the synergistic effect of 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;butyric acid (BBA) and oleylamine (OLA) in polar solvents including aqueous solution and a possible fundamental mechanism are proposed. Monodispersed CsPbBr3 (CPB) QDs obtained in water show high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 86.4&#8201;% and their PL features of CPB QDs have no significant change after being dispersed in aqueous solution for 96&#8197;h, which implies the structure of CPB QDs is unchanged. The results provide a viable design strategy to synthesize all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CPX QDs with strong stability against the attack of polar solvents and shed more light on their surface chemistry.

         <title>Organic Branched Heterostructures with Optical Interconnects for Photonic Barcodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of well&#8208;defined organic heterostructures toward active optoelectronic functions remains challenging. Optical interconnections based on organic branched heterostructures (OBHs) have been synthesized through a sequential self&#8208;assembly process. The accurate spatial organization has been applied to the generation of 2D barcodes.







Abstract
Optical interconnects exhibit superior potential in the precise regulation of photon transmission for organic photonic circuits. However, the rational design of well&#8208;defined organic heterostructures toward active optoelectronics remains challenging. Herein, we designed organic branched heterostructures (OBHs) with accurate spatial organization for optical interconnection. Notably, the precise regulation of OBHs has been controllably achieved including the trunk morphologies and the branched microwire number. Significantly, these as&#8208;prepared OBHs inherently exhibit the multichannel coupling outputs and the excitation position&#8208;dependent waveguide characteristics, leading to various outcoupling signals with tunable intensity and emission colors. The optical interconnects are realized due to the occurrence of exciton conversion and photon propagation between branch and trunk at the heterojunction, benefiting the application possibilities of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) optical barcodes.

         <title>Reducing Energy Disorder for Efficient and Stable Sn&#8208;Pb Alloyed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sn&#8208;Pb alloyed perovskites have drawn considerable attention because of their appropriate bandgap for both single&#8208;junction and multi&#8208;junction tandem photovoltaics, but the easy&#8208;formation of energy disorder still limits their practical applications. Here, we report that the combination of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;(methylsulfinyl) benzene (BBMS) and SnF  2  greatly reduced the Urbach energy of perovskite films, and largely restrained the oxidation of Sn  2+  . With the help of density functional theory calculations, we clarified the interactions between BBMS and perovskite was responsible for the improvements. As a result, a high efficiency of &gt; 22% was obtained for the Sn&#8208;Pb alloy&#8208;based solar cells treated by BBMS and SnF  2  . More importantly, the BBMS&#8208;treated device demonstrated outstanding stability, retaining 98% of its original efficiency after heating at 60 &#176;C for 2660 h under N  2  .</dc:description>

With the help of density functional theory calculations, we clarified the interactions between BBMS and perovskite was responsible for the improvements. As a result, a high efficiency of &amp;gt; 22% was obtained for the Sn-Pb alloy-based solar cells treated by BBMS and SnF  2  . More importantly, the BBMS-treated device demonstrated outstanding stability, retaining 98% of its original efficiency after heating at 60 &#176;C for 2660 h under N  2  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequencing of Uniform Multifunctional Oligoesters via Random Chain Cleavages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequence&#8208;defined polymers have been the object of many fascinating studies that focus on their implementation in both material and life science applications. In parallel, iterative synthetic methodologies have become more efficient, whereas the structure elucidation of these molecules is generally dependent on MS/MS analysis. Here, we report an alternative, simple strategy for the determination of the monomer order of uniform oligo(thioether ester)s. This approach, which relies on random cleavages of ester units within the macromolecular backbone  via  a basic treatment, enables the swift characterization of these macromolecules without the need for MS/MS. Consequently, this method can be used for decoding any information stored within the primary structure of oligoesters by means of ESI&#8208; or LC&#8208;MS. Finally, we speculate that a range of structurally diverse backbones could be susceptible towards this approach, which could promptly expand the library of chemically sequenceable macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Allylation of Azinium Ions with Allylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic allylations of pyridinium and quinolinium ions with allylboronates are reported. Transmetalation of the allylboronate with gold produces nucleophilic allylgold(I) species that add to the 4&#8208;position of the azinium ion with complete regioselectivity to give functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines and 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided mechanistic insight.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic allylations of pyridinium and quinolinium ions with various allyl pinacolboronates are reported. The reactions are completely selective with respect to the site of the azinium ion that is attacked, to give various functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines and 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines. Evidence suggests that the reactions proceed through nucleophilic allylgold(I) intermediates formed by transmetalation from allylboronates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided mechanistic insight.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric &#946;&#8208;Oxygen Elimination**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination is reported. The reaction design utilizes the symmetry of meso&#8208;ketene acetal substrates and proceeds in the presence of a chiral zirconocene catalyst. Furthermore, a regiodivergent &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination, the application in diol and amino alcohol synthesis, and a DFT&#8208;supported stereochemical analysis are presented.







Abstract
A catalytic enantioselective &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination reaction is reported in the form of a zirconium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric opening of meso&#8208;ketene acetals. Furthermore, a regiodivergent &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination is demonstrated. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, at low catalyst loadings, and produces chiral monoprotected cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols in good yield and enantiomeric excess. The combination with a Mitsunobu reaction or a one&#8208;pot hydroboration/Suzuki reaction sequence then gives access to additional diol and aminoalcohol building blocks. A stereochemical analysis supported by DFT calculations reveals that a high selectivity in the hydrozirconation step is also important for achieving high enantioselectivity, although it does not constitute the asymmetric step. This insight is crucial for the future development of related asymmetric &#946;&#8208;elimination reactions.

         <title>Digitizing Chemical Synthesis in 3D Printed Reactionware</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to the digitization of organic synthesis that combines reactions as building blocks with 3D printed reactor hardware or reactionware is presented. This practical approach allows the synthetic chemist to encode the unit operations allowing a digital blueprint to be built of the entire process.







Abstract
Chemistry digitization requires an unambiguous link between experiments and the code used to generate the experimental conditions and outcomes, yet this process is not standardized, limiting the portability of any chemical code. What is needed is a universal approach to aid this process using a well&#8208;defined standard that is composed of syntheses that are employed in modular hardware. Herein we present a new approach to the digitization of organic synthesis that combines process chemistry principles with 3D printed reactionware. This approach outlines the process for transforming unit operations into digitized hardware and well&#8208;defined instructions that ensure effective synthesis. To demonstrate this, we outline the process for digitizing 3 MIDA boronate building blocks, an ester hydrolysis, a Wittig olefination, a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction, and synthesis of the drug sulfanilamide.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of primary anilines via sustainable methods remains a challenge in organic synthesis.  We report  a photocatalytic protocol for the selective synthesis of primary anilines via cross&#8208;coupling of a wide range of aryl/heteroaryl bromides with sodium azide using a photocatalyst powder consisting of nickel(II) deposited on mesoporous carbon nitride (Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CN  x  )  . This heterogeneous photocatalyst contains a high surface area with a visible light&#8208;absorbing and adaptive &#8216;built&#8208;in&#8217; solid&#8208;state ligand for the integrated catalytic Ni site. The method displays a high functional group tolerance, requires mild reaction conditions, and benefits from easy recovery and reuse of the photocatalyst powder. Thereby, it overcomes  the need of complex ligand scaffolds required in homogeneous catalysis, precious metals and elevated temperatures/pressures in existing protocols  of primary anilines synthesis. The reported heterogeneous Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CN  x  holds potential for applications in the academic and industrial synthesis of anilines and exploration of other photocatalytic transformations.</dc:description>

The reported heterogeneous Ni-mpg-CN  x  holds potential for applications in the academic and industrial synthesis of anilines and exploration of other photocatalytic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustained Release of a Synthetic Autoinducing Peptide Mimetic Blocks Bacterial Communication and Virulence In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is significant interest in approaches to the treatment of bacterial infections that block virulence without creating selective pressures that lead to resistance. Here, we report the development of an &#8216;anti&#8208;virulence&#8217; strategy that exploits the activity of potent synthetic inhibitors of quorum sensing (QS) in  Staphylococcus aureus  . We identify peptide&#8208;based inhibitors of QS that are resistant to sequestration or degradation by components of murine tissue and demonstrate that encapsulation of a lead inhibitor in degradable polymer microparticles provides materials that substantially inhibit QS  in vitro.  Using a murine abscess model, we show that this inhibitor attenuates methicillin&#8208;resistant  S. aureus  (MRSA) skin infections  in vivo  , and that sustained release of the inhibitor from microparticles significantly improved outcomes compared to mice that received a single&#8208;dose bolus.  Our results present an effective and modular approach to controlling bacterial virulence  in vivo  and could advance the development of new strategies for skin infection control.</dc:description>

         <title>A Platform for Stop&#8208;Flow Gradient Generation to Investigate Chemotaxis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus microswimmers show positive and negative chemotaxis behavior in a microfluidic assay. A flow&#8208;based linear gradient is generated and the flow is stopped during the chemotaxis assay using a retroactive pressure loop.







Abstract
The ability of artificial microswimmers to respond to external stimuli and the mechanistical details of their origins belong to the most disputed challenges in interdisciplinary science. Therein, the creation of chemical gradients is technically challenging, because they quickly level out due to diffusion. Inspired by pivotal stopped flow experiments in chemical kinetics, we show that microfluidics gradient generation combined with a pressure feedback loop for precisely controlling the stop of the flows, can enable us to study mechanistical details of chemotaxis of artificial Janus micromotors, based on a catalytic reaction. We find that these copper Janus particles display a chemotactic motion along the concentration gradient in both, positive and negative direction and we demonstrate the mechanical reaction of the particles to unbalanced drag forces, explaining this behaviour.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Ion&#8208;Incorporated Mussel&#8208;Inspired Poly(Vinyl Alcohol)&#8208;Based Polymer Coating Offers Improved Antibacterial Activity and Cellular Mechanoresponse Manipulation</title>

         <dc:description>
A metal ion&#8208;triggered enhanced stiffness of poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based polymer coating incorporated with bioactive cobalt ions was designed. This surface coating platform not only exhibited durable and excellent antibacterial activity, but also manipulates cellular functions with enhanced mechanosensing that facilitates the cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation on the surface coating.







Abstract
Cobalt (CoII) ions have been an attractive candidate for the biomedical modification of orthopedic implants for decades. However, limited research has been performed into how immobilized CoII ions affect the physical properties of implant devices and how these changes regulate cellular behavior. In this study we modified biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol) with terpyridine and catechol groups (PVA&#8208;TP&#8208;CA) to create a stable surface coating in which bioactive metal ions could be anchored, endowing the coating with improved broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as enhanced surface stiffness and cellular mechanoresponse manipulation. Strengthened by the addition of these metal ions, the coating elicited enhanced mechanosensing from adjacent cells, facilitating cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation on the surface coating. This dual&#8208;functional PVA&#8208;TP&#8208;CA/Co surface coating offers a promising approach for improving clinical implantation outcomes.

         <title>In Situ Halogen&#8208;Ion Leaching Regulates Multiple Sites on Tandem Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interplay of dual components in tandem catalysts is uncovered and utilized during the electrochemical reconstruction for promoting CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products. Taking AgI&#8722;CuO as a conceptual tandem catalyst, in situ iodine ions leaching from AgI restrain the entire reduction of CuO to acquire stable active Cu0/Cu+ species, thus achieving a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 68.9&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tandem catalysts can divide the reaction into distinct steps by local multiple sites and thus are attractive to trigger CO2RR to C2+ products. However, the evolution of catalysts generally exists during CO2RR, thus a closer investigation of the reconstitution, interplay, and active origin of dual components in tandem catalysts is warranted. Here, taking AgI&#8722;CuO as a conceptual tandem catalyst, we uncovered the interaction of two phases during the electrochemical reconstruction. Multiple operando techniques unraveled that in situ iodine ions leaching from AgI restrained the entire reduction of CuO to acquire stable active Cu0/Cu+ species during the CO2RR. This way, the residual iodine species of the Ag matrix accelerated CO generation and iodine&#8208;induced Cu0/Cu+ promotes C&#8722;C coupling. This self&#8208;adaptive dual&#8208;optimization endowed our catalysts with an excellent C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 68.9&#8201;%. Material operando changes in this work offer a new approach for manipulating active species towards enhancing C2+ products.

         <title>Micromechanically&#8208;Powered Rolling Locomotion of a Twisted&#8208;Crystal Optical&#8208;Waveguide Cavity as a Mobile Light Polarization Rotor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted organic crystals display rolling locomotion on a flat substrate when subjected to mechanical force using an atomic force microscope cantilever tip. These crystals are flexible and efficiently self&#8208;guide the fluorescence both in straight and bent geometries and act as optical cavities. Remarkably, twisted&#8208;crystal waveguides rotate the guided polarized optical modes direction as a function of the crystal's rolling motion.







Abstract
We demonstrate mechanically&#8208;powered rolling locomotion of a twisted&#8208;microcrystal optical&#8208;waveguide cavity on the substrate, rotating the output signal's linear&#8208;polarization. Self&#8208;assembly of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;6&#8208;(((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenol produces naturally twisted microcrystals. The strain between several intergrowing, orientationally mismatched nanocrystalline fibres dictates the pitch lengths of the twisted crystals. The crystals are flexible, perpendicular to twisted (001) and (010) planes due to &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br, N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. The twisted crystals in their straight and bent geometries guide fluorescence along their body axes and display optical modes. Depending upon the degree of mechanical rolling locomotion, the crystal&#8208;waveguide cavity correspondingly rotates the output signal polarization. The presented twisted&#8208;crystal cavity with a combination of mechanical locomotion and photonic attributes unfolds a new dimension in mechanophotonics.

         <title>Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3]: A Heteroanionic Nonlinear Optical Material Containing Planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [CO3] and Heteroleptic [SnOSe3] Anionic Groups</title>

         <dc:description>
A heteroanionic nonlinear optical material, Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] has been synthesized. Its structure contains two different kinds of anionic groups: planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated [CO3] and heteroleptic [SnOSe3]. It exhibits promising properties including a large second harmonic generation (SHG) response (ca. 1&#215;AgGaS2), a wide band&#8208;gap (Eg) of 3.46&#8197;eV, a high laser damage threshold (LDT) of 240&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 as well as a wide transparent region.







Abstract
Inorganic heteroanionic materials are attracting increasing attention for exploring new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials because they could better satisfy the necessary but conflicting properties of NLO crystals, e.g. large SHG response and wide band&#8208;gap. Up to now, the reports on heteroanionic NLO materials have mainly focused on ultraviolet or visible oxide&#8208;based fluoroborates, fluorophosphates, borate&#8208;phosphates and borate&#8208;iodates. However, chalcogenides containing different kinds of anionic groups have barely been reported. Herein, we have synthesized the first oxychalcogenide&#8208;carbonate, Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] that contains two different kinds of anionic groups, [SnOSe3] and [CO3]. It crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group and exhibits fascinating NLO properties, including a large SHG response (&#8776;1&#215;AGS), sufficient birefringence (0.12 @1064&#8197;nm), wide band&#8208;gap (3.46&#8197;eV) and high laser damage threshold (240&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). These make Sr3[SnOSe3][CO3] a promising NLO crystal.

         <title>A Bacteria&#8208;Responsive Porphyrin for Adaptable Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>We report a cationic porphyrin 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TMPyP) that can respond to specific bacteria, followed by adaptable photodynamic/photothermal therapy processes. TMPyP could be reduced to phlorin by facultative anaerobes with a strong reducing ability such as  E. coli  and  S. typhimurium  in hypoxic environments, possessing strong NIR absorption and remarkable photothermal conversion capacity, thus demonstrating excellent antimicrobial activity (&gt; 99%) by photothermal therapy. While in an aerobic environment with aerobic bacteria, TMPyP functioned as a typical photosensitizer that killed bacteria effectively (&gt; 99.9%) by photodynamic therapy. By forming a host&#8208;guest complex with cucurbit[7]uril, the biocompatibility of TMPyP significantly improved. This kind of bacteria&#8208;responsive porphyrin shows specificity and adaptivity in antimicrobial treatment and holds potential in non&#8208;invasive treatments of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Amination of Benzene with Molecular Nitrogen Enabled by Plasma&#8208;Liquid Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen fixation is industrially realized by mass production of ammonia, the principal intermediate nitrogen source for N&#8208;containing organic molecules. Instead, direct C&#8208;N bond formation from dinitrogen (N  2  ) is of great interest but remains a grand challenge. Here, by virtue of unique plasma&#8208;liquid interactions, we developed an environmentally benign one&#8208;pot approach to directly coupling benzene and N  2  , two naturally abundant yet chemically inert molecules, into value&#8208;added arylamines. Under the optimal conditions, an amination yield of 45% was rapidly achieved, far better than the reported benzene amination efficiency using ammonia. A tentative reaction mechanism was proposed involving the long&#8208;lived N  2  (A  3  &#931;  u  +  )&#160;and N  2  +  species, as evidenced by the key intermediates detected. With a deeper mechanistic understanding and by further optimizing plasma reactor, it is promising to realize cost&#8208;effective electrical amination of benzene with N  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Strategy Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Ratiometric Emission to Differentiate Molecular Weight of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular weight has an important bearing on the properties of supramolecular polymers. However, the intuitive differentiation for the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers remains challenging. Given this situation, establishing a reliable relationship between fluorescence properties and molecular weight may be a promising strategy. Herein, we prepared a supramolecular monomer  M1  with aggregation&#8208;induced ratiometric emission characteristics. With the increasing  M1  concentration (0.100 &#8208; 100 mM), the average degree of polymerization (DP  DOSY  ) rose from 1.00 to 293. Meanwhile, the color changed from dark blue to cyan, finally to yellow&#8208;green in the same concentration range. Hence, the intuitive relationship between DP  DOSY  and fluorescence colors was constructed, allowing the visual differentiation of molecular weight. Moreover, the fluorescence color could be regulated by introducing competitive molecule to induce the depolymerization of supramolecular polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy for Kilogram&#8208;Scale Preparation of Highly Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scalable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of crystalline porous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) is essential to realize their broad industrial applications but remains a great challenge, which requires the fundamental understanding of the two&#8208;dimensional polymerization mechanism. Herein, we report a universal polyphosphoric acid (H  6  P  4  O  13  )&#8208;catalyzed nitrile trimerization route to synthesize a series of highly crystalline CTFs with high specific surface areas. This new strategy enables the cost&#8208;effective large&#8208;scale fabrication of crystalline CTFs at kilogram level for the first time. Through density functional theory calculation and detailed controlled experiments, we reveal that the polyphosphate acid show much higher catalytic activity for trimerization reaction than its analogues such as P  2  O  5  and H  3  PO  4  . Furthermore, the crystalline CTFs with regular porosity and abundant triazine groups exhibit ultrahigh removal efficiency of micropollutants, indicating its great potential in environment remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Dienyl and Allyl Esters from Propargyl Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent catalysis is a vital chemical tool that allows efficient access to large collections of structurally diverse molecules from a common precursor but remains a challenge. We reported a catalyst&#8208;controlled, tunable, and predictable regiodivergency in transforming the internal aliphatic propargyl esters into diverse libraries of highly substituted 1,3&#8208;dienyl and allyl products by Pd&#8208;catalysis. Depending on the ligand employed, palladium catalyst can involve two typical approaches: electrophilic palladium catalysis and sequential oxidation additive&#8208;reductive elimination pathway. This regiodivergent protocol endows facile access to four regioisomers with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity from the common propargyl esters. In terms of synthetic utility, a notable feature of this protocol is amenable to structural diversification of bioactive relevant molecules, enabling rapid assembly of many useful structural analogs of pharmaceutical candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure Changes of an Aromatic Amine Photoacid along the F&#246;rster Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacids show a strong increase in acidity in the first electronic excited state, enabling real&#8208;time studies of proton transfer in acid&#8208;base reactions, proton transport in energy storage devices and biomolecular sensor protein systems. Several explanations have been proposed for what determines photoacidity, ranging from variations in solvation free energy to changes in electronic structure occurring along the four stages of the F&#246;rster cycle. Here we use picosecond nitrogen K&#8208;edge spectroscopy to monitor the electronic structure changes of the proton donating group in a protonated aromatic amine photoacid in solution upon photoexcitation and subsequent proton transfer dynamics. Probing core&#8208;to&#8208;valence transitions locally at the amine functional group and with orbital specificity, we clearly reveal pronounced electronic structure, dipole moment and energetic changes on the conjugate photobase side. This result paves the way for a detailed electronic structural characterization of the photoacidity phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <title>Euglenatides, Potent Antiproliferative Cyclic Peptides Isolated from the Freshwater Photosynthetic Microalga Euglena gracilis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By limiting the nitrogen source to glutamic acid, we isolated cyclic peptides from  Euglena gracilis  containing asparagine and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids. Structure elucidation was accomplished through spectroscopic methods, mass spectrometry and chemical degradation. The euglenatides potently inhibit pathogenic fungi and cancer cell lines e.g., euglenatide B exhibiting IC  50  values of 4.3 mM in ketoconazole resistant  Aspergillus  fumigatus  and 0.29 mM in MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells. In an unprecedented convergence of non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase assembly&#8208;line biosynthesis between unicellular species and the metazoan kingdom, euglenatides bear resemblance to nemamides from  Caenorhabditis elegans  and inhibited both producing organisms  E. gracilis  and  C. elegans  . By molecular network analysis, we detected over forty euglenatide&#8208;like metabolites in  E. gracilis  ,  E. sanguinea  and  E. mutabilis  , suggesting an important biological role for these natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Decarbonylative Transfer Hydrochlorination of Alkenes and Alkynes Based on a B(C6F5)3&#8208;Initiated Grob Fragmentation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Readily available cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;ylcarbonyl chloride derivatives are introduced as bench&#8208;stable HCl surrogates for transfer hydrochlorination of terminal and internal alkenes as well as selected alkynes. The stepwise Grob fragmentation of those acyl chlorides into chloride, carbon monoxide, a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight arene, and a proton is promoted by B(C6F5)3. This decarbonylative transfer process enables the addition of HCl across C&#8211;C double and triple bonds with Markovnikov selectivity at room temperature.</dc:description>
