         <title>Photocatalytic upgrading of lignin oil to diesel precursor and hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Producing renewable biofuels from biomass is a promising way to meet future energy demand. Here, we demonstrated a lignin to diesel route via dimerization of the lignin oil followed by hydrodeoxygenation. The lignin oil undergoes C&#8722;C bond dehydrogenative coupling over Au/CdS photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, co&#8208;generating diesel precursors and hydrogen. The Au nanoparticles loaded on CdS can effectively restrain the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus improving the efficiency of the dimerization reaction. About 2.4 mmol g  catal  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  dimers and 1.6 mmol g  catal  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  H  2  were generated over Au/CdS, which is about 12 times and 6.5 times over CdS, respectively. The diesel precursors are finally converted into C16&#8208;C18 cycloalkanes or aromatics via hydrodeoxygenation reaction using Pd/C or porous CoMoS catalyst, respectively. The conversion of pine sawdust to diesel was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the lignin&#8208;to&#8208;diesel route.</dc:description>

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Highly Efficient Rare&#8208;Earth Element&#8208;Free Red/Green/Blue Solid&#8208;State Bandgap Fluorescent Carbon Quantum Rings for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare&#8208;earth element (REE)&#8208;based materials are commonly used in phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the negative impact of their use on the environment, human health, supply risks, and high cost prompts the need for REE&#8208;free materials. Here, we report the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of red/green/blue solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescent carbon quantum rings (R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQRs) with high quantum yields&#160;up to&#160;30&#8208;46%. This was achieved using cyano&#8208;group&#8208;bearing p&#8208;phenyldiacetonitrile and aldehyde&#8208;group&#8208;bearing terephthalaldehyde as precursors and forming carbon quantum rings of different diameters through the linkage of curved carbon quantum ribbons of different lengths. The results show the role of cyano groups in the curvature of carbon quantum ribbons for CQR formation and emission of stable solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescence. R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQR&#8208;phosphor&#8208;based LEDs emitted warm white light with low correlated color temperature (3576 K), high color rendering index (96.6), and high luminous efficiency (48.7 lm W  &#8208;1  ), comparable to REE&#8208;phosphor&#8208;based LEDs. This work facilitates the development of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost REE&#8208;free phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>Reply to a Comment on &#8220;The Nature of Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Type Tellurium&#8211;Nitrogen Interactions&#8221;</title>

Abstract
We reply to the comment by J.&#8208;M. Mewes, A. Hansen and S. Grimme (MHG), who challenged the accuracy of our re value for the N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te distance in (C6F5)Te(CH2)3NMe2 determined by gas electron diffraction (GED). We conclusively demonstrate that MHG&#8242;s quoted reference calculations are less accurate than they claim for solid state and gas phase. We show by higher level calculations, that we did not miss substantial contributions from open&#8208;chain conformers. Refinements on simulated scattering data show that such contributions would have had only an almost negligible effect on re(N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te). MHG suggested the use of a H0&#8208;tuned GFN method for calculating vibrational corrections ra&#8722;re, but this did not change these values substantially. Alternative amplitude calculations using higher level analytic harmonic and numeric cubic force fields (PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;TZVP) yield a GED value for re(N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te)=2.852(25)&#8197;&#197; that is well within the experimental error of our original value 2.918(31)&#8197;&#197; but far from the 2.67(8)&#8197;&#197; predicted by MHG. A now improved error estimation accounts for inaccuracies in the calculated auxiliary values. The gas/solid difference of the weak N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te interaction is in a realistic range compared to other systems involving weak chemical interactions.

Abstract
Mitzel and co&#8208;workers recently presented an intriguing molecule displaying a tellurium&#8211;nitrogen interaction. Structural data obtained in the solid and in gas phase indicated a large increase of the Te&#8211;N equilibrium distance re from 2.64 to 2.92&#8197;&#197;, respectively. Although some DFT calculations appear to support the large re in gas phase, we argue that the lions share of the increase is due to an incomplete description of finite&#8208;temperature effects in the back&#8208;corrected experimental data. This hypothesis is based on high&#8208;level coupled&#8208;cluster (CC) and periodic DFT calculations, which consistently point towards a much smaller re in the isolated molecule. Further support comes through MD simulations with a tuned GFN2&#8208;xTB Hamiltonian: Calibrated against a CC reference, these show a six&#8208;times larger influence of temperature than with the originally used GFN1&#8208;xTB. Taking this into account, the back&#8208;corrected re in gas phase becomes 2.67&#177;0.08&#8197;&#197;, in good agreement with high&#8208;level CC theory and most DFT methods.

         <title>Reduced Arene Complexes of Hafnium Supported by a Triamidoamine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reduced anthracene complex of hafnium(IV) reacts with two equivalents of benzonitrile to form the hafnium&#8208;bis(iminyl) as the kinetic product that expulses one equivalent of benzonitrile to give an imido complex.







Abstract
A series of hafnium complexes with a reduced arene of the general formula [K(L)][Hf(Xy&#8208;N3N)(arene)] (Xy&#8208;N3N={(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8722;, L=THF, 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; arene=C10H82&#8722;, C14H102&#8722;) mimic the chemistry of hafnium in its formal oxidation state +II. All compounds were obtained upon reduction of the chlorido complex [HfCl(Xy&#8208;N3N)(thf)] with two equivalents of potassium naphthalenide or anthracenide. The reducing nature and the basicity of the reduced anthracene ligand were explored in the reaction of benzonitrile and azobenzene, and by deprotonation of tert&#8208;butylacetylene, respectively. The reduction of benzonitrile provides an initial double nitrile insertion product under kinetic control that rearranges after extrusion of one of the inserted nitriles to a hafnium imido complex as the thermodynamic product. The reduction of azobenzene resulted in a diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex. Treatment of terminal alkynes with the anthracene or diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex led to the selective protonation of the corresponding dianionic ligand.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) mimic the chemistry of hafnium in its formal oxidation state +II. All compounds were obtained upon reduction of the chlorido complex [HfCl(Xy&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N)(thf)] with two equivalents of potassium naphthalenide or anthracenide. The reducing nature and the basicity of the reduced anthracene ligand were explored in the reaction of benzonitrile and azobenzene, and by deprotonation of tert&#8208;butylacetylene, respectively. The reduction of benzonitrile provides an initial double nitrile insertion product under kinetic control that rearranges after extrusion of one of the inserted nitriles to a hafnium imido complex as the thermodynamic product. The reduction of azobenzene resulted in a diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex. Treatment of terminal alkynes with the anthracene or diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex led to the selective protonation of the corresponding dianionic ligand.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams from &#945;&#8208;ketoacylsilanes and imines is reported, which proceeds via a [2+2] photochemical cycloaddition with in situ generation of siloxyketene. This reaction proceeds in an atom&#8208;economic fashion with broad substrate scope, including aldimines, ketimines, hydrazones, and fused nitrogen heterocycles, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance, affording a variety of &#946;&#8208;lactams with satisfactory diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams from &#945;&#8208;ketoacylsilanes and imines, which proceeds via a formal [2+2] photochemical cycloaddition with in situ generation of siloxyketene. This mild and operationally simple reaction proceeds in an atom&#8208;economic fashion with broad substrate scope, including aldimines, ketimines, hydrazones, and fused nitrogen heterocycles, affording a variety of important &#946;&#8208;lactams with satisfactory diastereoselectivities in most cases. This reaction also features good functional&#8208;group tolerance, facile scalability and product diversification. Experimental and computational studies suggest that &#945;&#8208;ketoacylsilanes can serve as photochemical precursors by engaging in a 1,3 silicon shift to the distal carbonyl group.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Pairing Approach to Stereoselective Metal&#8208;Free Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization is achieved by non&#8208;covalent interactions, such as ion&#8208;pairing, initiator sterics and solvation effects, in a metal&#8208;free condition.







Abstract
Stereochemistry can have a profound impact on polymer and materials properties. Unfortunately, straightforward methods for realizing high levels of stereocontrolled polymerizations are often challenging to achieve. In a departure from traditional metal&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), we discovered a remarkably simple method for controlling alkene stereochemistry in photoredox mediated metal&#8208;free ROMP. Ion&#8208;pairing, initiator sterics, and solvation effects each had profound impact on the stereochemistry of polynorbornene (PNB). Simple modifications to the reaction conditions produced PNB with trans alkene content of 25 to &gt;98&#8201;%. High cis content was obtained from relatively larger counterions, toluene as solvent, low temperatures (&#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C), and initiators with low Charton values. Conversely, smaller counterions, dichloromethane as solvent, and enol ethers with higher Charton values enabled production of PNB with high trans content. Data from a combined experimental and computational investigation are consistent with the stereocontrolling step of the radical cationic mechanism proceeding under thermodynamic control.

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Triggered Intracellular Carbon Monoxide Release Enables Selective Eradication of MRSA Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free CO&#8208;releasing micelles can be selectively taken up by Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, exerting a narrow&#8208;spectrum bactericidal activity toward only Gram&#8208;positive bacteria under red light irradiation. The CO&#8208;releasing micelles synergistically eradicate MRSA pathogens and accelerate MRSA&#8208;infected wound healing.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important gaseous signaling molecule. The use of CO&#8208;releasing molecules such as metal carbonyls enables the elucidation of the pleiotropic functions of CO. Although metal carbonyls show a broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity, it remains unclear whether the bactericidal property originates from the transition metals or the released CO. Here, we develop nonmetallic CO&#8208;releasing micelles via a photooxygenation mechanism of 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone derivatives, enabling CO release under red light irradiation (e.g., 650&#8197;nm). Unlike metal carbonyls that non&#8208;specifically internalize into both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, the nonmetallic micelles are selectively taken up by S. aureus instead of E. coli cells, exerting a selective bactericidal effect. Further, we demonstrate that the CO&#8208;releasing micelles can cure methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA)&#8208;infected wounds, simultaneously eradicating MRSA pathogens and accelerating wound healing.

         <title>Tuneable Control of Organocatalytic Activity through Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding an organocatalyst inside a cucurbituril molecular host can reversibly up&#8208; or downregulate catalytic activity, which is demonstrated in temporal control over the rate of a range of organocatalyzed transformations.







Abstract
Dynamic regulation of chemical reactivity is important in many complex chemical reaction networks, such as cascade reactions and signal transduction processes. Signal responsive catalysts could play a crucial role in regulating these reaction pathways. Recently, supramolecular encapsulation was reported to regulate the activities of artificial catalysts. We present a host&#8208;guest chemistry strategy to modulate the activity of commercially available synthetic organocatalysts. The molecular container cucurbit[7]uril was successfully applied to change the activity of four different organocatalysts and one initiator, enabling up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulation of the reaction rates of four different classes of chemical reactions. In most cases CB[7] encapsulation results in catalyst inhibition, however in one case catalyst activation by binding to CB[7] was observed. The mechanism behind this unexpected behavior was explored by NMR binding studies and pKa measurements. The catalytic activity can be instantaneously switched during operation, by addition of either supramolecular host or competitive binding molecules, and the reaction rate can be predicted with a kinetic model. Overall, this signal responsive system proves a promising tool to control catalytic activity.

         <title>Atomic Sulfur Filling Oxygen Vacancies Optimizes H Absorption and Boosts the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;atom doping of inverse spinel NiFe2O4 results in the occupation of the oxygen vacancies. S sites in the S&#8208;NiFe2O4 likely adsorb H adatoms and form S&#8208;H* in situ, which boosts the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that the lowered energy barrier for H2O dissociation induced by S doping is the key reason for the remarkable HER performance.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) usually has sluggish kinetics in alkaline solution due to the difficulty in forming binding protons. Herein we report an electrocatalyst in which sulfur atoms are doping in the oxygen vacancies (VO) of inverse spinel NiFe2O4 (S&#8208;NiFe2O4) to create active sites with enhanced electron transfer capability. This electrocatalyst has an ultralow overpotential of 61&#8197;mV at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability of 60&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;Acm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8197;M KOH media. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that S sites adsorb hydrogen adatom (H*) and in situ form S&#8208;H*, which favor the production of hydrogen and boosts HER in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that S introduction lowered the energy barrier of H2O dissociation. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed S atoms are active sites of the S&#8208;NiFe2O4.

&lt;p&gt;Sulfur&#8208;atom doping of inverse spinel NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; results in the occupation of the oxygen vacancies. S sites in the S&#8208;NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; likely adsorb H adatoms and form S&#8208;H* in situ, which boosts the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that the lowered energy barrier for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation induced by S doping is the key reason for the remarkable HER performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) usually has sluggish kinetics in alkaline solution due to the difficulty in forming binding protons. Herein we report an electrocatalyst in which sulfur atoms are doping in the oxygen vacancies (V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;) of inverse spinel NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (S&#8208;NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to create active sites with enhanced electron transfer capability. This electrocatalyst has an ultralow overpotential of 61&#8197;mV at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and long&#8208;term stability of 60&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;Acm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1.0&#8197;M KOH media. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that S sites adsorb hydrogen adatom (H*) and in situ form S&#8208;H*, which favor the production of hydrogen and boosts HER in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that S introduction lowered the energy barrier of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed S atoms are active sites of the S&#8208;NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Effect of the Ligand Backbone on the Reactivity and Mechanistic Paradigm of Non&#8208;Heme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo during Olefin Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steric and electronic effects exerted by the bulky quinoline&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand (2PyN2Q) in the non&#8208;heme complex [FeIV(2PyN2Q)(O)]2+ play a key role in olefin epoxidation by oxygen atom transfer and trigger mechanistic diversification. In the present study, the mechanism of olefin epoxidation was thoroughly investigated and rationalized with a detailed computational study.







Abstract
The oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactivity of the non&#8208;heme [FeIV(2PyN2Q)(O)]2+ (2) containing the sterically bulky quinoline&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand (2PyN2Q) has been thoroughly studied with different olefins. The ferryl&#8208;oxo complex 2 shows excellent OAT reactivity during epoxidations. The steric encumbrance and electronic effect of the ligand influence the mechanistic shuttle between OAT pathway I and isomerization pathway II (during the reaction stereo pure olefins), resulting in a mixture of cis&#8208;trans epoxide products. In contrast, the sterically less hindered and electronically different [FeIV(N4Py)(O)]2+ (1) provides only cis&#8208;stilbene epoxide. A Hammett study suggests the role of dominant inductive electronic along with minor resonance effect during electron transfer from olefin to 2 in the rate&#8208;limiting step. Additionally, a computational study supports the involvement of stepwise pathways during olefin epoxidation. The ferryl bend due to the bulkier ligand incorporation leads to destabilization of both 
 and 
 orbitals, leading to a very small quintet&#8211;triplet gap and enhanced reactivity for 2 compared to 1. Thus, the present study unveils the role of steric and electronic effects of the ligand towards mechanistic modification during olefin epoxidation

         <title>LiZn(OH)CO3: A Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Hydroxycarbonate Designed from a Diamond&#8208;like Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first DUV NLO hydroxycarbonate LiZn(OH)CO3 was obtained by structural design. LiZn(OH)CO3 exhibits a large SHG response, a wide band gap and a large birefringence, achieving the shortest phase&#8208;matching wavelength among all reported NLO carbonates.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are vital to the development of science and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies, but the exploration of these important optoelectronic materials is hindered by the contradiction between NLO effect and energy band gap as well as the sensitivity of DUV phase&#8208;matching to optical birefringence. Here, in order to achieve a well balanced DUV NLO performance, we chose the diamond&#8208;like structure as the prototype template for the material design and synthesized the first DUV NLO hydroxycarbonate crystal, LiZn(OH)CO3. This compound simultaneously has a wide band gap (&gt;6.53&#8197;eV), a strong second harmonic generation response (ca. 3.2&#215;KDP), and a large birefringence (0.147 at 1064&#8197;nm) with the shortest DUV phase&#8208;matching capability (&#955;PM&lt;190&#8197;nm) among all reported NLO carbonates. Moreover, the structure&#8211;property relationships in LiZn(OH)CO3 are analyzed by first&#8208;principles calculations. This work presents an effective design strategy to push the NLO performance of hydroxycarbonates into the DUV region.

         <title>Mechanochemical Release of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes from Flex&#8208;Activated Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of flex&#8208;activated mechanophore, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8211;carbodiimide adduct (NHC&#8208;CDI), was developed as a platform to release different NHCs under mechanical load. The polymeric materials containing NHC&#8208;CDI can be subjected to multiple compression cycles and successively release NHCs, which have potential to be utilized as self&#8208;healing, self&#8208;strengthening and self&#8208;reporting materials.







Abstract
We have discovered a new flex&#8208;activated mechanophore that releases an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) under mechanical load. The mechanophore design is based upon NHC&#8208;carbodiimide (NHC&#8208;CDI) adducts and demonstrates an important first step toward flex&#8208;activated designs capable of further downstream reactivities. Since the flex&#8208;activation is non&#8208;destructive to the main polymer chains, the material can be subjected to multiple compression cycles to achieve iterative increases in the activation percentage of mechanophores. Two different NHC structures were demonstrated, signifying the potential modularity of the mechanophore design.

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Pentagon&#8208; and Heptagon&#8208;Embedded Nanographene Containing a Central Pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;milligram&#8208;scale synthesis of the first example of a bowl&#8208;shaped nanographene with a pyrrolo&#8208;pyrrole core has been achieved via sequential, programmed, intramolecular direct arylations. This curved molecule possesses an inverse Stone&#8211;Thrower&#8211;Wales topology (a combination of fused pentagons and heptagons), small bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl inversion barrier, high&#8208;lying HOMO, weak red&#8208;emission at 615&#8197;nm, and a small dipole moment.







Abstract
A bowl&#8208;shaped nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographene composed of a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core substituted with six arene rings circularly bonded with one another has been prepared via a concise synthetic strategy encompassing the multicomponent tetraarylpyrrolopyrrole (TAPP) synthesis, the Scholl reaction, and intramolecular direct arylation. This synthesis represents the first case of programmed sequential intramolecular direct arylation reactions utilizing the different reactivity of C&#8211;Br and C&#8211;Cl bonds. The target compound contains two central pentagons confined between two adjacent heptagons&#8212;the inverse Stone&#8211;Thrower&#8211;Wales topology. The presence of both five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings in the final structure is responsible for interesting properties such as a perpendicularly aligned dipole moment, absorption and fluorescence in the orange&#8208;red region, weak emission originating from the charge&#8208;transfer character of a low&#8208;energy absorption band, and a high lying HOMO. In the solid state slipped convex&#8208;to&#8208;convex &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking dominates.

         <title>Catalytic Oxygenation of Hydrocarbons by Mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo Dicopper(II) Species Resulting from O&#8722;O Cleavage of Tetranuclear CuI/CuII Peroxo Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV/Vis and rRaman spectroscopies complemented by XAS and UHR&#8208;ESI mass spectrometry are employed to monitor the binding of O2 in a tetranuclear copper cluster, followed by homolytic O&#8722;O bond cleavage. The resulting mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo dicopper(II) complexes catalytically oxygenate a variety of hydrocarbons, establishing an unprecedented, 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economic scenario for the monooxygenation of organic substrates from gaseous O2.







Abstract
One of the challenges of catalysis is the transformation of inert C&#8722;H bonds to useful products. Copper&#8208;containing monooxygenases play an important role in this regard. Here we show that low&#8208;temperature oxygenation of dinuclear copper(I) complexes leads to unusual tetranuclear, mixed&#8208;valent &#956;4&#8208;peroxo [CuI/CuII]2 complexes. These Cu4O2 intermediates promote irreversible and thermally activated O&#8722;O bond homolysis, generating Cu2O complexes that catalyze strongly exergonic H&#8208;atom abstraction from hydrocarbons, coupled to O&#8208;transfer. The Cu2O species can also be produced with N2O, demonstrating their capability for small&#8208;molecule activation. The binding and cleavage of O2 leading to the primary Cu4O2 intermediate and the Cu2O complexes, respectively, is elucidated with a range of solution spectroscopic methods and mass spectrometry. The unique reactivities of these species establish an unprecedented, 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economic scenario for the catalytic, copper&#8208;mediated monooxygenation of organic substrates, employing both O&#8208;atoms of O2.

         <title>A Nature&#8208;Inspired MOFs Discriminator for Differential Diagnosis of Cancer Cell Subtypes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic glycan labeling (MGL) followed by bioorthogonal chemistry provides a powerful tool for tumor imaging and therapy. However, selectively metabolic labeling of cell or tissue of interest remains a challenge. Particularly, owing to tumor heterogeneity including tumor subtypes and inter&#8208;patient heterogeneity, it is far more difficult to realize tumor cell&#8208;selective metabolic labeling for precise diagnosis. Inspired by nature, herein, Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;azidosugar camouflaged with cancer cell membranes is designed to accomplish cancer cell&#8208;selective MGL  in vivo  . With abundant receptors, this biomimetic platform not only selectively targets homotypic cells but also realizes different breast cancer subtype&#8208;selective MGL. Moreover, the endo/lysosomal&#8208;escaped ZIF&#8208;8 can make azidosugar escape from lysosomes and accelerate its metabolic incorporation. This strategy also takes advantages of cancer tissue&#8208;derived cell membranes, which may have huge potential for personalized diagnosis and therapy. We believe this biommetic strategy open a new avenue for precise diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformation pathway from CdSe magic&#8208;size clusters with absorption doublets at 373/393 nm to clusters at 434/460 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divergent interpretations have appeared in the literature regarding the structural nature and evolutionary behavior for photoluminescent CdSe nano&#8208;species with sharp doublets in optical absorption. Here, we report a comprehensive description of the transformation pathway from one CdSe nano&#8208;species displaying an absorption doublet at 373/393 nm to another species with a doublet at 433/460 nm. These two nano&#8208;species are shown to be as zero&#8208;dimension (0D) magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) with 3D quantum confinement, and are labelled dMSC&#8208;393 and dMSC&#8208;460, respectively. Synchrotron&#8208;based small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) returns a radius of gyration of 0.92 nm for dMSC&#8208;393 and 1.14 nm for dMSC&#8208;460,  and indicates that both types are disc&#8208;shaped with the exponent of the SAXS form factor equal to 2.1.  The MSCs develop from their unique counterpart precursor compounds (PCs), which are labelled PC&#8208;393 and PC&#8208;460, respectively. For the dMSC&#8208;393 to dMSC&#8208;460 transformation, the proposed PC&#8208;enabled pathway is comprised of three key steps, dMSC&#8208;393 to PC&#8208;393 (Step 1), PC&#8208;393 to PC&#8208;460 (Step 2 involving monomer addition), and PC&#8208;460 to dMSC&#8208;460 (Step 3). The present study provides a framework for understanding the PC&#8208;based evolution of MSCs and how PCs enable transformations between MSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Separation and Purification of Hydrocarbons with Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on the developments of adsorbents for the separation and purification of hydrocarbons from, for example, methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, and propene/propane mixtures as well as for the separation of C8 aromatics (i.e. xylene isomers).







Abstract
This Minireview focuses on the developments of the adsorptive separation of methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, propene/propane mixtures as well as on the separation of C8 aromatics (i.e. xylene isomers) with a wide variety of materials, including carbonaceous materials, zeolites, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and porous organic frameworks. Some recent important developments for these adsorptive separations are also highlighted. The advantages and disadvantages of each material category are discussed and guidelines for the design of improved materials are proposed. Furthermore, challenges and future developments of each material type and separation processes are discussed.

Hepatitis&#8197;B virus (HBV) poses a severe threat to public health and social development. Here, we synthesized 4&#177;0.5&#8197;nm copper (I) sulfide (Cu2S) nanoparticles (NPs) with 46 mdeg chiroptical property at 530&#8197;nm to selectively cleavage HBV core antigen (HBcAg) and effectively blocked HBV assembly and prevented HBV infection both in vitro and in vivo under light at 808&#8197;nm.

Experimental analysis showed that the chiral Cu2S NPs specific bound with the functional domain from phenylalanine23 (F23) to leucine30 (L30) from HBcAg primary sequence and the cutting site was between amino acid residues F24 and proline25 (P25). Under excitation at 808&#8197;nm, the intracellular HBcAg concentration was reduced by 95&#8201;%, and in HBV transgenic mice, the levels of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA were decreased by 93&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%, respectively. Together, these results reveal the potential nanomedicine for HBV control and provide fresh tools for viral infection.

         <title>Efficient (&gt;20&#8201;%) and Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Cesium Lead Triiodide Solar Cell Enabled by Thiocyanate Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new urea&#8208;ammonium thiocyanate (UAT) molten salt was introduced as the additive in all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead triiodide solar cell, which modification strategy to fully release and exploit coordination activities of SCN&#8722; to deposit high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 film. Thus, the UAT&#8208;based devices can provide an encouraging PCE up to 20.08&#8201;% with excellent operational stability of over 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
Besides widely used surface passivation, engineering the film crystallization is an important and more fundamental route to improve the performance of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells. Herein, we have developed a urea&#8208;ammonium thiocyanate (UAT) molten salt modification strategy to fully release and exploit coordination activities of SCN&#8722; to deposit high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 film for efficient and stable all&#8208;inorganic solar cells. The UAT is derived by the hydrogen bond interactions between urea and NH4+ from NH4SCN. With the UAT, the crystal quality of the CsPbI3 film has been significantly improved and a long single&#8208;exponential charge recombination lifetime of over 30&#8197;ns has been achieved. With these benefits, the cell efficiency has been promoted to over 20&#8201;% (steady&#8208;state efficiency of 19.2&#8201;%) with excellent operational stability over 1000&#8197;h. These results demonstrate a promising development route of the CsPbI3 related photoelectric devices.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoroalkylation of Arylborates with Sulfone Reagents: Beyond the Limitation of Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of low&#8208;valent iron to the nitrogen atom of N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones can overcome the reduction potential limitation in intermolecular electron&#8208;transfer processes, thus enabling sulfones with low reduction potentials to efficiently participate in radical cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
The iron&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8211;aryl coupling reaction between sulfones and arylboron compounds has remained a challenge. We report the first iron&#8208;catalyzed radical difluoroalkylation of arylborates with N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones. The coordination between the iron catalyst and the nitrogen atom of N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones was identified to be important in overcoming the reduction potential limitation of sulfones in the intermolecular single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process, which enables both fluoroalkyl N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones (with relatively high reduction potentials) and nonfluorinated alkyl N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones (with low reduction potentials) to serve as powerful alkylation reagents.

         <title>Chemical Evolution of Antivirals Against Enterovirus D68 through Protein&#8208;Templated Knoevenagel Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;organized virus killing: Antivirals are generated through aldol condensations catalyzed by the 3C protease of enterovirus D68 and inhibit viral proliferation in infected human cells. Best inhibitors are slow and sticky. The process demonstrates a potentially native mechanism for the evolution of functional bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The generation of bioactive molecules from inactive precursors is a crucial step in the chemical evolution of life, however, mechanistic insights into this aspect of abiogenesis are scarce. Here, we investigate the protein&#8208;catalyzed formation of antivirals by the 3C&#8208;protease of enterovirus D68. The enzyme induces aldol condensations yielding inhibitors with antiviral activity in cells. Kinetic and thermodynamic analyses reveal that the bioactivity emerges from a dynamic reaction system including inhibitor formation, alkylation of the protein target by the inhibitors, and competitive addition of non&#8208;protein nucleophiles to the inhibitors. The most active antivirals are slowly reversible inhibitors with elongated target residence times. The study reveals first examples for the chemical evolution of bio&#8208;actives through protein&#8208;catalyzed, non&#8208;enzymatic C&#8722;C couplings. The discovered mechanism works under physiological conditions and might constitute a native process of drug development.

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Binding Molecular Photothermal Agent for Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protein&#8208;binding molecular photothermal agent was developed for photothermal therapy. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the heat generated by the photothermal agent directly destroyed the intracellular bioactive proteins and induced apoptosis under low power density laser irradiation. The therapeutic effect can be efficiently improved with the protein&#8208;binding strategy.







Abstract
Photothermal therapy usually requires a high power density to activate photothermal agent for effective treatment, which inevitably leads to damage to normal tissues and inflammation in tumor tissues. Herein, we rationally design a protein&#8208;binding strategy to build a molecular photothermal agent for photothermal ablation of tumor. The synthesized photothermal agent can covalently bind to the thiol groups on the intracellular proteins. The heat generated by the photothermal agent directly destroyed the bioactive proteins in the cells, effectively reducing the heat loss and the molecular leakage. Under a low power density of 0.2&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the temperature produced by the photothermal agent was sufficient to induce apoptosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the therapeutic effect of photothermal therapy can be efficiently improved with the protein&#8208;binding strategy.

         <title>Orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller Isomerism in the Dark&#8208;Stable State of Nature's Water Oxidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dark&#8208;stable resting state of the biological oxygen&#8208;evolving complex is shown to accommodate a rare type of functionally important MnIII orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller isomerism that is identified as the electronic origin of subsequent valence isomerism in the catalytic cycle of water oxidation.







Abstract
The tetramanganese&#8211;calcium cluster of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of photosystem II adopts electronically and magnetically distinct but interconvertible valence isomeric forms in its first light&#8208;driven oxidized catalytic state, S2. This bistability is implicated in gating the final catalytic states preceding O&#8722;O bond formation, but it is unknown how the biological system enables its emergence and controls its effect. Here we show that the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the resting (dark&#8208;stable) S1 state adopts orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller isomeric forms arising from a directional change in electronic configuration of the &#8220;dangler&#8221; MnIII ion. The isomers are consistent with available structural data and explain previously unresolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic observations on the S1 state. This unique isomerism in the resting state is shown to be the electronic origin of valence isomerism in the S2 state, establishing a functional role of orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller isomerism unprecedented in biological or artificial catalysis.

         <title>The Unusual Homodimer of a Heme&#8208;Copper Terminal Oxidase Allows Itself to Utilize Two Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3.4&#8197;&#197; structure of cytochrome c oxidase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (AaCcO) has been solved. The molecular mechanism that AaCcO uses involves both cytochrome c and quinol as electron donors through the native quinol molecules (NQs) bound at the dimeric interface.







Abstract
The heme&#8208;copper oxidase superfamily comprises cytochrome c and ubiquinol oxidases. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of electrons from different electron donors onto molecular oxygen. A B&#8208;family cytochrome c oxidase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus was discovered previously to be able to use both cytochrome c and naphthoquinol as electron donors. Its molecular mechanism as well as the evolutionary significance are yet unknown. Here we solved its 3.4&#8197;&#197; resolution electron cryo&#8208;microscopic structure and discovered a novel dimeric structure mediated by subunit I (CoxA2) that would be essential for naphthoquinol binding and oxidation. The unique structural features in both proton and oxygen pathways suggest an evolutionary adaptation of this oxidase to its hyperthermophilic environment. Our results add a new conceptual understanding of structural variation of cytochrome c oxidases in different species.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Ketones from Methyl Esters by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl esters are shown to participate in intermolecular Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Due to the mild nature of organoboron reagents, the product ketones are inert to the reaction conditions, avoiding over reactivity issues prominent with more aggressive organometallic nucleophiles.







Abstract
The direct conversion of alkyl esters to ketones has been hindered by the sluggish reactivity of the starting materials and the susceptibility of the product towards subsequent nucleophilic attack. We have now achieved a cross&#8208;coupling approach to this transformation using nickel, a bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, and alkyl organoboron coupling partners. 65 alkyl ketones bearing diverse functional groups and heterocyclic scaffolds have been synthesized with this method. Catalyst&#8208;controlled chemoselectivity is observed for C(acyl)&#8722;O bond activation of multi&#8208;functional substrates bearing other bonds prone to cleavage by Ni, including aryl ether, aryl fluoride, and N&#8208;Ph amide functional groups. Density functional theory calculations provide mechanistic support for a Ni0/NiII catalytic cycle and demonstrate how stabilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions between the bulky catalyst and substrate are critical for the reaction's success.

         <title>Bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;Nanotube with Tunable Helicity and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the fabrication of an exotic bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube via the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of a dipeptide&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide gelator with tunable helicity and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). It was found that in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) the gelator molecule self&#8208;assembled into a bamboo&#8208;like nanotube, which is composed of truncated nanocones and CPL active. When defining the diameter ratio of the lower to upper edge of each nanocone as a parameter to express the helicity of different nanotubes, it was found that both the helicity and CPL of these nanotubes can be adjusted by the amount of TFA. Moreover, the helicity of the nanotube can be conveyed to the achiral quantum dots (QDs) and produce a hybrid nanotube/QDs CPL active materials with adjustable dissymmetry factor. This work finds a new type self&#8208;assembled bamboo&#8208;like nanotube and unveiled their helicity and CPL control.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Complex Lipids for Fluid&#8211;Fluid Phase Separation in Coassembled Phospholipid Membranes</title>

Coassembly of metal complex lipids with DMPC demonstrates a very rare fluid&#8211;fluid phase separation up to 37&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
We demonstrate a fluid&#8211;fluid phase separation in 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (DMPC) membranes using a metal complex lipid of type [Mn(L1)] (1; HL1=1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxybenzamide)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;formyl&#8208;5&#8208;hexadecyloxybenzylideneamino)ethane). Small amount of 1 produces two separated domains in DMPC, whose phase transition temperatures of lipids (Tc) are both lower than that of the pristine DMPC. Variable temperature fluorescent microscopy for giant&#8208;unilamellar vesicles of DMPC/1 hybrids demonstrates that visible phase separations remain in fluid phases up to 37&#8201;&#176;C, which is clearly over the Tc of DMPC. This provides a new dimension for the application of metal complex lipids toward controlling lipid distributions in fluid membranes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Emitting Metal&#8211;Organic Halide 1D and 2D Structures: Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Efficiency, Low&#8208;Loss Optical Waveguide and Highly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides of (DTA)2SbCl5&#8901;DTAC (DTAC=dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) with near unity photoluminescence quantum yields are reported. Tuning of the organic groups associated with these hybrid materials brought about changes to their 1D and 2D morphology. The anisotropic structures demonstrated polarized emission and may be applied as low&#8208;loss waveguides.







Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic metal&#8208;halide materials (OIMMs) with zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structures offer useful optical properties with a wide range of applications. However, successful examples of 0D structural OIMMs with well&#8208;defined optical performance at the micro&#8208;/nanometer scale are limited. We prepared one&#8208;dimensional (1D) (DTA)2SbCl5&#8901;DTAC (DTAC=dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) single&#8208;crystal microrods and 2D microplates with a 0D structure in which individual (SbCl5)2&#8722; quadrangular units are completely isolated and surrounded by the organic cation DTA+. The organic molecular unit with a long alkyl chain (C12) and three methyl groups enables microrod and &#8208;plate formation. The single&#8208;crystal microrods/&#8208;plates exhibit a broadband orange emission peak at 610&#8197;nm with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of ca. 90&#8201;% and a large Stokes shift of 260&#8197;nm under photoexcitation. The broad emission originates from self&#8208;trapping excitons. Spatially resolved PL spectra confirm that these microrods exhibit an optical waveguide effect with a low loss coefficient (0.0019&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1) during propagation, and linear polarized photoemission with a polarization contrast (0.57).

         <title>A Supported Pd2 Dual&#8208;Atom Site Catalyst for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supported Pd2 dual&#8208;atom site catalyst (DAC) was synthesized and used for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). It exhibited superior CO2RR catalytic performance with 98.2&#8201;% CO faradic efficiency at &#8722;0.85&#8197;V vs. RHE, far exceeding that of Pd1 SAC, and coupled with long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DACs) have emerged as a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis because the synergistic effect between adjacent metal atoms can promote their catalytic activity while maintaining the advantages of single&#8208;atom site catalysts (SACs), like 100&#8201;% atomic utilization efficiency and excellent selectivity. Herein, a supported Pd2 DAC was synthesized and used for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for the first time. The as&#8208;obtained Pd2 DAC exhibited superior CO2RR catalytic performance with 98.2&#8201;% CO faradic efficiency at &#8722;0.85&#8197;V vs. RHE, far exceeding that of Pd1 SAC, and coupled with long&#8208;term stability. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the intrinsic reason for the superior activity of Pd2 DAC toward CO2RR was the electron transfer between Pd atoms at the dimeric Pd sites. Thus, Pd2 DAC possessed moderate adsorption strength of CO*, which was beneficial for CO production in CO2RR.

         <title>Mode&#8208;Specific Vibrational Analysis of Exciton Delocalization and Structural Dynamics in Conjugated Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed pictures of exciton delocalization and structural dynamics of archetypical conjugated oligomers are provided with the aid of femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy. Raman frequency dispersions in the S1 state and their time&#8208;dependent kinetics suggest the close connection between exciton delocalization and local structures of conjugated materials.







Abstract
Exciton delocalization in organic semiconducting polymers, affected by structures at a molecular level, plays a crucial role in modulating relaxation pathways, such as charge generation and singlet fission, which can boost device efficiency. However, the structural diversity of polymers and broad signals from typical electronic spectroscopy have their limits when it comes to revealing the interplay between local structures and exciton delocalization. To tackle these problems, we apply femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy in archetypical conjugated oligothiophenes with different chain lengths. We observed Raman frequency dispersions of symmetric bond stretching modes and mode&#8208;specific kinetics in the S1 Raman spectra, which underpins the subtle and complex interplay between exciton delocalization and bond length alternation along the conjugation coordinate. Our results provide a more general picture of exciton delocalization in the context of molecular structures for conjugated materials.

         <title>Interfering with Metabolic Profile of Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancers Using Rationally Designed Metformin Prodrugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AuIII prodrugs of anti&#8208;diabetic medicines metformin and phenformin were developed. These compounds effectively decreased triple negative breast tumor burden. The mode of action of novel complexes was linked to energetic crisis and abolishment of pro&#8208;survival responses leading to irreversible cell death.







Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, characterized by an aberrant metabolic phenotype with high metastatic capacity, resulting in poor patient prognoses and low survival rates. We designed a series of novel AuIII cyclometalated prodrugs of energy&#8208;disrupting Type II antidiabetic drugs namely, metformin and phenformin. Prodrug activation and release of the metformin ligand was achieved by tuning the cyclometalated AuIII fragment. The lead complex 3met was 6000&#8208;fold more cytotoxic compared to uncoordinated metformin and significantly reduced tumor burden in mice with aggressive breast cancers with lymphocytic infiltration into tumor tissues. These effects was ascribed to 3met interfering with energy production in TNBCs and inhibiting associated pro&#8208;survival responses to induce deadly metabolic catastrophe.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Counting and Superresolution Mapping of Tetraspanins on Exosomes Using a Single&#8208;Molecule Sensitive Flow Technique and Transistor&#8208;like Semiconducting Polymer Dots</title>

         <dc:description>
An approach is described for high&#8208;throughput counting and superresolution mapping of surface proteins on exosomes, using a combination of a single&#8208;molecule sensitive flow technique and an adaptive superresolution imaging method enabled by a new class of transistor&#8208;like, photoswitching polymer dots.







Abstract
A method for high&#8208;throughput counting and superresolution mapping of surface proteins on exosomes is described. The method combines a single&#8208;molecule sensitive flow technique and an adaptive superresolution imaging method. Exosomes stained with membrane dye and dye&#8208;conjugated antibodies were analyzed using a microfluidic platform at a flow rate of 100&#8197;exosome&#8201;s&#8722;1 to determine size and protein copy number. Superresolution mapping was performed with exosomes labeled with novel transistor&#8208;like, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots), which exhibit spontaneous blinking with &lt;5&#8197;nm localization error and a broad range of optical&#8208;adjustable duty cycles. Based on the copy numbers extracted from the flow analysis, the switch&#8208;on frequency of the Pdots were finely adjusted so that structures of hundreds of exosomes were obtained within five minutes. The high throughput and high sensitivity of this method offer clear advantages for characterization of exosomes and similar biological vesicles.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and novel AgI&#8208;catalyzed methodology for the synthesis of multisubstituted 4&#8208;silyloxypyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates with broad variability for the placement of substituents at the 2, 5&#8208;, and N&#8208;positions is presented. Convenient conversion of imino ethers to fully substituted pyrroles with uniformly high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies confirm a [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;O band cleavage/[1,5]&#8208;proton transfer cascade process.







Abstract
An unprecedented AgI&#8208;catalyzed efficient method for the coupling of imino ethers and enol diazoacetates through a [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;O bond cleavage/[1,5]&#8208;proton transfer cascade process is reported. The general class of imino ethers that includes oxazolines, benzoxazoles and benzimidates are applicable substrates for these reactions that provide direct access to fully substituted pyrroles with uniformly high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. High variability in substitution at the pyrrole 2&#8208;, 5&#8208; and N&#8208;positions characterizes this methodology that also presents an entry point for further pyrrole diversification via facile modification of resulting N&#8208;functional pyrroles.

Methyl&#8208;group NMR spectroscopy offers exceptional benefits for structural studies of complex biological systems. Yet, restrictive isotope labeling requirements obstructed its use in emerging protein expression systems. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016070), Manuel Etzkorn, Vladimir Gelev, Haribabu Arthanari, and co&#8208;worker report a five&#8208;step synthesis of stereo&#8208;selective methyl&#8208;labeled leucine, which greatly facilitates applications in eucaryotic or cell&#8208;free expression systems, providing desirable NMR sensors in so far inaccessible protein systems.

         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;based magnetization usage can strongly benefit investigations of large protein systems via NMR spectroscopy. Here, a simple and cost&#8208;effective method to obtain locally deuterated leucine suitable for methyl NMR and to quantify its benefits is presented. The approach substantially expands the applicability of methyl labeling in emerging expression systems including cell&#8208;free and eucaryotic systems.







Abstract
Therapeutically relevant proteins such as GPCRs, antibodies and kinases face clear limitations in NMR studies due to the challenges in site&#8208;specific isotope labeling and deuteration in eukaryotic expression systems. Here we describe an efficient and simple method to observe the methyl groups of leucine residues in proteins expressed in bacterial, eukaryotic or cell&#8208;free expression systems without modification of the expression protocol. The method relies on simple stereo&#8208;selective 13C&#8208;labeling and deuteration of leucine that alleviates the need for additional deuteration of the protein. The spectroscopic benefits of &#8220;local&#8221; deuteration are examined in detail through Forbidden Coherence Transfer (FCT) experiments and simulations. The utility of this labeling method is demonstrated in the cell&#8208;free synthesis of bacteriorhodopsin and in the insect&#8208;cell expression of the RRM2 domain of human RBM39.

         <title>Tricycloquinazoline&#8208;Based 2D Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Promising Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricycloquinazoline (TQ) based 2D conductive MOFs were developed and employed as electrocatalysts for converting CO2 into CH3OH. Cu3(HHTQ)2 with electron&#8208;deficient but nitrogen&#8208;rich TQ cores displays the best electrocatalytic CO2RR performance, showing high selectivity toward CH3OH with Faradic efficiency up to 53.6&#8201;% at a low overpotential of &#8722;0.4&#8197;V and maintained good durability.







Abstract
2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are promising candidates for efficient electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A nitrogen&#8208;rich tricycloquinazoline (TQ) based multitopic catechol ligand was used to coordinate with transition&#8208;metal ions (Cu2+ and Ni2+), which formed 2D graphene&#8208;like porous sheets: M3(HHTQ)2 (M=Cu, Ni; HHTQ=2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;Hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline). M3(HHTQ)2 can be regarded as a single&#8208;atom catalyst where Cu or Ni centers are uniformly distributed in the hexagonal lattices. Cu3(HHTQ)2 exhibited superior catalytic activity towards CO2RR in which CH3OH is the sole product. The Faradic efficiency of CH3OH reached up to 53.6&#8201;% at a small over&#8208;potential of &#8722;0.4&#8197;V. Cu3(HHTQ)2 exhibited larger CO2 adsorption energies and higher activities over the isostructural Ni3(HHTQ)2 and the reported archetypical Cu3(HHTP)2. There is a strong dependence of both metal centers and the N&#8208;rich ligands on the electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Superprotonic Conductivity of MOF&#8208;808 Achieved by Controlling the Binding Mode of Grafted Sulfamate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superprotonic conductivity in a metal&#8208;organic framework is achieved by modulating the binding mode of sulfamate&#8208;grafted MOF&#8208;808 to produce the more acidic cationic sulfiliminium group (&#8722;S=NH2+), which results in more efficient proton conduction.







Abstract
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) having superprotonic conductivity, MOF&#8208;808, is prepared by modulating the binding mode of the sulfamate (SA) moieties grafted onto the metal clusters. The activation of the SA&#8208;grafted MOF&#8208;808 at 150&#8201;&#176;C changes the binding mode of the grafted SA from monodentate to bridging bidentate, thus converting the neutral amido (&#8208;S&#8722;NH2) moiety of the grafted SA to the more acidic cationic sulfiliminium (&#8208;S=NH2+) moiety. Further, the acidic sulfiliminium moiety of MOF&#8208;808&#8208;4SA&#8208;150 results in more efficient proton conduction than the amido moiety of MOF&#8208;808&#8208;4SA&#8208;60. At 60&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% relative humidity, MOF&#8208;808&#8208;4SA&#8208;150 is found to have a proton conductivity of 7.89&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is more than 30&#8208;times higher than that of MOF&#8208;808&#8208;4SA&#8208;60. Moreover, this superprotonic conductivity is well maintained over 1000&#8197;cycles of conductivity measurements and for similar cyclic measurements each day for seven days.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Operated Molecular Cable Car for Gated Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural rhodopsin, an azobenzene&#8208;based molecular rotaxane was designed to insert into lipid membranes for the regulation of ion transport. Based on the shuttle transport mechanism, the significant difference in shuttling rate between trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;isomer caused by molecular isomerization facilitates light&#8208;gated ion transport.







Abstract
Inspired by the nontrivial and controlled movements of molecular machines, we report an azobenzene&#8208;based molecular shuttle PR2, which can perform light&#8208;gated ion transport across lipid membranes. The amphiphilicity and membrane&#8208;spanning molecular length enable PR2 to insert into the bilayer membrane and efficiently transport K+ (EC50=4.1&#8197;&#956;m) through the thermally driven stochastic shuttle motion of the crown ether ring along the axle. The significant difference in shuttling rate between trans&#8208;PR2 and cis&#8208;PR2 induced by molecular isomerization enables a light&#8208;gated ion transport, i.e., ON/OFF in situ regulation of transport activity and single&#8208;channel current. This work represents an example of using a photoswitchable molecular machine to realize gated ion transport, which demonstrates the value of molecular machines functioning in biomembranes.

The amphiphilicity and membrane&#8208;spanning molecular length enable &lt;b&gt;PR2&lt;/b&gt; to insert into the bilayer membrane and efficiently transport K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=4.1&#8197;&#956;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;) through the thermally driven stochastic shuttle motion of the crown ether ring along the axle. The significant difference in shuttling rate between trans&#8208;&lt;b&gt;PR2&lt;/b&gt; and cis&#8208;&lt;b&gt;PR2&lt;/b&gt; induced by molecular isomerization enables a light&#8208;gated ion transport, i.e., ON/OFF in situ regulation of transport activity and single&#8208;channel current. This work represents an example of using a photoswitchable molecular machine to realize gated ion transport, which demonstrates the value of molecular machines functioning in biomembranes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Natural Glycoforms of Human Interleukin 6 Show Atypical Plasma Clearance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugars affect plasma lifetime: The main glycoforms of human interleukin 6 (IL&#8208;6) were synthesized by native chemical ligation combining chemical, enzymatic, and recombinant methods. The native fold was evident from CD spectra, mass spectrometry, crystallography, and receptor binding. In vivo assays showed a different plasma clearance for each glycoform with an unexpected correlation to the glycan structures.







Abstract
A library of glycoforms of human interleukin 6 (IL&#8208;6) comprising complex and mannosidic N&#8208;glycans was generated by semisynthesis. The three segments were connected by sequential native chemical ligation followed by two&#8208;step refolding. The central glycopeptide segments were assembled by pseudoproline&#8208;assisted Lansbury aspartylation and subsequent enzymatic elongation of complex N&#8208;glycans. Nine IL&#8208;6 glycoforms were synthesized, seven of which were evaluated for in vivo plasma clearance in rats and compared to non&#8208;glycosylated recombinant IL&#8208;6 from E. coli. Each IL&#8208;6 glycoform was tested in three animals and reproducibly showed individual serum clearances depending on the structure of the N&#8208;glycan. The clearance rates were atypical, since the 2,6&#8208;sialylated glycoforms of IL&#8208;6 cleared faster than the corresponding asialo IL&#8208;6 with terminal galactoses. Compared to non&#8208;glycosylated IL&#8208;6 the plasma clearance of IL&#8208;6 glycoforms was delayed in the presence of larger and multibranched N&#8208;glycans in most cases

         <title>Towards the Highly Efficient Synthesis and Selective Methylation of C(sp3)&#8208;Bridged [6]Cycloparaphenylenes from Fluoren[3]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from fluoren[3]arenes, a new kind of easily available macrocyclic arenes, a powerful approach to the highly efficient synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylenes (C[6]CPPs) with aesthetic conjugated belt structures was developed.

Abstract
An approach to the highly efficient synthesis of C(sp3)&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylenes (C[6]CPPs) from fluoren[3]arenes (F[3]As) was developed. Consequently, F[3]As as a new kind of macrocyclic arenes were synthesized. Followed by the demethylation, triflation and intramolecular aryl&#8211;aryl coupling reactions, C[6]CPPs were then conveniently obtained. Interestingly, C[6]CPPs could be selectively methylated to produce their fully outer&#8208;methyl&#8208;substituted derivatives. The crystal structures showed the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted F[3]As had bowl&#8208;shaped conformations, and the C[6]CPPs exhibited rigid belt&#8208;shaped structures with deep cavities. Moreover, C[6]CPPs exhibited high HOMO energies and narrow energy gaps. An unclosed belt was further obtained, and it not only showed a similar narrow energy gap to those of the aromatic belts, but also displayed strong fluorescence property, which can play a vital role in the design and synthesis of new aromatic belts.

         <title>Mechanochemical Gold(III)&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical conversion of gold(III) complexes with sp&#8208;, sp2&#8208;, sp3&#8208;C,H bond&#8208;containing substrates in a planetary ball mill is reported. The base supported reaction delivers high valued products under solvent&#8208;free and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Starting from a [(MeOC^N^C)AuCl] complex as precursor, a direct substitution by C,H&#8208;activation from sp&#8208;, sp2&#8208; or sp3&#8208;C,H&#8208;bonds under basic conditions in a planetary ball mill was achieved. Because of the extraordinary photophysical properties of the target compounds, this protocol provides an easy access to a highly valued complex class. In contrast to existing protocols, no pre&#8208;functionalization of the starting materials is necessary and the use of expensive transition metal catalysts can be avoided, which makes this application appealing also for industrial purposes. In addition the methodology was not restricted to pincer complexes, which was demonstrated by the substitution of chelate type [(tpy)AuCl2] complexes.

         <title>Control of Triplet Blinking Using Cyclooctatetraene to Access the Dynamics of Biomolecules at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potent method is offered for accessing the dynamics of biomolecules and detecting miRNA at the single&#8208;molecule level in the time range from &#956;s to ms&#8208;tracing the triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (TTET) kinetics between a fluorescent molecule and cyclooctatetraene (COT) by monitoring the fluorescence blinking.







Abstract
To explore the dynamics of biomolecules, tracing the kinetics of photo&#8208;induced chemical reactions via the triplet excited state (T1) of probe molecules offers a timescale that is about 106 times wider than via the singlet excited state (S1). Using cyclooctatetraene (COT) as a triplet energy acceptor and at the same time as a photostabilizer, the triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (TTET) kinetics governed by oligonucleotide (oligo) dynamics were studied at the single&#8208;molecule level by measuring fluorescence blinking. TTET kinetics measurement allowed us to access the length&#8208; and sequence&#8208;dependent dynamics of oligos and realize the single&#8208;molecule detection of a model microRNA biomarker. In sharp contrast to the singlet&#8211;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that occurs in the 1&#8211;10&#8197;nm range, TTET requires a Van der Waals contact. The present method is thus a complementary method to FRET and provides direct information on biomolecular dynamics on the &#956;s to ms timescale.

Using cyclooctatetraene (COT) as a triplet energy acceptor and at the same time as a photostabilizer, the triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (TTET) kinetics governed by oligonucleotide (oligo) dynamics were studied at the single&#8208;molecule level by measuring fluorescence blinking. TTET kinetics measurement allowed us to access the length&#8208; and sequence&#8208;dependent dynamics of oligos and realize the single&#8208;molecule detection of a model microRNA biomarker. In sharp contrast to the singlet&#8211;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that occurs in the 1&#8211;10&#8197;nm range, TTET requires a Van der Waals contact. The present method is thus a complementary method to FRET and provides direct information on biomolecular dynamics on the &#956;s to ms timescale.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Simple Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptors Leading to Efficient Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring acceptors (NFRAs), denoted as PTB4F and PTB4Cl, are developed via a two&#8208;step synthesis from simple phenyl and thiophene units. The corresponding organic photovoltaics based on PTB4Cl:PBDB&#8208;TF have impressively achieved a power conversion efficiency of 12.76&#8201;%, representing the highest value among the fully non&#8208;fused NFRAs reported so far.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable progress achieved in recent years, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) still need work to approach the delicate balance between efficiency, stability, and cost. Herein, two fully non&#8208;fused electron acceptors, PTB4F and PTB4Cl, are developed via a two&#8208;step synthesis from single aromatic units. The introduction of a two&#8208;dimensional chain and halogenated terminals for these non&#8208;fused acceptors plays a synergistic role in optimizing their solid stacking and orientation, thus promoting an elongated exciton lifetime and fast charge&#8208;transfer rate in bulk heterojunction blends. As a result, PTB4Cl, upon blending with PBDB&#8208;TF polymer, has enabled single&#8208;junction OPVs with power conversion efficiencies of 12.76&#8201;%, representing the highest values among the reported fully unfused electron acceptors so far.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Benzyl Alcohols via Palladium/Chiral Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective kinetic resolution of tertiary benzyl alcohols via palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis is developed. Simple aryl iodides is used as the resolution reagent. Both enantioenriched tertiary benzyl alcohols and benzo[c]chromene products are obtained in good to excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic applications are demonstrated by the facile synthesis of diversified biorelevant heterocycles.







Abstract
Herein we report a highly enantioselective kinetic resolution of tertiary benzyl alcohols via palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis. With simple aryl iodides as the resolution reagent, a wide range of readily available racemic tertiary benzyl alcohols are applicable to this method. Both chiral tertiary benzyl alcohols and benzo[c]chromene products are obtained in good to excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity factor up to 544). The appealing synthetic utility of the obtained enantioenriched tertiary alcohols is demonstrated by the facile preparation of several valuable chiral heterocycles. Preliminary mechanism studies include DFT calculations to explain the origin of enantiodiscrimination and control experiments to uncover the formation of a transient axial chirality during the kinetic resolution step.

         <title>Periodicity in the Electrochemical Dissolution of Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, intrinsic metal descriptors based on theoretical considerations are linked to experimentally determined dissolution rates. Clear trends are identified between the dissolution during oxide formation and the metal&#8211;metal cohesive energy, as well as between the dissolution during the reduction of an oxide and the metal&#8211;oxygen adsorption energy.







Abstract
Extensive research efforts are currently dedicated to the search for new electrocatalyst materials in which expensive and rare noble metals are replaced with cheaper and more abundant transition metals. Recently, numerous alloys, oxides, and composites with such metals have been identified as highly active electrocatalysts through the use of high&#8208;throughput screening methods with the help of activity descriptors. Up to this point, stability has lacked such descriptors. Hence, we elucidate the role of intrinsic metal/oxide properties on the corrosion behavior of representative 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals. Electrochemical dissolution of nine transition metals is quantified using online inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS). Based on the obtained dissolution data in alkaline and acidic media, we establish clear periodic correlations between the amount of dissolved metal, the cohesive energy of the metal atoms (Ecoh), and the energy of oxygen adsorption on the metal (&#916;HO,ads). Such correlations can support the knowledge&#8208;driven search for more stable electrocatalysts.

         <title>Sampling and Analysis in Flow: The Keys to Smarter, More Controllable, and Sustainable Fine&#8208;Chemical Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical and fine&#8208;chemical industry requires a detailed understanding of ongoing reaction processes. Artificial intelligence and machine learning in conjunction with process analytical technology tools that help control and optimize the operation of continuous manufacturing reactors and the related chemical transformations enable chemists to optimize synthetic processes.







Abstract
Process analytical technology (PAT) is a system designed to help chemists better understand and control manufacturing processes. PAT systems operate through the combination of analytical devices, reactor control elements, and mathematical models to ensure the quality of the final product through a quality by design (QbD) approach. The expansion of continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical and fine&#8208;chemical industry requires the development of PAT tools suitable for continuous operation in the environment of flow reactors. This requires innovative approaches to sampling and analysis from flowing media to maintain the integrity of the reactor content and the analyte of interest. The following Review discusses examples of PAT tools implemented in flow chemistry for the preparation of small organic molecules, and applications of self&#8208;optimization tools.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Modification of the 5&#8242; Cap Maintains Translation and Increases Immunogenic Properties of mRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural modifications at the 5&#8242; cap of mRNA impact translation and immunogenicity. Now, mRNAs with non&#8208;natural post&#8208;transcriptional modifications are tested regarding translation and immunogenicity, providing a new strategy to tailor mRNA for therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Eukaryotic mRNAs are emerging modalities for protein replacement therapy and vaccination. Their 5&#8242; cap is important for mRNA translation and immune response and can be naturally methylated at different positions by S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (AdoMet)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTases). We report on the cosubstrate scope of the MTase CAPAM responsible for methylation at the N6&#8208;position of adenosine start nucleotides using synthetic AdoMet analogs. The chemo&#8208;enzymatic propargylation enabled production of site&#8208;specifically modified reporter&#8208;mRNAs. These cap&#8208;propargylated mRNAs were efficiently translated and showed &#8776;3&#8208;fold increased immune response in human cells. The same effects were observed when the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8212;a currently tested epitope for mRNA vaccination&#8212;was used. Site&#8208;specific chemo&#8208;enzymatic modification of eukaryotic mRNA may thus be a suitable strategy to modulate translation and immune response of mRNAs for future therapeutic applications.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Fabrication and Atomic&#8208;scale Characterization of Triply&#8208;linked, Laterally &#960;&#8208;Extended Porphyrin Nanotapes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrin nanotapes (Por NTs) are highly promising structures for their use as molecular wires thanks to their high degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation, low HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps, and exceptional conductance. Such structures have been repeatedly reported in solution&#8208;based approaches, but their on&#8208;surface synthesis, which allows an atomically&#8208;resolved characterization, remains unreported to this date. Here, we report the first example of meso&#8208;meso triply&#8208;fused Por NTs, which are prepared from a readily available Por precursor through a two&#8208;step synthesis on Au(111). The diradical character of the on&#8208;surface formed building block PorA  2  , a phenalenyl &#960;&#8208;extended Zn(II)Por, facilitates intermolecular homocoupling and allows for the formation of laterally &#960;&#8208;extended tapes. The structural and electronic properties of individual Por NTs are addressed, both on Au(111) and on a thin insulating NaCl layer, by high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy complemented by density functional theory calculations. Remarkably, the triply&#8208;linked, laterally &#960;&#8208;extended Por NTs carry one unpaired electron at each end, which leads to magnetic end states. Our study provides an alternative and versatile route to the fabrication of Por NTs and the atomic&#8208;scale characterizations of their structural and electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptional electrochemical HER performance with enhanced electron transfer between Ru nanoparticles and single atoms dispersed on carbon substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely regulating the electronic structures of metal active species is highly desirable for electrocatalysis. However, carbon with inert surface provide weak metal&#8208;support interaction, which is insufficient to modulate the electronic structures of metal nanoparticles. Herein, we propose a new method to control the electrocatalytic behavior of supported metal nanoparticles by dispersing single metal atoms on an O&#8208;doped graphene. Ideal atomic metal species are firstly computationally screened. We then verify this concept by deposition of Ru nanoparticles onto an O&#8208;doped graphene decorated with single metal atoms (e.g., Fe, Co, and Ni) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consistent with theoretical predictions, such hybrid catalysts show outstanding HER performance, much superior to other reported electrocatalysts such as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C. This work offers a new strategy for modulating the activity and stability of metal nanoparticles for electrocatalysis processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective vibrational strong coupling effects on molecular vibrational relaxation and energy transfer: Numerical insights via cavity molecular dynamics simulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a small fraction of hot CO2 molecules immersed in a liquid&#8208;phase CO2 thermal bath, classical cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that forming collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the C=O asymmetric stretch of&#160;CO2 molecules and a cavity mode accelerates hot&#8208;molecule relaxation. This acceleration stems from the fact that polaritons can be transiently excited during the nonequilibrium process, which facilitates intermolecular vibrational energy transfer. The VSC effects on these rates (i) resonantly depend on the cavity mode detuning, (ii) cooperatively depend on&#160;Rabi splitting, and (iii) collectively scale&#160;with the number of hot molecules. For&#160;larger cavity volumes, the average VSC effect per molecule can remain meaningful for up to N ~ 10^4 molecules forming VSC. Moreover, the transiently excited lower polariton prefers to relax by transferring its energy to the tail of the molecular energy distribution rather than equally distributing it to all thermal molecules. As far as the parameter dependence is concerned, the vibrational relaxation data presented here appears analogous to VSC catalysis in Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot microcavities.</dc:description>

         <title>The Metallocene Battery: Ultrafast Electron Transfer Self Exchange Rate Accompanied by a Harmonic Height Breathing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;metallocene battery consisting of poly&#8208;ferrocene and poly&#8208;cobaltocene is shown. The extremely high power density is provided via molecular self&#8208;assembly between polymers and reduced graphene oxide. The precise construction of anode and cathode results in a reciprocal height change during charging&#8211;discharging, due to anion (de)intercalation in the soft structure.







Abstract
The first all&#8208;metallocene rechargeable battery consisting of poly&#8208;cobaltocenium/&#8208; and poly&#8208;ferrocene/reduced graphene oxide composites as anode and cathode was prepared. The intrinsically fast ET self&#8208;exchange rate of metallocenes was successfully combined with an efficient ion&#8208;percolation achieved by molecular self&#8208;assembly. The resulting battery materials show ideal Nernstian behavior, is thickness scalable up to &gt;1.2&#8197;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and exhibit high coulombic efficiency at ultrafast rates (200&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Using aqueous LiClO4, the charge is carried exclusively by the anion. The ClO4&#8722; intercalation is accompanied by a reciprocal height change of the active layers. Principally, volume changes in organic battery materials during charging/discharging are not desirable and represent a major safety issue. However, here, the individual height changes&#8212;due to ion breathing&#8212;are reciprocal and thus prohibiting any internal pressure build&#8208;up in the closed&#8208;cell, leading to excellent cycling stability.

         <title>Stereoselective Directed Cationic Cascades Enabled by Molecular Anchoring in Terpene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic cyclizations are one of nature's tools for scaffold diversification. However, these transformations are very difficult to control by chemical catalysts. Herein, a strategy to gain full control over such reaction types is presented by introducing/ breaking specific hydrogen&#8208;bonds inside terpene cyclases. Consequently, valuable flavor and fragrance compounds were produced in gram&#8208;scale within a single enzymatic step in water.







Abstract
Cascade reactions appeared as a cutting&#8208;edge strategy to streamline the assembly of complex structural scaffolds from naturally available precursors in an atom&#8208;, as well as time, labor&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient way. We herein report a strategy to control cationic cyclization cascades by exploiting the ability of anchoring dynamic substrates in the active site of terpene cyclases via designed hydrogen bonding. Thereby, it is possible to induce &#8220;directed&#8221; cyclizations in contrast to established &#8220;non&#8208;stop&#8221; cyclizations (99:1) and predestinate cascade termination at otherwise catalytically barely accessible intermediates. As a result, we are able to provide efficient access to naturally widely occurring apocarotenoids, value&#8208;added flavors and fragrances in gram&#8208;scale by replacing multi&#8208;stage synthetic routes to a single step with unprecedented selectivity (&gt;99.5&#8201;% ee) and high yields (up to 89&#8201;%).

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Elucidation of Bisdibenzocorannulene at Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Extended&#160;curved polycyclic hydrocarbons have attracted widespread attention in not only chemistry but also materials science. We now report an  anti  &#8208;folded bowl&#8208;shaped bisdibenzocorannulene (  BDBC  ), featuring a new chair&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;like hexagon as a bridge of two dibenzocorannulene moieties. The neutral compound showed a multiple redox active property, and would be converted to the corresponding redox states through chemical reduction or oxidation. Chemical reduction of  BDBC  by stoichiometric addition of metallic potassium in the presence of [18]crown&#8208;6 ether, provided a radical anion  BDBC  &#8226;&#8722;  and a dianion  BDBC  2&#8722;  , respectively; while chemical oxidation by silver hexafluoroantimonate (V), invariably converted neutral compound to an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical dication  (BDBC  &#8226;&#8226;  )  2+  . Our results revealed that structural consequence of both electron&#8208;reduction and oxidation, were closely related to release of ring&#8208;strain of bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;scaffold and imposed steric hindrance of the hexagonal bridge. In addition, the unusual open&#8208;shell nature of the dication could mainly be attributed to the changing of localized antiaromaticity in closed&#8208;shell structure to delocalized character in biradical, and thus emerging of weakly bonded &#960;&#8208;electrons.</dc:description>

Chemical reduction of  BDBC  by stoichiometric addition of metallic potassium in the presence of [18]crown&#8208;6 ether, provided a radical anion  BDBC  &#8226;&#8722;  and a dianion  BDBC  2&#8722;  , respectively; while chemical oxidation by silver hexafluoroantimonate (V), invariably converted neutral compound to an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical dication  (BDBC  &#8226;&#8226;  )  2+  . Our results revealed that structural consequence of both electron&#8208;reduction and oxidation, were closely related to release of ring&#8208;strain of bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;scaffold and imposed steric hindrance of the hexagonal bridge. In addition, the unusual open&#8208;shell nature of the dication could mainly be attributed to the changing of localized antiaromaticity in closed&#8208;shell structure to delocalized character in biradical, and thus emerging of weakly bonded &#960;&#8208;electrons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Distannylated Monomer of Strong Electron&#8208;Accepting Organoboron Building Block: Enabling Acceptor&#8208;Acceptor Type Conjugated Polymers for n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;A) copolymerization is an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers. However, the development of A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers is challenging due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, a distannylated monomer of strong electron&#8208;deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit is readily synthesized and used to develop A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels of &#8208;4.4 eV, which is among the lowest value reported for organoboron polymers. After n&#8208;doping, the resulting polymers exhibit electric conductivity of 7.8 S cm  &#8208;1  and power factor of 24.8 &#956;W m  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;2  . This performance is among the best for n&#8208;type polymer thermoelectric materials. These results demonstrate the great potential of A&#8208;A type organoboron polymers for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Green Fluorescent Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Aromatic Belt Containing [6]Cycloparaphenylene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belts with conjugated structures still remain a challenge. Here, we report the first nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belt with [6]cycloparaphenylene skeleton, which is conveniently synthesized from the easily available calix[3]carbazole. The aromatic belt has a rigid conjugated structure and deep cavity, and it can encapsulate one dichloromethane in both solution and the solid state. Interestingly, the aromatic belt shows strong green fluorescence with the quantum yield of 0.39 and exhibits a narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of 2.02 eV. The belt&#8208;shaped conjugated structure composed of three carbazole subunits and specific optoelectronic properties will promote wide applications of the aromatic belt in supramolecular chemistry and materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dealkenylative Arylation of Alkenes with Arylboronic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8211;C bond formation reaction represents a fundamental and important transformation in synthetic chemistry, and exploring new types of C&#8211;C bond formation reactions is recognized as appealing, yet challenging. Herein, we disclose the first example of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes with arylboronic compounds, thereby providing an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemo&#8208;selectivity. In this method, C(aryl)&#8211;C(alkenyl) and C(alkenyl)&#8211;C(alkenyl) bonds in various alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes can be cleaved via a hydrometalation and followed by beta&#8208;carbon elimination pathway for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. Furthermore, a series of novel organic fluorescent molecules with excellent photophysical properties has been efficiently constructed with this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Motorized Macrocycle: A Photo&#8208;responsive Host with Switchable and Stereoselective Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing photo&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest systems can provide versatile supramolecular tools for constructing smart systems and materials. Here we demonstrate the design of photo&#8208;responsive macrocyclic hosts, modulated by light&#8208;driven molecular rotary motors enabling switchable chiral guest recognition. The intramolecular cyclization of the two arms of a first&#8208;generation molecular motor with flexible oligoethylene glycol chains of different lengths resulted in crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like macrocycles with intrinsic motor function. As a result, the octaethylene glycol linkage enables the successful unidirectional rotation of molecular motors, simultaneously allowing the 1:1 host&#8208;guest interaction with ammonium salt guests. The binding affinity and stereoselectivity of the motorized macrocycle can be reversibly modulated, owing to the multi&#8208;state light&#8208;driven switching of geometry and helicity of the molecular motors. This approach provides an attractive strategy to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest systems and dynamic materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoreticular functionalization is a well&#8208;elucidated strategy for pore environment tuning and the basis of gas separation performance in extended frameworks. The extension of this approach to discrete porous molecules such as metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) is conceptually straightforward but hindered by synthetic complications, especially stability concerns. We report the successful isoreticular functionalization of a zirconium MOC with tetrazole moiety by bottom&#8208;up synthesis. The title compound (ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;tetrazol) shows promising C  2  H  2  /CO  2  and C  2  H  2  /C  2  H  4  separation performance, as demonstrated by adsorption isotherms, breakthrough experiments, and density functional theory calculations. The design analogy between MOFs and highly stable MOCs may guide the synthesis of novel porous materials for challenging separation applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of 3D printing fuels the need for new photoinitiating systems working under mild conditions and/or leading to polymers with new and/or enhanced properties. In this context, we introduce herein N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;borane complexes as reagents for a new type of photo&#8208;click reaction, the borane&#8208;(meth)acrylate click reaction. Remarkably, the higher bond number of boranes relative to thiols induced an increase of the network density associated with faster polymerization kinetics. Solid&#8208;state NMR evidenced the strong participation of the boron centers on the network properties, while DMA and AFM showed that the materials exhibit improved mechanical properties, as well as reduced solvent swelling.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Rechargeable lithium&#8208;metal batteries with a cell&#8208;level specific energy of &gt;400 Wh kg  &#8722;1  are highly desired for the next&#8208;generation storage applications, yet the research has been retarded by poor electrolyte&#8208;electrode compatibility and rigorous safety concerns. In this work, we show that by simply formulating the composition of conventional electrolytes, a hybrid electrolyte was constructed to ensure high (electro)chemical and thermal stability with both the Li&#8208;metal anode and the high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes. By employing the new electrolyte, Li||LiNi  0.6  Co  0.2  Mn  0.2  O  2  cells show favorable cycling and rate performance, and a 10&#8208;Ah Li||LiNi  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  O  2  pouch cell demonstrates a practical&#160;specific energy of &gt;450 Wh kg  &#8722;1  . Our findings shed light on reasonable design of electrolyte and electrode/electrolyte interface towards practical realization of high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Pyrrole &#945;&#8208;Cleavage with Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates:&#160;Enzyme Model by Structural Constraint</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work describes the reaction of triplet dioxygen with the porphyrinogenic calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates to alkylperoxido aluminates in high selectivity. Multiconfigurational quantum chemical computations disclose the mechanism for this spin&#8208;forbidden process. Despite a negligible spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant, the intersystem crossing (ISC) is facilitated by singlet and triplet state degeneracy and spin&#8208;vibronic coupling. The formed peroxides are stable toward external substrates but undergo an unprecedented oxidative pyrrole &#945;&#8208;cleavage by ligand aromatization/dearomatization&#8208;initiated O&#8208;O &#963;&#8208;bond scission. A detailed comparison of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates with dioxygen&#8208;related enzymology provides insights into the ISC of metal&#8208; or cofactor&#8208;free enzymes. It substantiates the importance of structural constraint and element&#8208;ligand cooperativity for the functions of aerobic life.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique structural characteristics of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hollow nanostructures endow intriguing physicochemical properties and wide applications, especially for electrochemical energy storage applications. In this Minireview, we review the recent developments in the rational design and engineering of various kinds of 1D hollow nanostructures with well&#8208;designed architectures, structural/compositional complexity, controllable morphologies, and boosted electrochemical properties for different kinds of battery applications (i.e., lithium&#8208;ion batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, lithium&#8208;selenium sulfur batteries, lithium metal anodes). Based on the insights, we conclude the prospects on critical challenges and possible future research directions in this field. It is anticipated that further innovative works on the structural and compositional design of functional 1D nanostructured electrodes for energy storage applications can be stimulated.</dc:description>

         <title>Azacalix[3]triazines: A&#160;Substructure of Triazine&#8208;Based Graphitic Carbon Nitride Featuring Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has accepted broad research interest due to its unique catalytic properties. However, GCN, prepared by general methods, possess myriad structural defects and it has been difficult to elucidate their intrinsic physical properties. Here we report the development of azacalix[3]triazines (AC3Ts), a substructure of triazine&#8208;based GCN (Tz&#8208;GCN). Despite the electron&#8208;deficient natures of triazine, AC3Ts capture protons as organic superbases. Furthermore, we also revealed the unique anion&#8208;&#960;&#160;interaction of AC3Ts that altered the ionization potentials of AC3Ts. To the best of our knowledge, these features have not yet been recognized for Tz&#8208;GCN. These unveiled features of AC3Ts are expected to expand the scope and possibilities of GCNs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface synthesis is a powerful methodology for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanomaterials. Here, we demonstrate chemoselective Sonogashira coupling between trimethylsilyl(TMS)ethynyl and chloropheny groups in silylethynyl&#8208; and chloro&#8208;substituted partially fluorinated phenylene&#8211;ethynylenes (SiCPFPEs) on Ag(111). The desilylative Sonogashira coupling achieved a high chemoselectivity up to 75% while the competing homo&#8208;couplings of Ullmann and desilylative Glaser couplings were suppressed. A combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) and density functional theory calculations revealed that the oligomers were obtained by the formation of  intermolecular  silylene&#8208;tethers (&#8208;Me  2  Si&#8208;) via the CH  3  &#8211;Si bond activation at 130 &#176;C and the subsequent elimination of the tethers at an elevated temperature of 200 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversifying Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperative Catalysis in Semi&#8208;Synthetic [Mn]&#8208;Hydrogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases were reconstituted using specifically designed MnI complexes. In two catalytically active [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases, the mode of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation is different from that of the native [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. One such [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenase exhibits the highest specific activity among all known semi&#8208;synthetic [Mn]&#8208; and [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenases.







Abstract
The reconstitution of [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases using a series of MnI complexes is described. These complexes are designed to have an internal base or pro&#8208;base that may participate in metal&#8211;ligand cooperative catalysis or have no internal base or pro&#8208;base. Only MnI complexes with an internal base or pro&#8208;base are active for H2 activation; only [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases incorporating such complexes are active for hydrogenase reactions. These results confirm the essential role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation for H2 activation by the MnI complexes alone and by [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases. Owing to the nature and position of the internal base or pro&#8208;base, the mode of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation in two active [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases is different from that of the native [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. One [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenase has the highest specific activity of semi&#8208;synthetic [Mn]&#8208; and [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenases. This work demonstrates reconstitution of active artificial hydrogenases using synthetic complexes differing greatly from the native active site.

         <title>Chemical Imaging of Hierarchical Porosity Formation within a Zeolite Crystal Visualized by Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;Ray Scattering and In&#8208;Situ Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Hierarchical porosity within a zeolite crystal is visualized by X&#8208;ray scattering microscopy to probe nanoporosity within the inorganic zeolite phase. In complement, in situ fluorescence microscopy allows to monitor pore hierarchization in real&#8208;time via organic fluorescent stains, which fill the meso&#8208; and macropore space.







Abstract
Introducing hierarchical porosity to zeolites is vital for providing molecular access to microporous domains. Yet, the dynamics of meso&#8208; and macropore formation has remained elusive and pore space ill&#8208;characterized by a lack of (in situ) microscopic tools sensitive to nanoporosity. Here, we probe hierarchical porosity formation within a zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 crystal in real&#8208;time by in situ fluorescence microscopy during desilication. In addition, we introduce small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering microscopy as novel characterization tool to map intracrystal meso&#8208; and macropore properties. It is shown that hierarchical porosity formation initiates at the crystal surface and propagates to the crystal core via a pore front with decreasing rate. Also, hierarchical porosity only establishes in specific (segments of) subunits which constitute ZSM&#8208;5. Such space&#8208;dependent meso&#8208; and macroporosity implies local discrepancies in diffusion, performance and deactivation behaviors even within a zeolite crystal.

         <title>Silicon Tetrakis(trifluoromethanesulfonate): A Simple Neutral Silane Acting as a Soft and Hard Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title compound is the first neutral silane acting as a hard and soft Lewis superacid as exemplified by extensive scaling. Its distinct reactivity towards soft Lewis bases&#8197;L leads to unprecedented [L2Si(OTf)4] complexes, while the reactions with halocarbons afford electrophilic cations, including a straight access to benzoylium cations from mono&#8208; and bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenes, stabilized by the [Si(OTf)6]2&#8722; weakly coordinating dianion.







Abstract
A facile synthesis and isolation of pristine silicon tetrakis(trifluoromethanesulfonate), Si(OTf)4, is reported, acting as the first neutral silicon&#8208;based Lewis superacid suitable towards soft and hard Lewis bases. Its OTf groups have a dual function: they are excellent leaving groups and modulate the degree of reactivity towards soft and hard Lewis bases. Exposed to soft Lewis donors, Si(OTf)4 leads to [L2Si(OTf)4] complexes (L=isocyanide, thioether and carbonyl compounds) with retention of all Si&#8722;OTf bonds. In contrast, it can cleave C&#8722;X bonds (X=F, Cl) of hard organic Lewis bases with a high tendency to form SiX4 (X=F, Cl) after halide/triflate exchange. Most notable, Si(OTf)4 allows a gentle oxydefluorination of mono&#8208; and bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenes, resulting in the formation of the corresponding benzoylium species, which are stabilized by the weakly coordinating [Si(OTf)6] dianion.

         <title>Chasing the Mond Cation: Synthesis and Characterization of the Homoleptic Nickel Tetracarbonyl Cation and its Tricarbonyl&#8208;Nitrosyl Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the first homoleptic nickel carbonyl cation [Ni(CO)4].+ and the nickel tricarbonyl&#8208;nitrosyl cation [Ni(CO)3(NO)]+ in the condensed phase is reported. They were obtained by oxidation of nickel metal in CO atmosphere and stabilized with a suitable weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
130&#8197;years after Mond discovered the first homoleptic carbonyl complex Ni(CO)4, we report on a [Ni(CO)4].+ salt as the first synthesis of any homoleptic nickel carbonyl cation in the condensed phase. It was prepared by oxidation of nickel metal with the synergistic oxidant Ag[F{Al(ORF)3}2]/0.5&#8201;I2 (RF=C(CF3)3) in CO atmosphere. This D2d&#8208;symmetric metalloradical represents the last missing entry among the structurally characterized homoleptic carbonyl cations of Groups&#8197;6 to 11. Additionally, the nickel tricarbonyl&#8208;nitrosyl cation [Ni(CO)3(NO)]+ was obtained by usage of NO[F{Al(ORF)3}2] and all products were fully characterized by means of IR, Raman, NMR/EPR, single crystal and powder XRD.

         <title>Syntheses and Physical Properties of Cationic BN&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAH+) were synthesized via pyridine&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. Anion exchange gave a brickwork&#8208;type p&#8208;electronic ion pair with 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentacyanocyclopentadienyl anion ([PCCp&#8211;]).







Abstract
Cationic BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAH+s) were synthesized from a nitrogen&#8208;containing macrocycle via pyridine&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. Incorporating BN into PAH+ resulted in a remarkable hypsochromic shift due to an increase in the LUMO energy and the symmetry changes of the HOMO and LUMO. Electrophilic substitution or anion exchange of BN&#8208;PAH+ possessing tetrabromoborate as a counter anion (BN+[BBr4&#8722;]) afforded air&#8208;stable BN&#8208;PAH/PAH+s. Of these, BN+[TfO&#8722;] allowed reversible two&#8208;electron reduction and the formation of two&#8208;dimensional brickwork&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;electronic ion pair with 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentacyanocyclopentadienyl anion, demonstrating the potential application of BN&#8208;PAH+ as electronic materials.

         <title>Stereoselective Access to Polyfunctionalized Nine&#8208;Membered Heterocycles by Sequential Gold and Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a gold and palladium sequential catalysis to convert enynamides and vinyl ethylene carbonates to furan&#8208;fused nine&#8208;membered heterocycles via azadiene generation followed by [5+4] cycloaddition. Conformation&#8208;controlled diastereoselective derivatizations of these medium&#8208;sized rings and oxidative furan cleavage enabled access to diverse polyfunctionalized nine&#8208;membered lactams.







Abstract
We report herein a gold and palladium sequential catalysis system to access furan&#8208;fused nine&#8208;membered heterocycles in high efficiency and enantioselectivity. In this one&#8208;pot procedure, easily accessible enynamides undergo cyclization to generate azadienes in situ that participate in enantioselective formal [5+4] cycloaddition with vinyl ethylene carbonates. Conformation&#8208;controlled highly diastereoselective derivatizations of these medium&#8208;sized rings, coupled with oxidative furan cleavage, have enabled the access to diverse densely&#8208;functionalized nine&#8208;membered lactams.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Potassium&#8208;Rich Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode for High Power Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;strain potassium&#8208;rich K1.84Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.88&#8901;0.49&#8201;H2O (KNiHCF) was prepared by a facile co&#8208;precipitation method. The KNiHCF//graphite full cell exhibits high rate performance, superior cycling stability, and high power density. This work would offer an insight into design of the low&#8208;strain cathode materials for PIBs.







Abstract
Most of the cathode materials for potassium ion batteries (PIBs) suffer from poor structural stability due to the large ionic radius of K+, resulting in poor cycling stability. Here we report a low&#8208;strain potassium&#8208;rich K1.84Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.88&#8901;0.49&#8201;H2O (KNiHCF) as a cathode material for PIBs. The as&#8208;prepared KNiHCF cathode can deliver reversible discharge capacity of 62.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a high discharge voltage of 3.82&#8197;V. It can also achieve a superior rate performance of 45.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a capacity retention of 88.6&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles. The superior performance of KNiHCF cathode results from low&#8208;strain de&#8208;/intercalation mechanism, intrinsic semiconductor property and low potassium diffusion energy barrier. The high power density and long&#8208;term stability of KNiHCF//graphite full cell confirmed the feasibility of K&#8208;rich KNiHCF cathode in PIBs. This work provides guidance to develop Prussian blue analogues as cathode materials for PIBs.

         <title>Protein&#8211;Antibody Conjugates (PACs): A Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Strategy for Covalent Conjugation and Targeted Intracellular Delivery of Pristine Proteins</title>

Protein&#8211;antibody conjugates (PACs) have the potential to judiciously combine the merits of two prolific therapeutic approaches&#8212;biologics and antibody&#8211;drug conjugates&#8212;for antibody&#8208;directed delivery of protein therapeutics to specific cells.







Abstract
We report here on protein&#8211;antibody conjugates (PACs) that are used for antibody&#8208;directed delivery of protein therapeutics to specific cells. PACs have the potential to judiciously combine the merits of two prolific therapeutic approaches&#8212;biologics and antibody&#8211;drug conjugates. We utilize spherical polymer brushes to construct PACs using the combination of two simple and efficient functionally orthogonal click chemistries. In addition to the synthesis and characterization of these nanoparticles, we demonstrate that PACs are indeed capable of specifically targeting cells based on the presence of target antigen on the cell surface to deliver proteins. The potentially broad adaptability of PACs opens up new opportunities for targeted biologics in therapeutics and sensing.

         <title>Chemiluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency and Donor&#8211;Acceptor Distance: from Qualitative to Quantitative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than 50&#8197;years after the birth of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET), the first experimental evidence of the quantitative relationship between CRET efficiency and donor&#8211;acceptor distance was achieved using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active micelles.







Abstract
Since its birth in 1967, the utilization of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) has made substantial progress in a variety of fields for its unique features. However, the quantitative relationship between CRET efficiency and donor&#8211;acceptor distance has not yet been determined owing to the difficulty in designing the variable lengths between chemiluminescent donors and acceptors. Herein, we synthesized three kinds of tetraphenylethene (TPE)&#8208;anchored cationic surfactants with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. For the first time, it is quantitatively demonstrated that the CRET efficiency is inversely proportional to the sixth power of distance between luminol donors and TPE acceptors. The details disclosed in this contribute have provided the solid evidence that CRET follows F&#246;rster resonance theory. Our strategy would build a promising platform to control donor&#8211;acceptor distance, allowing to the interdisciplinary applications of CRET.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Sarpagine and Koumine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two key bridged skeleton&#8208;forming reactions, namely tandem sequential oxidative cyclopropanol ring&#8208;opening cyclization and ketone &#945;&#8208;allenylation, assembled the cage&#8208;shaped sarpagine scaffold. By late&#8208;stage diversifications of the ketone and allene groups, a concise, collective, and asymmetric total synthesis of two classes of indole alkaloids including five sarpagine alkaloids and three koumine alkaloids has been accomplished.







Abstract
We report here a concise, collective, and asymmetric total synthesis of sarpagine alkaloids and biogenetically related koumine alkaloids, which structurally feature a rigid cage scaffold, with L&#8208;tryptophan as the starting material. Two key bridged skeleton&#8208;forming reactions, namely tandem sequential oxidative cyclopropanol ring&#8208;opening cyclization and ketone &#945;&#8208;allenylation, ensure concurrent assembly of the caged sarpagine scaffold and installation of requisite derivative handles. With a common caged intermediate as the branch point, by taking advantage of ketone and allene groups therein, total synthesis of five sarpagine alkaloids (affinisine, normacusine&#8197;B, trinervine, Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine, and vellosimine) with various substituents and three koumine alkaloids (koumine, koumimine, and N&#8208;demethylkoumine) with more complex cage scaffolds has been accomplished.

         <title>Bicyclic &#946;&#8208;Sheet Mimetics that Target the Transcriptional Coactivator &#946;&#8208;Catenin and Inhibit Wnt Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from a 52 amino acid protein binding epitope, a bicyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin structure was developed to bind the transcriptional coactivator &#946;&#8208;catenin. Our structure&#8208;based design approach was supported by screening a focused library of bicyclic mimetics which was generated via late&#8208;stage diversification. The most active bicyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin shows cell&#8208;penetration and inhibits Wnt signaling in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
Protein complexes are defined by the three&#8208;dimensional structure of participating binding partners. Knowledge about these structures can facilitate the design of peptidomimetics which have been applied for example, as inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs). Even though &#946;&#8208;sheets participate widely in PPIs, they have only rarely served as the basis for peptidomimetic PPI inhibitors, in particular when addressing intracellular targets. Here, we present the structure&#8208;based design of &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics targeting the intracellular protein &#946;&#8208;catenin, a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Based on a protein binding partner of &#946;&#8208;catenin, a macrocyclic peptide was designed and its crystal structure in complex with &#946;&#8208;catenin obtained. Using this structure, we designed a library of bicyclic &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics employing a late&#8208;stage diversification strategy. Several mimetics were identified that compete with transcription factor binding to &#946;&#8208;catenin and inhibit Wnt signaling in cells. The presented design strategy can support the development of inhibitors for other &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;mediated PPIs.

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescent Lateral Flow Immunoassay for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing of Acute Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ratiometric fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay is achieved by inner filter effect&#8208;mediated double&#8208;signal&#8208;reverse change, which not only enables highly sensitive quantitative analysis by combing with the smartphone platform, but also allows the visual readout of H&#8208;FABP concentration by the naked eye. The developed strip can be used for rapid and accurate point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of acute myocardial infarction.







Abstract
We report the development of a highly sensitive ratiometric fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (RFLFIA) strip for rapid and accurate detection of acute myocardial infarction biomarker, namely heart&#8208;type fatty acid binding protein (H&#8208;FABP). The RFLFIA strip works in terms of ratiometric change of fluorescence signal, arising from blending of fluorescence emitted by two composite nanostructures conjugated to capture and probe antibodies and inner filter effect of gold nanoparticles. In conjunction with using custom smartphone&#8208;based analytical device and tonality analysis, quantitative detection of H&#8208;FABP was achieved with a low limit of detection at 0.21&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1. The RFLFIA strip can generate a visually distinguishable green&#8208;to&#8208;red color change around the threshold concentration of H&#8208;FABP (6.2&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1), thus allowing the semi&#8208;quantitative diagnosis by the naked eye.

         <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Binding Sites in Tubulin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How many binding sites exist in the vital anticancer protein target tubulin? A combined computational and crystallographic fragment screening approach now answers this question and reveals 11 novel sites as well as 56 novel small&#8208;molecule ligands in tubulin.







Abstract
Tubulin plays essential roles in vital cellular activities and is the target of a wide range of proteins and ligands. Here, using a combined computational and crystallographic fragment screening approach, we addressed the question of how many binding sites exist in tubulin. We identified 27 distinct sites, of which 11 have not been described previously, and analyzed their relationship to known tubulin&#8211;protein and tubulin&#8211;ligand interactions. We further observed an intricate pocket communication network and identified 56 chemically diverse fragments that bound to 10 distinct tubulin sites. Our results offer a unique structural basis for the development of novel small molecules for use as tubulin modulators in basic research applications or as drugs. Furthermore, our method lays down a framework that may help to discover new pockets in other pharmaceutically important targets and characterize them in terms of chemical tractability and allosteric modulation.

         <title>Discovery of a low thermal conductivity&#160;oxide guided by probe structure&#160;prediction and machine learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the aperiodic titanate Ba  10  Y  6  Ti  4  O  27  with a room temperature thermal conductivity that equals the lowest reported for an oxide. The structure is characterised by discontinuous occupancy modulation of each of the sites, and can be considered as a quasicrystal. The resulting localisation of lattice vibrations suppresses phonon transport of heat. This new lead material for low thermal conductivity oxides is metastable and located within a quaternary phase field that has been previously explored &#8211; its isolation thus requires a precisely&#8208;defined synthetic protocol. The necessary narrowing of the search space for experimental investigation is achieved by evaluation of titanate crystal chemistry, prediction of unexplored structural motifs that will favour synthetically accessible new compositions and assessment of their properties with machine learning models.</dc:description>

         <title>Exciton&#8208;Mediated Energy Transfer in Heterojunction Enables Infrared Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under infrared&#8208;light irradiation, black phosphorus (BP) is directly excited, and energy could be nonradiatively transferred to CN by exciton interactions. The indirectly generated excitons in CN would be dissociated into free electrons and holes at the interface of BP/CN heterojunction, followed by the injection of holes to BP and the accumulation of electrons in CN.







Abstract
Although a few semiconductors can directly absorb infrared light, their intrinsic properties like improper band&#8208;edge position and strong electron&#8211;hole interaction restrict further photocatalytic applications. Herein, we propose an exciton&#8208;mediated energy transfer strategy for realizing efficient infrared light response in heterostructures. Using black phosphorous/polymeric carbon nitride (BP/CN) heterojunction, CN could be indirectly excited by infrared light with the aid of nonradiatively exciton&#8208;based energy transfer from BP. At the same time, excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers at the interface of BP/CN heterojunction, followed by hole injection to BP and electron retainment in CN. As a result of these unique photoexcitation processes, BP/CN heterojunction exhibits promoted conversion rate and selectivity in amine&#8211;amine oxidative coupling reaction even under infrared light irradiation. This study opens a new way for the design of efficient infrared light activating photocatalysts.

         <title>1,1,2&#8208;Ethenetriol: The Enol of Glycolic Acid, a High&#8208;Energy Prebiotic Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As low temperature conditions (e.g., in space) prohibit reactions requiring large activation energies, an alternative mechanism for follow&#8208;up transformations of highly stable molecules involves the reactions of higher&#8208;energy isomers that were generated in a different environment. Hence, one working model for the formation of larger organic molecules is their generation from high&#8208;lying isomers of otherwise rather stable molecules. As an example,&#160; we present here the synthesis, IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic identification of the previously elusive 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol (  2  ), the higher energy enol tautomer of glycolic acid, a rather stable and hence unreactive biological building block. The title compound was generated in the gas phase by flash vacuum pyrolysis of tartronic acid at 400 &#176;C and was subsequently trapped in argon matrices at 10 K. The spectral assignments are supported by B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G(2d,2p) computations. Upon photolysis at &#955;=180&#8211;254 nm,&#160;  2&#160;  rearranges to glycolic acid and ketene.</dc:description>

         <title>Degradation in order: simple and versatile one&#8208;pot combination of two macromolecular concepts to encode diverse and spatially regulated degradability functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clever one&#8208;pot combination of two macromolecular concepts, ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) and step&#8208;growth polymerization (SGP), is demonstrated to be a simple yet, powerful tool to design a library of sequence&#8208;controlled polymers with diverse and spatially regulated degradability functions. ROP and SGP, sequentially, occur at room temperature by switching the organo&#8208;catalytic conditions from basic to acidic, each allowing the encoding of specific degradable bonds. The ROP controls the sequence length and position of the degradability functions, while the SGP between the complementary vinyl ether and hydroxyl chain&#8208;end, enables the formation of acetal bonds and high molar mass copolymers. The result is the rational combination of cleavable bonds prone to either bulk or surface erosion along the same macromolecule. The strategy is versatile and offers higher chemical diversity and level of control over the primary structure than current aliphatic polyesters or polycarbonates while being simple, effective, atom&#8208;economical and having potential for scalability.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality Transfer from an Innately Chiral Nanocrystal Core to a Nematic Liquid Crystal: Surface&#8208;Modified Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast majority of nanomaterials studied in light of their ability to transmit chirality to or amplify their chirality in a surrounding medium, constitute an achiral core with chirality solely installed at the surface by conjugation or encapsulation with optically active ligands. Here we present the inverse approach focusing on surface&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with core chirality at both the molecular and the morphological level to quantify transmission and amplification of core chirality through space using a host nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208; LC) as reporter. We find that CNCs functionalized at the surface with achiral molecules, structurally related to the N&#8208;LC, exhibit better N&#8208;LC solubility, thereby serving as highly efficient chiral inducers. Moreover, functionalization with chiral molecules only marginally enhances the efficacy of helical distortion in the host N&#8208;LC matrix, indicating the high propensity of CNCs to transfer chirality from an inherently chiral core.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Strained All&#8208;Phenylene Siamese&#8208;Twin Bismacrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the precise synthesis of a 3D highly strained all&#8208;phenylene bismacrocycle, termed&#160;Siamese&#8208;twin&#160;(1,4)[10]cycloparaphenylenophane (SCPP[10]). This structure consists of a twist benzene ring which is bridged twice by phenylene units anchored in two para&#8208;positions. The Siamese&#8208;twin structure of SCPP[10] was confirmed in real space at the atomic scale by scanning tunneling microscopy. Theoretical calculations indicate that this bismacrocycle has a very high strain energy of 110.59 kcal/mol and the largest interphenylene torsion angle of 46.07&#176; caused by multiple repulsive interactions. Furthermore, a 1:2 host&#8208;guest complex of SCPP[10] and [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester was investigated, which represents the first peanut&#8208;shaped 1:2 host&#8208;guest complex based on bismacrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fully Coplanar D&#8208;A Polymeric Semiconductor with Promoted Charge Separation Kinetics for Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge generation and separation have been regarded as the main constraints limiting the photocatalytic activity of polymeric photocatalysts. Herein  , two new linear polyarylether&#8208;based polymers (PAE&#8208;CPs) with different linking patterns between their donor and acceptor motifs have been tailor&#8208;made to investigate the influences of different linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process. Theoretical and experimental results unravel that compared to the traditional single&#8208;stranded linking pattern, the double&#8208;stranded linking pattern theoretically  helps to strengthen donor&#8208;acceptor interaction of PAE&#8208;CPs and generate the coplanar structure to facilitate the charge generation and separation, as well as red&#8208;shift light absorption. With these prominent advantages, the PAE&#8208;D with double&#8208;stranded linking pattern assumes a greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity than the single&#8208;stranded linking pattern analogue (PAE&#8208;S), facilitating the rational design and modification of organic semiconductors for charge&#8208;induced reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Exciton Binding Energies Enabling Direct Charge Photogeneration Towards Low&#8208;Driving&#8208;Force Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) with nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) exhibit efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets, leading to over 18% efficiency for the single&#8208;junction devices based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NFA of Y6. Herein, to reveal the underlying charge generation mechanisms, we have investigated the exciton binding energy (  E  b  ) in Y6 by a joint theoretical and experimental study. The results show that owing to strong charge polarization effects, Y6 has remarkable small  E  b  of &#8208;0.11~0.15 eV, which is even lower than perovskites in many cases. Moreover, it is peculiar that the photoluminescence is enhanced with temperature, and the energy barrier for separating excitons into charges is evidently lower than the thermal energy according to the temperature dependence of photoluminescence, manifesting direct photogeneration of charge carriers enabled by weak  E  b  in Y6. Thus, charge generation in NFA&#8208;based OSCs shows little dependence on interfacial driving forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Probes for Aggregated Protein Imaging via Michael Addition</title>

Squeeze and react: a bio&#8208;inspired fluorescence color&#8208;switch probe uncovers that covalent Michael addition can generally occur inside aggregated proteins.







Abstract
Covalent chemical reactions to modify aggregated proteins are rare. Here, we reported covalent Michael addition can generally occur upon protein aggregation. Such reactivity was initially discovered by a bioinspired fluorescent color&#8208;switch probe mimicking the photo&#8208;conversion mechanism of Kaede fluorescent protein. This probe was dark with folded proteins but turned on red fluorescence (620&#8197;nm) when it non&#8208;covalently bound to misfolded proteins. Supported by the biochemical and mass spectrometry results, the probe chemoselectively reacted with the reactive cysteines of aggregated proteins via covalent Michael addition and gradually switched to green fluorescence (515&#8197;nm) upon protein aggregation. Exploiting this Michael addition chemistry in the malachite green dye derivatives demonstrated its general applicability and chemical tunability, resulting in different fluorescence color&#8208;switch responses. Our work may offer a new avenue to explore other chemical reactions upon protein aggregation and design covalent probes for imaging, chemical proteomics, and therapeutic purposes.

Our work may offer a new avenue to explore other chemical reactions upon protein aggregation and design covalent probes for imaging, chemical proteomics, and therapeutic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Assisted Cation Adduction and Fragmentation of Small Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11310-11317, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticle&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry is studied for cation adduction and fragmentation of small metabolites. This work establishes the rules of cation&#8211;metabolite affinity and multiple cation adductions in charge transfer, characterizes the loss of given groups during fragmentation, and enhances the atomic/fragment coverage as defined for metabolite identification toward profiling.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry (MS) promises small&#8208;metabolite profiling as a tool of the future and calls for the comprehensive understanding of key procedures to enhance its capability. Herein, we studied cation adduction and fragmentation of small metabolites by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, via nanoparticle&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (LDI)&#8208;MS and MS/MS. We calculated the energies of adduction conformers and atomic bond orders to establish the rules of cation&#8211;metabolite affinity and multiple cation adductions in charge transfer. Further, we demonstrated the reaction paths of adducted ions and mapped the potential energy surfaces to characterize the loss of given groups during fragmentation. Finally, we successfully controlled metabolite fragmentation by selected and multiple adductions to enhance the atomic/fragment coverage as defined for metabolite identification toward profiling. Considering the success of MS in the analysis of large biomolecules, our work may have an impact and guide to advanced analysis of small metabolites.

         <title>Chiral Superatomic Nanoclusters Ag47 Induced by the Ligation of Amino Acids</title>

Amino acids protected silver nanoclusters with Ag0 atoms [Ag47L12(C&#8801;CtBu)16]BF4 (L=l&#8208;/d&#8208; valine or l&#8208;/d&#8208; isoleucine) have been synthesized for the first time. The Ag47 kernel consists of a tetracapped truncated tetrahedron (Ag17) and six W&#8208;shaped Ag5 units. They are superatoms with 1S21P61D10 configuration as revealed by DFT calculations. This work offers a facile method to obtain chiral nanoclusters by incorporating amino acids.







Abstract
Silver nanoclusters containing Ag0 atoms protected by amino acids were synthesized and characterized. Chiral superatomic silver nanoclusters [Ag47L12(C&#8801;CtBu)16]BF4 (L=l&#8208;/d&#8208;valine or l&#8208;/d&#8208;isoleucine) have been prepared by reducing AgC&#8801;CtBu and amino acids (AAs) with NaBH4. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that these clusters have T symmetry, and the Ag47 metal kernel can be viewed as a tetracapped truncated tetrahedron (Ag17) surrounded with six W&#8208;shaped Ag5 units. The clusters are homochiral as evidenced by CD measurements. As for the strong CD signals, large contributions are found from the occupied Ag s,p states (superatomic D states) near the Fermi level. Electron counting revealed that these clusters are 18&#8208;electron systems, suggesting they are superatomic clusters. The superatomic nature with a 1S21P61D10 configuration was supported by DFT calculations. This work paves the way of taking AAs as facile chiral induction agents for the synthesis of metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Prediction of Reactive Nitrous Acid Formation in Rare&#8208;Earth MOFs via ab&#8197;initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11514-11522, May 10, 2021. </description>

Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used to predict competitive adsorption of mixed acid gases (NO2 and H2O) and the in&#8208;pore reaction mechanisms for a series of rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks with DOBDC linkers. For the first time, spontaneous formation of nitrous acid (HONO) is identified as a result of deprotonation of the MOF organic linker.







Abstract
Reactive gas formation in pores of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a known mechanism of framework destruction; understanding those mechanisms for future durability design is key to next generation adsorbents. Herein, an extensive set of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used for the first time to predict competitive adsorption of mixed acid gases (NO2 and H2O) and the in&#8208;pore reaction mechanisms for a series of rare earth (RE)&#8208;DOBDC MOFs. Spontaneous formation of nitrous acid (HONO) is identified as a result of deprotonation of the MOF organic linker, DOBDC. The unique DOBDC coordination to the metal clusters allows for proton transfer from the linker to the NO2 without the presence of H2O and may be a factor in DOBDC MOF durability. This is a previously unreported mechanisms of HONO formation in MOFs. With the presented methodology, prediction of future gas interactions in new nanoporous materials can be achieved.

         <title>Non&#8208;Solvating and Low&#8208;Dielectricity Cosolvent for Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphases in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11442-11447, May 10, 2021. </description>

The introduction of cosolvents with non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;dielectricity (NL) properties can intrinsically enhance the interaction between anion and Li+ and regulate the solvation structures in electrolytes, which favors an upgraded anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anodes hold great promise for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, while the insufficient fundamental understanding of the complex solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is the major obstacle for the full demonstration of their potential in working batteries. The characteristics of SEI highly depend on the inner solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). Herein, we clarify the critical significance of cosolvent properties on both Li+ solvation structure and the SEI formation on working Li metal anodes. Non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;dielectricity (NL) cosolvents intrinsically enhance the interaction between anion and Li+ by affording a low dielectric environment. The abundant positively charged anion&#8211;cation aggregates generated as the introduction of NL cosolvents are preferentially brought to the negatively charged Li anode surface, inducing an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. A solvent diagram is further built to illustrate that a solvent with both proper relative binding energy toward Li+ and dielectric constant is suitable as NL cosolvent.

         <title>Steric Hindrance in Metal Coordination Drives the Separation of Pyridine Regioisomers Using Rhodium(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra</title>

Soluble RhII&#8208;MOPs have been implemented in liquid&#8211;liquid extraction systems to separate pyridine&#8208;based regioisomers. A steric hindrance&#8208;driven mechanism has been harnessed to selectively coordinate one regioisomer to the exohedral position of the dirhodium paddlewheel thus generating a solubility difference between the coordinated and the non&#8208;coordinated pyridine. This mechanism was elucidated through molecular dynamics and wet experiments.







Abstract
The physicochemical similarity of isomers makes their chemical separation through conventional techniques energy intensive. Herein, we report that, instead of using traditional encapsulation&#8208;driven processes, steric hindrance in metal coordination on the outer surface of RhII&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) can be used to separate pyridine&#8208;based regioisomers via liquid&#8211;liquid extraction. Through molecular dynamics simulations and wet experiments, we discovered that the capacity of pyridines to coordinatively bind to Rh&#8208;MOPs is determined by the positions of the pyridine substituents relative to the pyridine nitrogen and is influenced by steric hindrance. Thus, we exploited the differential solubility of bound and non&#8208;bound pyridine regioisomers to engineer liquid&#8211;liquid self&#8208;sorting systems. As a proof of concept, we separated four different equimolecular mixtures of regioisomers, including a mixture of the industrially relevant compounds 2&#8208;chloropyridine and 3&#8208;chloropyridine, isolating highly pure compounds in all cases.

Chemical fueling enables complex self&#8208;replicating molecules to outcompete structurally simpler and faster replicators, revealing an important mechanism behind complexification that is required to transform chemistry into biology.







Abstract
Unravelling how the complexity of living systems can (have) emerge(d) from simple chemical reactions is one of the grand challenges in contemporary science. Evolving systems of self&#8208;replicating molecules may hold the key to this question. Here we show that, when a system of replicators is subjected to a regime where replication competes with replicator destruction, simple and fast replicators can give way to more complex and slower ones. The structurally more complex replicator was found to be functionally more proficient in the catalysis of a model reaction. These results show that chemical fueling can maintain systems of replicators out of equilibrium, populating more complex replicators that are otherwise not readily accessible. Such complexification represents an important requirement for achieving open&#8208;ended evolution as it should allow improved and ultimately also new functions to emerge.

Previously, we showcased Z&#8208;selective Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman&#8208;type [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of aryl sulfoxides. In contrast, we describe herein the MBH&#8208;type rearrangement of aryl iodanes with the opposite stereoselectivity. Both protocols complement each other allowing for the synthesis of E&#8208; or Z&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl derivatives on demand.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls represent an important class of derivatizable synthetic intermediates, however, the synthesis of such compounds still remains a challenge. Recently, we showcased a novel Z&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles with aryl sulfoxides via [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement involving an Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) process. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of reversing the stereoselectivity of such MBH&#8208;type [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement by switching to a new pair of rearrangement partners consisting of aryl iodanes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxazolines. As a result, the two protocols complement each other in approaching E&#8208; or Z&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl derivatives. Mechanistic studies reveal a possible reaction pathway and provide an explanation for the opposite stereoselectivities.

         <title>Post&#8208;Functionalization of Supramolecular Polymers on Surface and the Chiral Assembly&#8208;Induced Enantioselective Reaction</title>

The first on&#8208;surface post&#8208;functionalization of two supramolecular polymers (SPs) derived from the same porphyrin precursor has been achieved via cross&#8208;coupling. Metal&#8208;coordinated SPs were easily decorated at both edges with 4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl via Heck reaction, while self&#8208;assembled chiral SPs underwent enantioselective cross&#8208;coupling with 4&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl to acquire homochiral functional units.







Abstract
Although post&#8208;functionalization is extensively used to introduce diverse functional groups into supramolecular polymers (SPs) in solution, post&#8208;functionalization of SPs on surfaces still remains unexplored. Here we achieved the on&#8208;surface post&#8208;functionalization of two SPs derived from 5,10,15&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;20&#8208;bromophenyl porphyrin (Br&#8208;TPyP) via cross&#8208;coupling reactions on Au(111). The ladder&#8208;shaped, Cu&#8208;coordinated SPs preformed from Br&#8208;TPyP were functionalized through Heck reaction with 4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl. In the absence of Cu, Br&#8208;TPyP formed chiral SPs as two enantiomers via self&#8208;assembly, which were functionalized via divergent cross&#8208;coupling reaction with 4&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (ICBP). Surprisingly, this reaction was discovered as an enantioselective on&#8208;surface reaction induced by the chirality of SPs. Mechanistic analysis and DFT calculations indicated that after debromination of Br&#8208;TPyP and the first addition of ICBP, only one attack direction of ICBP to the chiral SP intermediate is permissive in the second addition step due to the steric hindrance, which guaranteed the high enantioselectivity of the reaction.

Smart two&#8208;dimensional composite membranes containing flexible metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MONs) and graphene oxide nanosheets are developed for pressure&#8208;responsive CO2 separations through a CO2&#8208;induced &#8220;gate opening&#8221; effect. Huge jumps of CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity occur above the gate&#8208;opening pressure of the flexible MONs, indicating a stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior with greatly enhanced CO2 separation performance.







Abstract
The regulation of permeance and selectivity in membrane systems may allow effective relief of conventional energy&#8208;intensive separations. Here, pressure&#8208;responsive ultrathin membranes (&#8776;100&#8197;nm) fabricated by compositing flexible two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MONs) with graphene oxide nanosheets for CO2 separation are reported. By controlling the gas permeation direction to leverage the pressure&#8208;responsive phase transition of the MONs, CO2&#8208;induced gate opening and closing behaviors are observed in the resultant membranes, which are accompanied with the sharp increase of CO2 permeance (from 173.8 to 1144 gas permeation units) as well as CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities (from 4.1 to 22.8 and from 4 to 19.6, respectively). The flexible behaviors and separation mechanism are further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work establishes the relevance of structural transformation&#8208;based framework dynamics chemistry in smart membrane systems.

         <title>pH Feedback Lifecycles Programmed by Enzymatic Logic Gates Using Common Foods as Fuels</title>

         <dc:description>
A tandem of a lag&#8208;free YES gate and an enzymatic NAND gate with delay orchestrates a temporal pH feedback system: the YES gate lifts the system to a promoted state in seconds, and the NAND gate embedded with either invertase&#8208;glucose oxidase or &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;glucose oxidase chain drives it back to ground state with programmable lifetime. The system is very robust and able to use common foods as fuels.







Abstract
Artificial temporal signaling systems, which mimic living out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions, have made large progress. However, systems programmed by enzymatic reaction networks in multicomponent and unknown environments, and using biocompatible components remain a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an approach to program temporal pH signals by enzymatic logic gates. They are realized by an enzymatic disaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;monosaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;sugar acid reaction cascade catalyzed by two metabolic chains: invertase&#8208;glucose oxidase and &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;glucose oxidase, respectively. Lifetimes of the transient pH signal can be programmed from less than 15&#8197;min to more than 1&#8197;day. We study enzymatic kinetics of the reaction cascades and reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Operating with all&#8208;food grade chemicals and coupling to self&#8208;regulating hydrogel, our system is quite robust to work in a complicated medium with unknown components and in a biocompatible fashion.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Borosulfate with Incommensurate Modulations</title>

The unprecedented coexistence of deep&#8208;UV transparency, nonlinear optical response, and incommensurate structural modulations in a new borosulfate LiRb4[B(SO4)4] brings new possibilities to understand the underlying concepts of physics and chemistry in aperiodic materials.







Abstract
Despite borate&#8208;sulfates composed of isolated borate and sulfate groups have been discovered for more than one century, borosulfates of B&#8208;O&#8208;S bonding have not been synthesized until 2012 and their properties remain rarely explored. Here, we report a new borosulfate, namely LiRb4[B(SO4)4], which shows potential as a bran&#8208;new class of deep&#8208;UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material. Remarkably, according to the in&#8197;situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, LiRb4[B(SO4)4] undergoes successive first&#8208;order phase transitions with incommensurate structural modulations under room temperature and low temperature with (3 + 1)D superspace groups of X2(&#945;0&#947;)0 and P21(&#945;0&#947;)0, respectively. The first&#8208;principle calculations and structural analyses reveal that NLO properties, phase transitions, and incommensurate modulations are closely related to the [B(SO4)4]5&#8722; super&#8208;tetrahedral units with B&#8208;O&#8208;S bonding. We anticipate that the unprecedented coexistence of deep&#8208;UV transparency, NLO responses, and incommensurate structural modulations in one borosulfate will bring new possibilities to understand the underlying concepts of physics and chemistry in aperiodic materials.

         <title>Biosynthesis of 6&#8208;Hydroxymellein Requires a Collaborating Polyketide Synthase&#8208;like Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11423-11429, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new architecture for iterative Type&#8197;I polyketide synthases (PKS) from fungi has been investigated. TerA is a canonical non&#8208;reducing PKS which interacts with TerB, a fragment of a highly reducing PKS containing a functional ketoreductase. Interaction appears to be mediated between a non&#8208;functional dehydratase domain of TerB and the TerA product template domain. Working together, TerAB synthesises 6&#8208;hydroxymellein, a precursor of terrein and other fungal metabolites.







Abstract
The polyketide synthase (PKS)&#8208;like protein TerB, consisting of inactive dehydratase, inactive C&#8208;methyltransferase, and functional ketoreductase domains collaborates with the iterative non reducing PKS TerA to produce 6&#8208;hydroxymellein, a key pathway intermediate during the biosynthesis of various fungal natural products. The catalytically inactive dehydratase domain of TerB appears to mediate productive interactions with TerA, demonstrating a new mode of trans&#8208;interaction between iterative PKS components.

         <title>Designer Anticancer Nanoprodrugs with Self&#8208;Toxification Activity Realized by Acid&#8208;triggered Biodegradation and In&#8197;Situ Fragment Complexation</title>

A new paradigm of nanoprodrugs with a degradation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;toxification design is introduced. Organic&#8208;modified hollow silica/Pd(OH)2 nanocomposites are constructed for pH&#8208;responsive biodegradation and subsequent in&#8197;situ complexation of the predesigned molecular fragments into cytotoxic complexes, thereby fulfilling effective cancer therapy by turning degradation by&#8208;products into therapeutics without using conventional chemodrugs.







Abstract
Prodrugs that allow in&#8197;situ chemical conversion of less toxic precursors into active drugs in response to certain stimuli are promising anticancer candidates. Herein, we present a novel design of nanoprodrugs with a &#8220;degradation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;toxification&#8221; strategy, which realizes intracellular synthesis of anticancer agents using the nanoparticles&#8217; own degradation fragments as the precursors. To fulfill this concept, a metal complexing dicyclohexylphosphine (DCP) organosilane is carefully screened out from various ligands to conjugate onto Pd(OH)2 nanodots confined hollow silica nanospheres (PD&#8208;HSN). This constructed nanoprodrug shows acid&#8208;triggered degradation in lysosomes and neutralizes protons to induce lysosomes rupturing, generating predesigned less toxic fragments (Pd2+ and DCP&#8208;silicates) that complex into DCP/Pd complex in&#8197;situ for inducing DNA damage, leading to enhanced anticancer activity against various cancer cell lines as well as in a xenograft tumour model.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prodrugs that allow in&#8197;situ chemical conversion of less toxic precursors into active drugs in response to certain stimuli are promising anticancer candidates. Herein, we present a novel design of nanoprodrugs with a &#8220;degradation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;toxification&#8221; strategy, which realizes intracellular synthesis of anticancer agents using the nanoparticles&#8217; own degradation fragments as the precursors. To fulfill this concept, a metal complexing dicyclohexylphosphine (DCP) organosilane is carefully screened out from various ligands to conjugate onto Pd(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanodots confined hollow silica nanospheres (PD&#8208;HSN). This constructed nanoprodrug shows acid&#8208;triggered degradation in lysosomes and neutralizes protons to induce lysosomes rupturing, generating predesigned less toxic fragments (Pd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and DCP&#8208;silicates) that complex into DCP/Pd complex in&#8197;situ for inducing DNA damage, leading to enhanced anticancer activity against various cancer cell lines as well as in a xenograft tumour model.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dense&#8208;Stacking Porous Conjugated Polymer as Reactive&#8208;Type Host for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>

A dense&#8208;stacking hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) porous polymer is reported. The compact polymer/S cathode (ca. 15&#8197;mgs&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 200&#8208;&#956;m thickness) presents a low cathode porosity of 41&#8201;% and high areal capacity (&gt;10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in a lean electrolyte of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. The lithiation/delithiation of HATN polymer by Li2Sx facilitates the formation of intimately bound nanostructured Li2S/S on the bulky polymer host, leading to fast Li2S/S kinetics.







Abstract
Commercialization of the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery is hampered by bottlenecks like low sulfur loading, high cathode porosity, uncontrollable Li2Sx deposition and sluggish kinetics of Li2S activation. Herein, we developed a densely stacked redox&#8208;active hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) polymer with a surface area of 302&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a very high bulk density of ca. 1.60&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3. Uniquely, HATN polymer has a similar redox potential window to S, which facilitates the binding of Li2Sx and its transformation chemistry within the bulky polymer host, leading to fast Li2S/S kinetics. The compact polymer/S electrode presents a high sulfur loading of ca. 15&#8197;mgs&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (200&#8208;&#956;m thickness) with a low cathode porosity of 41&#8201;%. It delivers a high areal capacity of ca. 14&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability (200&#8197;cycles) at electrolyte&#8211;sulfur (E/S) ratio of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgs&#8722;1. The assembled pouch cell delivers a cell&#8208;level high energy density of 303&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 392&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1.

         <title>Studies on the Lithiation, Borylation, and 1,2&#8208;Metalate Rearrangement of O&#8208;Cycloalkyl 2,4,6&#8208;Triisopropylbenzoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11436-11441, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of O&#8208;cycloalkyl benzoates were studied to understand their ability to undergo a lithiation&#8211;borylation reaction. Ring size was the key feature: too large and the system could not be lithiated; too small and the system could not undergo 1,2&#8208;migration. The cyclobutyl system occupies a &#8220;Goldilock's zone&#8221; where the lithiation&#8211;borylation reaction works well and shows broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A broad range of acyclic primary and secondary 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylbenzoate (TIB) esters have been used in lithiation&#8208;borylation reactions, but cyclic TIB esters have not. We have studied the use of cyclic TIB esters in lithiation&#8208;borylation reactions and looked at the effect of ring size (3&#8208; &#8594; 6&#8208;membered rings) on the three key steps of the lithiation&#8208;borylation protocol: deprotonation, borylation and 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Although all rings sizes could be deprotonated, the cyclohexyl case was impractically slow, and the cyclopentyl example underwent &#945;&#8208;elimination faster than deprotonation at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C and so could not be used. Both cyclobutyl and cyclopropyl cases underwent rapid borylation, but only the cyclobutyl substrate underwent 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Thus, the cyclobutyl TIB ester occupies a &#8220;Goldilocks zone,&#8221; being small enough for deprotonation and large enough to enable 1,2&#8208;migration. The generality of the reaction was explored with a broad range of boronic esters.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Electron Diffraction Reveals a Hidden Novel Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Electrocatalysis</title>

Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction can be used as a high&#8208;throughput technique for discovering new materials, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, especially when they are synthesized in a phase mixture.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are known for their versatile combination of inorganic building units and organic linkers, which offers immense opportunities in a wide range of applications. However, many MOFs are typically synthesized as multiphasic polycrystalline powders, which are challenging for studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Therefore, developing new structural characterization techniques is highly desired in order to accelerate discoveries of new materials. Here, we report a high&#8208;throughput approach for structural analysis of MOF nano&#8208; and sub&#8208;microcrystals by three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3DED). A new zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate framework (ZIF), denoted ZIF&#8208;EC1, was first discovered in a trace amount during the study of a known ZIF&#8208;CO3&#8208;1 material by 3DED. The structures of both ZIFs were solved and refined using 3DED data. ZIF&#8208;EC1 has a dense 3D framework structure, which is built by linking mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;nuclear Zn clusters and 2&#8208;methylimidazolates (mIm&#8722;). With a composition of Zn3(mIm)5(OH), ZIF&#8208;EC1 exhibits high N and Zn densities. We show that the N&#8208;doped carbon material derived from ZIF&#8208;EC1 is a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The discovery of this new MOF and its conversion to an efficient electrocatalyst highlights the power of 3DED in developing new materials and their applications.

         <title>Optical Manipulation of Subcellular Protein Translocation Using a Photoactivatable Covalent Labeling System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11378-11383, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable chemically induced dimerization (photo&#8208;CID) system based on covalent protein&#8208;labeling technologies was developed by rationally designing a new caged ligand. This photo&#8208;CID system enabled light&#8208;induced protein translocation from the cytoplasm to subcellular regions such as the nucleus, mitochondrial outer membrane, and plasma membrane. Furthermore, quick protein translocation into a laser&#8208;illuminated subcellular microregion was achieved.







Abstract
The photoactivatable chemically induced dimerization (photo&#8208;CID) technique for tag&#8208;fused proteins is one of the most promising methods for regulating subcellular protein translocations and protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, light&#8208;induced covalent protein dimerization in living cells has yet to be established, despite its various advantages. Herein, we developed a photoactivatable covalent protein&#8208;labeling technology by applying a caged ligand to the BL&#8208;tag system, a covalent protein labeling system that uses mutant &#946;&#8208;lactamase. We further developed CBHD, a caged protein dimerizer, using caged BL&#8208;tag and HaloTag ligands, and achieved light&#8208;induced protein translocation from the cytoplasm to subcellular regions. In addition, this covalent photo&#8208;CID system enabled quick protein translocation to a laser&#8208;illuminated microregion. These results indicate that the covalent photo&#8208;CID system will expand the scope of CID applications in the optical manipulation of cellular functions.

&lt;p&gt;A photoactivatable chemically induced dimerization (photo&#8208;CID) system based on covalent protein&#8208;labeling technologies was developed by rationally designing a new caged ligand. This photo&#8208;CID system enabled light&#8208;induced protein translocation from the cytoplasm to subcellular regions such as the nucleus, mitochondrial outer membrane, and plasma membrane. Furthermore, quick protein translocation into a laser&#8208;illuminated subcellular microregion was achieved.

         <title>Adapting and Remolding: Orchestrating Tumor Microenvironment Normalization with Photodynamic Therapy by Size Transformable Nanoframeworks</title>

We designed a core&#8208;satellite nanoframework (T&#8208;PFRT) that can synchronously adapt to and remold tumor microenvironment (TME) via MMP2&#8208;triggered size transformation, TGF&#946; inhibition&#8208;mediated stroma remodeling and hemoglobin&#8208;enabled hypoxia relief. By coordinating TME normalization with photodynamic therapy (PDT), superior therapeutic outcomes could be gained in the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors.







Abstract
Abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME) facilitates tumor proliferation and metastasis and establishes physiological barriers for effective transport of therapeutics inside the tumor, posing great challenges for cancer treatment. We designed a core&#8208;satellite size transformable nanoframework (denoted as T&#8208;PFRT) that can synchronously adapt to and remold TME for augmenting photodynamic therapy to inhibit tumor growth and prevent tumor metastasis. Upon matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;responsive dissociation of the nanoframework in TME, the core structure loaded with TGF&#946; signaling pathway inhibitor and oxygen&#8208;carrying hemoglobin aims to stroma remodeling and hypoxia relief, allowing photosensitizer&#8208;encapsulated satellite particles to penetrate to deep&#8208;seated tumor for oxygen&#8208;fueled photodynamic therapy. T&#8208;PFRT could overcome the stroma and hypoxia barriers for delivering therapeutics and gain excellent therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>Metallated Graphynes as a New Class of Photofunctional 2D Organometallic Nanosheets</title>

Bottom&#8208;up 2D metallated graphyne nanosheets exhibit their outstanding broadband nonlinear saturable absorption properties and can be used as excellent saturable absorbers in the passively Q&#8208;switched Nd:YAG laser.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are attracting much attention due to their excellent electronic and optical properties. Here, we report the first experimental preparation of two free&#8208;standing mercurated graphyne nanosheets via the interface&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up method, which integrates both the advantages of metal center and graphyne. The continuous large&#8208;area nanosheets derived from the chemical growth show the layered molecular structural arrangement, controllable thickness and enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which result in their stable and outstanding broadband nonlinear saturable absorption (SA) properties (at both 532 and 1064&#8197;nm). The passively Q&#8208;switched (PQS) performances of these two nanosheets as the saturable absorbers are comparable to or higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D nanomaterials (such as graphene, black phosphorus, MoS2, &#947;&#8208;graphyne, etc.). Our results illustrate that the two metallated graphynes could act not only as a new class of 2D carbon&#8208;rich materials, but also as inexpensive and easily available optoelectronic materials for device fabrication.

         <title>Less Unfavorable Salt Bridges on the Enzyme Surface Result in More Organic Cosolvent Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11448-11456, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By removing unfavorable surface salt bridges, the organic solvent and thermal resistance of enzymes can be significantly improved. This design strategy results in locally refined flexibility and strengthened hydration.







Abstract
Biocatalysis for the synthesis of fine chemicals is highly attractive but usually requires organic (co&#8208;)solvents (OSs). However, native enzymes often have low activity and resistance in OSs and at elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a smart salt bridge design strategy for simultaneously improving OS resistance and thermostability of the model enzyme, Bacillus subtilits Lipase&#8197;A (BSLA). We combined comprehensive experimental studies of 3450 BSLA variants and molecular dynamics simulations of 36 systems. Iterative recombination of four beneficial substitutions yielded superior resistant variants with up to 7.6&#8208;fold (D64K/D144K) improved resistance toward three OSs while exhibiting significant thermostability (thermal resistance up to 137&#8208;fold, and half&#8208;life up to 3.3&#8208;fold). Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that locally refined flexibility and strengthened hydration jointly govern the highly increased resistance in OSs and at 50&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C. The salt bridge redesign provides protein engineers with a powerful and likely general approach to design OSs&#8208; and/or thermal&#8208;resistant lipases and other &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolases.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved and Comprehensive Analysis of Surface Glycoproteins Reveals Distinct Responses of Monocytes and Macrophages to Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11494-11503, May 10, 2021. </description>

Glycoproteins on the surface of monocytes and macrophages were systematically quantified during the bacterial infection. The time&#8208;resolved analysis revealed transient changes and differential remodeling of these glycoproteins on both types of cells. Novel surface glycoproteins participating in the immune response were discovered, and site&#8208;specific glycosylation changes were identified.







Abstract
Glycoproteins on the surface of immune cells play extremely important roles in response to pathogens. Yet, a systematic and time&#8208;resolved investigation of surface glycoproteins during the immune response remains to be explored. Integrating selective enrichment of surface glycoproteins with multiplexed proteomics, we globally and site&#8208;specifically quantified the dynamics of surface glycoproteins on THP&#8208;1 monocytes and macrophages in response to bacterial infection and during the monocyte&#8208;to&#8208;macrophage differentiation. The time&#8208;resolved analysis reveals transient changes and differential remodeling of surface glycoproteins on both cell types, and potential upstream regulators and downstream effects of the regulated glycoproteins. Besides, we identified novel surface glycoproteins participating in the immune response such as APMAP, and site&#8208;specific changes of glycoproteins. This study provides unprecedented information to deepen our understanding of glycoproteins and cellular activities.

         <title>Liposomes as Carriers of Membrane&#8208;Associated Proteins and Peptides for Mass Spectrometric Analysis</title>

Proteoliposome carriers for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane&#8208;associated proteins and peptides enable the investigation of lipid clusters, protein oligomers, and protein&#8211;lipid interactions. This approach is versatile, applicable to many peripheral membrane proteins/peptides, and can be linked with functional assays.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are key players of the cell. Their structure and the interactions they form with their lipid environment are required to understand their function. Here we explore liposomes as membrane mimetics for mass spectrometric analysis of peripheral membrane proteins and peptides. Liposomes are advantageous over other membrane mimetics in that they are easy to prepare, can be varied in size and composition, and are suitable for functional assays. We demonstrate that they dissociate into lipid clusters in the gas phase of a mass spectrometer while intact protein and protein&#8211;lipid complexes are retained. We exemplify this approach by employing different liposomes including proteoliposomes of two model peptides/proteins differing in size. Our results pave the way for the general application of liposomes for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane&#8208;associated proteins.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Cobalt(II) Catalysis: Scope and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11384-11390, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic and acyclic tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids is demonstrated via CoII catalysis. Broad substrate scope is achieved, yielding chiral carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol. A CoII catalytic cycle involving migratory insertion and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis processes is posited whereby steric substrate ligand effects promote enantiocontrol.







Abstract
Chiral carboxylic acids are important compounds because of their prevalence in pharmaceuticals, natural products and agrochemicals. Asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids has been widely recognized as one of the most efficient synthetic approaches to afford such compounds. Although related asymmetric hydrogenation of di&#8208; and trisubstituted unsaturated acids with noble metals is well established, asymmetric hydrogenation of challenging tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids is rarely reported. We demonstrate enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic and acyclic tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids via cobalt(II) catalysis. This protocol showed broad substrate scope and gave chiral carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol (up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies support a CoII catalytic cycle involving migratory insertion and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis processes. DFT calculations reveal that enantioselectivity may originate from the steric effect between the phenyl groups of the ligand and the substrate.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Initial Coulombic Efficiency Induced by Interface Engineering Enables Rapid, Stable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11481-11486, May 10, 2021. </description>

A defect&#8208;repairing&#8208;induced dot&#8211;matrix distributed interface efficiently catalyzes electrolyte decomposition. This strategy enables an ultra&#8208;thin and robust solid&#8211;electrolyte interface achieving ultra&#8208;high initial coulombic efficiency in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
High initial coulombic efficiency is highly desired because it implies effective interface construction and few electrolyte consumption, indicating enhanced batteries&#8217; life and power output. In this work, a high&#8208;capacity sodium storage material with FeS2 nanoclusters (&#8776;1&#8211;2&#8197;nm) embedded in N, S&#8208;doped carbon matrix (FeS2/N,S&#8208;C) was synthesized, the surface of which displays defects&#8208;repaired characteristic and detectable dot&#8208;matrix distributed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C bonds. After the initial discharging process, the uniform ultra&#8208;thin NaF&#8208;rich (&#8776;6.0&#8197;nm) solid electrolyte interphase was obtained, thereby achieving verifiable ultra&#8208;high initial coulombic efficiency (&#8776;92&#8201;%). The defects&#8208;repaired surface provides perfect platform, and the catalysis of dot&#8208;matrix distributed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C bonds to the rapid decomposing of NaSO3CF3 and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether successfully accelerate the building of two&#8208;dimensional ultra&#8208;thin solid electrolyte interphase. DFT calculations further confirmed the catalysis mechanism. As a result, the constructed FeS2/N,S&#8208;C provides high reversible capacity (749.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cycle stability (92.7&#8201;%, 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Especially, at &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C, it also obtains a reversible capacity of 211.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Assembled pouch&#8208;type cell performs potential application. The insight in this work provides a bright way to interface design for performance improvement in batteries.

         <title>Residual Chlorine Induced Cationic Active Species on a Porous Copper Electrocatalyst for Highly Stable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11487-11493, May 10, 2021. </description>

A porous Cu electrocatalyst showed long&#8208;term stability for over 240&#8197;h in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The mixed Cu0 and Cu+ oxidation state induced by the residual Cl and the porous sheet&#8208;like morphology were the key to the catalytic stability.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive approach to deal with the emission of CO2 and to produce valuable fuels and chemicals in a carbon&#8208;neutral way. Many efforts have been devoted to boost the activity and selectivity of high&#8208;value multicarbon products (C2+) on Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, Cu&#8208;based CO2RR electrocatalysts suffer from poor catalytic stability mainly due to the structural degradation and loss of active species under CO2RR condition. To date, most reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts present stabilities over dozens of hours, which limits the advance of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO2RR. Herein, a porous chlorine&#8208;doped Cu electrocatalyst exhibits high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 53.8&#8201;% at &#8722;1.00&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE). Importantly, the catalyst exhibited an outstanding catalytic stability in long&#8208;term electrocatalysis over 240&#8197;h. Experimental results show that the chlorine&#8208;induced stable cationic Cu0/Cu+ species and the well&#8208;preserved structure with abundant active sites are critical to the high FE of C2+ in the long&#8208;term run of electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>One&#8208;step Ethylene Purification from an Acetylene/Ethylene/Ethane Ternary Mixture by Cyclopentadiene Cobalt&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

A new modification method for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can realize one&#8208;step purification of ethylene in ternary gas mixture with a single adsorbent. 







Abstract
The separation of ethylene (C2H4) from a mixture of ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), and acetylene (C2H2) at normal temperature and pressure is a significant challenge. The sieving effect of pores is powerless due to the similar molecular size and kinetic diameter of these molecules. We report a new modification method based on a stable ftw topological Zr&#8208;MOF platform (MOF&#8208;525). Introduction of a cyclopentadiene cobalt functional group led to new ftw&#8208;type MOFs materials (UPC&#8208;612 and UPC&#8208;613), which increase the host&#8208;guest interaction and achieve efficient ethylene purification from the mixture of hydrocarbon gases. The high performance of UPC&#8208;612 and UPC&#8208;613 for C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 separation has been verified by gas sorption isotherms, density functional theory (DFT), and experimentally determined breakthrough curves. This work provides a one&#8208;step separation of the ternary gas mixture and can further serve as a blueprint for the design and construction of function&#8208;oriented porous structures for such applications.

         <title>Structural Basis for Pore Blockade of the Human Cardiac Sodium Channel Nav1.5 by the Antiarrhythmic Drug Quinidine**
</title>

The Cryo&#8208;EM structure of human cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 in complex with quinidine reveals the molecular basis for pore blockade of Nav1.5 by class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs. An advanced and comprehensive structural understanding of the mechanism of action of antiarrhythmic drugs will facilitate drug discovery targeting Nav channels.







Abstract
Nav1.5, the primary voltage&#8208;gated Na+ (Nav) channel in heart, is a major target for class I antiarrhythmic agents. Here we present the cryo&#8208;EM structure of full&#8208;length human Nav1.5 bound to quinidine, a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug, at 3.3&#8197;&#197; resolution. Quinidine is positioned right beneath the selectivity filter in the pore domain and coordinated by residues from repeats I, III, and IV. Pore blockade by quinidine is achieved through both direct obstruction of the ion permeation path and induced rotation of an invariant Tyr residue that tightens the intracellular gate. Structural comparison with a truncated rat Nav1.5 in the presence of flecainide, a class Ic agent, reveals distinct binding poses for the two antiarrhythmics within the pore domain. Our work reported here, along with previous studies, reveals the molecular basis for the mechanism of action of class I antiarrhythmic drugs.

Stimuli&#8208;responsive phenomena are widely observed in nature. In their Research Article on page&#8197;11318, Chongli Zhong, Dan Zhao, and co&#8208;workers report for pressure&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composite membranes based on the gate&#8208;opening effect that CO2 molecules act as a &#8220;key&#8221; to open the MOF gates. Huge jumps of CO2 permeance as well as CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities occur above the gate&#8208;opening pressure of the flexible MOF, demonstrating a smart gas separation behavior.

A CpCo group was introduced in a cubic cage to generate a sphere&#8208;like force surface, thus dividing the cubic cage into two parts. Gas molecules have to pass the sphere&#8208;like force surface twice, which increases the interaction probability between gas and framework. Based on the high selectivity of the CpCo group, high&#8208;purity ethylene is obtained from an acetylene/ethylene/ethane ternary mixture, as reported by Daofeng Sun et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;11350.

Liposomes as carriers of proteins and peptides enable investigation of lipid clusters, protein oligomers and protein&#8211;lipid interactions in mass spectrometric analysis. In their Research Article on page&#8197;11523, Carla Schmidt et&#8197;al. show that proteoliposomes dissociate in the gas phase of a mass spectrometer, releasing associated proteins or peptides. This new approach shows that liposomes can be used to study proteins and peptides as well as their interactions with lipids.

         <title>The 2&#8208;Pyridyl Problem: Challenging Nucleophiles in Cross&#8208;Coupling Arylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11068-11091, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review focuses on methods developed as solutions for the challenging coupling of 2&#8208;pyridyl nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl electrophiles. The topic encompasses traditional cross&#8208;coupling processes, modifications to the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, as well as alternative nucleophilic reagents and recent developments in C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
Azine&#8208;containing biaryls are ubiquitous scaffolds in many areas of chemistry, and efficient methods for their synthesis are continually desired. Pyridine rings are prominent amongst these motifs. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reactions have been widely used for their synthesis and functionalisation as they often provide a swift and tuneable route to related biaryl scaffolds. However, 2&#8208;pyridine organometallics are capricious coupling partners and 2&#8208;pyridyl boron reagents in particular are notorious for their instability and poor reactivity in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The synthesis of pyridine&#8208;containing biaryls is therefore limited, and methods for the formation of unsymmetrical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridines are scarce. This Review focuses on the methods developed for the challenging coupling of 2&#8208;pyridine nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl electrophiles, and ranges from traditional cross&#8208;coupling processes to alternative nucleophilic reagents and novel main group approaches.

This Minireview discusses the limitations of electrolyte development and strategies for the design of artificial interphases in magnesium&#8208;ion batteries. Future perspectives in the development of artificial interphases for rechargeable magnesium batteries are also discussed.







Abstract
The first prototype of a rechargeable magnesium (Mg) battery demonstrated two decades ago sparked tremendous interest in the electrochemical community due to their potential low cost, high volumetric energy density. However, the development of rechargeable Mg batteries has been hampered by the incompatibility between the Mg&#8208;metal anode and conventional carbonate electrolytes. Research has focused on electrolytes that are thermodynamically stable against reduction at the expense of low oxidation potential at the cathode side. Alternatively, the use of an artificial solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) via surface coating presents promising results to address the Mg/electrolyte incompatibility and significantly broaden the selection of electrolytes. This minireview discusses the limitations of electrolyte development and strategies for the design of artificial interphases in magnesium&#8208;ion batteries. Future perspectives in the development of artificial interphases for rechargeable magnesium batteries are also discussed.

Bimetallic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been applied as sacrificial templates or precursors in the preparation of derivatives that can be used in supercapacitors. Bimetallic MOFs and their derivatives can offer the advantages of improved electrochemical activity, convenient redox reactions, and high electrical conductivity, and are excellent candidates as advanced electrode materials.







Abstract
Supercapacitors (SCs), showing excellent power density, long service life, and high reversibility, have received great attention because of the increasing demand for energy storage devices. To further improve their performance, it is essential to develop advanced electrode materials. One group of materials, porous crystalline solids referred to as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), have proved to be excellent templates for synthesizing functional materials to be employed in the preparation of electrodes for SCs. In comparison to monometallic MOFs, bimetallic MOFs and their derivatives offer a number of advantages, including tunable electrochemical activity, high charge capacity, and improved electrical conductivity. This review focuses on the use of MOF&#8208;derived bimetallic materials in SCs, the origin of the improved performance, and the latest developments in the field. Furthermore, the challenges and perspectives in this research area are discussed.

         <title>Precision Conjugation: An Emerging Tool for Generating Protein&#8211;Polymer Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11024-11035, May 10, 2021. </description>

Precision conjugation to resolve the nonspecificity and low&#8208;efficiency problems associated with traditional protein&#8211;polymer conjugation techniques such as PEGylation is the focus of this Minireview. Site&#8208;specific in&#8197;situ growth (SIG) and intrinsically disordered polypeptide fusion (IPF) are discussed as two representative grafting&#8208;from methods for the development of next&#8208;generation protein&#8211;polymer conjugates.







Abstract
Protein&#8211;polymer conjugates are increasingly being applied in biomedicine because of the unique combination of the biological activity of the proteins and the multifunctionality and flexibility of the polymers. However, traditional protein&#8211;polymer conjugation techniques suffer from some unavoidable drawbacks, including nonspecificity and low efficiency. In this Minireview, we discuss a new approach based on &#8220;precision conjugation&#8221; for the construction of the next&#8208;generation protein&#8211;polymer conjugates in a more controlled, more efficient, and tailorable fashion for a broad range of advanced applications. In illustrating the concept, we highlight two general methods: site&#8208;specific in&#8197;situ growth and intrinsically disordered polypeptide fusion, with a focus on the in&#8197;situ, efficient, and controllable formation of protein&#8211;polymer conjugates. At the end, the challenges associated with this emerging concept are further discussed.

         <title>Conjugated Copolymers That Shouldn't Be</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11115-11119, May 10, 2021. </description>

Unexpected excited&#8208;state conjugation was observed in a series of copolymers derived from ladder silsesquioxane, vinyl(Me/Ph)Si(O0.5)2[PhSiO1.5]4(O0.5)2Si(Me/Ph)vinyl, which exhibited 30&#8211;60&#8197;nm red&#8208;shifted emission relative to double&#8208;decker derived analogues with equal or larger degrees of polymerization. Further studies hint at their potential application as semiconducting polymers.







Abstract
Multiple studies have explored using cage silsesquioxanes (SQs) as backbone elements in hybrid polymers motivated by their well&#8208;defined structures and physical and mechanical properties. As part of this general exploration, we report unexpected photophysical properties of copolymers derived from divinyl double decker (DD) SQs, [vinyl(Me)Si(O0.5)2][PhSiO1.5]8[(O0.5)2Si(Me)vinyl] (vinylDDvinyl). These copolymers exhibit strong emission red&#8208;shifts relative to model compounds, implying unconventional conjugation, despite vinyl(Me)Si(O&#8208;)2 siloxane bridges. In an effort to identify minimum SQ structures that do/do not offer extended conjugation, we explored Heck catalyzed co&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;ladder(LL)&#8208;vinyl compounds, vinyl(Me/Ph)Si(O0.5)2[PhSiO1.5]4(O0.5)2Si(Me/Ph)vinyl, with Br&#8208;Ar&#8208;Br. Most surprising, the resulting oligomers show 30&#8211;60&#8197;nm emission red&#8208;shifts beyond those seen with vinylDDvinyl analogs despite lacking a true cage. Further evidence for unconventional conjugation includes apparent integer charge transfer (ICT) between LL&#8208;co&#8208;thiophene, bithiophene, and thienothiophene with 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% F4TCNQ, suggesting potential as p&#8208;type doped organic/inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>An Efficient Interfacial Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11190-11195, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Ni metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MOF NSs) with controlled coordination mode were carefully created through a liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial synthesis strategy for the first time and adopted as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis. The optimized partially unsaturated Ni MOF NSs&#8208;6 exhibits near&#8208;zero overpotential as well as ca. 98&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity in 0.1&#8197;M KOH, exceeding most electrocatalysts up to date.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MOF NSs) play a vital role in catalysis, but the most preparation is ultrasonication or solvothermal. Herein, a liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial synthesis method has been developed for the efficient fabrication of a series of 2D Ni MOF NSs. The active sites could be modulated by readily tuning the ratios of metal precursors and organic linkers (RM/L). The Ni MOF NSs display highly RM/L dependent activities towards 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), where the Ni MOF NSs with the RM/L of 6 exhibit the optimal near&#8208;zero overpotential, ca. 98&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity and production rate of ca. 80&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. As evidenced by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, the coordination environment of active sites changed from saturation to unsaturation, and the partially unsaturated metal atoms are crucial to create optimal sites for enhancing the electrocatalysis.

The optimized partially unsaturated Ni MOF NSs&#8208;6 exhibits near&#8208;zero overpotential as well as ca. 98&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity in 0.1&#8197;M KOH, exceeding most electrocatalysts up to date.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MOF NSs) play a vital role in catalysis, but the most preparation is ultrasonication or solvothermal. Herein, a liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial synthesis method has been developed for the efficient fabrication of a series of 2D Ni MOF NSs. The active sites could be modulated by readily tuning the ratios of metal precursors and organic linkers (R&lt;sub&gt;M/L&lt;/sub&gt;). The Ni MOF NSs display highly R&lt;sub&gt;M/L&lt;/sub&gt; dependent activities towards 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), where the Ni MOF NSs with the R&lt;sub&gt;M/L&lt;/sub&gt; of 6 exhibit the optimal near&#8208;zero overpotential, ca. 98&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity and production rate of ca. 80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. As evidenced by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, the coordination environment of active sites changed from saturation to unsaturation, and the partially unsaturated metal atoms are crucial to create optimal sites for enhancing the electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

MAPbI3 crystal growth in the films made by drop&#8208;casting is regulated by changing the temperature. At low temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C), the crystals are (110) oriented, needle&#8208;like. At high temperature (&gt;120&#8201;&#176;C), the crystals are (200) oriented, presenting round grains. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology and photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
Drop&#8208;casting was used to make MAPbI3 films for solar cells. The crystal growth in drop&#8208;cast MAPbI3 films was regulated by adjusting temperature. A mechanism for the formation of different morphology was proposed by combining in situ crystal&#8208;growth study with XRD measurements. The crystals in the films made at low temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C) and high temperature (&#8805;120&#8201;&#176;C) are (110) and (200) oriented, respectively. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology. Compared with spin&#8208;coating, drop&#8208;casting shows much better tolerance to humidity. MAPbI3 solar cells made under 88&#8201;% humidity delivered a PCE of 18.17&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE for perovskite solar cells made under &gt;70&#8201;% humidity without antisolvent assistance.

Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer driven valence tautomerism and redox noninnocence of unexplored azobis(benzothiazole) on coordination to {Ru(acac)2} (acac=2,4&#8208;pentanedianato) have been illustrated in the context of designing reversible electron reservoir system for the potential application in catalysis and material science.







Abstract
The impact of metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer towards the redox noninnocence of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobis(benzothiazole) (abbt) has been highlighted on coordination to {RuII(acac)2} (acac=2,4&#8208;pentanedionato). It led to the authentication of a series of mononuclear and dinuclear complexes incorporating variable oxidation states of abbt (abbt0/.&#8722;/2&#8722;). Mononuclear 1 was identified as [RuIII(abbt.&#8722;)], a MLCT excited state of [RuII(abbt)]. Dinuclear 2 was however recognized as two discrete redox isomers: (i) radical bridged mixed&#8208;valent meso&#8208;[Ru2.5(&#956;&#8208;abbt.&#8722;)Ru2.5] (2a) and (ii) dianionic ligand bridged isovalent meso&#8208;[RuIII(&#956;&#8208;abbt2&#8722;)RuIII] (2b), demonstrating unprecedented structural confirmation of valence tautomerism in azo&#8208;based ligand systems. A crystal structure of [2]ClO4 validated the formation of [RuIII(&#956;&#8208;abbt.&#8722;) RuIII]ClO4. Analysis of electronic structural forms of 1 and 2 in accessible redox states via spectroelectrochemistry and DFT revealed their electron reservoir feature.

A family of 6&#8208;connected trimer&#8208;based MOFs with 6&#8208;coordinated metals has been developed from rare&#8208;earth elements. A confluence of factors have been identified to lead to such unusual low&#8208;coordinate rare&#8208;earth MOFs that prove to be a powerful platform enabling dramatically enhanced efficiency for rare&#8208;earth separation.







Abstract
For rare&#8208;earth separation, selective crystallization into metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) offers new opportunities. Especially important is the development of MOF platforms with high selectivity toward target ions. Here we report a MOF platform (CPM&#8208;66) with low&#8208;coordination&#8208;number environment for rare&#8208;earth ions. This platform is highly responsive to the size variation of rare&#8208;earth ions and shows exceptional ion&#8208;size selectivity during crystallization. CPM&#8208;66 family are based on M3O trimers (M=6&#8208;coordinated Sc, In, Er&#8208;Lu) that are rare for lanthanides. We show that the size matching between urea&#8208;type solvents and metal ions is crucial for their successful synthesis. We further show that CPM&#8208;66 enables a dramatic multi&#8208;fold increase in separation efficiency over CPM&#8208;29 with 7&#8208;coordinated ions. This work provides some insights into methods to prepare low&#8208;coordinate MOFs from large ions and such MOFs could serve as high&#8208;efficiency platforms for lanthanide separation, as well as other applications.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Mediated C&#947;&#8722;H Functionalization of Alicyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11227-11230, May 10, 2021. </description>

An approach to selectively transform C&#947;&#8722;H bonds of alicyclic amines to C&#947;(sp3)&#8722;halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, boron, and sulfur bonds is described. This method is enabled via the pre&#8208;complexation of the amine substrate with palladium followed by the addition of oxidant to yield bioactive motifs functionalized at the &#947;&#8208;position.







Abstract
This paper describes a new method for the transannular functionalization of the &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds in alicyclic amines to install C(sp3)&#8722;halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, boron, and sulfur bonds. The key challenge for this transformation is controlling the relative rate of C&#947;&#8722;H versus C&#945;&#8722;H functionalization. We demonstrate that this selectivity can be achieved by pre&#8208;complexation of the substrate with Pd prior to the addition of oxidant. This approach enables the use of diverse oxidants that ultimately install various heteroatom functional groups at the &#947;&#8208;position with high site&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;An approach to selectively transform C&lt;sub&gt;&#947;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H bonds of alicyclic amines to C&lt;sub&gt;&#947;&lt;/sub&gt;(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, boron, and sulfur bonds is described. This method is enabled via the pre&#8208;complexation of the amine substrate with palladium followed by the addition of oxidant to yield bioactive motifs functionalized at the &#947;&#8208;position.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper describes a new method for the transannular functionalization of the &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds in alicyclic amines to install C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, boron, and sulfur bonds. The key challenge for this transformation is controlling the relative rate of C&lt;sub&gt;&#947;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H versus C&lt;sub&gt;&#945;&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H functionalization. We demonstrate that this selectivity can be achieved by pre&#8208;complexation of the substrate with Pd prior to the addition of oxidant. This approach enables the use of diverse oxidants that ultimately install various heteroatom functional groups at the &#947;&#8208;position with high site&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Induced Surface Metallization for Ammonia Synthesis under Photoexcitation up to 1550&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11173-11179, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface metallization of TiO2&#8722;x was achieved through the bonding between surface terminal Ti&#8208;F groups and adjacent Ti3+. The metalized TiO2 with reduced work function and downward band bending possesses high electron&#8208;donating power to supported Ru species via atomic&#8208;scale ohmic contacts, exhibiting superior photocatalytic performances for ammonia synthesis across the entire solar spectrum region.







Abstract
The first observation of surface metallization of TiO2&#8722;x induced by fluoride ions is presented. The emerging metallic states are contributed by the 3d orbital of surface Ti and the 2p orbital of surface bridging F, which are intrinsically originated from the strong electron repulsion between F&#8722; and adjacent Ti3+. The metalized TiO2&#8722;x with reduced work function and downward band bending possesses high electron&#8208;donating power to supported Ru species via atomic&#8208;scale ohmic contacts, exhibiting unprecedented photocatalytic performances for ammonia synthesis across the entire solar spectrum region (200&#8211;1550&#8197;nm) at room temperature. Mechanism and kinetic analysis revealed that the loaded Ru could behave as efficient electron sinks to accumulate photogenerated electrons and that the metallic surface markedly enhanced the dissociation of H2 and N2 by the hot electrons generated by the visible or even infrared light irradiation.

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Specific Pro&#8208;amplifier of Reactive Oxygen Species in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11158-11162, May 10, 2021. </description>

A fluorogenic N&#8208;alkylaminoferrocene&#8208;based prodrug activated by reactive oxygen species in vitro and in vivo was developed that is cancer cell specific and targets the endoplasmic reticulum.







Abstract
The folding and export of proteins and hydrolysis of unfolded proteins are disbalanced in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cancer cells, leading to so&#8208;called ER stress. Agents further augmenting this effect are used as anticancer drugs including clinically approved proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib. However, these drugs can affect normal cells, which also rely strongly on ER functions, leading, for example, to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To address this problem, we have developed ER&#8208;targeted prodrugs activated only in cancer cells in the presence of elevated ROS amounts. These compounds are conjugates of cholic acid with N&#8208;alkylaminoferrocene&#8208;based prodrugs. We confirmed their accumulation in the ER of cancer cells, their anticancer efficacy, and cancer cell specificity. These prodrugs induce ER stress, attenuate mitochondrial membrane potential, and generate mitochondrial ROS leading to cell death via necrosis. We also demonstrated that the new prodrugs are activated in vivo in Nemeth&#8208;Kellner lymphoma (NK/Ly) murine model.

         <title>Triarylmethanes and their Medium&#8208;Ring Analogues by Unactivated Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangement of Benzanilides</title>

A conformationally accelerated intramolecular arylation provides an operationally simple way to prepare triarylmethanes and their medium&#8208;ring analogues. In&#8197;situ IR spectroscopy and a Hammett plot revealed mechanistic details of the electronically unactivated SNAr reaction.







Abstract
Intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution (Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement) of the anions of 2&#8208;benzyl benzanilides leads to triarylmethanes in an operationally simple manner. The reaction succeeds even without electronic activation of the ring that plays the role of electrophile in the SNAr reaction, being accelerated instead by the preferred conformation imposed by the tertiary amide tether. The amide substituent of the product may be removed or transformed into alternative functional groups. A ring&#8208;expanding variant (n&#8197;to n+4) of the reaction provided a route to doubly benzo&#8208;fused medium ring lactams of 10 or 11&#8197;members. Hammett analysis returned a &#961;&#8197;value consistent with the operation of a partially concerted reaction mechanism.

         <title>Complexation of an Antimicrobial Peptide by Large&#8208;Sized Macrocycles for Decreasing Hemolysis and Improving Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11288-11293, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two water&#8208;soluble large&#8208;sized quaterphen[n]arenes (WQPns, n=3, 4) were designed and synthesized. Macrocycles WQP3 and WQP4 could strongly complex with an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan (PXG). Host&#8211;guest complexation served to not only efficiently decrease the PXG's hemolysis in rabbit red blood cells, but also substantially enhance its metabolic stability in presence of proteinase&#8197;K, rat plasma and liver or kidney homogenates.







Abstract
Traditional macrocyclic hosts have finite cavity sizes, generally 5&#8211;10&#8197;&#197;, which are commonly adaptive to recognize small guests rather than biological macromolecules. Here two water&#8208;soluble large&#8208;sized quaterphen[n]arenes (WQPns, n=3, 4) were designed and synthesized. These two hosts present significantly distinct recognition abilities. Specifically, they could strongly complex an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan (PXG) with the association constants (Ka) of (4.20&#177;0.23)&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 for PXG/WQP3 and (2.46&#177;0.44)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 for PXG/WQP4. Complexation of PXG by WQP3 and WQP4 served to decrease the hemolysis of PXG in rabbit red blood cells in a statistically significant way. Furthermore, host&#8211;guest complexation was shown to substantially enhance metabolic stability of PXG in presence of proteinase K, rat plasma and liver or kidney homogenates.

A new generation of protein&#8208;based nanodrugs was developed driven by supramolecular assembly. The nanodrug exhibited significantly enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects in osteosarcoma models, allowing long&#8208;acting osteosarcoma treatment. Side effects including cardiotoxicity and lung&#8208;metastasis were greatly mitigated with this medication.







Abstract
Supramolecular nanodrug assembly driven by supramolecular chemistry is becoming a powerful strategy for medication. The potential of engineered proteins as building blocks for nanoformulations is rarely investigated. Here, we developed a new generation of recombinant protein&#8208;based nanodrug carriers, which is very efficient for loading and delivering the hydrophobic prodrug aldoxorubicin. Significantly enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects in osteosarcoma (OS) models were observed. The half&#8208;life of the nanodrug reached almost two days and the corresponding bioavailability increased by 17&#8208;fold. This is significantly superior to other drug counterparts, empowering long&#8208;acting OS treatment scenarios. Importantly, off&#8208;target side effects of the prodrug, including cardiotoxicity and lung&#8208;metastasis, were greatly mitigated with our medication. Thus, our assembly strategy enables the customized design of advanced nanodelivery systems employing broader biomaterial building blocks for cancer therapy.

         <title>Understanding the Reduction of Transition&#8208;Metal Phosphates to Transition&#8208;Metal Phosphides by Combining Temperature&#8208;Programmed Reduction and Infrared Spectroscopy</title>

TPR&#8208;IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation. Ni2P drastically accelerated the formation of PH3 and the reaction of PH3 with H2O, which can be important reasons that excess phosphorus is needed for the reduction of nickel phosphate to Ni2P.







Abstract
Temperature&#8208;programmed reduction of transition&#8208;metal phosphate precursors is the most commonly used method for the preparation of transition&#8208;metal phosphides (a new class of versatile metal catalysts), but the reduction processes are still not clear. Here we describe the construction of a temperature&#8208;programmed reduction&#8208;infrared spectroscopy apparatus (TPR&#8208;IR) to analyze the gas flows during the reduction of nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten phosphates. PH3 and Pn+ species already appeared in the gas flows at low temperature (ca. 200&#8201;&#176;C), and PH3 was involved in the formation of phosphides. The emission of PH3 and Pn+ during the reduction of the molybdenum and tungsten phosphates was smaller than that of the nickel phosphate. Ni2P drastically accelerated the formation of the PH3 and Pn+. These results explain why excess phosphorus is needed for the preparation of Ni2P, and also demonstrate that the TPR&#8208;IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Selective Protection of Peptides from Proteolysis</title>

Synthetic nanoparticles act as protecting agents for peptides from enzymatic action, enabling selective proteolysis of peptides in a mixture and selective hydrolysis at degenerate cleavage sites.







Abstract
Proteolysis of proteins and peptides is involved in the infection of cells by enveloped viruses and also in the invasion and spread of cancer cells. Shutting down broad&#8208;specificity proteases, however, is problematic because normal functions by these proteases will be affected. Herein, nanoparticle receptors were prepared from molecular imprinting for complex biological peptides. Their strong and selective binding enabled them to protect their targeted sequences from proteolysis in aqueous solution at stoichiometric amounts. Generality of the method was demonstrated by the protection of hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides from different proteases, selective protection of a segment of a long peptide, and selective protection of a targeted peptide in a mixture. Most interestingly, two receptors targeting different parts of a long peptide could work in cooperation to protect the overall sequence, highlighting the versatility of the method.

         <title>Biogenesis&#8208;Guided Synthesis and Structural Revision of Sarocladione Enabled by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Endoperoxide Fragmentation</title>

By studying sarocladione biosynthesis, we accomplished its chemical synthesis from ergosterol in two or seven steps and revised the published structure of this compound, which is the first 5,10:8,9&#8208;diseco&#8208;steroid isolated from a natural source. This work was enabled by development of a general method for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed endoperoxide fragmentation, which transformed saturated endoperoxides into olefinic diketones by dual C&#8722;C bond cleavage.







Abstract
Sarocladione is the first 5,10:8,9&#8208;diseco&#8208;steroid with a 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic diketone framework to have been isolated from a natural source. Herein we report a biomimetic synthesis of sarocladione in only two or seven steps from inexpensive, commercially available ergosterol. The key feature of this synthesis was a novel ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed endoperoxide fragmentation, which transformed various saturated endoperoxides into olefinic diketones by cleavage of two C&#8722;C bonds. This synthesis allowed us to unambiguously determine the structure of sarocladione and provided experimental support for its revised biosynthetic origin. This work also vividly demonstrates that consideration of the biogenesis is a powerful tool for elucidating the structures of natural products.

         <title>A Genetically Encoded Two&#8208;Dimensional Infrared Probe for Enzyme Active&#8208;Site Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11143-11147, May 10, 2021. </description>

A genetically encoded two&#8208;dimensional infrared probe, N3Y, was developed for monitoring femtosecond to picosecond water dynamics and conformational flexibility of enzyme active sites. The addition of a low concentration of desaturating reagent decreased active&#8208;site water motion confinement, which is correlated with a decrease in enzyme activity.







Abstract
While two&#8208;dimensional infrared (2D&#8208;IR) spectroscopy is uniquely suitable for monitoring femtosecond (fs) to picosecond (ps) water dynamics around static protein structures, its utility for probing enzyme active&#8208;site dynamics is limited due to the lack of site&#8208;specific 2D&#8208;IR probes. We demonstrate the genetic incorporation of a novel 2D&#8208;IR probe, m&#8208;azido&#8208;L&#8208;tyrosine (N3Y) in the active&#8208;site of DddK, an iron&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dimethylsulfoniopropionate to dimethylsulphide. Our results show that both the oxidation of active&#8208;site iron to FeIII, and the addition of denaturation reagents, result in significant decrease in enzyme activity and active&#8208;site water motion confinement. As tyrosine residues play important roles, including as general acids and bases, and electron transfer agents in many key enzymes, the genetically encoded 2D&#8208;IR probe N3Y should be broadly applicable to investigate how the enzyme active&#8208;site motions at the fs&#8211;ps time scale direct reaction pathways to facilitating specific chemical reactions.

         <title>A Simple Biomimetic Receptor Selectively Recognizing the GlcNAc2 Disaccharide in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11168-11172, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Think simple. In the development of biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates, an approach that focuses on simple acyclic architectures can be successfully exploited for disaccharide recognition, provided that the correct binding geometry can be achieved. Here we present a simple tweezers&#8208;shaped receptor that selectively recognizes in water GlcNAc2, the core fragment of N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses, such as coronaviruses.







Abstract
GlcNAc2 is the core disaccharide fragment present in N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses of high health concern, such as coronaviruses. Because N&#8208;glycans are directly involved in the docking of viruses to host cells, recognition of GlcNAc2 by a biomimetic receptor may be a convenient alternative to the use of lectins to interfere with viral entry and infection. Herein, we describe a simple biomimetic receptor recognizing the methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glycoside of GlcNAc2 in water with an unprecedented affinity of 160&#8197;&#956;M, exceeding that of more structurally complex receptors reported in the literature. The tweezers&#8208;shaped acyclic structure exhibits marked selectivity among structurally related disaccharides, and complete discrimination between mono&#8208; and disaccharides. Molecular modelling calculations supported by NOE data provided a three&#8208;dimensional description of the binding mode, shedding light on the origin of the affinities and selectivities exhibited by the receptor.

         <title>Unravelling the Structure of a Medium&#8208;Sized Metalloid Gold Nanocluster and its Filming Property</title>

A novel Au67(SCH2Ph)35 nanocluster was synthesized and its structure unravelled, which is the first one resolved by SCXC for thiolated metalloid gold nanoclusters in the size range from Au61 to Au91. Au67(SCH2Ph)35 can be thermally induced to aggregate into larger nanoparticles and self&#8208;deposit to form a gold nanoparticles film, which exhibits high sensitivity, uniformity and recyclability as a SERS substrate for sensing malachite green, methylene blue and Sudan III.







Abstract
Unravelling the structure of thiolated metalloid gold nanoclusters in the medium&#8208;sized range by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography (SCXC) is challenging. Herein, we successfully synthesized a novel Au67(SR)35 nanocluster, and unravelled its single crystal structure by SCXC, which features a mix&#8208;structured Au48 kernel protected by one Au4(SR)5 staple and fifteen Au(SR)2 staples. Unprecedentedly, this structure can be thermally induced to aggregate into larger nanoparticles and self&#8208;deposit to form a gold nanoparticles film onto the walls of a vial or other substrates such as quartz, mica or ceramic, which can be developed into a facile, substrate&#8208;universal and scalable filming method. The film exhibits high sensitivity, uniformity and recyclability as a surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate and can be applied for detecting multiple organic pollutants.

         <title>Chiral Amplification of Phosphoramidates of Amines and Amino Acids in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11120-11126, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of homochirality is a fundamental scientific question. We show that dissolution behavior of racemic and enantiopure amines can be altered by conversion into phosphoramidates. Stirring a solid scalemic mixture in water leads to enantioenrichment of the solution phase (&gt;90&#8201;% ee). Amplification of amino acids and their derivatives show that phosphorylation can serve as a potentially viable source of prebiotic homochirality.







Abstract
The origin of biomolecular homochirality continues to be one of the most fascinating aspects of prebiotic chemistry. Various amplification strategies for chiral compounds to enhance a small chiral preference have been reported, but none of these involves phosphorylation, one of nature's essential chemical reactions. Here we present a simple and robust concept of phosphorylation&#8208;based chiral amplification of amines and amino acids in water. By exploiting the difference in solubility of a racemic phosphoramidate and its enantiopure form, we achieved enantioenrichment in solution. Starting with near racemic, phenylethylamine&#8208;based phosphoramidates, ee's of up to 95&#8201;% are reached in a single amplification step. Particularly noteworthy is the enantioenrichment of phosphorylated amino acids and their derivatives, which might point to a potential role of phosphorus en&#8208;route to prebiotic homochirality.

Trimethylsilylium abstraction from a cobalt nitrilimide complex generates a transient cobalt diazomethanediide complex, which forms a terminal isocyanoamido ligand through a radical de&#8208;arylation.







Abstract
Lithium trimethylsilyldiazomethanide and a cobalt (II) precursor with an N&#8208;anchored tris&#8208;NHC (TIMENmes) ligand provide access to the cobalt nitrilimide 1. Complex 1 was structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry (SC&#8208;XRD) and its electronic structure was examined in detail, including EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and computational analyses. The desilylation of the C&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)nitrilimide reveals a transient complex with an elusive diazomethanediide ligand, which substitutes one of the mesitylene rings of the ancillary ligand through C&#8722;N bond cleavage. This transformation results in the cyclometalated cobalt(II) complex 2, featuring a rare isocyanoamido&#8208;&#954;&#8208;C ligand.

Desmethylxestospongin&#8197;B (dmXeB) is a complex marine natural product that exhibits unique properties as a modulator of calcium signaling with downstream effects on cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism. We report a scalable total synthesis of dmXe&#8201;B by a flexible synthetic strategy that allows for control of oxidation levels and stereochemistry at C9/9&#8242;.







Abstract
The scalable synthesis of the oxaquinolizidine marine natural product desmethylxestospongin&#8197;B is based on the early application of Ireland&#8211;Claisen rearrangement, macrolactamization, and a late&#8208;stage installation of the oxaquinolizidine units by lactam reduction. The synthesis serves as the source of material to investigate calcium signaling and its effect on mitochondrial metabolism in various cell types, including cancer cells.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scalable synthesis of the oxaquinolizidine marine natural product desmethylxestospongin&#8197;B is based on the early application of Ireland&#8211;Claisen rearrangement, macrolactamization, and a late&#8208;stage installation of the oxaquinolizidine units by lactam reduction. The synthesis serves as the source of material to investigate calcium signaling and its effect on mitochondrial metabolism in various cell types, including cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dicyclopentaannelated Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with a Singlet Biradical Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11300-11304, May 10, 2021. </description>

Incorporation of two fully unsaturated pentagons to the bay positions of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) core gives access to two dicyclopentaannelated HBC regioisomers: mPHBC and pPHBC. Both compounds show decreased energy gaps compared with the parent HBC and exhibit singlet biradical ground state with prominent biradical character.







Abstract
Synthesis of two dicyclopentaannelated hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (PHBC) regioisomers was carried out, using nonplanar oligoaryl precursors with fluorenyl groups: mPHBC 8 with two pentagons in the &#8220;meta&#8221;&#8208;configuration was obtained as a stable molecule, while its structural isomer with the &#8220;para&#8221;&#8208;configuration, pPHBC 16, could be generated and characterized only in situ due to its high chemical reactivity. Both PHBCs exhibit low energy gaps, as reflected by UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption and electrochemical measurements. They also show open&#8208;shell singlet ground states according to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The use of fully benzenoid HBC as a bridging moiety leads to significant singlet biradical characters (y0) of 0.72 and 0.96 for mPHBC 8 and pPHBC 16, respectively, due to the strong rearomatization tendency of the HBC &#960;&#8208;system; these values are among the highest for planar carbon&#8208;centered biradical molecules. The incorporation of fully unsaturated pentagons strongly perturbs the aromaticity of the parent HBC and makes the constituted benzene rings less aromatic or antiaromatic. These results illustrate the high impact of cyclopentaannelation on the electronic structures of fully benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and open up a new avenue towards open&#8208;shell PAHs with prominent singlet biradical characters.

The first successful example of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohols with diarylphosphine oxides as phosphorus&#8208;centered nucleophiles is reported. This synthetic approach provides a new method to prepare chiral phosphorus&#8208;containing organic compounds.







Abstract
The development of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution reactions has gained much progress in recent years, however, no successful example with phosphorus&#8208;centered nucleophiles has yet been reported until now. Herein, we report the first successful example of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohols with diarylphosphine oxides as phosphorus&#8208;centered nucleophiles. This synthetic approach provides a new method to prepare chiral phosphorus&#8208;containing organic compounds.

         <title>A General Supramolecular Approach to Regulate Protein Functions by Cucurbit[7]uril and Unnatural Amino Acid Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11196-11200, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal supramolecular host&#8211;guest recognition strategy was developed for reversible regulation of protein function at the single residue level. A guest molecule that can be specifically recognized by cucurbit[7]uril was genetically encoded into proteins. Reversible regulation of enzyme function and cell activity was achieved when this strategy was applied to two enzymes and a cytokine.







Abstract
Regulation of specific protein function is of great importance for both research and therapeutic development. Many small or large molecules have been developed to control specific protein function, but there is a lack of a universal approach to regulate the function of any given protein. We report a general host&#8211;guest molecular recognition approach involving modification of the protein functional surfaces with genetically encoded unnatural amino acids bearing guest side chains that can be specifically recognized by cucurbit[7]uril. Using two enzymes and a cytokine as models, we showed that the activity of proteins bearing unnatural amino acid could be turned off by host molecule binding, which blocked its functional binding surface. Protein activity can be switched back by treatment with a competitive guest molecule. Our approach provides a general tool for reversibly regulating protein function through molecular recognition and can be expected to be valuable for studying protein functions.

         <title>Bioinspired Synergistic Photochromic Luminescence and Programmable Liquid Crystal Actuators</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the synergic allochroic and shape&#8208;morphing bio&#8208;functions like caterpillars and cephalopods, photochromic luminescent liquid crystal actuators were prepared. Complex movements and fluorescent colors can be synergically manipulated by light based on the phase transition of liquid crystals and photoresponse of the fluorescent chromophores after the actuators were programmed with hybrid mesogenic alignments.







Abstract
Bioinspired smart materials with synergistic allochroic luminescence and complex deformation are expected to play an important role in many areas of science and technology. However, it is still challenging to fabricate such soft actuators with high programmability that can be manipulated in situ with high spatial resolution. Herein, we have incorporated terminally functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission active tetraphenylethene derivative and photochromic spiropyran moieties into the networks of liquid crystal elastomers through covalent bonding to obtain the synergistic photochromic luminescence and programmable soft actuators. Bio&#8208;mimic functions and light&#8208;induced auxetic metamaterial&#8208;like devices were shown to be feasible based on the combination of assembly and origami&#8208;programming strategy. These bioinspired devices with synergistic photochromic luminescence and complex photodeformation abilities provide an elegant strategy to design multi&#8208;functional liquid crystal actuators.

         <title>Hidden Mechanism Behind the Roughness&#8208;Enhanced Selectivity of Carbon Monoxide Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11133-11137, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism behind the roughness&#8208;enhanced selectivity of the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide is revealed by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for the reaction on catalysts with different roughness factors (RF). Ways to enhance the reaction selectivity are predicated.







Abstract
High roughness has been proved to be an effective design strategy for electrocatalyst in many systems. Especially, high selectivity of carbon monoxide reduction (CORR) in competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction has been observed on high roughness electrocatalysts. However, the two well&#8208;known mechanisms, i.e., decreasing the energy barrier of CORR and increasing local pH, failed to understand the roughness&#8208;enhanced selectivity in a recent experiment. Herein we unravel the hidden mechanism by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for CORR on catalysts with different roughness factors. We conclude that the roughness&#8208;enhanced CORR selectivity is actually kinetic controlled by local&#8208;electric&#8208;field&#8208;directed mass transfer of adsorbed species on the electrode surface.

     alt="Hidden Mechanism Behind the Roughness&#8208;Enhanced Selectivity of Carbon Monoxide Electrocatalytic Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism behind the roughness&#8208;enhanced selectivity of the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide is revealed by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for the reaction on catalysts with different roughness factors (RF). Ways to enhance the reaction selectivity are predicated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High roughness has been proved to be an effective design strategy for electrocatalyst in many systems. Especially, high selectivity of carbon monoxide reduction (CORR) in competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction has been observed on high roughness electrocatalysts. However, the two well&#8208;known mechanisms, i.e., decreasing the energy barrier of CORR and increasing local pH, failed to understand the roughness&#8208;enhanced selectivity in a recent experiment. Herein we unravel the hidden mechanism by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for CORR on catalysts with different roughness factors. We conclude that the roughness&#8208;enhanced CORR selectivity is actually kinetic controlled by local&#8208;electric&#8208;field&#8208;directed mass transfer of adsorbed species on the electrode surface. Several ways to optimize CORR selectivity are predicted. Our work highlights the kinetics in electrocatalysis on nanocatalysts, and provides a conceptually new principle for future catalyst design.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Meroterpenoid Manginoid&#8197;A as Fueled by a Challenging Pinacol Coupling and Bicycle&#8208;forming Etherification</title>

The manginoids are a unique collection of bioactive natural products whose structures fuse an oxa&#8208;bridged spirocyclohexanedione with a trans&#8208;hydrindane framework. Such architectures can be accessed through a strategy combining a challenging pinacol coupling and bicycle&#8208;forming etherification with several additional regioselective reactions. As a result, a 19 step total synthesis of manginoid&#8197;A has been achieved.







Abstract
The manginoids are a unique collection of bioactive natural products whose structures fuse an oxa&#8208;bridged spirocyclohexanedione with a heavily substituted trans&#8208;hydrindane framework. Herein, we show that such architectures can be accessed through a strategy combining a challenging pinacol coupling and bicycle&#8208;forming etherification with several additional chemo&#8208; and regioselective reactions. The success of these key events proved to be highly substrate and condition specific, affording insights for their application to other targets. As a result, not only has a 19&#8208;step total synthesis of manginoid&#8197;A been achieved, but a potential roadmap to access other members of the family and related natural products has also been identified.

         <title>Bispecific Aptamer Chimeras Enable Targeted Protein Degradation on Cell Membranes</title>

Bispecific aptamer chimeras were designed and constructed for lysosomal degradation of targeted membrane&#8208;associated proteins (see picture). The method provides a powerful and potentially universal platform for the use of inexpensive and readily synthesized aptamer materials for the clinical translation of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based molecular medicine.







Abstract
The ability to regulate membrane protein abundance offers great opportunities for developing therapeutic sites for various diseases. Herein, we describe a platform for the targeted degradation of membrane&#8208;associated proteins using bispecific aptamer chimeras that bind both the cell&#8208;surface lysosome&#8208;shuttling receptor (IGFIIR) and the targeted membrane&#8208;bound proteins of interest. We demonstrate that the aptamer chimeras can efficiently and quickly shuttle the therapeutically relevant membrane proteins of Met and PTK&#8208;7 to lysosomes and degrade them through the lysosomal protein degradation machinery. We anticipate that our method will provide a universal platform for the use of readily synthesized aptamer materials for biochemical research and potential therapeutics.

Disubstituted alkylidene Meldrum's acids proved to be novel C4&#8208;synthons capable of undergoing a vinylogous formal (4+2) cycloaddition reaction with reactive ketones, providing an unprecedented route to chiral 3,6&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones under Br&#248;nsted base organocatalytic conditions.







Abstract
Upon Br&#248;nsted base organocatalysis, ketone&#8208;derived alkylidene Meldrum's acids proved to be competent vinylogous platforms able to undergo a formal (4+2) cycloaddition reaction with dihydro&#8208;2,3&#8208;furandione, providing an unprecedented route to 3,6&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones as spiro[4.5]decane derivatives with up to 98&#8201;% ee thanks to the commercially available Takemoto catalyst. Preliminary investigation showed that this reaction could be extended to other activated ketones, establishing these alkylidene Meldrum's acids as a novel C4&#8208;synthon in the vinylogous series.

Macrocycle &#960;&#8208;conjugation: The two&#8208;fold reduction of [6]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene ([6]CNAP) with Li and K metals affords the doubly reduced macrocycle with a large 62&#960; conjugated system, enhanced aromaticity, and variable metal complexation patterns.







Abstract
Chemical reduction of a naphthylene macrocycle, [6]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene ([6]CNAP, 1), with alkali metals, Li and K, revealed the accessibility of the doubly&#8208;reduced state of 1. The macrocyclic 12&#8722; anion was isolated in different coordination environments and crystallographically characterized. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed the formation of contact&#8208;ion complexes with one Li+ and two K+ ions in THF, and a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion in the solvent&#8208;separated ion product with K+ ions in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether. The detailed structural analysis of 12&#8722; showed that the &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the biaryl linkages between naphthylene panels were enhanced upon two&#8208;fold reduction, which was rationally explained by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Multicomponent Self&#8208;Assembly of a Giant Heterometallic Polyoxotungstate Supercluster with Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11153-11157, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical assembly of a giant heterometallic polyoxotungstate supercluster with a molecular weight of ca. 25&#8197;kDa is reported. Geometrically unrestricted cerium(III) and geometrically restricted dimethyl tin cation linkers are used to gain access to a giant molecular species featuring three different polyoxometalate building units. The compound demonstrates in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antiproliferative activity against HeLa cervical cancer cell lines.







Abstract
The hierarchical aggregation of molecular nanostructures from multiple components is a grand synthetic challenge, which requires highly selective linkage control. We demonstrate how two orthogonal linkage groups, that is, organotin and lanthanide cations, can be used to drive the aggregation of a giant molecular metal oxide superstructure. The title compound {[(Sn(CH3)2)2O]4{[CeW5O18] [TeW4O16][CeSn(CH3)2]4[TeW8O31]4}2}46&#8722; (1&#8201;a) features dimensions of ca. 2.2&#215;2.3&#215;3.4&#8197;nm3 and a molecular weight of ca. 25&#8197;kDa. Structural analysis shows the hierarchical aggregation from several independent subunits. Initial biomedical tests show that 1 features an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HeLa cells based on an apoptosis pathway. In&#8197;vivo experiments in mice reveal the antiproliferative activity of 1 and open new paths for further development of this new compound class.

&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical assembly of a giant heterometallic polyoxotungstate supercluster with a molecular weight of ca. 25&#8197;kDa is reported. Geometrically unrestricted cerium(III) and geometrically restricted dimethyl tin cation linkers are used to gain access to a giant molecular species featuring three different polyoxometalate building units. The compound demonstrates in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antiproliferative activity against HeLa cervical cancer cell lines.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hierarchical aggregation of molecular nanostructures from multiple components is a grand synthetic challenge, which requires highly selective linkage control. We demonstrate how two orthogonal linkage groups, that is, organotin and lanthanide cations, can be used to drive the aggregation of a giant molecular metal oxide superstructure. The title compound {[(Sn(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;{[CeW&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;] [TeW&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;][CeSn(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[TeW&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;46&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) features dimensions of ca. 2.2&#215;2.3&#215;3.4&#8197;nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a molecular weight of ca. 25&#8197;kDa.

         <title>Synthesis of Single&#8208;Handed Helical Spiro&#8208;Conjugated Ladder Polymers through Quantitative and Chemoselective Cyclizations**
</title>

Both right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical spiro&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers were successfully synthesized through quantitative and chemoselective acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular alkyne benzannulations of random&#8208;coil precursor polymers containing optically&#8208;active 1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane units as a spiro&#8208;type chiral linkage in the main chain that relies on the 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents introduced to the 4&#8208;alkoxyphenylethynyl pendants.







Abstract
We report the unprecedented synthesis of one&#8208;handed helical spiro&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers with well&#8208;defined primary and secondary structures, in which the spiro&#8208;linked dibenzo[a,h]anthracene fluorophores are arranged in a one&#8208;handed twisting direction, through quantitative and chemoselective acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclizations of random&#8208;coil precursor polymers composed of chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane and achiral bis[2&#8208;(4&#8208;alkoxyphenyl)ethynyl]phenylene units. Intense circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were observed, whereas the precursor polymers exhibited negligible CD and CPL activities. The introduction of 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents on the 4&#8208;alkoxyphenylethynyl pendants is of key importance for this simple, quantitative, and chemoselective cyclization. This strategy is applicable to the defect&#8208;free precise synthesis of other varieties of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and coplanar ladder polymers that have not been achieved before.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Reagent&#8208;Free Formal Aza&#8208;Wacker Cyclizations Enabled by Continuous&#8208;Flow Electrochemistry</title>

A continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical aza&#8208;Wacker&#8208;type cyclization reaction that is free of catalyst, oxidant, supporting electrolyte, and additives is presented. The method is scalable and compatible with di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrasubstituted alkenes.







Abstract
The development of efficient and sustainable methods to access saturated N&#8208;heterocycles is of great importance because of the prevalence of these structures in natural products and bioactive compounds. Pd&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Wacker type cyclization is a powerful method and provides access to N&#8208;heterocycles bearing an alkene moiety available for further synthetic manipulations from readily available materials. Herein we disclose a catalyst&#8208; and reagent&#8208;free formal aza&#8208;Wacker type cyclization reaction for the synthesis of functionalized saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. Key to the success is to conduct the reactions in a continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical reactor without adding supporting electrolyte or additives. The reactions are characterized by broad tolerance of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes.

Organic crystals with polymer composite coatings which involved layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembled (PDDA/PSS)9 polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) and a succeeding PVA layer are reported. The PVA&#8208;(PDDA/PSS)9&#8208;coated single crystals can remain intact over 24&#8197;h in a variety of organic solvents without being damaged and as optical waveguides are as efficient as the uncoated crystals.







Abstract
Recently, luminescent organic crystals have been widely studied as new optoelectronic materials. However, corrosion and dissolution of organic crystals by solvents have always been a great challenge for the application of organic crystals in various fields. In this work, we propose a general method of fabricating a solvent&#8208;resistant coating to prevent organic crystals from being corroded or dissolved by organic solvents. The coatings involved layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDDA) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) onto crystals, followed by immersing the coated crystals into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solutions for 2&#8197;minutes. The coated crystals can remain intact over 24&#8197;h in common organic solvents without being damaged and even insoluble in dichloromethane for 5&#8197;days. Moreover, the thin and transparent coatings have little effect on the optical properties of crystals which still have excellent optical waveguide performance with the coatings.

         <title>Dispersion&#8208;Bound Isolated Dimers in the Gas Phase: Observation of the Shortest Intermolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C Distance via Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy</title>

Head&#8208;on Collision: Isolated gas phase triphenylmethane based dimers containing dispersion energy donors form a head&#8208;to&#8208;head structure with an extremely short C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C distance with a collinear arrangement of atoms. This surprising result from molecular beam experiments indicates that it is London dispersion but not crystal packing, responsible for this peculiar structural arrangement.







Abstract
The triphenylmethane and all&#8208;meta tert&#8208;butyl triphenylmethane dimers, (TPM)2 and (T&#8201;tBuPM)2, respectively, were studied with ionization loss stimulated Raman spectroscopy in molecular beam experiments to resolve structure sensitive vibrations. This answers the question whether the recently reported linear head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement in (T&#8201;tBuPM)2 results from crystal packing or prevails also in the gas phase, and therefore must result from extraordinarily strong London dispersion (LD) interactions. Our study clearly demonstrates that the head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement is maintained even under isolated molecular beam conditions in the absence of crystal packing effects. The central Raman&#8208;active aliphatic C&#8722;D vibration of appropriately deuterated (T&#8201;tBuPM)2 associated with an unusually short C&#8722;D&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;D&#8722;C distance exhibits a strong blue&#8208;shift compared to the undisturbed case. As the LD stabilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups are absent in (TPM)2, it displays an approximately S6&#8208;symmetric tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement.

This answers the question whether the recently reported linear head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement in (T&#8201;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;BuPM)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; results from crystal packing or prevails also in the gas phase, and therefore must result from extraordinarily strong London dispersion (LD) interactions. Our study clearly demonstrates that the head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement is maintained even under isolated molecular beam conditions in the absence of crystal packing effects. The central Raman&#8208;active aliphatic C&#8722;D vibration of appropriately deuterated (T&#8201;&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;BuPM)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; associated with an unusually short C&#8722;D&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;D&#8722;C distance exhibits a strong blue&#8208;shift compared to the undisturbed case. As the LD stabilizing &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butyl groups are absent in (TPM)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it displays an approximately &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;symmetric tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Large Sized Siloxene Nanosheets as Bifunctional Photocatalyst for a Li&#8208;O2 Battery with Superior Round&#8208;Trip Efficiency and Extra&#8208;Long Durability</title>

Ultra&#8208;large sized and few layered siloxene nanosheets have been used as a bifunctional photocatalyst in a Li&#8208;O2 battery. Due to its superior photoelectric characters, the assembled photo&#8208;assisted battery has exhibited a breakthrough round&#8208;trip efficiency up to 185&#8201;%.







Abstract
Developing new optimized bifunctional photocatalyst is of great significant for achieving the high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Herein, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 system is constructed by using siloxene nanosheets with ultra&#8208;large size and few&#8208;layers due to its superior light harvesting, semiconductor characteristic, and low recombination rate. An ultra&#8208;low charge potential of 1.90&#8197;V and ultra&#8208;high discharge of 3.51&#8197;V have been obtained due to the introduction of this bifunctional photocatalyst into Li&#8208;O2 batteries, and these results have realized the round&#8208;trip efficiency up to 185&#8201;%. In addition, this photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries exhibits a high rate (129&#8201;% round&#8208;trip efficiency at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a prolonged cycling life with 92&#8201;% efficiency retention after 100&#8197;cycles, and the highly reversible capacity of 1170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.75&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work will open the vigorous opportunity for high&#8208;efficiency utilization of solar energy into electric system.

         <title>Construction of Highly Ordered Glyco&#8208;Inside Nano&#8208;Assemblies through RAFT Dispersion Polymerization of Galactose&#8208;Decorated Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11098-11103, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing numerous intermediate morphologies are fabricated by leveraging RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated monomer for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. This method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to expand the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.







Abstract
Glyco&#8208;assemblies derived from amphiphilic sugar&#8208;decorated block copolymers (ASBCs) have emerged prominently due to their wide application, for example, in biomedicine and as drug carriers. However, to efficiently construct these glyco&#8208;assemblies is still a challenge. Herein, we report an efficient technology for the synthesis of glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies by utilizing RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated methacrylate for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Using this approach, a series of highly ordered glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing intermediate morphologies were fabricated by adjusting the length of the hydrophobic glycoblock and the polymerization solids content. A specific morphology of complex vesicles was captured during the PISA process and the formation mechanism is explained by the morphology of its precursor and intermediate. Thus, this method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to enable the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.

We report on the construction of a new type of protein corona, termed binding&#8208;mediated protein corona. This new corona enables the efficient and controllable delivery of functional proteins, which is otherwise challenging for conventional protein coronae.







Abstract
Protein coronae formed with nanoparticles confer several useful properties. However, the non&#8208;specific nature of protein corona formation makes it difficult to deliver specific proteins for therapeutic applications. Herein, we report on the construction of a new type of protein corona, termed binding&#8208;mediated protein corona. This new corona enables the efficient and controllable delivery of functional proteins, which is otherwise challenging for conventional protein coronae. We show the design and delivery of the ribonucleoprotein corona for the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Successful gene editing in human cell lines (Hela and HEK293) demonstrates the efficient delivery, high stability, low cytotoxicity, and well&#8208;controlled activity of the Cas9&#8208;guide RNA ribonucleoprotein. The binding&#8208;mediated protein corona strategy opens up new opportunities for therapeutic protein delivery.

         <title>Dynamic Protease Activation on a Multimeric Synthetic Protein Scaffold via Adaptable DNA&#8208;Based Recruitment Domains</title>

A hexameric protein recruitment platform allows controlled assembly and activation of caspase&#8208;9 enzymes using short DNA sequences as modular recruitment domains. Simple molecular tuning of the DNA recruitment domains enables reversible switching or kinetic inhibition of the proximity&#8208;induced enzyme activation.







Abstract
Hexameric hemoprotein (HTHP) is employed as a scaffold protein for the supramolecular assembly and activation of the apoptotic signalling enzyme caspase&#8208;9, using short DNA elements as modular recruitment domains. Caspase&#8208;9 assembly and activation on the HTHP platform due to enhanced proximity is followed by combinatorial inhibition at high scaffold concentrations. The DNA recruitment domains allow for reversible switching of the caspase&#8208;9 assembly and activity state using short modulatory DNA strands. Tuning of the recruitment domain affinity allows for generating kinetically trapped active enzyme complexes, as well as for dynamic repositioning of caspases over scaffold populations and inhibition using monovalent sink platforms. The conceptual combination of a highly structured multivalent protein platform with modular DNA recruitment domains provides emergent biomimicry properties with advanced levels of control over protein assembly.

The joint application of experimental and computational approaches discloses unprecedented mechanistic intricacies associated to Cp*Co&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reactions when using nucleophilic coupling partners. The use of trifluoromethylthiolation reveals an exceptional reductive elimination event from high&#8208;valent Cp*CoIV that can be promoted by either chemical oxidants or electrochemical methods.







Abstract
The potential access to CoIV species for promoting transformations that are particularly challenging at CoIII still remains underexploited in the context of Cp*Co&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. Herein, we disclose a combined experimental and computational strategy for uncovering the participation of Cp*CoIV species in a Cp*Co&#8208;mediated C&#8722;S bond&#8208;reductive elimination. These studies support the intermediacy of high&#8208;valent Cp*Co species in C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, under oxidative conditions, when involving nucleophilic coupling partners.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoredox [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/retro&#8208;Mannich&#8208;type reaction was developed for the concise synthesis of cyclohepta[b]indoles, which is initiated by a novel process of single&#8208;electron transfer from the enaminone moiety.







Abstract
A novel method for the concise synthesis of cyclohepta[b]indoles in high yields was developed. The method involves a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, photocatalyzed [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/ retro&#8208;Mannich&#8208;type reaction of enaminones. Experimental and computational studies suggested that the reaction is a photoredox process initiated by single&#8208;electron oxidation of an enaminone moiety, which undergoes subsequent cyclobutane formation and rapidly fragmentation in a radical&#8208;cation state to form cyclohepta[b]indoles.

The electrophotocatalytic C&#8722;H heterofunctionalization of arenes with high chemoselectivity under both batch and flow conditions is demonstrated.







Abstract
The electrophotocatalytic heterofunctionalization of arenes is described. Using 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyanoquinone (DDQ) under a mild electrochemical potential with visible&#8208;light irradiation, arenes undergo oxidant&#8208;free hydroxylation, alkoxylation, and amination with high chemoselectivity. In addition to batch reactions, an electrophotocatalytic recirculating flow process is demonstrated, enabling the conversion of benzene to phenol on a gram scale.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Fluorogenic Probe for Imaging Orthotopic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective fluorescence imaging of biomarker in vivo and in situ for evaluating orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) chemotherapy remains a great challenge due to current imaging agents suffering from the potential interferences of other hydrolases. Herein, we observed that carbamate unit showed a high selectivity toward HCC&#8208;related biomarker (carboxylesterase, CE) for evaluation of treatment. A near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe was developed to not only specially image CE activity in vivo and in situ but also target orthotopic liver tumor after systemic administration. In vivo signals of probe correlating well with tumor apoptosis make it possible to evaluate the status of treatment. Excellent property of probe enables the first imaging of CE activity in situ with high resolution three&#8208;dimensional view. This study may promote advancements in optical imaging approach for precise imaging&#8208;guided diagnosis of HCC in situ and its evaluation of treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Stacked Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dendrimers for Highly Efficient White Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Stacked dendrimers consisting of cofacially aligned donors and acceptors are developed by introducing three dendritic teracridan donors with orthogonal configuration and three triazine acceptors in periphery of hexaphenylbenzene skeleton. The dendritic structure and orthogonal configuration of teracridan not only make their outer acridan segments approaching to acceptor in close distance, but also fix donor and acceptor in face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment, leading to through&#8208;space charge transfer emission with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) effect. By regulating charge transfer strength via substituent effect of acceptor, emission color of the dendrimers can be tuned from blue to yellow/red region. Solution&#8208;processed two&#8208;color white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on blue and yellow &#960;&#8208;stacked donor&#8208;acceptor dendrimers exhibit the maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.6% and maximum power efficiency of 58.9 lm W  &#8208;1  , representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency for all&#8208;TADF white OLEDs by solution process.</dc:description>

         <title>General Synthesis of Ordered Mesoporous Carbonaceous Hybrid Nanostructures with Molecularly Dispersed Polyoxometallates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid nanomaterials with controlled dimensions, intriguing components and ordered structures have attracted significant attention in nanoscience and technology. Herein, we report a facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores. By using various polyoxometallates such as ammonium phosphomolybdate, silicotungstic acid, and phosphotungstic acid, our approach can be generalized to synthesize ordered mesoporous hybrid nanostructures with diverse compositions and morphologies (nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical architectures, nanospheres, and nanorods). Moreover, the ordered mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical hybrids with molecularly dispersed POMs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol with the high isobutene selectivity (100 %) and long&#8208;term catalytic durability (80 h).</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning&#160;of Chiral Microenvironments within Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates for Enhanced Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the formation of an unexpected and unique family of multi&#8208;chiral helicates with self&#8208;amplifying enantioselectivity. Crystal structures show that these triple&#8208;stranded Zn  II  2  L  3  complexes are held together by subcomponent assembly of axially chiral diamine&#8208;functionalized 1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenol ditopic with 2&#8208;formylpyridine and Zn(II). Specifically, the molecular helicity of the complexes can be controlled by the absolute configurations of the bimetallic vertices, which has been shown to be homoconfiguration (&#916;&#916;) or mesomeric configuration (&#916;&#923;), depending critically on the bulky groups and length of the spacers. Fascinatingly, in this system we can engineer the space&#8208;restricted multi&#8208;chiral microenvironments with varied polar and apolar moieties, which profoundly influence the binding affinities and chiral discrimination properties of the helicates, leading to highly enantio&#8208; and helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective recognition for chiral amino alcohols (up to 9.35). This work reveals the transformation of single&#8208;molecule chirality to global multi&#8208;chirality within well&#8208;defined helicates and demonstrates their chiral discriminations are highly dependent on the superior microenvironments.</dc:description>

         <title>Low dimensional inorganic tin perovskite solar cells by a template growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manipulation of the dimensionality and nanostructures based on precise control of the crystal growth kinetics boosts the flourishing development of perovskite optoelectronic materials and devices. Herein, a low&#8208;dimensional inorganic tin halide perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8208;x(SCN)x  with mixed 2D and 3D structure is fabricated. Kinetic study indicates that Sn(SCN)2  and phenylethylamine hydroiodate can form 2D perovskite structure that acts as a template for the growth of 3D perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8208;x(SCN)x. The film shows out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and large grain size, giving rise to reduced defect density, superior thermostability and oxidation resistance. Solar cell based on this low&#8208;dimensional film reaches a power conversion efficiency of 5.01%, which is the highest value for CsSnBrxI3&#8208;x  perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the device shows enhanced stability in ambient air. Low&#8208;dimensional inorganic structure provides a route for the development of high efficiency and stable tin halide perovskite solar cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Selenophene&#8208;Containing Narrow Bandgap Polymer Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with over 15% Efficiency and High Reproducibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have achieved tremendous progress due to the recent advances of polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs) and their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached over 14%. However, the practical applications of all&#8208;PSCs are still severely restricted by the lack of PSMAs with a broad absorption spectrum, high electron mobility, low energy loss, and good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility. Herein, a multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing PSMA, namely PFY&#8208;3Se, based on a selenophene&#8208;fused SMA framework and a selenophene &#960;&#8208;spacer was designed and developed. Compared to its thiophene analog PFY&#8208;0Se, PFY&#8208;3Se possesses a significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption (~30 nm), increased electron mobility, and improved intermolecular aggregation and packing. When matched with polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, the PFY&#8208;3Se&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs achieved an impressive PCE of 15.1% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density of 23.6 mA cm&#8208;2 and high fill factor of 0.737, and a low energy loss, which are among the best values in all&#8208;PSCs field reported so far and much better than those of thiophene analogs (PCE=13.0%). More importantly, PFY&#8208;3Se maintains similarly good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch properties which is very helpful for realizing reproducible device performance. This is the first reported and also is very rare for the PSMAs so far which provides a potential candidate for efficient all&#8208;PSCs toward practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Tricyanidoferrates(&#8211;IV) and Ruthenates(&#8211;IV) with Non&#8208;Innocent Cyanido&#160;Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exceptionally electron&#8208;rich, nearly trigonal&#8208;planar tricyanidometalate anions [Fe(CN)3]7&#8211;  and [Ru(CN)3]7&#8211;  were stabilized in LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] and  Ae3.5M(CN)3] (Ae  = Sr, Ba;  M  = Fe, Ru). They are the first examples of group 8 elements with the oxidation state of &#8211;IV. Microcrystalline powders were obtained by a solid&#8208;state route, single&#8208;crystals from alkali metal flux. While LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] crystallizes in  P  63/m  , the polar space group  P  63  with three&#8208;fold cell volume for  Ae3.5[M(CN)3] is confirmed by second harmonic generation. X&#8208;ray diffraction, IR and Raman spectroscopy reveal longer C&#8211;N distances (124&#8211;128 pm) and much lower stretching frequencies (1484&#8211;1634 cm&#8211;1  ) than in classical cyanidometalates. Weak C&#8211;N bonds in combination with strong  M  &#8211;C &#960;&#8208;bonding is a scheme also known for carbonylmetalates.

         <title>Can Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Work at Sub&#8208;Zero Temperatures?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient energy storage at low temperatures starves for competent battery techniques. Herein, inherent advantages of zinc&#8211;air batteries on low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage are discovered. The electrode reactions are resistive against low temperatures to render feasible working zinc&#8211;air batteries under sub&#8208;zero temperatures. The relatively reduced ionic conductivity of electrolyte is identified as the main limiting factor, which can be addressed by employing a CsOH&#8208;based electrolyte through regulating the solvation structures. Accordingly, 500 cycles with a stable voltage gap of 0.8 V at 5.0 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved at &#8722;10oC. This work reveals the promising potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries for low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage and inspires advanced battery systems under extreme working conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A modular in vitro platform for the production of terpenes and polyketides from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A long&#8208;term goal in realizing a sustainable biocatalysis and organic synthesis is the direct use of the greenhouse gas CO  2  as feedstock for the production of bulk and fine chemicals, such as pharma&#173;ceuticals, fragrances and food&#8208;additives. Here we developed a modular  in vitro  platform for the continuous conversion of CO  2  into complex multi&#8208;carbon compounds, such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and polyketides. Combining natural and synthetic metabolic pathway modules, we established a route from CO  2  into the key intermediates acetyl&#8208; and malonyl&#8208;CoA, which can be subsequently diversified through the action of different terpene and polyketide synthases. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates the simul&#173;taneous operation of different metabolic modules comprising of up to 29 enzymes in one pot, which opens the way for developing and optimizing synthesis routes for the generation of complex CO  2  &#8208;based chemicals in the future.</dc:description>

Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates the simul&#173;taneous operation of different metabolic modules comprising of up to 29 enzymes in one pot, which opens the way for developing and optimizing synthesis routes for the generation of complex CO  2  &#8208;based chemicals in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformational control of chemical reactivity for surface&#8208;confined Ru&#8208;porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We assess the crucial role of tetrapyrrole flexibility in the CO ligation to distinct Ru&#8208;porphyrins supported on an atomistically well&#8208;defined Ag(111) substrate. Our systematic real space visualisation and manipulation experiments with scanning tunnelling microscopy directly probe the ligation, while bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray standing waves measurements characterise the geometry, X&#8208;ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy the electronic structure, and temperature programmed desorption the binding strength. Density functional theory calculations provide additional insight into the functional interface. We unambiguously demonstrate that the substituents regulate the interfacial conformational adaptability, either promoting or obstructing the uptake of axial CO adducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of the Catalytic Activity of Thrombin for Fibrin Formation by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes catalyze a vast variety of reactions rendering the regulation of their activity a key method to control biological function. In this work, we report two systems enabling the ultrasound&#8208;induced activation of thrombin, which is vital for the coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis. Firstly, we designed polyaptamers, which can specifically bind to thrombin inhibiting its catalytic activity. With both ultrasound generating inertial cavitation (20 kHz) and therapeutic medical focused ultrasound (5 MHz), the specific interactions between polyaptamer and enzyme are cleaved restoring the activity of thrombin to catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin. Secondly, we expanded this approach to split aptamers conjugated to the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). In the presence of thrombin, these assemble into an aptamer tertiary structure, induce AuNP aggregation, and deactivate the enzyme. By ultrasonication, the AuNP aggregates disassemble releasing and activating the enzyme. Notably, the latter process is reversible and can be induced multiple times without apparent fatigue. We envision that this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept approach to regulate the activity of aptamer&#8208;guarded enzymes by ultrasound will be a blueprint to control the function of other proteins by mechanical stimuli and open further avenues in sonogenetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Telluroxane Bowls Connected by a Layer of Iodine Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenyltelluroxane clusters of the composition [{(PhTe)  19  O  24  }  2  I  18  (solv)] (  1  ) are formed during the hydrolysis of [PhTeI  3  ]  2  or the oxidation of various phenyltellurium(II) compounds with iodine under hydrolytic conditions. The compounds consist of two half&#8208;spheres with a {(PhTe)  19  O  24  }  9+  network, which are connected by 18 iodine atoms. The spherical clusters can accommodate solvent molecules such as pyridine or methanol in the center of two rings formed by iodine atoms. The presence of other metal ions during the cluster formation results in a selective replacement of the central {PhTe}  3+  units of each half&#8208;sphere as has been demonstrated with the isolation of [{(PhTe)  18  ({Ca(H  2  O)  2  }O  24  }  2  I  16  ] (  2  ) and [{(PhTe)  18  ({Y(NO  3  )&#173;(H  2  O)}O  24  }  2  I  16  ] (  3  ). A crownether&#8208;like coordination by six oxygen atoms of the telluroxane network is found for the {Ca(H  2  O}  2  }  2+  and {Y(NO  3  )(H  2  O)}  2+  building blocks. Mass spectrometric studies show that considerable amounts of the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling catenation in Ge(I) chemistry through hemi&#8208;lability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel approach for constructing chains of group 14 metal atoms linked by unsupported metal&#8208;metal bonds that exploits hemi&#8208;labile ligands to generate unsaturated metal sites. The formation/nature of catenated species (oligo&#8208;dimetallynes) can be controlled by the use of (acidic/basic) 'protecting groups' and through variation of the ligand scaffold. Reduction of ArNiPr2GeCl (ArNiPr2&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;(iPr2NCH&#173;&#173;2)2C6H&#173;3) &#8208; featuring hemi&#8208;labile NiPr2&#160;donors &#8208; yields (ArNiPr2Ge)4&#160;(2), which contains a tetrameric Ge4&#160;chain.&#160;2&#160;is the first example of a linear homo&#8208;catenated Ge(I) compound featuring unsupported E&#8210;E bonds. Trapping experiments reveal that a key structural component is the central two&#8208;way Ge=Ge donor&#8208;acceptor bond: reactions with IMe4&#160;and W(CO)5(NMe3) give the base&#8208; or acid&#8208;stabilized digermynes (ArNiPr2Ge(IMe4))2&#160;&#160;(4) and (ArNiPr2Ge{W(CO)5})2&#160;(5), respectively.&#160;The use of smaller&#160;N&#8208;donors leads to stronger Ge&#8210;N interactions and quenching of catenation behaviour: reduction of ArNEt2GeCl gives the digermyne (ArNEt2Ge)2, while the unsymmetrical system ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2&#160;dimerizes to give tetranuclear (ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2)2through aggregation at the NiPr2&#8208;ligated Ge(I) centres.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of electrostatic interaction on bulk morphology in efficient donor&#8208;acceptor photovoltaic blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulk heterojunctions comprising mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials have proven to be the most efficient device structures for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The bulk morphology of such cells plays a critical role in charge generation, recombination, and transport, thereby determining the device performance. Although numerous studies have discussed the morphology&#8208;performance relationship of these cells, the method of designing OPV materials with the desired morphology remains unclear. In this work, guided by molecular electrostatic potential distributions, we have established a connection between the chemical structure and bulk morphology. Our findings demonstrate that the molecular orientation at the D&#8208;A interface and the domain purity in the blend can be effectively modulated by modifying the functional groups. In addition, enhancing the D&#8208;A interaction is beneficial for charge generation. However, the resulting low domain purity and increased charge transfer ratio in its hybridization with the local excitation states lead to severe charge recombination. Our work proposes a molecular design strategy that can finely&#8208;tune the bulk morphology to achieve balanced charge generation and recombination, which is crucial for further boosting the efficiency of the OPV cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;responsive gene delivery from perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions through cleavable poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical utility of emulsions as delivery vehicles is hindered by a dependence on passive release. Stimuli&#8208;responsive emulsions overcome this limitation but rely on external triggers or are composed of nanoparticle&#8208;stabilized droplets that preclude sizes necessary for biomedical applications. Here, we employ cleavable poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) diblock copolymer surfactants to form perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsions that release cargo upon exposure to glutathione. These surfactants allow for the first example of redox&#8208;responsive nanoemulsions in cellulo. A noncovalent fluorous tagging strategy is leveraged to solubilize a GFP plasmid inside the PFC nanoemulsions, whereupon protein expression is achieved selectively when employing a stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactant. This work contributes a methodology for non&#8208;viral gene delivery and represents a general approach to nanoemulsions that respond to endogenous stimuli.</dc:description>

This work contributes a methodology for non&#8208;viral gene delivery and represents a general approach to nanoemulsions that respond to endogenous stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Archaeal Lipid Parallel GDGT&#8208;0 (Isocaldarchaeol)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Archaeal glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT) are some of the most unusual membrane lipids identified in nature. These amphiphiles are the major constituents of the membranes of numerous Archaea, some of which are extremophilic organisms. Due to their unique structures, there has been significant interest in studying both the biophysical properties and the biosynthesis of these molecules. However, these studies have thus far been hampered by limited access to chemically pure samples. Herein, we report a concise and stereoselective synthesis of the archaeal tetraether lipid parallel GDGT&#8208;0 and the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of derivatives bearing different polar groups.</dc:description>

         <title>A Divergent Strategy for Site&#8208;Selective Radical Disulfuration of Carboxylic Acids with Trisulfide&#8208;1,1&#8208;Dioxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct conversion of carboxylic acids to disulfides is described. The approach employs oxidative photocatalysis for the base&#8208;promoted decarboxylation of the substrate, which yields an alkyl radical that engages a trisulfide dioxide by homolytic substitution. The trisulfide dioxides are easily prepared via a newly described approach. Each of 1 &#176; , 2 &#176; &#160;and 3 &#176; carboxylic acids with varied substitution are good substrates, including amino acids and substrates with highly activated C&#8208;H bonds. Trisulfide dioxides are also used to achieve&#160; &#947; &#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8211;H disulfuration of amides via radical relay. In both reactions, the sulfonyl radical that results from substitution propagates the reaction. Factors governing the selectivity of substitution at S2 vs S3 of the trisulfide dioxides are explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Nano&#8208;Amperometric Measurement of Intravesicular Glutamate Content and of its Sub&#8208;Quantal Release by Living Neurons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutamate (Glu) is a crucial fundamental excitatory neurotransmitter released through vesicular exocytosis in the central nervous system. Hence, quantitative measurements of intravesicular Glu and of transient exocytotic release contents directly from individual living neurons are highly desired for understanding the mechanisms (full or sub&#8208;quantal release?) of synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, this could not be achieved so far due to the lack of adequate experimental strategies relying on selective and sensitive Glu nanosensors. Herein, we introduce a novel electrochemical Glu nanobiosensor based on a single SiC nanowire prone to selectively measure in real&#8208;time Glu fluxes released via exocytosis by large Glu vesicles (  ca.  125 nm diameter) present in single hippocampal axonal varicosities as well as their intravesicular content before exocytosis. Combination of these two series of measurements revealed a sub&#8208;quantal release mode in living hippocampal neurons, viz., only ca. one third to one half of intravesicular Glu molecules are released by individual vesicles during exocytotic events. Importantly, this fraction remained practically the same when hippocampal neurons were pretreated with L&#8208;Glu&#8208;precursor L&#8208;glutamine, while it significantly increased after zinc treatment, although in both cases the intravesicular contents were drastically affected. By affording quantitative measurements of intravesicular Glu inside living neurons and of its sub&#8208;quantal release fractions this work is opening new possibilities for investigating in situ and in time the regulatory mechanisms of glutamatergic neurotransmission and plasticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of photolatent bases for locally controlling dynamic exchange reactions in thermo&#8208;activated vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers exhibit a covalently crosslinked network structure as characteristic for classic thermosetting polymers. However, they are capable of rearranging their network topology by thermo&#8208;activated associative exchange reactions when the topology freezing transition temperature (  T  v  ) is exceeded. Despite the vast number of developed vitrimers, there is a serios lack in methods which enable a (spatially) controlled onset of these rearrangement reactions above  T  v  . Herein, we highlight the localized release of the efficient transesterification catalyst 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) by the UV&#8208;induced cleavage of a photolatent base within a covalently crosslinked thiol&#8208;epoxy network. Demonstrated with stress relaxation measurements conducted well above the network&#8217;s  T  v  , only the controlled release of TBD facilitates the immediate onset of transesterifications in terms of a viscoelastic flow. Moreover, the spatially resolved UV&#8208;mediated photoactivation of vitrimeric properties is confirmed by permanent shape changes induced locally in the material.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of high&#8208;quality, small&#8208;sized rare&#8208;earth metal nanoparticles (1&#8208;3&#160;nm) &#8211; ranging from lanthanum as one of the largest (187&#160;pm) to scandium as the smallest (161&#160;pm) rare&#8208;earth metal &#8211; is shown. Size, oxidation state, and reactivity of the nanoparticles are examined (e.g., electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, selected reactions). Whereas the nanoparticles are highly reactive (e.g. in contact to air and water), they are chemically stable as THF suspension and powder under inert conditions. The reactivity can be controlled to obtain inorganic and metal&#8208;organic compounds at room&#8208;temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of A Nitrogenase PN&#8208;Cluster Model with [Fe8S7(&#956;&#8208;Sthiolate)2] Core from the All&#8208;ferric [Fe4S4(Sthiolate)4] Cubane Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing synthetic models of the nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge. Here, we report an optimal nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster model [{(TbtS)(OEt2)Fe4S3}2(&#956;&#8208;STbt)2(&#956;6&#8208;S)] ( 2 ) [Tbt = 2,4,6&#8208;tris{bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl}phenyl] that is the closest synthetic mimic constructed to date. Of note is that two thiolate ligands and one hexacoordinated sulfide are connecting the two Fe4S3 incomplete cubanes similar to the native PN&#8208;cluster, which has never been achieved. Cluster 2 has been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and relevant physico&#8208;chemical methods. The variable temperature magnetic moments of 2 indicate a singlet ground state (S = 0). The M&#246;ssbauer spectrum of 2 exhibit two doublets with an intensity ratio of 3:1, which suggests the presence of two types of iron sites. The synthetic pathway of the cluster 2 could indicate the native PN&#8208;cluster maturation process as it has been achieved from the Fe4S4 cubane Fe4S4(STbt)4 ( 1 ).</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Planar Perylene Bisimide Analogues with Inserted Carbonyl and Methylene Subunits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>T he synthesis and properties of&#160; dinaphthotropone bisimide (DNTrBI) and dinaphthocycloheptatriene bisimide (DNCHepBI) are described.&#160;Their molecular design is conceptually based on the insertion of a carbon atom into a perylene bisimide (PBI) core. These molecules adopt non&#8208;planar structures due to the presence of a seven&#8208;membered ring. The PBI derivative into which a carbonyl group was inserted (DNTrBI) immediately underwent nonradiative decay and/or intersystem crossing in its excited state. The PBI derivative into which a methylene group was inserted (DNCHepBI) was susceptible to deprotonation on account of the two electron&#8208;withdrawing naphthalene monoimide units. Subsequent aerobic oxidation resulted in the formation of a C&#8208;C bond at the central methylene unit, thus affordin g a&#160; &#963;&#8208;dimer. The formation of th is&#160; C&#8208;C bond is dynamically redox&#8208;active, i.e., electron injection into the &#963;&#8208;dimer almost&#160; quantitatively&#160; regenerated the deprotonated DNCHepBI .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkene hydrogenation is presented as the strategy  par excellence  to prepare saturated isoprenoids and mycoketides. This highly stereoselective synthesis approach is combined with an established  13  C&#8208;NMR method to determine the enantioselectivity of each methyl&#8208;branched stereocenter. It is shown that this analysis is fit for purpose and the combination allows the synthesis of the title compounds with a significant increase in efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Hydro(Chloro)pentafluorosulfanylation of Diazo Compounds with Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF  5  Cl) is the most prevalent reagent for the incorporation of SF  5  group into organic compounds. However, the preparation of SF  5  Cl often relied on hazardous reagents and specialized apparatuses. Herein we described a safe and practical synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solution of SF  5  Cl in  n  &#8208;hexane under gas&#8208;reagent&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic application of SF  5  Cl was demonstrated through the unprecedented reaction with diazo compounds. The chemoselective hydro&#8208; and chloropentafluorosulfanylations of &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds were developed in the presence of K  3  PO  4  or copper catalyst respectively. These reactions provide a direct and efficient access to various  &#945;&#8208;pentafluorosulfanyl carbonyl compounds  of high value for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;energy&#8208;density Magnesium&#8208;air Battery Based on Dual&#8208;layer Gel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mg&#8208;air batteries are explored as the next&#8208;generation power systems for wearable and implantable electronics as they could work stably in neutral electrolytes and are also biocompatible. However, high corrosion rate and low utilization of Mg anode largely impair the performance of Mg&#8208;air battery with low discharge voltage, poor specific capacity and low energy density. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we first report a dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte to simultaneously solve the above two problems by preventing the corrosion of Mg anode and the production of&#160;dense passive layer, respectively. The resulting Mg&#8208;air batteries produced an average specific capacity of 2190 mAh&#183;g  &#8208;1  based on the total Mg anode (99.3% utilization rate of Mg anode) and energy density of 2282 Wh&#183;kg  &#8208;1  based on the total anode and air electrode, both of which are the highest among the reported Mg&#8208;air batteries. Besides, our Mg&#8208;air batteries could be made into a fiber shape, and they were flexible to work stably under various deformations such as bending and twisting.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Lithium Metal Anode in Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolyte with Electrochemically Induced Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal anode holds great promises for next&#8208;generation battery technologies but is notoriously difficult to work with. The key to solving this challenge is believed to lie in the ability of forming stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To further address potential safety issues, it is critical to achieve this goal in nonflammable electrolytes. Building upon previous successes in forming stable SEI in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, here we report that reversible Li stripping/plating could be realized in triethyl phosphate (TEP), a known flame retardant. The critical enabling factor of our approach was the introduction of oxygen, which upon electrochemical reduction induces the initial decomposition of TEP and produces Li  3  PO  4  and poly&#8208;phosphates. Importantly, the reaction was self&#8208;limiting, and the resulting material regulated Li plating by limiting dendrite formation. In effect, we obtained a functional SEI on Li metal in a nonflammable electrolyte. When tested in a symmetric Li||Li cell, more than 300 cycles of stripping/plating were measured at a current density of 0.5 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  . Prototypical Li&#8208;O  2  and Li&#8208;ion batteries were also fabricated and tested to further support the effectiveness of this strategy. The mechanism by which the SEI forms was studied by density functional theory (DFT), and the predictions were corroborated by the successful detection of the intermediates and products.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Labeling and Crosslinking by Covalent Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a new approach to selectively modify native proteins in their biological environment using electrophilic, covalent aptamers. These aptamers are generated through introduction of a proximity&#8208;driven electrophile at specific nucleic acid sites. Using thrombin as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that covalent aptamers can selectively transfer a variety of functional handles and/or irreversibly crosslink to the target protein. This approach offers broad programmability and high target specificity. Furthermore, it addresses issues common to aptamers such as instability towards endogenous nucleases and residence times during target engagement. Covalent aptamers are new tools that enable specific protein modification and sensitive protein detection. Moreover, they provide prolonged, nuclease&#8208;resistant enzyme inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Degrader for Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1/2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:   Aberrant activation of FGFR signaling occurs in many cancers, and ATP&#8208;competitive FGFR inhibitors have received regulatory approval. Despite demonstrating clinical efficacy, these inhibitors exhibit dose&#8208;limiting toxicity, potentially due to a lack of selectivity amongst the FGFR family and are poorly tolerated. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192, a bivalent degrader that couples the pan&#8208;FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 to a CRL2  VHL  E3 ligase recruiting ligand, which preferentially induces FGFR1&amp;2 degradation while largely sparing FGFR3&amp;4. DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 exhibited two  &#8208;digit nanomolar DC  50  s for both wildtype FGFR2 and several FGFR2&#8208;fusions, resulting in degradation&#8208;dependent antiproliferative activity in representative gastric cancer and cholangiocarcinoma cells. Importantly, DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 induced degradation of a clinically relevant FGFR2 fusion protein in a xenograft model. Taken together, we demonstrate that DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 has potential as a prototype FGFR degrader.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular cylinders target bulge structures in the 5'&#160;UTR of the RNA genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and inhibit viral replication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The untranslated regions (UTRs) of viral genomes contain a variety of conserved yet dynamic structures crucial for viral replication, providing drug targets for the development of broad spectrum anti&#8208;virals. We combine RNA analysis with Molecular Dynamics simulations to build the first 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key regions of the 5' UTR of &#160;the&#160;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. Furthermore, we determine the binding of metallo&#8208;supramolecular helicates (cylinders) to this RNA structure. These nano&#8208;size agents are uniquely able to thread through RNA junctions and we identify their binding to a 3&#8208;base bulge and the central cross 4&#8208;way junction located in the stem loop 5. Finally, we show these RNA&#8208;binding cylinders suppress SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication, highlighting their potential as novel anti&#8208;viral agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide nanomotors induce multiple acidosis in tumor cells by destroying tumor metabolic symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Destruction of tumor metabolism symbiosis is an attractive cancer treatment method which targets tumor cells with little harm to normal cells. Yet, a single intervention strategy and poor penetration of the drug in tumor tissue result in limited effect. Herein, we propose a zero&#8208;waste zwitterion&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S)&#8208;driven nanomotor based on the basic principle of reaction in human body. When loaded with monocarboxylic acid transporter inhibitor &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid (&#945;&#8208;CHCA), the nanomotor can move in tumor microenvironment and induce multiple acidosis of tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth through the synergistic effect of motion effect, driving force H  2  S and &#945;&#8208;CHCA. Given the good biosafety of the substrate and driving gas of this kind of nanomotor, as well as the limited variety of nanomotors currently available to move in the tumor microenvironment, this kind of nanomotor may provide a competitive candidate for the active drug delivery system of cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Electrolyte Engineering Enables Safe and Wide&#8208;Temperature Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte is an important component in redox flow batteries (RFBs) that determines the current capability, potential window, and safety, but both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes have their intrinsic limits. Here, we develop the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybrid electrolyte chemistry to enable the design of safe and wide&#8208;temperature RFBs. In addition to the non&#8208;flammable characteristics, the hybrid electrolyte also inherits the high electrochemical stability and wide operational temperature range. It can show a potential window of 2.5 V and maintain high ion conductivities at low temperatures. It also enables LiI to achieve high Coulombic efficiencies of &gt;99.9%, showing long cycling stability over 800 cycles. Moreover, it enables the successful operation of Zn/LiI RFBs at &#8208;20 &#176;C for 150 cycles with nearly no capacity loss. This study highlights the great potential of hybrid electrolyte chemistry for the approach of safe and high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale energy storage systems in wide temperature ranges.</dc:description>
