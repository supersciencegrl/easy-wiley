         <title>A&#8208;Site Diamine Cation Anchoring Enables Efficient Charge Transfer and Suppressed Ion Migration in Bi&#8208;based Hybrid Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the large distance or weak electronic conjugation between adjacent Bi&#8208;I octahedrons, the charge transport in the low&#8208;dimensional bismuth based hybrid perovskites is impeded and thus hinders their future developments. In this work, A&#8208;site cation engineering by monoamine BZA (benzylamine) and diamine 3&#8208;AMP (3&#8208;(aminomethyl)pyridine) has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy to regulate the corresponding activation energy of ionic migration and carrier transport capacity. Given the higher polarity of 3&#8208;AMP than BZA, producing a more efficient dielectric screening effect, it gives rise to obtaining the small exciton binding energy (50 meV) and low defect states (3.53 &#215; 109 cm&#8208;3). The reduced distance of adjacent Bi&#8208;I octahedrons by the bilateral anchoring of the 3&#8208;AMP2+ diamine cation enhances both electronic conjugation and charge transport performance. Therefore, the photodetector for (3&#8208;AMP)BiI5 SC shows a 243&#8208;fold increase in on/off ratio compared with the (BZA)3BiI6 SC.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking New Reactivities in Enzymes by Iminium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of biocatalysis in conquering challenging synthesis requires the constant input of new enzymes. Developing novel biocatalysts by absorbing catalysis modes from synthetic chemistry has yielded fruitful new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes. Organocatalysis was originally bio&#8208;inspired, and has risen as the third pillar of asymmetric catalysis. Transferring organocatalytic reactions back to enzyme platforms is a promising approach for biocatalyst creation. Herein, we summarize the recent developments in the design of novel biocatalysts that adopt iminium catalysis, a fundamental branch in organocatalysis. By repurposing existing enzymes or constructing artificial enzymes, various biocatalysts for iminium catalysis have been created and optimized via protein engineering to promote valuable abiological transformations. The recent advances in iminium biocatalysis illustrate the power of combining chemomimetic biocatalyst design and directed evolution to generate useful new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Pickering Emulsion Catalysis: Interfacial Chemistry, Catalyst Design, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pickering emulsions are particle&#8208;stabilized surfactant&#8208;free dispersions composed of two immiscible liquid phases, and emerge as attractive catalysis platform to surpass traditional technique barrier in some cases. In this review, we have comprehensively summarized the development and the catalysis applications of Pickering emulsions since the pioneering work in 2010. The explicit mechanism for Pickering emulsions will be initially discussed and clarified. Then, summarization is given to the design strategy of amphiphilic emulsion catalysts in two categories of intrinsic and extrinsic amphiphilicity. The progress of the unconventional catalytic reactions in Pickering emulsion is further described, especially for the polarity/solubility difference&#8208;driven phase segregation, &#8220;smart&#8221; emulsion reaction system, continuous flowing catalysis, and Pickering interfacial biocatalysis. Challenges and future trends for the development of Pickering emulsion catalysis are finally outlined.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric double hydroxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes was developed by using relay catalysis, providing a highly efficient route to chiral succinic acids (41 examples, 76&#8208;94%, 94&#8208;99%  ee  ). Key to success was the combinatorial use of a Pd precursor with two distinct phosphine ligands in one&#8208;pot manner. Synthetic utilities of this protocol were showcased in the facile synthesis of key intermediates for chiral pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepping Out of the Blue: From Visible to Near&#8208;IR Triggered Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light offers unique opportunities for controlling the activity of materials and bio&#8208;systems with high spatiotemporal resolution. Molecular photoswitches are chromophores that undergo reversible isomerization between different states upon irradiation with light, allowing a convenient means to control their influence over the system of interest. However, a significant limitation of classical photoswitches is the requirement to initiate the switching in one or both directions using deleterious UV light with poor tissue penetration. Red&#8208;shifted photoswitches are hence in high demand and has attracted keen recent research interest. In this Review, we highlight recent progress towards the development of visible&#8208; and NIR&#8208;activated photoswitches characterized by distinct photochromic reaction mechanisms. We hope that this review article will inspire further endeavors to this field, allowing the full potential of these tools in biotechnology and materials chemistry applications to be realized.</dc:description>

         <title>An Energy Dense, Powerful, Robust Bipolar Zinc&#8208;Ferrocene Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have been recognized as a promising option for scalable and dispatchable renewable energy storage (e.g., solar and wind energy). Zinc metal represents a low cost, high capacity anode material to develop high energy density aqueous redox flow batteries. However, the energy storage applications of traditional inorganic Zn halide flow batteries are primarily plagued by the material challenges of traditional halide cathode electrolytes (e.g., bromine), including corrosion, toxicity, and severe crossover. As reported here, we have developed a bipolar Zinc&#8208;ferrocene salt compound, Zinc 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;sulfonatopropyl)ferrocene, Zn[Fc(SPr)2] (1.80 M solubility or 48.2 Ah/L charge storage capacity) &#8211; a robust, energy&#8208;dense, bipolar redox&#8208;active electrolyte material for high performance Zn organic RFBs. Using a low&#8208;cost porous Daramic membrane, the Zn[Fc(SPr)2] aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) has worked in dual&#8208;flow and single&#8208;flow modes. It has manifested outstanding current, energy, and power performance, specifically operating at high current densities of up to 200 mA/cm2 and delivering an energy efficiency of up to 81.5% and a power density of up to 270.5 mW/cm2. A Zn[Fc(SPr)2] AORFB demonstrated an energy density of 20.2 Wh/L and displayed 100% capacity retention for 2000 cycles (1284 hr or 53.5 days). The Zn[Fc(SPr)2] ionic bipolar electrolyte not only offers record&#8208;setting, highly&#8208;stable, energy&#8208;dense, and the most powerful Zn&#8208;organic AORFBs to date, but it also provides a new paradigm to develop even more advanced redox materials for scalable energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming Receptor Clustering with DNA Probabilistic Circuits for Enhanced&#160; Natural Killer Cell&#160;Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing strategies to enhance the recognition ability of immune cells is important to the success of cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we report programming receptor clustering on membrane with DNA probabilistic circuits for enhanced immune cell recognition. By designing the circuit output to activate receptors for binding to adjacent receptors, we can engineer DNA probabilistic circuits for programmable regulation of receptor clustering. The generated receptor clusters show higher binding affinity to target cancer cells and improved membrane&#8208;anchoring stability compared with monomers. We demonstrate that programming receptor clustering could allow to modulate the recognition capability of natural killer cells and control natural killer cell&#8208;cancer cell interactions to promote efficient cancer cell killing. This work provides insights for precise control over cellular recognition and opens new opportunities for the development of cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>From Copper to Basic Copper Carbonate: A Reversible Conversion Cathode in Aqueous Anion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;ion batteries that use anions and cations as charge carriers represent a promising energy storage technology. However, an uncharted area is to explore transition metals as electrodes to host carbonate in conversion reactions. Here we report the reversible conversion reaction from copper to Cu  2  CO  3  (OH)  2  , where the copper electrode comprising K  2  CO  3  and KOH solid is self&#8208;sufficient with anion charge carriers. This electrode dissociates and associates K  +  ions during battery charge and discharge. The copper active mass and the anion&#8208;bearing cathode exhibit a reversible capacity of 664 mAh/g and 299 mAh/g, respectively, and relatively stable cycling in a saturated mixture electrolyte of K  2  CO  3  and KOH. The results open an avenue to use carbonate as a charge carrier for batteries to serve for the consumption and storage of CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Synthetic Affinity Probe Reveals Inhibitory Synapse Ultrastructure and Brain Connectivity**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short dimerized peptidic probe for high contrast visualization of inhibitory synapses in neuron cultures and brain tissue is presented. The probe can be flexibly applied both for widefield and confocal 3D volumetric synapse visualization, for inhibitory circuits mapping in tissue and for super&#8208;resolution imaging of synapses.







Abstract
Visualization of inhibitory synapses requires protocol tailoring for different sample types and imaging techniques, and usually relies on genetic manipulation or the use of antibodies that underperform in tissue immunofluorescence. Starting from an endogenous ligand of gephyrin, a universal marker of the inhibitory synapse, we developed a short peptidic binder and dimerized it, significantly increasing affinity and selectivity. We further tailored fluorophores to the binder, yielding &#8220;Sylite&#8221;&#8212;a probe with outstanding signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio that outperforms antibodies in tissue staining with rapid and efficient penetration, mitigation of staining artifacts, and simplified handling. In super&#8208;resolution microscopy Sylite precisely localizes the inhibitory synapse and enables nanoscale measurements. Sylite profiles inhibitory inputs and synapse sizes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the midbrain and combined with complimentary tracing techniques reveals the synaptic connectivity.

         <title>Scalable Nitrate Treatment for Constructing Integrated Surface Structures to Mitigate Capacity Fading and Voltage Decay of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable nitrate treatment for constructing surface&#8208;integrated structure was developed to mitigate capacity fading and voltage decay. A rule for building robust surface&#8208;integrated structure is also proposed. When the binding energy of the structure locates at a low level and the Bader charge of the O atoms nearest to the cationic atoms is as small as possible, an advanced Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode can be obtained.







Abstract
Capacity fading and voltage decay is one of the biggest obstacles for the practical application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides due to the serious surface&#8208;related detrimental reactions. Herein, we develop a versatile and scalable method to construct a robust surface&#8208;integrated structure. All the designed samples deliver outstanding capacity and voltage stability, among which the Zn&#8208;treated sample possesses the best electrochemical performance. Its capacity retention is larger than 90&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles with a voltage decay ratio as small as 0.73&#8197;mV per cycle. What is more, the rules of surface&#8208;integrated structure with different cations in terms of capacity and voltage stability is further deciphered by combining with density function theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that to obtain advanced Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes, cations in Li&#8208;sites should firstly ensure the binding energy of the surface&#8208;integrated structure in a lower level and then provide Bader charge for the nearest O atoms as small as possible.

         <title>1,3,2&#8208;Diazaphospholene&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cyclizations of Organohalides**

         <dc:description>
1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholenes hydrides (DAP&#8208;H) are shown as efficient catalysts for reductive radical cyclization of aryl and alkyl halides under irradiation with visible light. The pivotal DAP catalyst turnover was achieved by a DBU&#8208;assisted &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the formed DAP halide and HBpin.







Abstract
1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholenes hydrides (DAP&#8208;Hs) are highly nucleophilic organic hydrides serving as main&#8208;group catalysts for a range of attractive transformations. DAP hydrides can act as stoichiometric hydrogen atom transfer agents in radical reactions. Herein, we report a DAP&#8208;catalyzed reductive radical cyclization of a broad range of aryl and alkyl halides under mild conditions. The pivotal DAP catalyst turnover was achieved by a DBU&#8208;assisted &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between the formed DAP halide and HBpin, which rapidly regenerates DAP&#8208;H. The transformation is significantly accelerated by irradiation with visible light. Mechanistic investigations indicate that visible light irradiation leads to the formation of DAP dimers, which are in equilibrium with DAP radicals and accelerate the cyclization. The direct use of (DAP)2 enabled a catalytic protocol in the absence of light.

         <title>Highly Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Methanation with Water Vapor on Single&#8208;Atom Platinum&#8208;Decorated Defective Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically active sites are designed for CO2 methanation with water by integrating defective polymeric carbon nitride with single Pt atoms. Single Pt sites, carbon nitride defects and &#8722;OH groups synergistically work for different functions to achieve high activity and selectivity for CH4 production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 methanation with water is an important route to simultaneously address carbon neutrality and produce fuels. It is challenging to achieve high selectivity in CO2 methanation due to competing reactions. Nonetheless, aspects of the catalyst design can be controlled with meaningful effects on the catalytic outcomes. We report highly selective CO2 methanation with water vapor using a photocatalyst that integrates polymeric carbon nitride (CN) with single Pt atoms. As revealed by experimental characterization and theoretical simulations, the widely explored Pt&#8722;CN catalyst is adapted for selective CO2 methanation with our rationally designed synthetic method. The synthesis creates defects in CN along with formation of hydroxyl groups proximal to the coordinated Pt atoms. The photocatalyst exhibits high activity and carbon selectivity (99&#8201;%) for CH4 production in photocatalytic CO2 reduction with pure water. This work provides atomic scale insight into the design of photocatalysts for selective CO2 methanation.

The synthesis creates defects in CN along with formation of hydroxyl groups proximal to the coordinated Pt atoms. The photocatalyst exhibits high activity and carbon selectivity (99&#8201;%) for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction with pure water. This work provides atomic scale insight into the design of photocatalysts for selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realizing 1,1&#8208;Dehydration of Secondary Alcohols to Carbenes: Pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ols as a Source of Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal dehydration of secondary alcohols to carbenes and reverse back&#8208;hydration are showcased. The in situ generation of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes through the thermal 1,1&#8208;dehydration of secondary pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ol alcohols was realized and utilized for various purposes such as the synthesis of transition metal&#8208;carbene complexes. This methodology opens a door for further consideration of various secondary alcohols as sources of carbenes.







Abstract
Herein we report secondary pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ols as a source of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAAC) for the synthesis of CAAC&#8208;CuI&#8208;complexes and cyclic thiones when reacted with CuI&#8208;salts and elemental sulfur, respectively, under reductive elimination of water from the carbon(IV)&#8208;center. This result demonstrates a convenient and facile access to CAAC&#8208;based CuI&#8208;salts, which are well known catalysts for different organic transformations. It further establishes secondary alcohols to be a viable source of carbenes&#8212;realizing after 185&#8197;years Dumas&#8217; dream who tried to prepare the parent carbene (CH2) by 1,1&#8208;dehydration of methanol. Addressed is also the reactivity of water towards CAACs, which proceeds through an oxidative addition of the O&#8722;H bond to the carbon(II)&#8208;center. This emphasizes the ability of carbon&#8208;compounds to mimic the reactivity of transition&#8208;metal complexes: reversible oxidative addition and reductive elimination of the O&#8722;H bond to/from the C(II)/C(IV)&#8208;centre.

         <title>Strong Proton&#8208;Electron Coupling in &#960;&#8208;Planar Metal Complex with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong proton&#8208;electron coupling behavior of a &#960;&#8208;planar nickel(II) complex with redox&#8208;active N,S&#8208;ligands was demonstrated using optical and electrochemical methods as well as theoretical calculations. The potential&#8208;pH diagram shows a significant shift in the acidity&#8208;dependent redox potential, which is supported by the calculated energetic stabilization of frontier orbitals by protonation.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) of metal complexes has been widely studied, especially in biochemistry and catalytic chemistry. Although metal complexes bearing redox&#8208;active ligands play a part in these research areas, those with &#960;&#8208;planar structure remain entirely unexplored, which are vital for future development of iono&#8208;electronics. Here, proton&#8208;electron coupling of a &#960;&#8208;planar nickel complex bearing redox&#8208;active N,S&#8208;ligands, Ni(itsq)2, was investigated by combining experimental and theoretical approaches. Strong proton&#8208;electron coupling was manifested in a large potential shift, which is twice greater than that of a typical PCET&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;planar metal complex with redox&#8208;inactive ligands, [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8722;. Theoretical calculations affirmed that the stabilization of frontier orbitals by protonation is greater in Ni(itsq)2 than that in [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8722;. These results indicate that &#960;&#8208;planar metal complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands are promising for developing novel PCET&#8208;type materials.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Cyclic&#8208;Helical Polymers with Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic polymers attract attention because of their endless structure and unique properties, which differ from the linear analogs. However, the synthesis of cyclic polymers is difficult and prohibits their functions and applications. In this study, we reported chiral cyclic Pd(II)&#8208;catalysts that initiate a living ring&#8208;expansion polymerization of isocyanides, yielding a single&#8208;handed cyclic&#8208;helical poly(phenyl isocyanide), with predictable molecular weight (M  n) and low dispersity (M  w/M  n), in good yield. Using this method, cyclic bottlebrush polymers were prepared via the grafting&#8208;onto strategy. The cyclic topology was confirmed using various spectroscopic data and atomic force microscope observation. Moreover, the cyclic polymer brushes, comprising of a one&#8208;handed helical backbone, showed interesting photoluminescence and circularly&#8208;polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Separation by Creating Band Bending in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Improved Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been intensively studied as a class of semiconductor&#8208;like materials in photocatalysis. However, band bending, which plays a crucial role in semiconductor photocatalysis, has not yet been demonstrated in MOF photocatalysts. Herein, a representative MOF, MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, is integrated with metal oxides (MoO3  and V2O5) that feature appropriate work function and energy level to afford the corresponding MOF composites. Surface photovoltage results demonstrate band bending in the MOF composites, which gives rise to the built&#8208;in electric field of MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, boosting the charge separation. As a result, the MOF composites present 56 and 42 times higher activity, respectively, compared to the pristine MOF for photocatalytic H2  production. Upon depositing Pt onto the MOF, ~6 times higher activity is achieved. This work illustrates band bending of MOFs for the first time, supporting their semiconductor&#8208;like nature, which would greatly promote MOF photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Organic Electroluminescent Material with Very High Color Purity and Efficiency Based on Polycyclization of Multiple Resonance Parent Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds have set off an upsurge of research because of their tremendous application prospect in the field of wide color gamut display. Herein, we propose a novel MR&#8208;TADF molecular construction paradigm based on polycyclization of multiple resonance parent core, and construct a representative multiple resonance polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (MR&#8208;PAH) based on para&#8208;alignment boron and nitrogen atoms into six&#8208;membered ring (p&#8208;BNR). Through the retrosynthesis analysis, a concise synthesis strategy with wide applicability has been proposed, encompassing programmed sequential boron esterification, Suzuki coupling and Scholl oxidative coupling. The target model molecule BN&#8208;TP shows green fluorescence with emission peak at 523 nm and narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 34 nm. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing BN&#8208;TP as an emitter exhibits ultrapure green emission with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.70), and achieves maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.1%.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Hollow Zinc Oxide Nanocomposites derived from Morphology&#8208;tunable Coordination Polymers for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the flexible producer of substrates, it is of increasing importance to create the infinite coordination&#8208;polymer particles (CPPs) for high&#8208;efficiency solar energy conversion. However, the inadequate advanced organic ligands and modification largely hinder their application. In this work, competitive evolution&#8212;morphological and structural change from Zn&#8208;based crystallites to amorphous particles is achieved. The controllable contribution of organic linkers selectively derived six Zn&#8208;CPPs with multivariate characters. Based on the diversity of these substructures, hollow zinc oxide particles were initially formed by self&#8208;pyrolysis of CPPs and effectively modified by ultrathin doped&#8208;nanosheets. Especially, the obtained double&#8208;sided heterojunctions show advantages of fully&#8208;covered active sites, bringing together the efficient light&#8208;excited charge transfer nanochannels, which exhibit an excellent solar H2  releasing activity (e.g., 4512.5 &#956;mol h&#8208;1  g&#8208;1  ) and stable cyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Thioester&#8208;Assisted Sortase&#8208;A &#8208; Mediated Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sortase A (SrtA)&#8208;mediated ligation, a popular method for protein labeling and semi&#8208;synthesis, is limited by its reversibility and dependence on the LPxTG motif, where &#8220;x&#8221; is any amino acid. Here, we report that SrtA can mediate the efficient and irreversible ligation of a protein/peptide containing a C&#8208;terminal thioester with another protein/peptide bearing an N&#8208;terminal Gly, with broad tolerance for a wide variety of LPxT&#8208;derived sequences. This strategy, the thioester&#8208;assisted SrtA&#8208;mediated ligation, enabled the expedient preparation of proteins bearing various N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminal labels, including post&#8208;translationally modified proteins such as the Ser139&#8208;phosphorylated histone H2AX and Lys9&#8208;methylated histone H3, with less dependence on the LPxTG motif. Our study validates the chemical modification of substrates as an effective means of augmenting the synthetic capability of existing enzymatic methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Janus Nickel Sites on Red Phosphorus for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom nickel catalysts hold great promise for photocatalytic water splitting due to their plentiful active sites and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we adopt a reactive&#8208;group guided strategy to prepare atomically dispersed nickel catalysts on red phosphorus. The hydrothermal treatment of red phosphorus leads to the formation of P&#8208;H and P&#8208;OH groups, which behave as the reactive functionalities to generate the dual structure of single&#8208;atom P&#8208;Ni and P&#8208;O&#8208;Ni catalytic sites. The produced single&#8208;atom sites provide two different functions: P&#8208;Ni for water reduction and P&#8208;O&#8208;Ni for water oxidation. Benefitting from this specific Janus structure, Ni&#8208;red phosphorus shows an elevated hydrogen evolution rate compared to Ni nanoparticle&#8208;modified red phosphorus under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The hydrogen evolution rate was additionally enhanced with increased reaction temperature, reaching 91.51 &#956;mol h  &#8208;1  at 70 &#176;C, corresponding to an apparent quantum efficiency of 8.9 % at 420 nm excitation wavelength.</dc:description>

         <title>Odorant Metabolism in Humans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Odorants are relatively small molecules which are easily taken up and distributed in the human body. Despite their relevance in everyday life, however, only a limited amount of evidence about their metabolism, pathways, and bioactivities in the human body exists. With this review, we aim to encourage future interdisciplinary research on the function and mechanisms of the biotransformation of odorants, involving different disciplines such as nutrition, medicine, biochemistry, chemistry, and sensory sciences. Starting with a general overview of the different ways of odorant uptake and enzymes involved in the metabolism of odorants, a more precise description of biotransformation processes and their function in the oral cavity, the nose, the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is given together with an overview of the different routes of odorant excretion. Finally, perspectives for future research are discussed.</dc:description>

Hydrophobicity is important, but subtle changes in electrostatic surface potential, dipoles and polarizability also enhance association with phospholipid membranes and cell uptake. A combination of fluorine and sulfur substituents on an aromatic ring induces microdipoles that enhance&#160;cell uptake of 12&#8208;residue peptide inhibitors of p53&#8208;HDM2 interaction and of cell&#8208;penetrating cyclic peptides.

         <title>Cobalt Single Atoms Anchored on Oxygen&#8208;Doped Tubular Carbon Nitride for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation: Simultaneous Coordination Structure and Morphology Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous regulation of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts and engineering architectures with efficient exposed active sites   are efficient strategies for boosting peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation.   We isolated  cobalt atoms with dual nitrogen and oxygen coordination (Co&#8208;N  3  O  1  ) on oxygen&#8208;doped tubular carbon nitride (TCN) by pyrolyzing a hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyanuric acid melamine&#8211;cobalt acetate precursor. The theoretically constructed Co&#8208;N  3  O  1  moiety on TCN exhibited an impressive mass activity of 7.61&#215;105 min  &#8722;1  mol  &#8722;1  with high  1  O  2  selectivity. Theoretical calculations revealed that the cobalt single atoms occupied a dual nitrogen and oxygen coordination environment, and that PMS adsorption was promoted and energy barriers reduced for the key *O intermediate that produced  1  O  2  . The catalysts were attached to a widely used poly(vinylidene fluoride) microfiltration membrane to deliver an antibiotic wastewater treatment system with 97.5% ciprofloxacin rejection over 10 hours, thereby revealing the suitability of the membrane for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Small&#8208;Molecule Metal&#8208;Carrying Prochelator: A Novel Prodrug Design Strategy for Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective activation of prodrugs is an important approach to reduce the side effects of disease treatment. We report a prodrug design concept for metal complexes, termed &#8220;metal&#8208;carrying prochelator&#8221;, which can co&#8208;carry a metal ion and chelator within a single small&#8208;molecule compound   and remain inert until it undergoes a specifically triggered intramolecular chelation to synthesize a bioactive metal complex  in situ  for targeted therapy  . As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we designed a H  2  O  2  &#8208;responsive small&#8208;molecule prochelator, DPBD, based on the strong chelator diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) and copper. DPBD can carry Cu  2+  (DPBD&#8208;Cu) and respond to elevated H  2  O  2  levels in tumor cells by releasing DTC, which rapidly chelates Cu  2+  from DPBD&#8208;Cu affording a DTC&#8208;copper complex with high cytotoxicity, realizing potent antitumor efficacy with low systemic toxicity. Thus, with its unique intramolecularly triggered activation mechanism, this concept based on a small&#8208;molecule metal&#8208;carrying prochelator  can help in the prodrug design of metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>SrZnGeS4: A Dual&#8208;Waveband Nonlinear&#160;Material With A Transparency Spanning UV&#8211;Vis and Far&#8208;IR Spectral Regions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;linear optical chalcogenides with a wide band gap (Eg) and excellent NLO properties are key materials for highly desirable multiwaveband tunable optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). We exploit the &#8220;electronic structure engineer bucket effect&#8221; to develop a novel dual&#8208;waveband SrZnGeS4 with an ultrawide transparency window. It exhibits an asymmetric Fdd2 structure that consists of layers formed by corner&#8208;sharing [ZnGeS6] dimers. SrZnGeS4 is transparent from 0.30 to 23.6 &#956;m, spanning the UV&#8208;, vis&#8208;, mid&#8208; and far&#8208;IR spectral regions and has the widest Eg (3.63 eV) in the AeMIIMIVQ4 family to date. It exhibits phase matching, high SHG intensities (e.g., 11.0 &#215; KDP and 17.5 &#215; AGS under &#955;inc = 1450 and 950 nm, respectively), and a very high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (35 &#215; AGS). These results not only suggest bright prospects for high&#8208;power laser applications but may also enable applications of the multiwaveband OPO system from the UV&#8211;visible to far&#8208;IR regions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Valence&#8208;Engineered Self&#8208;Cascading Antioxidant Nanozyme for the Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A valence&#8208;engineered strategy to develop self&#8208;cascading nanozymes with simultaneous multiple antioxidant activities has been proposed. Nanozyme LiMn2O4 (LM), as the final optimized material, exhibits the best SOD&#8208;like, CAT&#8208;like, GPx&#8208;like, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities. The outstanding antioxidant capacity of LM was demonstrated at the cellular level and in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in mice.







Abstract
Antioxidant treatment strategy by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a highly effective disease treatment option. Nanozymes with multiple antioxidant activities can cope with the diverse ROS environment. However, lack of design strategies and limitation of negative correlation for nanozymes with multiple antioxidant activities hindered their development. To overcome these difficulties, here we used ZnMn2O4 as a model to explore the role of Mn valency at the octahedral site via a valence&#8208;engineered strategy, and found that its multiple antioxidant activities are positively correlated with the content of Mn4+. Therefore, through this strategy, a self&#8208;cascading antioxidant nanozyme LiMn2O4 was constructed, and its efficacy was verified at the cellular level and in an inflammatory bowel disease model. This work not only provides guidance for the design of multiple antioxidant nanozymes, but also broadens the biomedical application potential of multiple antioxidant nanozymes.

Strong molecular bonding formed by Ge 4s and O 2p orbitals contributes to a robust and endurable metal&#8211;oxygen framework of the spinel oxide structure, which is not achievable via common 3d&#8211;2p orbital hybridization alone, making the oxide cathodes exhibit extraordinarily stable electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Oxides composed of an oxygen framework and interstitial cations are promising cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the instability of the oxygen framework under harsh operating conditions results in fast battery capacity decay, due to the weak orbital interactions between cations and oxygen (mainly 3d&#8211;2p interaction). Here, a robust and endurable oxygen framework is created by introducing strong 4s&#8211;2p orbital hybridization into the structure using LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 oxide as an example. The modified oxide delivers extraordinarily stable battery performance, achieving 71.4&#8201;% capacity retention after 2000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work shows that an orbital&#8208;level understanding can be leveraged to engineer high structural stability of the anion oxygen framework of oxides. Moreover, the similarity of the oxygen lattice between oxide electrodes makes this approach extendable to other electrodes, with orbital&#8208;focused engineering a new avenue for the fundamental modification of battery materials.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic as a Highly Active and Selective Catalyst for Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;metallization of intermetallic NiGa formed high&#8208;entropy intermetallcis represented as (NiFeCu)(GaGe), which worked as a highly active and selective catalyst for acetylene semihydrogenation. Overhydrogenation of ethylene was completely inhibited even at complete conversion of acetylene. Moreover, the specific activity was at least five times higher than those in reported systems using selective Ni&#8208; and Cu&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Acetylene semihydrogenation is a key technology for producing polymer&#8208;grade ethylene from crude ethylene. Ni&#8208;based catalysts are promising alternatives to noble&#8208;metals for this process. However, achieving high catalytic activity and selectivity remains a big challenge. We report a novel catalyst design based on high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEI), which provide thermally stable isolated Ni without excess counterpart metals and achieve exceptionally high performance. Intermetallic NiGa was multi&#8208;metalized to a (NiFeCu)(GaGe), where the Ni and Ga sites were partially substituted with Fe/Cu and Ge, respectively, without altering the parent CsCl&#8208;type structure. The NiFeCuGaGe/SiO2 HEI catalyst completely inhibited ethylene overhydrogenation even at complete acetylene conversion, and exhibited five&#8208;times higher activity than other 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. The DFT study showed that the surface energy decreased by multi&#8208;metallization, which drastically weakened ethylene adsorption.

         <title>Stereodefined Skipped Dienes through Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Formal Addition of Tertiary Allylic C&#8722;H Bonds to Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal addition of allylic C&#8722;H bond to alkyne is reported. A tertiary C&#8722;H bond was cleaved at the site of which a quaternary carbon center was formed. This atom&#8208;economical process provided a straightforward synthetic route to skipped dienes containing a C3&#8208;quaternary carbon. Enantioselective construction of acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters through enantio&#8208;convergent vinylation of tertiary C&#8722;H bond was also feasible.







Abstract
Preparation of skipped dienes with a quaternary carbon center at the C&#8208;3 position remains a synthetic challenge. We report here an iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal addition of tertiary sp3 C&#8722;H bond to alkyne for the facile preparation of skipped dienes. The tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bond is cleaved regioselectively, at the site of which a new C&#8722;C bond is formed. Enantioselective construction of acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters is also demonstrated.

         <title>Mapping Active Site Geometry to Activity in Immobilized Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A many&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic performance of frustrated Lewis pairs is attainable through judicious control of the spatial arrangement of the acid and base components. This is demonstrated for CO2 hydrogenation by mapping the active site geometry to catalyst activity and identifying the optimal distance and orientation of the donor&#8211;acceptor centers using nonlinear scaling relationships.







Abstract
The immobilization of molecular catalysts imposes spatial constraints on their active site. We reveal that in bifunctional catalysis such constraints can also be utilized as an appealing handle to boost intrinsic activity through judicious control of the active site geometry. To demonstrate this, we develop a pragmatic approach, based on nonlinear scaling relationships, to map the spatial arrangements of the acid&#8211;base components of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to their performance in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. The resulting activity map shows that fixing the donor&#8211;acceptor centers at specific distances and locking them into appropriate orientations leads to an unforeseen many&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic activity of FLPs compared to their unconstrained counterparts.

         <title>Persistent Ambipolar Heptacenes and Their Redox Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble heptacenes are stabilized via TIPS&#8208;ethynylation and halogenation. TIPS&#8208;ethynylation on every second ring is critical for longevity. The most stable derivative is characterized in thin&#8208;film transistors and post&#8208;functionalized via Stille coupling to a nonarene.







Abstract
Sixfold TIPS&#8208;ethynylation combined with fourfold bromination of the armchair edges furnishes a long&#8208;lived, soluble heptacene; &#960;&#8208;extension via Stille coupling accesses a persistent tetrabenzononacene. Both types of acenes were stabilized best by double TIPS&#8208;ethynylation on every other benzene ring. Tetrabromoheptacene is an ambipolar transistor material (up to 0.036&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 n&#8208;channel), which was corroborated by generation of its monoanion and monocation.

         <title>Photocatalytic Chemical Crosslinking for Profiling RNA&#8211;Protein Interactions in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic interactions between RNA and proteins play crucial roles in regulating diverse cellular processes. Proteome&#8208;wide characterization of these interactions in their native cellular context remains desirable but challenging. A photocatalytic crosslinking (PhotoCAX) strategy for studying the composition and dynamics of protein&#8211;RNA interactions via mass spectrometry (PhotoCAX&#8208;MS) as well as RNA sequencing (PhotoCAX&#8208;seq) is reported.







Abstract
The dynamic interactions between RNAs and proteins play crucial roles in regulating diverse cellular processes. Proteome&#8208;wide characterization of these interactions in their native cellular context remains desirable but challenging. Herein, we developed a photocatalytic crosslinking (PhotoCAX) strategy coupled with mass spectrometry (PhotoCAX&#8208;MS) and RNA sequencing (PhotoCAX&#8208;seq) for the study of the composition and dynamics of protein&#8208;RNA interactions. By integrating the blue light&#8208;triggered photocatalyst with a dual&#8208;functional RNA&#8211;protein crosslinker (RP&#8208;linker) and the phase separation&#8208;based enrichment strategy, PhotoCAX&#8208;MS revealed a total of 2044 RBPs in human HEK293 cells.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic interactions between RNAs and proteins play crucial roles in regulating diverse cellular processes. Proteome-wide characterization of these interactions in their native cellular context remains desirable but challenging. Herein, we developed a photocatalytic crosslinking (PhotoCAX) strategy coupled with mass spectrometry (PhotoCAX-MS) and RNA sequencing (PhotoCAX-seq) for the study of the composition and dynamics of protein-RNA interactions. By integrating the blue light-triggered photocatalyst with a dual-functional RNA&#8211;protein crosslinker (RP-linker) and the phase separation-based enrichment strategy, PhotoCAX-MS revealed a total of 2044 RBPs in human HEK293 cells. We further employed PhotoCAX to investigate the dynamic change of RBPome in macrophage cells upon LPS-stimulation, as well as the identification of RBPs interacting directly with the 5&#8242; untranslated regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Correlative Electrochemical Microscopy for the Elucidation of the Local Ionic and Electronic Properties of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining feedback (FB) and multi&#8208;frequency alternating&#8208;current (AC) SECM methodologies is proposed as a unique approach that provides the two essential properties namely the ionic and electronic conductivity of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in Li&#8208;ion batteries quantitatively. The influence of the electrolyte composition and the SEI formation protocol on the properties of the resulting SEI was derived.







Abstract
The solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a key role in the stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the SEI prevents the continuous degradation of the electrolyte at the anode. The SEI acts as an insulating layer for electron transfer, still allowing the ionic flux through the layer. We combine the feedback and multi&#8208;frequency alternating&#8208;current modes of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for the first time to assess quantitatively the local electronic and ionic properties of the SEI varying the SEI formation conditions and the used electrolytes in the field of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Correlations between the electronic and ionic properties of the resulting SEI on a model Cu electrode demonstrates the unique feasibility of the proposed strategy to provide the two essential properties of an SEI: ionic and electronic conductivity in dependence on the formation conditions, which is anticipated to exhibit a significant impact on the field of LIBs.

         <title>Synergy in Au&#8722;CuO Janus Structure for Catalytic Isopropanol Oxidative Dehydrogenation to Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique Au&#8722;CuO Janus structure with a 0.5&#8197;nm ultrathin CuO layer was developed. The Au&#8722;CuO interfacial structure was confirmed to be extremely efficient for C&#8722;H activation; a dramatic decrease of the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond scission energy barrier from 1.44 to 0.01&#8197;eV due to the strong affinity between the O of CuO and H of isopropanol, compared with Au sites alone.







Abstract
The controlled oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding ketones or aldehydes via selective cleavage of the &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of alcohols under mild conditions still remains a significant challenge. Although the metal/oxide interface is highly active and selective, the interfacial sites fall far behind the demand, due to the large and thick support. Herein, we successfully develop a unique Au&#8722;CuO Janus structure (average particle size=3.8&#8197;nm) with an ultrathin CuO layer (0.5&#8197;nm thickness) via a bimetal in situ activation and separation strategy. The resulting Au&#8722;CuO interfacial sites prominently enhance isopropanol adsorption and decrease the energy barrier of &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond scission from 1.44 to 0.01&#8197;eV due to the strong affinity between the O atom of CuO and the H atom of isopropanol, compared with Au sites alone, thereby achieving ultrahigh acetone selectivity (99.3&#8201;%) over 1.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% AuCu0.75/Al2O3 at 100&#8201;&#176;C and atmospheric pressure with 97.5&#8201;% isopropanol conversion. Furthermore, Au&#8722;CuO Janus structures supported on SiO2, TiO2 or CeO2 exhibit remarkable catalytic performance, and great promotion in activity and acetone selectivity is achieved as well for other reducible oxides derived from Fe, Co, Ni and Mn. This study should help to develop strategies for maximized interfacial site construction and structure optimization for efficient &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation.

         <title>Electronically Engineering Water Resistance in Methane Combustion with an Atomically Dispersed Tungsten on PdO Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane combustion generates less CO2 emissions than coal and oil, making it a cleaner alternative to other fossil fuels. A PdW1/Al2O3 single&#8208;atom catalyst shows enhanced H2O&#8208;resistance during CH4 combustion. The results show that catalytic CH4 combustion involves water and proceeds via a hydroperoxyl&#8208;promoted reaction on the catalyst surface. An upshift of the d&#8208;band center of Pd aids the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst.







Abstract
Improving the low&#8208;temperature water&#8208;resistance of methane combustion catalysts is of importance for industrial applications and it is challenging. A stepwise strategy is presented for the preparation of atomically dispersed tungsten species at the catalytically active site (Pd nanoparticles). After an activation process, a Pd&#8722;O&#8722;W1&#8208;like nanocompound is formed on the PdO surface with an atomic scale interface. The resulting supported catalyst has much better water resistance than the conventional catalysts for methane combustion. The integrated characterization results confirm that catalytic combustion of methane involves water, proceeding via a hydroperoxyl&#8208;promoted reaction mechanism on the catalyst surface. The results of density functional theory calculations indicate an upshift of the d&#8208;band center of palladium caused by electron transfer from atomically dispersed tungsten, which greatly facilitates the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Catalyzed Copper&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Sulfonylation of Benzaldehydes via a Transient Imine Directing Group**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient C&#8722;H sulfonylation of benzaldehydes is achieved using copper and catalytic &#946;&#8208;alanine to form a directing group in situ. Aldehydes and sulfinate salts are coupled in a single step in high yields. Kinetic and mechanistic investigations are presented, with insights to the C&#8722;H activation step.







Abstract
Transient directing groups (TDGs) can provide a powerful means for C&#8722;H functionalization without requiring additional steps for directing group introduction and removal. We report the first use of a TDG in combination with copper to effect C&#8722;H functionalization. The regioselective copper mediated &#946;&#8722;C(sp2)&#8722;H sulfonylation of aldehydes with sulfinate salts is accomplished using catalytic &#946;&#8208;alanine to form a transient imine. A broad range of sulfonylated benzaldehydes are prepared using copper fluoride as both copper source and oxidant, involving a [5,6] cupracyclic intermediate. &#947;&#8208;(peri)&#8208;Sulfonylation of napthyl and phenanthrenyl carboxaldehydes is achieved through [6,6] cupracyclic intermediates. Further derivatisation of the aldehyde products is demonstrated. Kinetic experiments and Hammett analysis suggest the turnover limiting step to be a concerted asynchronous C&#8722;H cleavage via a dearomative Wheland&#8208;type transition state.

         <title>Enhancing Metalating Efficiency of the Sodium Amide NaTMP in Arene Borylation Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;nucleophilic amide NaTMP, in combination with PMDETA and B(OiPr)3 have allowed the deprotonative borylation of unactivated arenes under mild conditions. The study of its reaction pathway and the characterisation of the intermediates by X&#8208;Ray crystallography and 1H DOSY enabled the development of this protocol, which forms boronates in a direct and easy way, enabling Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings to obtain biaryls in an efficient manner.







Abstract
Though LiTMP (TMP=2,2&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) is a commonly used amide, surprisingly the heavier NaTMP has hardly been utilised. Here, by mixing NaTMP with tridentate donor PMDETA (N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine), we provide structural, and mechanistic insights into the sodiation of non&#8208;activated arenes (e.g. anisole and benzene). While these reactions are low yielding, adding B(OiPr)3 has a profound effect, not only by intercepting the CAr&#8208;Na bond, but also by driving the metalation reaction towards quantitative formation of more stabilized sodium aryl boronates. Demonstrating its metalating power, regioselective C2&#8208;metalation/borylation of naphthalene has been accomplished contrasting with single&#8208;metal based protocols which are unselective and low yielding. Extension to other arenes allows for in situ generation of aryl boronates which can then directly engage in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings, furnishing a range of biaryls in a selective and efficient manner.

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Decorated Conjugated Organic Polymers Activate Oxygen for Photocatalytic Methane Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a process of methane conversion photocatalyzed by the sulfone&#8208;decorated conjugated organic polymer, S&#8208;CTTP, light irradiation first induced the homolytic dissociation of S=O bonds in sulfone groups on the catalyst surface to generate free radicals. The radicals drive efficient conversion of 1O2 to H2O2 and then &#8901;OH, for oxidation of adsorbed CH4 into CH3OH and HCOOH selectively.







Abstract
Oxidizing CH4 into liquid products with O2 under mild conditions still mainly relies on metal catalysis. We prepared a series of sulfone&#8208;modified conjugated organic polymers and found that the catalyst with proper SVI content (0.10) could drive O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8901;OH to oxidize CH4 into CH3OH and HCOOH directly and efficiently at room temperature under light irradiation. Experimental results showed that after 4&#8197;h reaction, decomposition rate and residual amounts of H2O2 were 81.21&#8201;% and 4.83&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 respectively, and CH4 conversion rate was 22.81&#8201;%. Mechanism studies revealed that illumination could induce the homolytic dissociation of S=O bonds on catalyst to produce oxygen and sulfur radicals, where the &#8901;O could adsorb and activate CH4, and the &#8901;S could supply electrons for 1O2 to generate H2O2 and then for decomposing the H2O2 into &#8901;OH timely to oxidize CH4. This research provided a novel organic catalysis approach for oxygen activation and utilization.

         <title>Interfacial Polymetallic Oxides and Hierarchical Porous Core&#8211;Shell Fibres for High Energy&#8208;Density Electrochemical Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hetero&#8208;structured polymetallic oxides/porous graphene core&#8211;sheath fibres are demonstrated as high&#8208;performance electrochemical supercapacitor electrodes via a microchannel self&#8208;assembly method. Because of rich micro&#8208;/mesoporous ionic pathways, a large accessible surface, high Faradaic activity and excellent interface electron conduction, the supercapacitors display remarkable areal capacitance, energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life cycles and actual applications.







Abstract
Realizing high energy&#8208;density and actual applications of fibre&#8208;based electrochemical supercapacitors (FESCs) are pivotal but challenging, as the ability to construct advanced fibres for accelerating charges kinetic diffusion and Faradaic storage remain key bottlenecks. Here, we demonstrate high&#8208;performance FESCs based on hetero&#8208;structured polymetallic oxides/porous graphene core&#8211;sheath fibres, where the large pseudo&#8208;active polymetallic oxide (PMO) sheath is uniformly loaded on a hierarchical porous graphene fibre (PGF) core. Due to the abundant micro&#8208;/mesoporous pathways, large accessible surface, excellent redox activity and good interface electron conduction, the PMO&#8208;PGF possesses high areal capacitance (2959.78&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and manageable Faradaic reversibility in a 6&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the PMO&#8208;PGF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state FESCs present high energy&#8208;density (187.22&#8197;&#956;&#8201;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), long&#8208;life cycles (95.8&#8201;% capacitive retention after 20&#8201;000&#8197;cycles), diverse&#8208;powered capabilities and actual energy&#8208;supply applications.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks and Their Derivatives via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and green mechanochemistry was performed to realize the reticular synthesis of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with predictable structures. Moreover, a series of Pd@HOF composites were generated by the one&#8208;pot mechanosynthesis, which showed different catalytic activities for CO oxidation. The synergetic effect between Pd and HOF was revealed by in situ DRIFTS, proving the application potential of functionalized HOF&#8208;composites.







Abstract
Rational synthesis of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with predicted structure has been a long&#8208;term challenge. Herein, by using the efficient, simple, low&#8208;cost, and scalable mechanosynthesis, we demonstrate that reticular chemistry is applicable to HOF assemblies based on building blocks with different geometry, connectivity, and functionality. The obtained crystalline HOFs show uniform nano&#8208;sized morphology, which is challenging or unachievable for conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Furthermore, the one&#8208;pot mechanosynthesis generated a series of Pd@HOF composites with noticeably different CO oxidation activities. In situ DRIFTS studies indicate that the most efficient composite, counterintuitively, shows the weakest CO affinity to Pd sites while the strongest CO affinity to HOF matrix, revealing the vital role of porous matrix to the catalytic performance. This work paves a new avenue for rational synthesis of HOF and HOF&#8208;based composites for broad application potential.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Regulation of FeN4 Spin State by Neighboring Cu Atoms for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis in Flexible Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First&#8208;principles calculations show a nearly linear correlation of the energy barriers of critical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) steps with the Fe magnetic moment of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C composites. This is indeed observed when single Cu sites are incorporated into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C aerogels, where the interactions between adjacent Fe&#8722;Cu 3d electrons result in a reduced magnetic moment of the Fe center and hence enhanced ORR activity.







Abstract
Iron, nitrogen&#8208;codoped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) nanocomposites have emerged as viable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the formation of FeNxCy coordination moieties.

&lt;p&gt;First-principles calculations show a nearly linear correlation of the energy barriers of critical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) steps with the Fe magnetic moment of Fe-N-C composites. This is indeed observed when single Cu sites are incorporated into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C aerogels, where the interactions between adjacent Fe&#8722;Cu 3d electrons result in a reduced magnetic moment of the Fe center and hence enhanced ORR activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron, nitrogen-codoped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) nanocomposites have emerged as viable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the formation of FeN&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Dewar Metallabenzenes from Reactions of Metallacyclobutadienes with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Dewar benzene derivative was obtained over 60&#8197;years ago. The first hetero Dewar benzene with a p&#8208;block element (a 2&#8208;Dewar pyridine) was reported 45&#8197;years ago. The first examples of structurally characterized Dewar metallabenzenes via unprecedented reactions of metallacyclobutadienes with aminoalkynes have now been successfully prepared.







Abstract
Dewar benzenes, the metastable valence isomers of benzenes, have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. In contrast, little is known about Dewar metallabenzenes having a transition metal in the skeletal framework, despite the recent intensive interest in the development of chemistry of metallabenzenes. Herein, we report the isolation and characterization of the first examples of structurally characterized Dewar metallabenzenes. These compounds were generated via unprecedented reactions of metallacyclobutadienes with aminoalkynes.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Ligand&#8208;Controlled Remote para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation and Borylation of Twisted Aromatic Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of aromatic amides is reported. The para borylation proceeds via an unprecedented substrate&#8211;ligand distortion between the twisted aromatic amides and a newly designed ligand framework (defa), which is different from the standard borylation ligand. A new type of catalytic system was developed by using this defa ligand that demonstrated excellent levels of para selectivity for a range of aromatic amides.







Abstract
A method of para&#8208;selective borylation of aromatic amides is described. The borylation proceeded via an unprecedented substrate&#8211;ligand distortion between the twisted aromatic amides and a newly designed ligand framework (defa) that is different from the traditionally used ligand (dtbpy) for the C&#8722;H borylation reactions. The designed ligand framework (defa) has led to the development of a new type of catalytic system that shows excellent para selectivity for a range of aromatic amides. Moreover, the designed ligand has shown excellent reactivity and selectivity for a range of heterocyclic aromatic amides. The identification of key transition states and intermediates using the DFT computations associated with the three regio&#8208;isomeric pathways revealed that the most efficient catalytic pathway with the defa ligand leads to the para borylation while in the case of bpy the borylation at the para and meta sites compete.

         <title>A Hybrid Supramolecular Polymeric Nanomedicine for Cascade&#8208;Amplified Synergetic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid supramolecular polymeric nanomedicine for cascade&#8208;amplified synergetic chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy is constructed based on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin/camptothecin host&#8722;guest molecular recognition and iron&#8208;carboxylate coordination. In synergy with a checkpoint blockade, this supramolecular nanomedicine leads to an enhanced therapeutic performance and long&#8208;term tumor remission.







Abstract
Supramolecular nanomedicines have shown great merits in cancer therapy, but their clinical translation is hampered by monotonous therapeutic modality and unsatisfactory antitumor performance. Herein, a hybrid supramolecular polymeric nanomedicine (SNPs) is developed based on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin/camptothecin (CPT) host&#8722;guest molecular recognition and iron&#8208;carboxylate coordination. Iron ions stabilizing SNPs catalyze the conversion of intracellular hydrogen peroxide into highly toxic hydroxyl radical through a Fenton reaction, which further cleaves the thioketal linker of the supramolecular monomer to release potent CPT, thus amplifying the therapeutic efficacy by combining chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. The combination therapy stimulates antitumor immunity and promotes intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by triggering immunogenic cell death. In synergy with PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade, SNPs enables enhanced immune therapy and a long&#8208;term tumor remission.

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite Based Heterojunction Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in constructing photocatalysts based on metal halide perovskite (MHP) heterojunctions, including Schottky, type&#8197;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, which show improved carrier separation and accelerated surface reaction rates for efficient solar energy conversion are discussed systematically in this Review. Techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are also evaluated and challenges and future directions highlighted.







Abstract
With fascinating photophysical properties and a strong potential to utilize solar energy, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have become a prominent feature within photocatalysis research. However, the effectiveness of single MHP photocatalysts is relatively poor. The introduction of a second component to form a heterojunction represents a well&#8208;established route to accelerate carrier migration and boost reaction rates, thus increasing the photoactivity. Recently, there have been several scientific advances related to the design of MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts, including Schottky, type&#8197;II, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. In this Review, we systematically discuss and critically appraise recent developments in MHP&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysis. In addition, the techniques for identifying the type of active heterojunctions are evaluated and we conclude by briefly outlining the ongoing challenges and future directions for promising photocatalysts based on MHP heterojunctions.

Successful synthesis of 1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;hexaazatriphenylene (HAT)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks of M3(HAT)2, (M=Fe, Ni, Co) by means of an on&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly protocol which effectively overcomes the strong inter&#8208;molecular steric hindrance.







Abstract
1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;Hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) is one of the smallest polyheterocyclic aromatic building blocks for forming conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs). However, the strong inter&#8208;molecular steric hindrance impedes the growth of HAT&#8208;based cMOFs. Here we employ on&#8208;surface synthesis to grow single&#8208;layer two&#8208;dimensional cMOFs of M3(HAT)2 (M=Ni, Fe, Co). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) analysis, we resolve that the frameworks comprise a hexagonal lattice of HAT molecules and a Kagome lattice of metal atoms. The DFT analysis indicates that Ni, Co and Fe carry a magnetic moment of 1.1, 2.5, and 3.7&#8197;&#956;B, respectively. We anticipate that the small &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of HAT and strong bidentate chelating coordination give rise to appealing electronic and magnetic properties.

However, the strong inter-molecular steric hindrance impedes the growth of HAT-based cMOFs.

The DFT analysis indicates that Ni, Co and Fe carry a magnetic moment of 1.1, 2.5, and 3.7&#8197;&#956;B, respectively.

         <title>Transfer of Axial Chirality to the Nanoscale Endows Carbon Nanodots with Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon Nanotechnology Lab @lab_carbonAtropoisomeric precursors have been employed to prepare chiral carbon dots using a straightforward bottom&#8208;up approach. Chirality is retained in the nanoparticle, endowing carbon nanodots with intrinsic circularly polarized luminescence. The obtained material combines chiroptical activity with excellent processability in organic solvents and thermal stability.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, purification and characterization of chiral carbon nanodots starting from atropoisomeric precursors. The obtained atropoisomeric carbon nanodots are soluble in organic solvents and have good thermal stability, which are desirable features for technological applications. The synthetic protocol is robust, as it supports a number of variations in terms of molecular doping agents. Remarkably, the combination of axially chiral precursors and 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone as doping agent results in green&#8208;emissive carbon dots displaying circularly polarized luminescence. Dissymmetry factors of |3.5|&#215;10&#8722;4 are obtained in solution, without the need of any additional element of chirality. Introducing axial chirality expands the strategies available to tailor the properties of carbon nanodots, paving the way for carbon nanoparticles that combine good processability in organic solvents with engineered advanced chiroptical properties.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hypercoordinated Silicon Anions: Catching Intermediates of Lewis Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane serves as a binding platform for weak anionic donors, providing the first characterized anionic bromido, iodido, formato, acetato, triflato, and sulfato silicates. This set allows to evaluate the structural and electronic perturbation of silicon species and substantiates their role in Lewis base catalysis.







Abstract
Anionic hypercoordinated silicates with weak donors were proposed as key intermediates in numerous silicon&#8208;based reactions. However, their short&#8208;lived nature rendered even spectroscopic observations highly challenging. Here, we characterize hypercoordinated silicon anions, including the first bromido&#8208;, iodido&#8208;, formato&#8208;, acetato&#8208;, triflato&#8208; and sulfato&#8208;silicates. This is enabled by a new, donor&#8208;free polymeric form of Lewis superacidic bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane 1. Spectroscopic, structural, and computational insights allow a reassessment of Gutmann's empirical rules for the role of silicon hypercoordination in synthesis and catalysis. The electronic perturbations of 1 exerted on the bound anions indicate pronounced substrate activation.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Metastable Species in Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented mechanism for the supramolecular polymerization (SP) of H&#8208;bonding synthons has been unravelled. Remarkably, a new on&#8208;pathway metastable dimer state (D*) incorporating both intra&#8208; and intermolecular H&#8208;bonds was discovered that allows spatiotemporal and length control of the SP through a consecutive mechanism.







Abstract
We reveal unique hydrogen (H&#8208;) bonding patterns and exploit them to control the kinetics, pathways and length of supramolecular polymers (SPs). New bisamide&#8208;containing monomers were designed to elucidate the role of competing intra&#8208; vs. intermolecular H&#8208;bonding interactions on the kinetics of supramolecular polymerization (SP). Remarkably, two polymerization&#8208;inactive metastable states were discovered. Contrary to previous examples, the commonly assumed intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded monomer does not evolve into intermolecularly H&#8208;bonded SPs via ring opening, but rather forms a metastable dimer. In this dimer, all H&#8208;bonding sites are saturated, either intra&#8208; or intermolecularly, hampering elongation. The dimers exhibit an advantageous preorganization, which upon opening of the intramolecular portion of the H&#8208;bonding motif facilitates SP in a consecutive process. The retardation of spontaneous self&#8208;assembly as a result of two metastable states enables length control in SP by seed&#8208;mediated growth.

         <title>Tetraanionic arachno&#8208;Carboranyl Ligand Imparts Strong Axiality to Terbium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of fully sandwiched lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets derived from the tetraanionic arachno&#8208;carboranyl ligand possess a pseudo hexagonal&#8208;prismatic local coordination geometry which significantly enhances the magnetic axiality of the terbium(III) analogue.







Abstract
A family of fully sandwiched arachno&#8208;lanthanacarborane complexes formulated as {&#951;6&#8208;[&#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;[o&#8208;C6H4(CH2)2]&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10]2Ln}{Li5(THF)10} (Ln=Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Y) is successfully synthesized, where the &#8220;carbons&#8208;adjacent&#8221; carboranyl ligand (arachno&#8208;R2&#8208;C2B10H104&#8722;) bears four negative charges and coordinates to the central lanthanide ions using the hexagonal &#951;6C2B4 face. Thus, the central lanthanide cations are pseudo&#8208;twelve&#8208;coordinate and have an approximate pseudo&#8208;D6h symmetry or hexagonal&#8208;prismatic geometry. As the crystal field effect imparted by this geometry is still unknown, we thoroughly investigated the magnetic properties of this series of complexes and found that the crystal field imposed by this ligand causes a relation of Tb&gt;Dy&gt;Ho&gt;Er for the energy gaps between the ground and the first excited states, which is of striking resemblance to the ferrocenophane and phthalocyanine ligands although the latter two ligands give disparate local coordination geometries. Moreover, the effective energy barrier to magnetization reversal of 445(10)&#8197;K, the observable hysteresis loop up to 4&#8197;K and the relaxation time of the yttrium&#8208;diluted sample reaching 193(17) seconds at 2&#8197;K under an optimized field for the Tb analogue of this family of arachno&#8208;lanthanacarborane complexes, render a new benchmark for Tb3+&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets.

         <title>Pushing Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries towards Practical Working Conditions through a Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergy of cathode engineering and electrolyte manipulation effectively enhance redox kinetics and cycling stability of Li&#8722;S batteries. This strategy is demonstrated to be effective in achieving high performance under wide temperature situations and enabling a stable Li&#8722;S pouch cell under a thin Li&#8208;metal anode, thick S cathode, and lean electrolyte conditions.







Abstract
The commercialization of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is still hindered by the unsatisfactory cell performance under practical working conditions, which is mainly caused by the sluggish cathode redox kinetics, severe polysulfide shuttling, and poor Li stripping/plating reversibility. Herein, we report an effective strategy by combining Se&#8208;doped S hosted in an ordered macroporous framework with a highly fluorinated ether (HFE)&#8208;based electrolyte to simultaneously address the aforementioned issues in both cathode and anode. A reversible and stable high areal capacity of &gt;5.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with high Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.2&#8201;% can be achieved under high areal Se/S loading (5.8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), while the underlying mechanism was further revealed through synchrotron X&#8208;ray probes and Time&#8208;of&#8208;Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS). The practical application potential was further evaluated at low (0&#8201;&#176;C) and high (55&#8201;&#176;C) temperatures under high areal Se/S loading (&gt;5.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and thin Li metal (40&#8197;&#956;m).

         <title>Chemical Recycling of Poly(Cyclohexene Carbonate) Using a Di&#8208;MgII Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the chemical recycling of poly(cyclohexene carbonate) (PCHC) to cyclohexene oxide (CHO) with 98&#8201;% selectivity using a dinuclear MgII catalyst is reported. The chemical recycling and recovery of CHO under mild conditions further advances the utilization of CO2&#8208;polycarbonates as recyclable materials.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of polymers to true monomers is pivotal for a circular plastics economy. Here, the first catalyzed chemical recycling of the widely investigated carbon dioxide derived polymer, poly(cyclohexene carbonate), to cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide is reported. The reaction requires dinuclear catalysis, with the di&#8208;MgII catalyst showing both high monomer selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%) and activity (TOF=150&#8197;h&#8722;1, 0.33&#8197;mol&#8201;%, 120&#8201;&#176;C). The depolymerization occurs via a chain&#8208;end catalyzed depolymerization mechanism and DFT calculations indicate the high selectivity arises from Mg&#8208;alkoxide catalyzed epoxide extrusion being kinetically favorable compared to cyclic carbonate formation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iterative approach that allows doubling the lenght of the longest pyrene&#8208;pyrazinoquinoxaline molecular nanoribbons is reported. The largest nanoribbon obtained through this approach shows a 60 linearly&#8208;fused ring backbone (14.9&#8197;nm) and a 324&#8208;atoms core (C276N48).







Abstract
Molecular nanoribbons are a class of atomically&#8208;precise nanomaterials for a broad range of applications. An iterative approach that allows doubling the length of the longest pyrene&#8208;pyrazinoquinoxaline molecular nanoribbons is described. The largest nanoribbon obtained through this approach&#8212;with a 60 linearly&#8208;fused ring backbone (14.9&#8197;nm) and a 324&#8208;atoms core (C276N48)&#8212;shows an extremely high molar absorptivity (values up to 1&#8201;198&#8201;074&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) that also endows it with a high molar fluorescence brightness (8700&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1).

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Free Copying of 12 Bases of RNA with Dinucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When dinucleotides were allowed to act as building blocks for enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying of RNA, sequences up to 12 bases in length were faithfully transmitted into the copy.







Abstract
The synthesis of complementary strands is the reaction underlying the replication of genetic information. It is likely that the earliest self&#8208;replicating systems used RNA as genetic material. How RNA was copied in the absence of enzymes and what sequences were most likely to have supported replication is not clear. Here we show that mixtures of dinucleotides with C and G as bases copy an RNA sequence of up to 12 nucleotides in dilute aqueous solution. Successful enzyme&#8208;free copying occurred with in situ activation at 4&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;6.0. Dimers were incorporated in favor of monomers when both competed as reactants, and little misincorporation was detectable in mass spectra. Simulations using experimental rate constants confirmed that mixed C/G sequences are good candidates for successful replication with dimers. Because dimers are intermediates in the synthesis of longer strands, our results support evolutionary scenarios encompassing formation and copying of RNA strands in enzyme&#8208;free fashion.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Alkylation of (Hetero)Arenes with Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective alkylation of alkenes with indoles, thiophenes and electron rich arenes has been developed. This is the first CoH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization using carbon nucleophiles via hydrogen atom transfer.







Abstract
An efficient and general intermolecular Cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation of styrenes with (hetero)arenes including indoles, thiophene and electron rich arenes has been developed, providing straightforward access to enantioenriched alkyl(hetero)arenes with high enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction underwent a CoH&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkenes, followed by a pivotal catalyst&#8208;controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated organocobalt(IV) species and aromatic nucleophiles. This is the first CoH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization using carbon nucleophiles, providing a new strategy for asymmetric Friedel&#8211;Crafts type alkylation.

         <title>Anomalous Redox Features Induced by Strong Covalency in Layered NaTi1&#8722;yVyS2 Cathodes for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox voltage of doped cathodes usually falls in between the voltage of undoped layered cathodes. However, anomalous redox features were found in NaTi1&#8722;yVyS2. The discharge potential is 0.2&#8197;V higher than that of undoped cathodes. It is speculated that the anomalous voltage is mainly attributed to the strong covalency in the Ti&#8722;V&#8722;S system. Ti3+ and V3+ undergo charge transfer and form a more stable Ti (t2g0eg0) and V (t2g3eg0) electronic configuration.







Abstract
The rising demand for energy density of cathodes means the need to raise the voltage or capacity of cathodes. Transition metal (TM) doping has been employed to enhance the electrochemical properties in multiple aspects. The redox voltage of doped cathodes usually falls in between the voltage of undoped layered cathodes. However, we found anomalous redox features in NaTi1&#8722;yVyS2. The first discharge platform potential (2.4&#8197;V) is significantly higher than that of undoped NaTiS2 and NaVS2 (both around 2.2&#8197;V), and the energy density is raised by 15&#8201;%. We speculate that the anomalous voltage is mainly attributed to the strong hybridization in the Ti&#8722;V&#8722;S system. Ti3+ and V3+ undergo charge transfer and form a more stable Ti (t2g0eg0) and V (t2g3eg0) electronic configuration. Our results indicate that higher voltage of cathode materials could be achieved by strong TM&#8208;ligand covalency, and this conclusion provides possible opportunities to explore high voltage materials for future layered cathodes.

         <title>Enzyme Catalysis for Reversible Deactivation Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development, roles, and applications of enzymes in reversible deactivation radical polymerization (Enz&#8208;RDRP) are summarized in this Minireview. A reflection on the challenges and future directions of this promising field are also given.







Abstract
Enzyme catalysis has been increasingly utilized in reversible deactivation radical polymerization (Enz&#8208;RDRP) on account of its mildness, efficiency, and sustainability. In this Minireview we discuss the key roles enzymes play in RDRP, including their ATRPase, initiase, deoxygenation, and photoenzyme activities. We use selected examples to highlight applications of Enz&#8208;RDRP in surface brush fabrication, sensing, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, and high&#8208;throughput synthesis. We also give our reflections on the challenges and future directions of this emerging area.

         <title>Dynamic Interconversions of Single Molecules Probed by Recognition Tunneling at Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Functionalized Supramolecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic conversions of single molecules can be monitored at doubly cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;functionalized supramolecular junctions. Through this intermolecular recognition tunneling technique, the molecular conductance of different analytes and analyte mixtures can be finger&#8208;printed in dependence on pH and competitive salts, showcasing the first examples of direct as well as displacement titrations of single host&#8211;guest complexes at electronic junctions.







Abstract
We introduce a versatile recognition tunneling technique using doubly cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;functionalized electrodes to form supramolecular junctions that capture analytes dynamically by host&#8211;guest complexation. This results in characteristic changes in their single&#8208;molecule conductance. For structurally related drug molecules (camptothecin, sanguinarine, chelerythrine, and berberine) and mixtures thereof, we observed distinct current switching signals related to their intrinsic conductance properties as well as pH&#8208;dependent effects which can be traced back to their different states (protonated versus neutral). The conductance variation of a single molecule with pH shows a sigmoidal distribution, allowing us to extract a pKa value for reversible protonation, which is consistent with the reported macroscopic results. The new electronic method allows the characterization of unmodified drug molecules and showcases the transfer of dynamic supramolecular chemistry principles to single molecules.

         <title>NIR&#8208;I&#8208;Responsive Single&#8208;Band Upconversion Emission through Energy Migration in Core&#8211;Shell&#8211;Shell Nanostructures</title>

         <dc:description>
To regulate the excitation and emission peaks of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) into the NIR&#8208;I bio&#8208;window, a new type of high&#8208;efficiency NIR&#8208;I&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;I UCNPs has been developed based on the elaborate combination of high&#8208;content Nd3+ sensitization, Yb&#8208;mediated energy migration, Mn2+&#8208;assisted exchange&#8208;energy transfer and core&#8208;multishell construction that exhibit intense single&#8208;band red luminescence upon 808&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;I laser excitation.







Abstract
Here we report a new strategy to tune both excitation and emission peaks of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) into the first infrared biowindow (NIR&#8208;I, 650&#8211;900&#8197;nm) with high NIR&#8208;I&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;I upconversion efficiency. By introducing the sensitizer Nd3+, activator Er3+, energy migrator Yb3+ and energy manipulator Mn2+ into specific region to construct proposed energy migration processes in the designed core&#8211;shell&#8211;shell nanoarchitecture, back energy transfer (BET) from activator to sensitizer or migrator can be greatly blocked and the NIR&#8208;to&#8208;red upconversion emission can be efficiently promoted. Consequently, BET&#8208;induced photon quenching and the undesired green&#8208;emitting radiative transition are entirely eliminated, leading to high&#8208;efficiency single&#8208;band red upconversion emission upon 808&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;I laser excitation. Our findings provide insights into fundamental lanthanide interactions and advance the development of UCNPs for bioapplications with techniques that overturn traditional limitations.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Mesoporous Crystalline TiO2 Materials by Monomicelle Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring mesoporous TiO2 at the mesoscopic and microscopic level has been advancing in the last decade as its unique nanoscale architectures are of great importance for various applications. This Review surveys and discusses how to synthesize a series of novel mesoporous TiO2 materials, with the aim of highlighting how precise control can be achieved over the mesostructure and also potential synthetic directions.







Abstract
Mesoscale TiO2 structures have realized many technological applications&#8212;ranging from catalysis and biomedicine to energy storage and conversion&#8212;because of their large mesoporosities offering desirable accessibility and mass transport. Tailoring mesoporous TiO2 structures with novel mesoscopic and microscopic configurations is envisaged to offer ample opportunities for further applications. In this Review, we explain how to synthesize novel mesoporous TiO2 materials and present recent examples. An emphasis is placed on a &#8220;monomicelle assembly&#8221; strategy as an emerging and powerful approach to direct the formation of mesostructured TiO2 with precise control over its structural orientations and architectures. Furthermore, typical examples of mesoporous TiO2 for applications in batteries and photocatalysis are highlighted. The Review ends with an outlook towards the synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 with tailored architectures by self&#8208;assembly, which could pave the way for developing advanced energy conversion and storage devices.

Furthermore, typical examples of mesoporous TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for applications in batteries and photocatalysis are highlighted. The Review ends with an outlook towards the synthesis of mesoporous TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with tailored architectures by self-assembly, which could pave the way for developing advanced energy conversion and storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Avoiding Structural Collapse to Reduce Lead Leakage in Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structural collapse in perovskite films governs the Pb leakage after exposed to water as indicated by Noyes&#8208;Whitney Model simulation. It is effectively retarded by constructing a chemically stable Dion&#8208;Jacobson two&#8208;dimension (2D) perovskite (DOE)PbI4&#8722;xClx at the surface of the film.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a promising candidate for the next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies. As an essential element for high&#8208;efficiency PSCs however, the heavy metal Pb is soluble in water, causing a serious threat to the environment and human health. Due to the weak ionic bonding in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites, drastic structure decomposition occurs when immersing the perovskite film in water, which accelerates the Pb leakage. By introducing the chemically stable Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskite at the 3D perovskite surface, the film dissolution is significantly slowed down, which retards lead leakage. As a result, the Pb contamination is dramatically reduced under various extreme conditions. In addition, the PSCs device deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.6&#8201;% and retain over 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after the maximum power point tracking for over 1100&#8197;h.

         <title>Modular Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Concave Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for High&#8208;Performance Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Tunable Emission Mechanisms**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curved and fully conjugated N&#8208;pyrrolic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (N&#8208;PAHs) were utilized as efficient emitters in thermally activated delayed fluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diode (TADF/OLED) devices. The curvature increases the spatial separation between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, leading to low singlet&#8211;triplet gaps, which are essential for high reverse intersystem crossing rates. The overall photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is up to 86&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although bowl&#8208;shaped N&#8208;pyrrolic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can achieve excellent electron&#8208;donating ability, their application for optoelectronics is hampered by typically low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). To address this issue, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of curved and fully conjugated nitrogen&#8208;doped PAHs. Through structural modifications to the electron&#8208;accepting moiety, we are able to switch the mechanism of luminescence between thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), and to tune the overall PLQY in the range from 9&#8201;% to 86&#8201;%. As a proof of concept, we constructed solid&#8208;state organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices, which has not been explored to date in the context of concave N&#8208;doped systems being TADF/RTP emitters. The best&#8208;performing dye, possessing a peripheral trifluoromethyl group adjacent to the phenazine acceptor, exhibits yellow to orange emission with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12&#8201;%, which is the highest EQE in a curved D&#8208;A embedded N&#8208;PAH to date.

         <title>Programmed Supramolecular Assemblies Using Orthogonal Pairs of Heterodimeric Coiled Coil Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for constructing peptide&#8208;based supramolecular assemblies with pre&#8208;determined oligomeric states and topologies is reported. By using four polypeptide chains that form two orthogonal heterodimeric coiled coils and pre&#8208;installing covalent linkages between the non&#8208;complementary pairs in strategic arrangements, several discrete supramolecular assemblies with pre&#8208;determined molar masses and topologies were constructed.







Abstract
Despite recent progress, it remains challenging to program biomacromolecules to assemble into discrete nanostructures with pre&#8208;determined sizes and topologies. We report here a novel strategy to address this challenge. By using two orthogonal pairs of heterodimeric coiled coils as the building blocks, we constructed six discrete supramolecular assemblies, each composed of a prescribed number of coiled coil components. Within these assemblies, different coiled coils were connected via end&#8208;to&#8208;side covalent linkages strategically pre&#8208;installed between the non&#8208;complementary pairs. The overall topological features of two highly complex assemblies, a &#8220;barbell&#8221; and a &#8220;quadrilateral&#8221; form, were characterized experimentally and were in good agreement to the designs. This work expands the design paradigms for peptide&#8208;based discrete supramolecular assemblies and will provide a route for de novo fabrication of functional protein materials.

         <title>Enhanced Blue Afterglow through Molecular Fusion for Bio&#8208;applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a molecular fusion strategy to achieve a high&#8208;efficiency photochemical afterglow system. The afterglow quantum yield was up to 2.59&#8201;%, which was significantly higher than that achieved with the physical mixing strategy and the covalent coupling strategy. This afterglow system was further used for high SNR bio&#8208;imaging and for the background&#8208;free high&#8208;sensitivity lateral flow immunoassay detection of &#946;&#8208;hCG.







Abstract
Afterglow materials have drawn considerable attention due to their attractive luminescent properties. However, their low&#8208;efficiency luminescence in aqueous environment limits their applications in life sciences. Here, we developed a molecular fusion strategy to improve the afterglow efficiency of photochemical afterglow materials. By fusing a cache unit with an emitter, we obtained a blue afterglow system with a quantum yield up to 2.59&#8201;%. This is 162&#8197;times higher than that achieved with the traditional physical mixing system and more than an order of magnitude larger than that of the covalent coupling system. High&#8208;efficiency afterglow nanoparticles were obtained and utilized for bio&#8208;imaging with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of 131, and for the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) of &#946;&#8208;hCG with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.34&#8197;mIU&#8201;mL&#8722;1. This paves a new way for the construction of high&#8208;efficiency afterglow materials and expands the number of luminescence reporter candidates for disease diagnosis and bio&#8208;imaging.

         <title>Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Guided Photothermal Immunotherapy Based on a Versatile NIR&#8208;II Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile NIR&#8208;II AIE luminogen displaying fluorescence, photoacoustic, and photothermal imaging functions was designed by using a benzo[c]thiophene moiety as a building block. This luminogen, when applied with an integrated programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) antibody, exhibits unprecedented performance in multimodal imaging&#8208;guided photothermal immunotherapy towards breast tumors.







Abstract
Synergistic photothermal immunotherapy has captured great attention owing to the mutually strengthening therapeutic outcomes towards both original tumors and abscopal tumors. Herein, a versatile theranostic agent displaying aggregation&#8208;induced emission, namely TPA&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ, was designed and prepared based on benzo[c]thiophene unit as a building block; it can be used for simultaneous fluorescence imaging (FLI) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), photothermal imaging (PTI), and thermal eradication of tumors. Further experiments validate that photothermal therapy (PTT) mediated by TPA&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ nanoparticles not only destroys the primary tumor but also enhances immunogenicity for further suppressing the growth of tumors at distant sites. Furthermore, PTT combining a programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) antibody prevents the metastasis and recurrence of cancer by potentiating the effect of immunotherapy.

This luminogen, when applied with an integrated programmed death-ligand 1 (&#945;PD-L1) antibody, exhibits unprecedented performance in multimodal imaging-guided photothermal immunotherapy towards breast tumors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergistic photothermal immunotherapy has captured great attention owing to the mutually strengthening therapeutic outcomes towards both original tumors and abscopal tumors. Herein, a versatile theranostic agent displaying aggregation-induced emission, namely TPA-BT-DPTQ, was designed and prepared based on benzo[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]thiophene unit as a building block; it can be used for simultaneous fluorescence imaging (FLI) in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), photothermal imaging (PTI), and thermal eradication of tumors. Further experiments validate that photothermal therapy (PTT) mediated by TPA-BT-DPTQ nanoparticles not only destroys the primary tumor but also enhances immunogenicity for further suppressing the growth of tumors at distant sites. Furthermore, PTT combining a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody prevents the metastasis and recurrence of cancer by potentiating the effect of immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Activatable Polymeric Nanoprobe for Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging of Tumor&#8208;Associated Neutrophils in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable polymeric nanoprobe (SPCy) is synthesized for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) detection of neutrophil elastase (NE), a biomarker of tumor&#8208;associated neutrophils (TANs). SPCy reacts with NE in tumors to only turn on the NIRF and PA signals of hemicyanine but not the reference polymer backbone, leading to ratiometric NIRF and increased PA signals of TANs during cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Imaging to evaluate tumor&#8208;associated neutrophils (TANs) is imperative for cancer immunotherapy but remains challenging. We herein report an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPCy) for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of neutrophil elastase (NE), a biomarker of TANs. SPCy comprises a semiconducting polymer conjugated with a hemicyanine (hemi&#8208;Cy) dye caged by a NE&#8208;cleavable peptide as the side chain. After systemic administration, SPCy passively targets the tumor and reacts with NE to &#8220;uncage&#8221; the hemi&#8208;Cy, leading to enhanced NIRF and PA signals of the hemi&#8208;Cy but unchanged signals of the SP. Such NE&#8208;activated ratiometric NIRF and enhanced PA signals of SPCy correlate with the intratumoral population of TANs. Thus, this study not only presents the first TAN&#8208;specific PA probe, but also provides a general molecular design strategy for PA imaging of other immune&#8208;related biomarkers to facilitate screening of cancer immunotherapeutics.

         <title>Multicolor Zinc(II)&#8208;Coordinated Hydrazone&#8208;Based Bistable Photoswitches for Rewritable Transparent Luminescent Labels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitches with high emission quantum yields, excellent reversible photoisomerization properties, and long thermal stability are reported. Impressively, multiple emission colors can be obtained readily for these two photoswitches upon coordination with various zinc salts. Furthermore, the photo&#8208;controlled rewritable printing of invisible multicolor images with extremely high resolution and stability is achieved.







Abstract
Repeatable printing of invisible multicolor luminescence patterns with long retention times on transparent substrates is of significant importance, but it remains a formidable challenge. Here, two novel hydrazone&#8208;based on/off fluorescent photoswitches with decent emission quantum efficiencies, good reversible photoisomerization properties, and extremely long thermal half&#8208;lives, were designed and synthesized. Excitingly, X&#8208;ray crystallography data of both Z and E isomers of one hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitch were obtained. Multiple emission colors of blue, cyan, green, yellow, and orange can be obtained readily for these two photoswitches upon coordination with various zinc salts. Moreover, the photo&#8208;controlled rewritable printing of invisible multicolor images with high resolution was achieved by using these photoswitches. Importantly, the legibility of the printed patterns can last at least over 3&#8197;months without detectable emission intensity loss under ambient conditions.

         <title>A New Strategy to Fight Metallodrug Resistance: Mitochondria&#8208;Relevant Treatment through Mitophagy to Inhibit Metabolic Adaptations of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to fight metallodrug resistance through mitochondria&#8208;relevant treatment is reported. The cyclometalated IrIII complex Ir&#8208;Rhein could inhibit the metabolic adaptation of cancer cells by inducing severe mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. Moreover, complex Ir&#8208;Rhein could overcome metallodrug resistance through the regulation of the platinum resistance&#8208;related transporters.







Abstract
Metabolic adaptations can help cancer cells to escape from chemotherapeutics, mainly involving autophagy and ATP production. Herein, we report a new rhein&#8208;based cyclometalated IrIII complex, Ir&#8208;Rhein, that can accurately target mitochondria and effectively inhibit metabolic adaptations. The complex Ir&#8208;Rhein induces severe mitochondrial damage and initiates mitophagy to reduce the number of mitochondria and subsequently inhibit both mitochondrial and glycolytic bioenergetics, which eventually leads to ATP starvation death. Moreover, Ir&#8208;Rhein can overcome cisplatin resistance. Co&#8208;incubation experiment, 3D tumor spheroids experiment and transcriptome analysis reveal that Ir&#8208;Rhein shows promising antiproliferation performance for cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells with the regulation of platinum resistance&#8208;related transporters. To our knowledge, this is a new strategy to overcome metallodrug resistance with a mitochondria&#8208;relevant treatment.

         <title>Hydrophilic Catalysts with High Activity and Stability in the Aqueous Polymerization of Ethylene to High&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight&#8208;Polyethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophilic sulfonated phosphinephenolato NiII catalysts are highly active and stable in aqueous ethylene polymerization, forming high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE) dispersions with narrow particle size distributions.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble synthetic transition metal catalysts have been studied extensively for many reactions, but for olefin polymerization such catalysts have been lacking. We report herein a straightforward synthesis of phosphinephenolato NiII catalysts endowed permanently with a hydrophilic sulfonate moiety bound to the chelating ligand. These catalysts&#8217; hydrophilic active sites promote aqueous ethylene polymerization with high activity (TOF up to 6.3&#215;104&#8197;molEthylene&#8201;molNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) to high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE), with half&#8208;lives on the order of hours also at elevated temperatures. The obtained polyethylene dispersions feature narrow particle size distributions without any aggregates.

         <dc:description>Assessing the outcomes of chemical reactions in a quantitative fashion has been a cornerstone across all synthetic disciplines. Classically approached through empirical optimization, data&#8208;driven modelling bears an enormous potential to streamline this process. However, such predictive models require significant quantities of high&#8208;quality data, the availability of which is limited: Main reasons for this include experimental errors and, importantly, human biases regarding experiment selection and result reporting.

         <title>Rapid High&#8208;contrast Photoreversible Coloration of Surface&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;doped TiO2 Nanocrystals for Rewritable Light&#8208;Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pristine titanium dioxide (TiO2) changes color from white to black when it is reduced from Ti(IV) to Ti(III) by photoexcited electrons. However, the black coloration requires substantial light energy to create, and it vanishes instantaneously upon exposure to air. This work reports the synthesis of surface&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;doped TiO2 nanocrystals that rapidly change color (i.e., within seconds) from whitish to black under low&#8208;power irradiation with excellent color stability in atmospheric conditions. The N&#8208;doping plays a critical role in promoting the surface&#8208;adsorption of polyol groups to stabilize the Ti(III) species and accelerate the coloration process. A rewritable paper fabricated using these nanocrystals exhibits excellent writing and erasing reversibility in response to UV irradiation and oxygen exposure. The low&#8208;cost, rapid response, excellent reversibility, and good color stability are vital advantages of N&#8208;doped TiO2 nanocrystals for color&#8208;switching applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Bipyrrole&#8208;based Tetra&#8208;BF2 Flag&#8208;hinge Chromophores: Achieving Multicolor and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the facile syntheses of tetra&#8208;boron difluoride (tetra&#8208;BF  2  ) complexes, flag&#8208;hinge&#8208;like molecules that exhibit intense green&#8208;to&#8208;orange luminescence in solution and yellow&#8208;to&#8208;red emission in the solid states. Single&#8208;crystal structure analysis and density functional theory calculations suggested a bent structure of this series of compounds. The complexes also exhibited excellent optical properties, with quantum yields reaching 100% and a large Stokes shift. These properties were attributed to the altered bending angle of the molecule in the S  1  excited state. As the rotational motion was suppressed around the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrrole axis, atropisomers with axial chirality were formed, which are optically resolvable into (  R  ) and (  S  )&#8208;enantiomers through a chiral column. The atropisomers thus function as circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials, in which the color (green, green&#8208;yellow, and yellow) can be varied by controlling the aggregation state. This rational design of multi&#8208;BF  2  complexes can potentially realize novel photofunctional materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In a ball mill, FeBr  3  &#8208;catalyzed intramolecular amidations lead to 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2(1  H  )&#8208;quinolinones in&#160; good to almost&#160; quantitative yields. &#160; The reactions do not require a solvent and are easy to perform. No additional ligand is needed for the iron catalyst. Both 4&#8208;substituted aryl and&#160;  &#946;  &#8208;substituted dioxazolones provide products with high &#160;selectivity. Mechanistically, an electrophilic spirocyclization followed by C&#8208;C migration explains the formation of rearranged products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cocatalyst Strategy to Enhance Ruthenium&#8208;Mediated Metathesis Reactivity towards Electron&#8208;Deficient Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ruthenium&#8208;mediated olefin metathesis has been widely applied for the synthesis of various organic molecules and polymers. Inspired by the cocatalyst strategy for olefin polymerization, here we demonstrate that the abstraction of a chloride ion from various commercially available ruthenium catalysts significantly enhances their reactivity towards electron&#8208;deficient internal olefins. This cocatalyst strategy can be implemented in ethenolysis and cross&#8208;metathesis reactions of FG&#8208;CH=CH&#8208;FG type substrates bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and the synthesis of telechelic polymers that can be converted to polyethylene&#8208;like materials with closed&#8208;loop recycling properties. The copolymerization cyclic substrate with cycloolefins followed by hydrogenation afforded polyolefin materials with in&#8208;chain break points. Interestingly, switchable catalysis was achieved in the absence and presence of a cocatalyst, which allowed the polymer microstructure and material properties to be fine&#8208;tuned.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible Cuprous Triazolate Frameworks as Highly Stable and Efficient Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction with Tunable C2H4/CH4 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks have attracted much attention for electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction, but they are generally instable and difficult to control the product selectivity. We report flexible Cu(I) triazolate frameworks as efficient, stable, and tunable electrocatalysts for CO  2&#160;  reduction to C  2  H  4  /CH  4  . By changing the size of ligand side groups, the C  2  H  4  /CH  4  selectivity ratio can be gradually tuned and inversed from 11.8:1 to 1:2.6, giving C  2  H  4  , CH  4  , and hydrocarbon selectivities up to 51%, 56%, and 77%, respectively. After long&#8208;term electrocatalysis, they can retain the structures/morphologies without formation of Cu&#8208;based inorganic species. Computational simulations showed that the coordination geometry of Cu(I) changed from triangular to tetrahedral to bind the reaction intermediates, and two adjacent Cu(I) cooperated for C&#8211;C coupling to form C  2  H  4  . Importantly, the ligand side groups controlled the catalyst flexibility by the steric hindrance mechanism, and the C  2  H  4  pathway is more sensitive than the CH  4  one.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Metal&#8208;Free Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent Copolymer for Low Flicker AC&#8208;LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic room&#8208;temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescent materials are promising light&#8208;emitting materials for encryption, architectural decoration, organic solar cells, and biomedical applications. However, their unstable structures and thermal&#8208; and humidity&#8208;induced emission quenching have greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we report a metal&#8208;free nonconjugated copolymer that possesses stable photoluminescence at both high temperature and humidity. The room temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) of this copolymer lasts for more than 15 s and can be recovered in high humidity conditions by heating to remove moisture. Copolymer LPL can be achieved with various excitation wavelengths, ranging from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared, and the LPL color can be adjusted accordingly. The high initial LPL intensity and ultrafast filling time of the copolymer makes it suitable for low flicker alternating current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (AC&#8208;LEDs).</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Sensitive Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CO over Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate a new case of materials&#8208;gene engineering to precisely design photocatalysts with the prescribed properties. Based on theoretical calculations, a phase&#8208;doping strategy was proposed to regulate the pathways of CO2 conversion over Au nanoparticles (NPs) loaded TiO2 photocatalysts. As a result, the thermodynamic bottleneck of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is successfully unlocked by the incorporation of stable twinning crystal planes into face centered cubic (fcc) &#160;phase Au NPs. Compared to bare pristine TiO2, the activity results showed that the loading of regular fcc&#8208;Au NPs raised the CO production by 18&#8208;fold but suppressed the selectivity from 84% to 75%, whereas Au NPs with twinning (110) and (100) facets boosted the activity by nearly 40&#8208;fold and established near unity CO selectivity. This enhancement is shown to originate from a beneficial shift in the surface reactive site energetics arising at the twinned stacking fault, whereby both the CO reaction energy and desorption energy were significantly reduced.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed radical enantioselective carbo&#8208;esterification of styrenes enabled by a perfluoroalkylated&#8208;PyBox ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral lactones are found in many natural products. The reaction of simple alkenes with iodoacetic acid is a powerful method to build lactones, but the enantioselective version of this reaction has not been implemented to date. Herein, we report efficient catalytic radical enantioselective carbo&#8208;esterification of styrenes enabled by a newly developed Cu(I)&#8208;perfluoroalkylated PyBox system. Simple styrenes have been converted to useful chiral lactones whose synthetic applications are showcased. The mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is a rare example of an efficient ligand&#8208;decelerated system in which the ligand deaccelerates the reaction but the reaction is still efficient with reduced amounts of the ligand. This uncommon catalytic system may inspire further consideration of the effect of ligands in asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Silylene Stabilized by a &#963;&#8208;Donating Ni(0) Fragment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A donor&#8208;stabilized silylene  4  featuring a Ni(0)&#8208;based donating ligand was synthesized. Complex  4  exhibits a pyramidalized and nucleophilic Si(II) center and shows a peculiar behavior due to the cooperative reactivity of Si and Ni centers. Calculations indicate that the orientation of Ni&#8208;ligands with respect to the silylene moiety is crucial in determining the role of Ni&#8208;fragment (Lewis acid or Lewis base) towards silylene. Indeed, a simple 90&#176; rotate of Si&#8208;Ni&#8208;bond, reverses the role of Ni, and transforms a classical silylene&#8594;Ni(0) complex into an unprecedented Ni(0)&#8594;silylene complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Temperature&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Borylative Cyclizations of Enynes: BCl3&#8208;Promoted Skeletal Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free borylative cyclization of biphenyl&#8208;embedded 1,3,5&#8208;trien&#8208;7&#8208;ynes in the presence of simple and inexpensive BCl3 provided synthetically useful borylated building blocks. The outcome of the process depends on the reaction temperature, with borylated phenanthrenes obtained at 60 &#186;C and phenanthrene&#8208;fused borylated cyclobutanes formed at 0 &#186;C. Based on DFT calculations, a mechanism for these novel transformations has been proposed, which involves an uncommon skeletal rearrangement, including migration of a methyl group and alkyne fragmentation, unprecedented in BCl3&#8208;promoted cyclization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Diffraction Enables the Mapping of Coke in ZSM&#8208;5 Micropores Formed during Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unveiling the coke formation in zeolites is an essential prerequisite for tackling the deactivation of these catalysts in the transformations of hydrocarbons. Herein, we present the direct mapping of coke in the micropores of ZSM&#8209;5 catalysts used in methanol&#8209;to&#8209;hydrocarbons conversion by single&#8208;crystal electron diffraction analysis. The latter technique revealed a polycyclic aromatic structure along the straight channel, wherein the high quality data permit refinement of its occupancy to about 40%. These findings were exploited to analyze the evolution of micropore coke during the reaction. Herein, coke&#8209;associated signals, which correlate with the activity loss, indicate that the nucleation of coke commences in the intersections of sinusoidal and straight channels and is following by coke formation in the straight pores in the late stages of deactivation. The findings uncover an attractive method for analyzing coke deposition in the micropore domain.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorescent Cage for Supramolecular Sensing of 3&#8208;Nitrotyrosine in Human Blood Serum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3&#8208;Nitrotyrosine (NT) is generated by the action of peroxynitrite and other reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and as a consequence it is accumulated in inflammation&#8208;associated conditions. This is particularly relevant in kidney disease, where NT concentration in blood is considerably high. Therefore, NT is a crucial biomarker of renal damage, although it has been underestimated in clinical diagnosis due to the lack of an appropriate sensing method. Herein we report the first fluorescent supramolecular sensor for such a relevant compound: Fluorescence by rotational restriction of tetraphenylethenes (TPE) in a covalent cage is selectively quenched in human blood serum by 3&#8208;nitrotyrosine (NT) that binds to the cage with high affinity, allowing a limit of detection within the reported physiological concentrations of NT in chronic kidney disease.</dc:description>

Therefore, NT is a crucial biomarker of renal damage, although it has been underestimated in clinical diagnosis due to the lack of an appropriate sensing method. Herein we report the first fluorescent supramolecular sensor for such a relevant compound: Fluorescence by rotational restriction of tetraphenylethenes (TPE) in a covalent cage is selectively quenched in human blood serum by 3-nitrotyrosine (NT) that binds to the cage with high affinity, allowing a limit of detection within the reported physiological concentrations of NT in chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantification of Biocatalytic Transformations by Single Microbial Cells Enabled by Tailored Integration of Droplet Microfluidics and Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the performance of chemical transformations catalysed by microbial biocatalysts requires a deep understanding of cellular processes. While the cellular heterogeneity of cellular characteristics, such as the concentration of high abundant cellular content, is well studied, little is known about the reactivity of individual cells and its impact on the chemical identity, quantity, and purity of excreted products. Biocatalytic transformations were monitored chemically specific and quantifiable at the single&#8208;cell level by integrating droplet microfluidics, cell imaging, and mass spectrometry. Product formation rates for individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were obtained by i)&#160;incubating nanolitre&#8208;sized droplets for product accumulation in microfluidic devices, ii) an imaging setup to determine the number of cells in the droplets, and iii)&#160;electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry for reading the chemical contents of individual droplets. These findings now enable the study of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis at single&#8208;cell resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Induction of Diverse Cryptic Fungal Metabolites by Steroids and Channel Blockers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fungi offer a deep source of natural products but remain underutilized. Most biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that can be detected are silent or &#8216;cryptic&#8217; in standard lab cultures and their products are thus not interrogated in routine screens. As genetic alterations are difficult and some strains can only be grown on agar, we have herein applied an agar&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput chemical genetic screen to identify inducers of fungal BGCs. Using R. solani and S. sclerotiorum as test cases, we report 13 cryptic metabolites in four compound groups, including sclerocyclane, a natural product with a novel scaffold. Steroids were the best elicitors and follow&#8208;up studies showed that plant&#8208;steroids trigger sclerocyclane synthesis, which shows antibiotic activity against B. plantarii, an ecological competitor of S. sclerotiorum. Our results open new paths to exploring the chemical ecology of fungal&#8208;plant interactions and provide a genetics&#8208;free approach for uncovering cryptic fungal metabolites.</dc:description>

         <title>carba&#8208;Nucleopeptides (cNPs): A Biopharmaceutical Modality Formed through Aqueous Rhodamine B Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exchanging the ribose backbone of an oligonucleotide for a peptide can enhance its physiologic stability and nucleic acid binding affinity. Ordinarily, the eneamino nitrogen atom of a nucleobase is fused to the side chain of a polypeptide through a new C&#8722;N bond. The discovery of C&#8722;C linked nucleobases in the human transcriptome reveals new opportunities for engineering nucleopeptides that replace the traditional C&#8722;N bond with a non&#8208;classical C&#8722;C bond, liberating a captive nitrogen atom and promoting new hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. We report the first late&#8208;stage synthesis of C&#8722;C linked carba&#8208;Nucleopeptides (cNPs) using aqueous Rhodamine B photoredox catalysis. We prepare brand&#8208;new cNPs in batch, in parallel, and in flow using three long&#8208;wavelength photochemical setups. We detail the mechanism of our reaction by experimental and computational studies and highlight the essential role of diisopropylethylamine as a bifurcated two&#8208;electron reductant.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The confinement of a catalytic site is an efficient strategy to control a reaction and modulate its selectivity. In the present work, a new class of structurally simple and easily accessible bulky tris&#8208;(  ortho  biaryl)phosphine ligands were accessed, and their gold(I) complexes synthesized. Their X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis and the comparative evaluation of their V  Bur  % and  G  steric parameters against a series of gold complexes commonly employed in catalysis demonstrated their confined nature. Despite their notable steric congestion, these complexes exhibited remarkable catalytic activities and unusual selectivities, both in nature and level, that make them unique in the field of synthetic homogeneous gold catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Post&#8208;Polymerization Amidation of Polymers with Side&#8208;Chain Ester Groups by Intramolecular Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic conversion of esters to amides represents new opportunities in the synthetic diversification and upcycling of polymers, as esters are commonly featured in various polymer structures. Yet, direct amidation is typically hampered by poor reaction kinetics and the effects of polymer structure on the reactivity remain poorly understood. Within this contribution, we report the accelerated amidation for amines with additional hydrogen bond donating or accepting groups. These amines facilitate the expeditious (co)amidation of polymers with pendant ester groups, displaying at least a 400&#8208;fold higher reactivity relative to polyesters with esters in the main. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the reactivity and degree of polymerization for poly(methyl acrylate) suggests a hydrogen&#8208;bond mediated intramolecular activation of the esters, which was confirmed by FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy and basic molecular mechanics modeling. The reported method paves the way to synthesize diverse (co)polymers with amide side chains from readily available polymeric precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of 2,3,4&#8208;Trisubstituted 3&#8208;Pyrrolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of synthetic methods to produce highly functionalized chiral 3&#8208;pyrrolines is of indisputable importance because of their prevalence in natural and synthetic bioactive molecules. Unfortunately, previous general cycloaddition approaches using allenoates, could not synthesize 3,4&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;pyrrolines. Herein, an original approach to yield 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted 3&#8208;pyrrolines with chirality at the 2&#8208;position is presented. A Ni(II)/Fc&#8208;i&#8208;PrPhox catalytic system facilitated a redox&#8208;neutral highly stereoselective process that exhibited an enantioselectivity of up to 99%. Enantioenriched 3&#8208;pyrrolines can be converted to other valuable classes of N&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

Unfortunately, previous general cycloaddition approaches using allenoates, could not synthesize 3,4-disubstituted 3-pyrrolines. Herein, an original approach to yield 2,3,4-trisubstituted 3-pyrrolines with chirality at the 2-position is presented. A Ni(II)/Fc-i-PrPhox catalytic system facilitated a redox-neutral highly stereoselective process that exhibited an enantioselectivity of up to 99%. Enantioenriched 3-pyrrolines can be converted to other valuable classes of N-heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Structural Stability and Pressure&#8208;induced Photoconductivity in Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite&#160;(C6H5CH2NH3)2CuBr4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The eco&#8208;friendly properties enable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Cu&#8208;based perovskites as ideal candidates for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, but practical application is limited by low photoelectric conversion efficiency because of poor carrier transport abilities. Here, we report enhanced structural stability of 2D CuBr4&#160;perovskites under compression up to 30 GPa, without obvious volume collapse or structural amorphization, by inserting organic C6H5CH2NH3&#160;(PMA) groups between layers. The band gap value of (PMA)2CuBr4  can be effectively tuned from 1.8 to 1.47 eV by employing external pressures, leading a broadened absorption range of 400&#8208;800 nm. Notably, we successfully detected photoconductivity of photoresponse at pressures from 10 to 40 GPa, that the maximum value of 5&#215;10  &#8208;3  S/cm is observed at 28 GPa, indicating potential applicaitions for high performance photovoltaic candidates under exterme conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Delicate and Fast Photochemical Surface Modification of 2D Photoresponsive Organosilicon Metal&#8210;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoresponsive arylsilanes have been fascinating molecules for decades because of their unique photophysical characteristics and surface chemistry. Here we report the synthesis and fabrication of a crystalline two&#8208;dimensional trisilyl metal&#8210;organic framework (TSiMOF) orderly installed with the classical photoresponsive hexamethyltrisilane groups on the surface. Irradiated by UV light under air in minutes the fluorescence of the TSiMOF is turned on simultaneously with an intriguing surface transformation from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic. Thus, multifarious luminescent and hydrophilic patterns including logos, characters and Quick Response codes, etc. with good resolution are readily generated on the facilely fabricated TSiMOF film. The mechanism of this transformation is revealed by control experiments that the superficial trimethylsilyl groups suffering photochemical oxidation have been converted to hydroxyl groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatically Directed Long&#8208;Range Self&#8208;Assembly of Nucleotides with Cationic Nanoparticles to Form Multifunctional Bioplasmonic Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A precise control over interparticle interactions is essential to retain the functions of individual components in a self&#8208;assembled superstructure. Here, we report the design of a multifunctional bioplasmonic network via an electrostatically directed self&#8208;assembly process involving adenosine 5'&#8208;triphosphate (ATP). The present study unveils the ability of ATP to undergo a long&#8208;range self&#8208;assembly in the presence of cations and gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Modelling and NMR studies gave a qualitative insight into the major interactions driving the bioplasmonic network formation. ATP&#8208;Ca2+coordination helps in regulating the electrostatic interaction, which is crucial in transforming an uncontrolled precipitation into a kinetically controlled aggregation process. Remarkably, ATP and AuNP retained their inherent properties in the multifunctional bioplasmonic network. The generality of electrostatically directed self&#8208;assembly process was extended to different nucleotide&#8208;nanoparticle systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable CHA/AEI Zeolite Intergrowths with A Priori Biselective Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agents: Controlling Enrichment and Implications for Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel &#8220;ab&#8208;initio&#8221; methodology based on high&#8208;throughput simulations has permitted designing unique bi&#8208;selective organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs) that allow the efficient synthesis of CHA/AEI zeolite intergrowth materials with controlled phase compositions. Distinctive local crystallographic ordering of the CHA/AEI intergrowths has been revealed at the nanoscale level using integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC STEM). These novel CHA/AEI materials have been tested for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx, presenting an outstanding catalytic performance and hydrothermal stability, even surpassing the performance of the well&#8208;stablished commercial CHA&#8208;type catalyst. This methodology opens the possibility for synthetizing new zeolite intergrowths with more complex structures and unique catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Commonly Used Alkylating Agents Limit Persulfide Detection by Converting Protein Persulfides into Thioethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein persulfides (R&#8208;S&#8208;SH) have emerged as a common post&#8208;translational modification. Detection and quantitation of protein persulfides requires trapping with alkylating agents. Here we show that alkylating agents differ dramatically in their ability to conserve the persulfide&#8217;s sulfur&#8208;sulfur bond for subsequent detection by mass spectrometry. The two alkylating agents most commonly used in cell biology and biochemistry,  N  &#8208;ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide, are found to be unsuitable for the purpose of conserving persulfides under biologically relevant conditions. The resulting persulfide adducts (R&#8208;S&#8208;S&#8208;Alk) rapidly convert into the corresponding thioethers (R&#8208;S&#8208;Alk) by donating sulfur to ambient nucleophilic acceptors. In contrast, certain other alkylating agents, in particular monobromobimane and  N  &#8208;  t  &#8208;butyl&#8208;iodoacetamide, generate stable alkylated persulfides. We propose that the nature of the alkylating agent determines the ability of the disulfide bond (R&#8208;S&#8208;S&#8208;Alk) to tautomerize into the thiosulfoxide (R&#8208;(S=S)&#8208;Alk), and/or the ability of nucleophiles to remove the sulfane sulfur atom from the thiosulfoxide.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of versatile and sensitive biotools to quantify specific SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 immunoglobulins in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected and non&#8208;infected individuals, built&#8208;on the surface of magnetic microbeads functionalized with nucleocapsid (N) and in&#8208;house expressed recombinant spike (S) proteins is reported. Amperometric interrogation of captured N&#8208; and S&#8208;specific circulating total or individual immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes (IgG, IgM, and IgA), subsequently labelled with HRP&#8208;conjugated secondary antibodies, was performed at disposable single or multiplexed (8x) screen&#8208;printed electrodes using the HQ/HRP/H  2  O  2  &#160;system. The obtained results using N and in&#8208;house expressed S ectodomains of five SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants of concern (including the latest Delta and Omicron) allow identification of vulnerable populations from those with natural or acquired immunity, monitoring of infection, evaluation of vaccine efficiency and even identification of the variant responsible for the infection.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Equal Ratio Cocrystal Engineering to Improve Charge Transport Characteristics of Organic Semiconductors: a Case Study on Indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare studies of cocrystal engineering have focused on improving carrier mobility of organic semiconductors mainly because of the generation of ambipolarity, the alteration of the charge carrier polarity or the reduction of electronic couplings. Herein, we utilize indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole (IC) as the model compound and 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthraquinone (DPAO) and 9&#8208;fluorenone (FO) as the coformers to construct IC2&#8208;DPAO and IC&#8208;FO cocrystals with 2:1 or 1:1 ratios respectively through hydrogen bonds and donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. Very interestingly, the more appropriate packing structure, possessing not only enhanced electronic couplings but also increased intermolecular distances, is achieved in IC2&#8208;DPAO, which shows an improved carrier mobility of 0.11 cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  by four orders of magnitude relative to IC crystal. These results suggest that non&#8208;equal ratio cocrystal engineering opens up the possibility to the development of organic semiconductors with enhanced charge transport behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Desymmetric Dicarbofunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The desymmetric dicarbofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes by a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed to access pyrrolidinones bearing multi&#8208;stereocenters with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. The utilization of the 8&#8208;Quinox ligand is crucial for maintaining high enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.







Abstract
The construction of multi&#8208;stereocenters by a transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction is a major challenge. The catalytic desymmetric functionalization of unactivated alkenes remains largely unexplored. Herein, we disclose &#8208;a desymmetric dicarbofunctionalization of 1,6&#8208;dienes via a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The leverage of the underdeveloped chiral 8&#8208;Quinox enables the Ni&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric carbamoylalkylation of both unactivated mono&#8208; and disubstituted alkenes to form pyrrolidinone bearing two nonadjacent stereogenic centers in high enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivitives with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. The synthetic application of pyrrolidinones allows the rapid access to complex chiral fused&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>A Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complex Disrupts Actin Cytoskeleton Assembly and Blocks Cytokinesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dinuclear RuII complex [(Ru(phen)2)2(tpphz)]4+ binds to G&#8208;actin monomers, preventing assembly into F&#8208;actin. This inhibits actin fibre assemblies within live cells and causes disruption to late cytokinesis by interfering with the function of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) during abscission. These results reveal new possibilities for metal complexes as biomedical tools and novel therapeutic leads.







Abstract
The dinuclear RuII complex [(Ru(phen)2)2(tpphz)]4+ (phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, tpphz=tetrapyridophenazine) &#8220;RuRuPhen&#8221; blocks the transformation of G&#8208;actin monomers to F&#8208;actin filaments with no disassembly of pre&#8208;formed F&#8208;actin. Molecular docking studies indicate multiple RuRuPhen molecules bind to the surface of G&#8208;actin but not the binding pockets of established actin polymerisation inhibitors. In cells, addition of RuRuPhen causes rapid disruption to actin stress fibre organisation, compromising actomyosin contractility and cell motility; due to this effect RuRuPhen interferes with late&#8208;stage cytokinesis. Immunofluorescent microscopy reveals that RuRuPhen causes cytokinetic abscission failure by interfering with endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) complex recruitment.

         <title>Circular Dichroism Based Chirality Sensing with Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiroptical sensing based on noncovalent recognition using synthetic hosts and circular dichroism spectroscopy is discussed in this Minireview. The synthetic hosts used as the chirality sensors are divided into three classes according to their structural features. Applications of the chirality sensors are demonstrated with selected examples together with the challenges.







Abstract
Optical methods are promising to address the ever&#8208;increasing demands for chirality analysis in drug discovery and related fields because they are amenable to high&#8208;throughput screening. Circular dichroism&#8208;based chiroptical sensing using host&#8208;guest chemistry is especially appealing due to the fast equilibrium kinetics, wide substrate scope, and potential for sustainable development. In this Minireview, we give an overview on this emerging field. General aspects of molecular recognition and chirality transfer are analyzed. Chirality sensors are discussed by dividing them into three classes according to their structural features. Applications of these chirality sensors for chirality analysis of the products of asymmetric reactions and for the real&#8208;time monitoring of reaction kinetics are demonstrated with selected examples. Moreover, challenges and research directions in this field are also highlighted.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence in Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Vacancy&#8208;Ordered Double Perovskite Cs2ZrCl6 Phosphors via Te4+ Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of NIR emitters was developed based on tellurium and lanthanide co&#8208;doped perovskite&#8208;derivative Cs2ZrCl6 phosphors. Through sensitization by the spin&#8208;orbital allowed 1S0&#8594;3P1 transition of Te4+, intense and multi&#8208;wavelength NIR luminescence from Er3+, Nd3+, and Yb3+ was achieved upon excitation with a near&#8208;ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;derivative metal halides have shown great promise in optoelectronics, however, it remains challenging to realize efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence in these materials. Herein, we report a novel strategy based on Te4+/Ln3+ (Ln=Er, Nd, and Yb) co&#8208;doping to achieve efficient NIR luminescence in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite Cs2ZrCl6 phosphors, which are excitable by a low&#8208;cost near&#8208;ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) chip. Through sensitization by the spin&#8208;orbital allowed 1S0&#8594;3P1 transition of Te4+, intense and multi&#8208;wavelength NIR luminescence originating from the 4f&#8594;4f transitions of Er3+, Nd3+, and Yb3+ was acquired, with a quantum yield of 6.1&#8201;% for the Er3+ emission. These findings provide a general approach to achieve efficient NIR emission in lead&#8208;free metal halides through ns2&#8208;metal and lanthanide ion co&#8208;doping, thereby opening up a new avenue for exploring NIR&#8208;emitting perovskite derivatives towards versatile applications such as NIR&#8208;LEDs and bioimaging.

Through sensitization by the spin-orbital allowed &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; transition of Te&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, intense and multi-wavelength NIR luminescence from Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved upon excitation with a near-ultraviolet light-emitting diode.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-inorganic lead-free perovskite-derivative metal halides have shown great promise in optoelectronics, however, it remains challenging to realize efficient near-infrared (NIR) luminescence in these materials. Herein, we report a novel strategy based on Te&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (Ln=Er, Nd, and Yb) co-doping to achieve efficient NIR luminescence in vacancy-ordered double perovskite Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; phosphors, which are excitable by a low-cost near-ultraviolet light-emitting diode (LED) chip. Through sensitization by the spin-orbital allowed &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; transition of Te&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, intense and multi-wavelength NIR luminescence originating from the 4f&#8594;4f transitions of Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; was acquired, with a quantum yield of 6.1&#8201;% for the Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; emission. These findings provide a general approach to achieve efficient NIR emission in lead-free metal halides through ns&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-metal and lanthanide ion co-doping, thereby opening up a new avenue for exploring NIR-emitting perovskite derivatives towards versatile applications such as NIR-LEDs and bioimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Prodrug Activation by an Affibody&#8208;Ruthenium Catalyst Hybrid for HER2&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An affibody&#8208;ruthenium catalyst hybrid (Ru&#8208;HER2) binds to the HER2 receptor on cancer cells and catalyzes the in situ activation of gemcitabine prodrug, resulting in enhanced anticancer activity via the synergism between the HER2 signaling pathway blockade and gemcitabine&#8208;induced DNA damage. Therefore, the catalytic chemotherapy selectively inhibits the growth of HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells and significantly reduces the side effects to normal cells.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalysts exhibit great potential as therapeutic agents to inhibit tumor growth. However, the precise delivery and in situ catalysis are challenging in catalytic medicine. Herein, we report an anti&#8208;HER2 affibody&#8208;ruthenium catalyst hybrid, named Ru&#8208;HER2 for selective and effective killing of cancer cells. Ru&#8208;HER2 binds to the HER2 receptor on a tumor cell and in situ catalyzes the activation of gemcitabine prodrug, resulting in enhanced selectivity in suppression of tumor growth and reduction of side effects. Immunoblotting reveals that Ru&#8208;HER2 in combination with gemcitabine prodrug can not only induce DNA damage, but also effectively block the HER2 signaling pathway in cancer cells. Therefore, the HER2&#8208;targeted chemotherapy exhibits substantially high anticancer activity toward HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In a word, we report the first affibody&#8208;ruthenium catalyst hybrid and reveal its potential for effective HER2&#8208;targeted cancer chemotherapy.

         <dc:description>
We developed a highly regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselective CuI&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening/B&#8722;H bond insertion reactions between 1&#8208;silylcyclopropenes and borane adducts, which represents the first highly enantioselective carbene insertion reaction of &#945;&#8208;silylcarbenes, and enriches the accesses and type of chiral gem&#8208;bimetallics reagents.







Abstract
Herein, we report the development of a method for highly regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantioselective B&#8722;H bond insertion reactions of &#945;&#8208;silylcarbenes generated from 1&#8208;silylcyclopropenes in the presence of a chiral copper(I)/bisoxazoline catalyst for the construction of chiral &#947;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allylic gem&#8208;silylboranes, which cannot be prepared by any other known methods. This reaction is the first highly enantioselective carbene insertion reaction of &#945;&#8208;silylcarbenes ever to be reported. The method shows general applicability for various 3,3&#8208;disubstituted silylcyclopropenes and exclusively affords E&#8208;products. The novel chiral &#947;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allylic gem&#8208;silylborane products are versatile allylic bimetallic reagents with high stability and have great synthetic potential, especially for the construction of complex molecules with continuous chiral centers.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Oxo Cluster Assisted Fabrication of a Defect&#8208;Rich Ti&#8208;MOF Membrane Showing Versatile Gas&#8208;Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the titanium&#8208;oxo cluster Ti8(&#956;2&#8208;O)8(OOCC6H5)16 as the titanium source, a MIL&#8208;125 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane was prepared under mild reaction conditions through combining single&#8208;mode microwave heating with tertiary growth. Using this titanium source and maintaining a lower reaction temperature increased the missing&#8208;linker number in the MIL&#8208;125 framework and therefore enhanced the CO2/N2 selectivity.







Abstract
Although having shown great promise for efficient gas separation, relevant study of Ti&#8208;MOF membranes remains very scarce, owing to limited Ti source types and uncertain factors which dominate the separation properties. In this work, we pioneered the use of the Ti8(&#956;2&#8208;O)8(OOCC6H5)16 cluster as the Ti source of MIL&#8208;125 membranes, which led to lower reaction temperature and higher missing&#8208;linker number within the framework and therefore, enhanced CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity. The MIL&#8208;125 membrane prepared by combining single&#8208;mode microwave heating with tertiary growth displayed an ideal CO2/N2 selectivity of 38.7, which ranked the highest among all pristine pure MOF membranes measured under comparable conditions. In addition, the ideal H2/N2 and H2/CH4 selectivity was as high as 64.9 and 40.7, thus showing great promise for versatile utility in gas separation.

         <title>Modular Introduction of endo&#8208;Binding Sites in a Macrocyclic Cavity towards Selective Recognition of Neutral Azacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles with functionalized interiors are relatively hard to synthesize. Here, a versatile and modular strategy to customize endo&#8208;binding sites in the macrocycle cavity is reported. This new family of macrocyclic receptors, with diverse binding sites across the inner surface, exhibit well&#8208;defined structures, facile post&#8208; and pre&#8208;modification, and excellent host&#8211;guest recognition.







Abstract
Macrocycles with a functionalized interior, which is a general cavity feature of bioreceptors, are relatively hard to synthesize. Here we report a modular strategy to customize diverse endo&#8208;binding sites in the macrocycle cavity. Only two steps are needed. First, one V&#8208;shaped functional module bearing an embedded binding site and two 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyls as reaction modules are connected. Then the condensation of the resulting monomer and paraformaldehyde directly produces the designed macrocycle. V&#8208;shaped monomers are deliberately used to guarantee the binding sites equatorially directing inward into the cavity and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyls standing axially as macrocycle sidewalls. More than a dozen endo&#8208;functionalized macrocyclic receptors have been constructed. Host&#8211;guest complexation studies show that macrocycle BP1&#8208;decorated interior OH moieties can strongly encapsulate neutral azacycles by forming inner hydrogen bonds, giving a high association constant of 4.59&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in non&#8208;polar media.

         <title>Anion&#8208;guided Stepwise Assembly of High&#8208;nuclearity Lanthanide Hydroxide Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to construct complex molecular architectures with precise control is critical for realizing molecule&#8208;based materials and functions. Using the assembly of a 60&#8208;metal complex of Er(III) with histidine as an example, we demonstrate the rational assembly of otherwise synthetically elusive polynuclear lanthanide hydroxide clusters directed by the combined set of I&#8722; and CO32&#8722; as templates. We succeeded in the stepwise transformation starting from Er12 to Er60 by way of two key intermediates Er34 and Er48. The Er12, Er34, and Er48 core motifs represent respectively 1/6, 1/2, and 3/4 of the complete sodalite cage of Er60. This work, representing a rare example of rationally constructing high&#8208;nuclearity lanthanide clusters guided by judiciously chosen templates, is expected to stimulate more future efforts for the controllable synthesis of complex molecular or supramolecular architectures with unprecedented structural sophistication and possibly useful properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free C&#8208;H Functionalization via Diaryliodonium Salts with a Chemically Robust Dummy Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;step strategy for the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8211;H functionalization of arenes using unsymmetrical iodonium salts as versatile synthetic linchpins is presented. The key to the success of this strategy is the identification of the 3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;isoxazolyl (DMIX) group as a superior dummy ligand, which enables not only site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H functionalization to afford unsymmetrical iodonium salts, but also highly selective aryl transfer during the subsequent metal&#8208;free coupling reaction. Both electron&#8208;rich and moderately electron deficient arenes can be converted into the iodonium salts through C&#8211;H functionalization, allowing for diverse structural elaboration by metal&#8208;free C&#8211;N, C&#8211;C, C&#8211;S, and C&#8211;O coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Driven Highly Selective Catalytic Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Towards Tunable Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the easy over&#8208;oxidation, it is a promising yet challenging task for exploring renewable carbon resources to control the sunlight&#8208;driven selective catalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), producing important chemical feedstocks &#8722; less&#8208;oxidized 2, 5&#8208;diformylfurane (DFF) and 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA). Herein, we have developed a photocatalyst by anchoring Ru complex on CdS quantum dots, which achieves selective oxidation of HMF toward DFF or HMFCA with high conversion (&gt;81%) and selectivity (&gt;90%), based on controllable generation of two oxygen radicals under different atmospheres. Such selective conversion can also work well outside the laboratory by natural sunlight. In particular, the selective production of HMFCA through photocatalytic HMF oxidation is achieved for the first time. More importantly, our photocatalyst is proven applicable for the selective oxidation of other compounds with hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Organic Salts: Diversifying Void Structures and Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic salts (POSs) are porous organic materials, in which various aromatic sulfonic acids and amines are regularly selfassembled by charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. POSs exhibit high solubility in highly polar solvents. Therefore, they are prepared via facile recrystallization and exhibit high recyclability. In this study, tetrahedral&#8208;structured tetrasulfonic acid and triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) were combined to construct POSs with rigid diamond networks called diamondoid porous organic salts (  d  &#8208;POSs) without crystal polymorphism. Furthermore, by introducing substituents (e.g., F, Cl, Br, or I) at the  para  &#8208;positions of benzene rings of TPMA, these substituents were exposed on the void surface of  d  &#8208;POSs, and their diamond networks were distorted. This induced the formation of a variety of void structures and environments in the  d  &#8208;POSs, which significantly affected their gas absorption behavior. In particular, the  d  &#8208;POS from TPMA substituted by fluorine exhibited very high CO  2  adsorption of 182 mL(STP)/g at 1 atm in all&#8208;organic porous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Adatom Bonding Sites in a Nickel&#8208;Fe3O4(001) Single&#8208;Atom Model Catalyst and O2 Reactivity Unveiled by Surface Action Spectroscopy with Infrared Free&#8208;electron Laser Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysis presently receives much attention with its promise to decrease the cost of the active material while increasing the catalyst&#8217;s performance. However, key details such as the exact location of SA species and their stability are often unclear due to a lack of atomic level information. Here, we show how vibrational spectra measured with surface action spectroscopy (SAS) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations can differentiate between different adatom binding sites and determine the location of Ni and Au single atoms on Fe  3  O  4  (001). We reveal that Ni and Au adatoms selectively bind to surface oxygen ions which are octahedrally coordinated to Fe ions. In addition, we find that the Ni adatoms can activate O  2  to superoxide in contrast to the bare surface and Ni in subsurface positions. Overall, we unveil the advantages of combining SAS and DFT for improving the understanding of single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>What is the Smallest Zeolite that Could be Synthesized?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites with a few unit cells are promising as catalyst and adsorbents. The quest to synthesize the smallest zeolites has recently resulted in 4 to 8 nm nanozeolites, about 2 to 4 unit cells. These findings pose the question of what is the smallest zeolite that could be obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. Here we address this question using molecular simulations and thermodynamic analysis. The simulations predict that amorphous precursors as small as 4 nm can crystallize zeolites, in agreement with the experiments. We find that interfacial forces dominate the structure of smaller particles, resulting in size&#8208;dependent compact isomers that have ring and pore distributions different from open framework zeolites. The instability of zeolites smaller than 3 &#177; 0.5 nm precludes a classical mechanism of nucleation from solution or through assembly of small nanoslabs.</dc:description>

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Helical Assemblies based on Tartaric Acid&#8208;derived Acylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we combined the merits of emergent excitation&#8208;dependent (ExD) emission and circularly polarized luminescence to develop an excitation&#8208;dependent circularly polarized luminescence (ExD CPL) material showing unique features. A series of acylhydrazones based on a chiral tartaric skeleton was designed and found to self&#8208;assemble into helical nanostructures through non&#8208;covalent bonds. The helical assemblies showed ExD CPL due to the cooperation of chirality transfer and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Remarkably, not only the emission wavelength could be tuned by excitation wavelength but the handedness of CPL could be modulated in an inverted or ON/OFF manner as well, thus leading to the first example of an ExD inverted or ON/OFF switchable CPL system. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out to explain the inversion of ExD CPL. This work provided a new insight into the unprecedented handedness controllable ExD CPL, which showcased a new paradigm of the advanced CPL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Inorganic Chiral Photonic Crystals Doped with Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral semiconductor nanostructures have received enormous attention due to their emerging properties of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, compared with well&#8208;studied photoluminescence (PL), the reported CPL is much weaker and challenging to be modulated. Herein, we describe a new approach to acquiring the intense and tunable CPL from inorganic chiral photonic crystals (CPCs) doped with semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Unprecedentedly, the sign, position and intensity of CPL peaks can be precisely controlled by manipulating either the photonic bandgap of CPCs or luminescence wavelength of QDs and a giant absolute dissymmetry factor |  g  lum  | up to 0.25 is obtained. More importantly, the origin of CPL modulation is clearly elucidated by both experiment and theory. This work lays the foundation for the construction of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance CPL&#8208;based devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;guest Complexation&#8208;induced Aggregation based on Pyrene&#8208;modified Cyclodextrins for Improved Electronic Circular Dichroism and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  &#160;Several &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives mono&#8208; or di&#8208;substituted&#160;by pyrenes at the primary rim of CD were demonstrated to aggregate&#160;into nano&#8208;strips in aqueous solutions,&#160;with the pyrene moieties interpenetrating into g&#8208;CD&#160;cavities. The hydrophobic complexation&#8208;induced aggregation provides a rigid chiral environment for the pyrenes and leads to significant ECD&#160;and CPL activities, giving unprecedently high  g  abs  &#160;and  g  lum  &#160;values&#160;up to 4.3 &#215; 10  &#8208;2  &#160;and 5.3 &#215; 10  &#8208;  2  , respectively.

         <title>Modular Generation of (Iodinated) Polyarenes Using Triethylgermane as Orthogonal Masking Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complementary modular coupling approach to the widely employed Suzuki coupling is disclosed herein, relying on organogermane&#8208;containing building blocks paired with air&#8208;stable PdI dimer based bond construction, which allows to significantly shorten the reaction times and close gaps in the accessible compound space.







Abstract
While the modular construction of molecules from suitable building blocks is a powerful means to more rapidly generate a diversity of molecules than through customized syntheses, the further evolution of the underlying coupling methodology is key to realize widespread applications. We herein disclose a complementary modular coupling approach to the widely employed Suzuki coupling strategy of boron containing precursors, which relies on organogermane containing building blocks as key orthogonal functionality and an electrophilic (rather than nucleophilic) unmasking event paired with air&#8208;stable PdI dimer based bond construction. This allows to significantly shorten the reaction times for the iterative coupling steps and/or to close gaps in the accessible compound space, enabling straightforward access also to iodinated compounds.

         <title>Distal Ruthenaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Bromination with Aqueous HBr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization has been accomplished, affording the positionally selective bromination product in an undivided cell by the catalysis of readily available RuCl3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O with aqueous HBr as the brominating agent.







Abstract
While electrochemical ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H activations are well established, distal C&#8722;H activations continue to be underdeveloped. In contrast, we herein describe the electrochemical meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization. The remote C&#8722;H bromination was accomplished in an undivided cell by RuCl3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O with aqueous HBr. The electrohalogenation proceeded under exogenous ligand&#8208; and electrolyte&#8208;free conditions. Notably, pyrazolylarenes were meta&#8208;selectively brominated at the benzenoid moiety, rather than on the electron&#8208;rich pyrazole ring for the first time. Mechanistic studies were suggestive of an initial ruthenacycle formation, and a subsequent ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT) process to liberate the brominated product.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Highly Oxidizing Cobalt Molecular Catalyst Designed for Bioinspired Water Oxidation</title>

A stable water&#8208;soluble cobalt(IV) complex supported by a dianionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;diyl)bis(propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) ligand scaffold is very active in the catalysis of water oxidation at an overpotential of only 360&#8197;mV at pH=6.







Abstract
Herein, we present a stable water&#8208;soluble cobalt complex supported by a dianionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;diyl)bis(propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) ligand scaffold, which is a rare example of a high&#8208;oxidation species, as demonstrated by structural, spectroscopic and theoretical data. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that the CoIV center of the mononuclear complex in the solid state resides in the high spin state (sextet, S=5/2). The complex can effectively catalyze water oxidation via a single&#8208;site water nucleophilic attack pathway with an overpotential of only 360&#8197;mV in a phosphate buffer with a pH of 6. The key intermediate toward water oxidation was speculated based on theoretical calculations and was identified by in situ spectroelectrochemical experiments. The results are important regarding the accessibility of high&#8208;oxidation state metal species in synthetic models for achieving robust and reactive oxidation catalysis.

         <title>Shell&#8208;like Xenon Nano&#8208;Traps within Angular Anion&#8208;Pillared Layered Porous Materials for Boosting Xe/Kr Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shell&#8208;like nano traps for xenon were prepared by exploiting the shape and size of tetrahedral MO42&#8722; pillar ligands. This approach gives a high degree of confinement and multiple interactions in close proximity which enhance the affinity towards Xe.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation of xenon (Xe) and krypton (Kr) is a promising technique but remains a daunting challenge since they are atomic gases without dipole or quadruple moments. Herein we report a strategy for fabricating angular anion&#8208;pillared materials featuring shell&#8208;like Xe nano&#8208;traps, which provide a cooperative effect conferred by the pore confinement and multiple specific interactions. The perfect permanent pore channel (4&#8211;5&#8197;&#197;) of Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2MO4 (M=Cr, Mo, W) can host Xe atoms efficiently even at ultra&#8208;low concentration (400&#8197;ppm Xe), showing the second&#8208;highest selectivity of 30.2 in Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2WO4 and excellent Xe adsorption capacity in Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2CrO4 (15.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;kg&#8722;1). Crystallography studies and DFT&#8208;D calculations revealed the energy favorable binding sites and angular anions enable the synergism between optimal pore size and polar porosity for boosting Xe affinity. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrated three MOFs as efficient adsorbents for Xe/Kr separation.

         <title>Highly Stable and Reactive Platinum Single Atoms on Oxygen Plasma&#8208;Functionalized CeO2 Surfaces: Nanostructuring and Peroxo Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;treatment of the ceria (CeO2) surface with oxygen plasma assists the formation of highly dense and stable Pt single atoms resistant to sintering under CO oxidation conditions. The effect is assigned to plasma&#8208;induced oxide nanostructuring and the formation of surface peroxo species which favor single&#8208;atom metal adsorption. This approach can be utilized for the preparation of stable single&#8208;atom catalysts with a high density of active sites.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed precious metals on oxide supports have recently become increasingly interesting catalytic materials. Nonetheless, their non&#8208;trivial preparation and limited thermal and environmental stability constitutes an issue for their potential applications. Here we demonstrate that an oxygen plasma pre&#8208;treatment of the ceria (CeO2) surface serves to anchor Pt single atoms, making them active and resistant towards sintering in the CO oxidation reaction. Through a combination of experimental results obtained on well&#8208;defined CeO2 films and theory, we show that the O2 plasma causes surface nanostructuring and the formation of surface peroxo (O22&#8722;) species, favoring the uniform and dense distribution of isolated strongly bonded Pt2+ atoms. The promotional effect of the plasma treatment was further demonstrated on powder Pt/CeO2 catalysts. We believe that plasma functionalization can be applied to other metal/oxide systems to achieve tunable and stable catalysts with a high density of active sites.

         <title>Non&#8208;binary Encoded Nucleic Acid Barcodes Directly Readable by a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely simple molecular barcoding strategy is proposed based on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic DNA oligomers and direct nanopore decoding. The composition of the barcode probe is highly programmable, and in principle 14n unique step&#8208;shaped barcode patterns can be generated without nanopore sequencing. Different protein and microRNA targets were identified using this strategy, showing its generality in single molecule sensing.







Abstract
A large collection of unique molecular barcodes is useful in the simultaneous sensing or screening of molecular analytes. Though the sequence of DNA has been widely applied to encode for molecular barcodes, decoding of these barcodes is normally assisted by sequencing. We here demonstrate a barcode system based solely on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic nucleic acids and direct nanopore decoding. Each molecular barcode is composed of &#8220;n&#8221; distinct information nodes in a non&#8208;binary manner and can be sequentially scanned and decoded by a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore. Nanopore events containing step&#8208;shaped features were consistently reported. 14 unique information nodes were developed which in principle could encode for 14n unique molecular barcodes in a barcode containing &#8220;n&#8221; information nodes. These barcode probes were adapted to detect different antibody proteins or cancer&#8208;related microRNAs, suggesting their immediate application in a wide variety of sensing applications.

         <title>Disproportionation of Nitric Oxide at a Surface&#8208;Bound Nickel Porphyrinoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel tetraphenyl porphyrins deposited in vacuo on a copper surface are reactive towards nitric oxide disproportionation already at room temperature. The high chemical reactivity of nitrogen oxides species, eventually present in the residual gas background, and of the possible reaction intermediates yields a challenging complexity, where even a small fraction of contamination can change the scenario.







Abstract
Uncommon metal oxidation states in porphyrinoid cofactors are responsible for the activity of many enzymes. The F430 and P450nor co&#8208;factors, with their reduced NiI&#8208; and FeIII&#8208;containing tetrapyrrolic cores, are prototypical examples of biological systems involved in methane formation and in the reduction of nitric oxide, respectively. Herein, using a comprehensive range of experimental and theoretical methods, we raise evidence that nickel tetraphenyl porphyrins deposited in vacuo on a copper surface are reactive towards nitric oxide disproportionation at room temperature. The interpretation of the measurements is far from being straightforward due to the high reactivity of the different nitrogen oxides species (eventually present in the residual gas background) and of the possible reaction intermediates. The picture is detailed in order to disentangle the challenging complexity of the system, where even a small fraction of contamination can change the scenario.

The F&lt;sub&gt;430&lt;/sub&gt; and P450nor co-factors, with their reduced Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;- and Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-containing tetrapyrrolic cores, are prototypical examples of biological systems involved in methane formation and in the reduction of nitric oxide, respectively. Herein, using a comprehensive range of experimental and theoretical methods, we raise evidence that nickel tetraphenyl porphyrins deposited in vacuo on a copper surface are reactive towards nitric oxide disproportionation at room temperature. The interpretation of the measurements is far from being straightforward due to the high reactivity of the different nitrogen oxides species (eventually present in the residual gas background) and of the possible reaction intermediates. The picture is detailed in order to disentangle the challenging complexity of the system, where even a small fraction of contamination can change the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidase&#8208;Type C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H Coupling Using an Isoquinoline&#8208;Derived Organic Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isoquinoline&#8208;derived diaryl ketone&#8208;type photocatalyst was designed and synthesized. This photocatalyst enabled visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with alkanes and aldehydes using air as the sole oxidant. An unconventional mechanism with &#8220;self&#8208;quenching&#8221; to generate an isoquinoline N&#8208;radical cation to trigger hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) is involved, according to time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopic and mass spectrometry studies.







Abstract
Oxidase&#8208;type oxidation is an attractive strategy in organic synthesis due to the use of O2 as the terminal oxidant. Organic photocatalysis can effect metal&#8208;free oxidase chemistry. Nevertheless, current methods are limited in reaction scope, possibly due to the lack of suitable photocatalysts. Here we report an isoquinoline&#8208;derived diaryl ketone&#8208;type photocatalyst, which has much enhanced absorption of blue and visible light compared to conventional diaryl ketones. This photocatalyst enables dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with unactivated and activated alkanes as well as aldehydes using air as the oxidant. A wide range of heterocycles with various functional groups are suitable substrates. Transient absorption and excited&#8208;state quenching experiments point to an unconventional mechanism that involves an excited state &#8220;self&#8208;quenching&#8221; process to generate the N&#8208;radical cation form of the sensitizer, which subsequently abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane substrate to yield a reactive alkyl radical.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Condensation of [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; Metalloligand in Stepwise Assembly of Hexagonal and Rectangular Ag18 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Ag18 nanoclusters with different geometries are isolated by employing the [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; metalloligand. The condensation degree of the metalloligand was strongly dependent on the alcohols. In the absence of alcohols, the [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; can be controllably cyclized to form a wheel&#8208;like [(Mo2O5PTC4A)6]12&#8722; to trap silver ions. In contrast, the similar cyclization reaction is completely blocked in the presence of alcohols.







Abstract
Stepwise assembly starting from a preassembled metalloligand is a promising approach to obtain otherwise unattainable silver nanoclusters, but hard to be intrinsically identified due to the lack of convincing evidence to justify such a process. Herein, hexagonal and rectangular Ag18 nanoclusters are constructed from the [Mo2O5(PTC4A)2]6&#8722; (H4PTC4A=p&#8208;phenyl&#8208;thiacalix[4]arene) metalloligand through stepwise assembly. The formation of the metalloligand is confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, then assembled with silver ions to form two geometrically different Ag18 nanoclusters in different solvents. The cyclization from the metalloligand to [(Mo2O5PTC4A)6]12&#8722; can be realized without alcohols and otherwise blocked by them. The installation of this metalloligand not only provides comprehensive understanding of how the solvents regulate the silver nanocluster structures, but also brings new insights for the controllable ligand metallization and subsequent condensation.

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208;, and Enantioselective Decarboxylative Hydroaminoalkylation of Dienol Ethers Enabled by Dual Palladium/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel decarboxylative hydroaminoalkylation (HAA) reaction of N&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;amino acids with dienol ethers enabled by a photoredox/palladium dual catalytic system is presented. With the developed method, a broad variety of substrates was deployed to deliver vicinal amino tertiary ethers in good to excellent yields with excellent diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that this transformation proceeds through a reversible hydropalladation of 1,3&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
Intermolecular photocatalytic hydroaminoalkylation (HAA) of alkenes have emerged as a powerful method for the construction of alkyl amines. Although there are some studies aiming at stereoselective photocatalytic HAA reactions, the alkenes are limited to electrophilic alkenes. Herein, we report a highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective HAA of electron&#8208;rich dienol ethers and &#945;&#8208;amino radicals derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids using a unified photoredox and palladium catalytic system. This decarboxylative 1,2&#8208;Markovnikov addition enables the construction of vicinal amino tertiary ethers with high levels of regio&#8208; (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 rr), diastereo&#8208; (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), and enantioselectivity control (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies support a reversible hydropalladation as a key step.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylindoles via Atroposelective Cyclization of Ynamides Catalyzed by Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective cyclization of ynamides is disclosed, which represents the first metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of axially chiral compounds from ynamides. This method enables the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable N&#8208;arylindoles in excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
In recent years, asymmetric catalysis of ynamides has attracted much attention, but these reactions mostly constructed central chirality, except for a few examples on the synthesis of axially chiral compounds which exclusively relied on noble&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, a facile access to axially chiral N&#8208;heterocycles enabled by chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of ynamides is disclosed, which represents the first metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of axially chiral compounds from ynamides. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable N&#8208;arylindoles in excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, organocatalysts and ligands based on such axially chiral N&#8208;arylindole skeletons are demonstrated to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Rhodaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed peri&#8208;Selective Direct Alkenylations with Weak O&#8208;Coordination Enabled by the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed electrooxidative alkenylation of oxidation&#8208;sensitive 1&#8208;naphthols as well as 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;hydroxyquinolines has been developed. It employs readily available starting materials, and the C&#8722;C bond formation proceeds with high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity, with molecular H2 as the only stoichiometric waste product.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H functionalizations by electrocatalysis is dominated by strongly coordinating N(sp2)&#8208;directing groups. In sharp contrast, direct electrocatalytic transformations of weakly&#8208;coordinating phenols remain underdeveloped. Herein, electrooxidative peri C&#8722;H alkenylations of challenging 1&#8208;naphthols were achieved by versatile rhodium(III) catalysis via user&#8208;friendly constant current electrolysis. The rhodaelectrocatalysis employed readily&#8208;available alkenes and a protic reaction medium and features ample scope, good functional group tolerance and high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The strategy was successfully applied to high&#8208;value, nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, thereby providing direct access to uncommon heterocyclic motifs based on the dihydropyranoquinoline skeleton.

         <title>Ratiometric and Colorimetric Optical Thermometers Using Emissive Dimeric and Trimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}n Moieties Generated in d&#8211;f Heterometallic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The {[AuI(SCN)2]&#8722;}2 and {[AuI(SCN)2]&#8722;}3 ions were incorporated in two different supramolecular matrices with GdIII and YIII. The resulting materials exhibit characteristic Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au vibrational peaks investigated by ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The formation of Au2 and Au3 moieties yields strong photoluminescence with rich color tunability, providing high&#8208;performance colorimetric and ratiometric thermometer abilities.







Abstract
Gold complexes can generate excimers ([Au2]&#8594;[Au2]*) and exciplexes ([Au3]&#8594;[Au3]*) with light excitation. Four GdIII and YIII complexes were assembled with dimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}2 and trimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}3 bis(thiocyanato)gold(I) counterions. The vibrational signature associated with the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au vibrational mode was probed with ultralow frequency (ULF) Raman spectroscopy as a function of temperature. Emission spectroscopy was used to explore photophysical properties. Two broad features in the high&#8208; and low&#8208;energy regions were associated with the fluorescence and phosphorescence of the gold entities, respectively. Temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence measurements showed that the emission color can be tuned from blue to green via cyan and white. Hence, these complexes can act as colorimetric thermometers. Additionally, a ratiometric thermal sensing ability was incorporated with high sensitivity up to 5&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 in the cryogenic temperature range.

         <title>Tuning the Elasticity of Nanogels Improves Their Circulation Time by Evading Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small changes in the elasticity of the inherently soft radiolabeled nanogels show major differences in its in vivo circulation half&#8208;life. Longer circulation life renders a higher possibility for nanogels to accumulate in the tumor microenvironment by enhanced permeation and retention effect.







Abstract
Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is used to treat solid tumors by locally delivering radiation. However, due to nephro&#8208; and hepato&#8208;toxicity, it is limited by its dosage. To amplify radiation damage to tumor cells, radiolabeled nanogels can be used. We show that by tuning the mechanical properties of nanogels significant enhancement in circulation half&#8208;life of the gel could be achieved. We demonstrate why and how small changes in the mechanical properties of the nanogels influence its cellular fate. Nanogels with a storage modulus of 37&#8197;kPa were minimally phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages compared to nanogels with 93&#8197;kPa modulus. Using PET/CT a significant difference in the blood circulation time of the nanogels was shown. Computer simulations affirmed the results and predicted the mechanism of cellular uptake of the nanogels. Altogether, this work emphasizes the important role of elasticity even for particles that are inherently soft such as nano&#8208; or microgels.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor Anodes for Ultrastable and Site&#8208;Selective Upconversion Photoinduced Electrochemiluminescence</title>

n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Pt and n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (up to 35&#8197;h) for the generation of intense anti&#8208;Stokes photoinduced electrochemiluminescence onto the whole surface of the metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) photoanode or at a specifically&#8208;chosen location. These results provide solutions for overcoming the instability that has hampered the practical application of upconversion photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL).







Abstract
Photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL) allows the electrochemically assisted conversion of low&#8208;energy photons into high&#8208;energy photons at an electrode surface. This concept is expected to have important implications, however, it is dramatically limited by the stability of the surface, impeding future developments. Here, a series of metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) junctions, using photoactive n&#8208;type Si (n&#8208;Si) as a light absorber covered by a few&#8208;nanometer&#8208;thick protective SiOx/metal (SiOx/M, with M=Ru, Pt, and Ir) overlayers are investigated for upconversion PECL of the model co&#8208;reactant system involving the simultaneous oxidation of tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) and tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. We show that n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Pt and n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (35&#8197;h for n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir) for the generation of intense PECL with an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 218&#8197;nm. We also demonstrate that these surfaces can be employed for spatially localized PECL. These unprecedented performances are extremely promising for future applications of PECL.

         <title>A New Platform of B/N&#8208;Doped Cyclophanes: Access to a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Block&#8208;Type B3N3 Macrocycle with Strong Dipole Moment and Unique Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual block&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycle MC&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 that shows a strong dipole moment and a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap is introduced. Compared with other cyclic hexamers, its unique orientation of electron&#8208;donor block and acceptor block resulted in largely red&#8208;shifted orange emission both in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
We herein describe a new design principle to achieve B/N&#8208;doped cyclophane where an electron&#8208;donor block of three triarylamines (Ar3N) and an acceptor block of three triarylboranes (Ar3B) are spatially separated on opposite sides of the &#960;&#8208;extended ring system. DFT computations revealed the distinct electronic structure of the block&#8208;type macrocycle MC&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 with a greatly enhanced dipole moment and reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap in comparison to its analogue with alternating B and N sites, MC&#8208;alt&#8208;B3N3. The unique arrangement of borane acceptor Ar3B and amine donor Ar3N components in MC&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 induces exceptionally strong intramolecular charge transfer in the excited state, which is reflected in a largely red&#8208;shifted luminescence at 612&#8197;nm in solution. The respective linear open&#8208;chain oligomer L&#8208;b&#8208;B3N3 was also synthesized for comparison. Our new approach to donor&#8211;acceptor macrocycles offers important fundamental insights and opens up a new avenue to unique optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Structural Basis for the Prenylation Reaction of Carbazole&#8208;Containing Natural Products Catalyzed by Squalene Synthase&#8208;Like Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole prenyltransferase was found to combine the overall structure of squalene synthase and the elegant stacking interaction between prenyl diphosphate and aromatic compounds observed in the aromatic substrate prenyltransferase. Structural and mutational analyses revealed the binding and deprotonation mechanisms of the carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone moiety of the prenyl acceptor.







Abstract
Some enzymes annotated as squalene synthase catalyze the prenylation of carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone&#8208;containing substrates in bacterial secondary metabolism. Their reaction mechanisms remain unclear because of their low sequence similarity to well&#8208;characterized aromatic substrate prenyltransferases (PTs). We determined the crystal structures of the carbazole PTs, and these revealed that the overall structure is well superposed on those of squalene synthases. In contrast, the stacking interaction between the prenyl donor and acceptor substrates resembles those observed in aromatic substrate PTs. Structural and mutational analyses suggest that the Ile and Asp residues are essential for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with the carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone moiety of the prenyl acceptor, respectively, and a deprotonation mechanism of an intermediary &#963;&#8208;complex involving a catalytic triad is proposed. Our results provide a structural basis for a new subclass of aromatic substrate PTs.

         <title>Reversible Three&#8208;Color Fluorescence Switching of an Organic Molecule in the Solid State via &#8220;Pump&#8211;Trigger&#8221; Optical Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and programmable triple fluorescence switching in the solid state was demonstrated through an alternative &#8220;Pump&#8211;Trigger&#8221; optical manipulation strategy employing a spiropyran&#8208;functionalized distyrylanthracene derivative. The unique switching ability enabled innovative multicolor, tunable, switching cell imaging and two&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging in a single&#8208;molecule system.







Abstract
In photoswitches that undergo fluorescence switching upon ultraviolet irradiation, photoluminescence and photoisomerization often occur simultaneously, leading to unstable fluorescence properties. Here, we successfully demonstrated reversible solid&#8208;state triple fluorescence switching through &#8220;Pump&#8211;Trigger&#8221; multiphoton manipulation. A novel fluorescence photoswitch, BOSA&#8208;SP, achieved green, yellow, and red fluorescence under excitation by pump light and isomerization induced by trigger light. The energy ranges of photoexcitation and photoisomerization did not overlap, enabling appropriate selection of the multiphoton light for &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; photoswitching, respectively. Additionally, the large free volume of the spiropyran (SP) moiety in the solid state promoted reversible photoisomerization. Switching between &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; light is useful for three&#8208;color tunable switching cell imaging, which can be exploited in programmable fluorescence switching. Furthermore, we exploited reversible dual&#8208;fluorescence switching in a single molecular system to successfully achieve two&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging.

         <title>A Heterogeneous Palladium Catalyst for the Polymerization of Olefins Prepared by Halide Abstraction Using Surface R3Si+ Species</title>

A silylium&#8208;like ion supported on silica ionizes a Pd&#8722;Cl complex by chloride abstraction to generate a very active catalyst for (co&#8208;)polymerization reactions.







Abstract
The silylium&#8208;like surface species [iPr3Si][(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)] activates (N^N)Pd(CH3)Cl (N^N=Ar&#8722;N=CMeMeC=N&#8722;Ar, Ar=2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzene) by chloride ion abstraction to form [(N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3][(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)] (1). A combination of FTIR, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and reactions with CO or vinyl chloride establish that 1 shows similar reactivity patterns as (N^N)Pd(CH3)Cl activated with Na[B(ArF)4]. Multinuclear 13C{27Al} RESPDOR and 1H{19F} S&#8208;REDOR experiments are consistent with a weakly coordinated ion&#8208;pair between (N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3+ and [(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)]. 1 catalyzes the polymerization of ethylene with similar activities as [(N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3]+ in solution and incorporates up to 0.4&#8201;% methyl acrylate in copolymerization reactions. 1 produces polymers with significantly higher molecular weight than the solution catalyst, and generates the highest molecular weight polymers currently reported in copolymerization reactions of ethylene and methylacrylate.

         <title>Cofactor&#8208;Driven Cascade Reactions Enable the Efficient Preparation of Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex de novo biosynthesis of sugar nucleotides was reorganized as cascade reactions. The cascade reactions were driven toward the formation of the target sugar nucleotides through the addition of an excess amount of a cofactor provided by a cofactor regeneration system, thus resulting in high synthetic yields.







Abstract
Glycosylation is catalyzed by glycosyltransferases using sugar nucleotides or occasionally lipid&#8208;linked phosphosugars as donors. However, only very few common sugar nucleotides that occur in humans can be obtained readily, while the majority of sugar nucleotides that exist in bacteria, plants, archaea, or viruses cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by either enzymatic or chemical synthesis. The limited availability of such rare sugar nucleotides is one of the major obstacles that has greatly hampered progress in glycoscience. Herein we describe a general cofactor&#8208;driven cascade conversion strategy for the efficient synthesis of sugar nucleotides. The described strategy allows the large&#8208;scale preparation of rare sugar nucleotides from common sugars in high yields and without the need for tedious purification processes.

&lt;p&gt;The complex &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthesis of sugar nucleotides was reorganized as cascade reactions. The cascade reactions were driven toward the formation of the target sugar nucleotides through the addition of an excess amount of a cofactor provided by a cofactor regeneration system, thus resulting in high synthetic yields.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Substitution of Methyl Azaarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution of a variety of methyl azaarenes, including (benzo)thiazole, oxazole, benzoimidazole, pyridine, and (iso)quinoline, is described. The corresponding chiral azaarene derivatives are afforded in good yields with high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Herein, an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reaction of methyl azaarenes is described. Azaarenes such as (benzo)thiazole, oxazole, benzoimidazole, pyridine, and (iso)quinoline are all tolerated. The corresponding chiral azaarene derivatives are obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). The utilization of the Knochel reagent TMPZnBr&#8901;LiBr warrants the in situ formation of benzylic nucleophiles without additional activating reagents. 1H&#8197;NMR studies suggested a two&#8208;fold function of the Knochel reagent in this reaction. The synthetic utility of this method has been showcased by a concise enantioselective synthesis of an allosteric protein kinase modulator.

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyoligosaccharides Enabled by Stereoselective Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast photoglycosylation is reported that proceeds through a bromide&#8208;based hydrogen species and electron transfer process. The value of this protocol was well demonstrated by the iterative synthesis of oligosaccharides on a gram scale as well as digoxin and a 20&#8208;mer deoxyglycan in good yields and with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The photoinitiated intramolecular hydroetherification of alkenols has been used to form C&#8722;O bonds, but the intermolecular hydroetherification of alkenes with alcohols remains an unsolved challenge. We herein report the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted 2&#8208;deoxyglycosylation of alcohols with glycals. The glycosylation reaction was completed within 2&#8197;min in a high quantum yield (&#981;=28.6). This method was suitable for a wide array of substrates and displayed good reaction yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The value of this protocol was further demonstrated by the iterative synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxyglycans with &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosidic linkages up to a 20&#8208;mer in length and digoxin with &#946;&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosidic linkages. Mechanistic studies indicated that this reaction involved a glycosyl radical cation intermediate and a photoinitiated chain process.

         <title>Spatially Resolved, Error&#8208;Robust Multiplexed MicroRNA Profiling in Single Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore&#8208;encoded error&#8208;corrected label (FluoEL) for multiplexed microRNA imaging in living cells is developed. Proportionally encoded Cy3 and Cy5 overcome the limitation of spectral overlap. The core&#8211;shell mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) structure avoids FRET between the recognition component of the molecular beacon (MB) and the barcoding dye to provide high accuracy.







Abstract
Simultaneous imaging of multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) in individual living cells is challenging due to the lack of spectrally distinct encoded fluorophores and non&#8208;cytotoxic methods. We describe a multiplexed error&#8208;robust combinatorial fluorescent label&#8208;encoding method, termed fluorophores encoded error&#8208;corrected labels (FluoELs), enabling multiplexed miRNA imaging in living cells with error&#8208;correcting capability. The FluoELs comprise proportional dual fluorophores for encoding and a constant quantitative single fluorophore for error&#8208;corrected quantification. Both are embedded in 260&#8197;nm core&#8211;shell silica nanoparticles modified with molecular beacon detection probes. The FluoELs are low cytotoxic and could accurately quantify and spatially resolve nine breast&#8208;cancer&#8208;related miRNAs and evaluate their coordination. The FluoELs enabled a single&#8208;cell analysis platform to evaluate miRNA expression profiles and the molecular mechanisms underlying miRNA&#8208;associated diseases.

         <dc:description>
Artificial systems that mimic aspects of natural light&#8208;harvesting functions are fascinating and attractive for materials design. Given the complexity of such a system, a simple design pathway is desirable. Associative phase separation of oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can provide such a path in an environmentally benign medium: water. Complexation between an exciton&#8211;donor and acceptor CPE leads to formation of a complex fluid in which energy transfer is highly efficient.







Abstract
The ability to assemble artificial systems that mimic aspects of natural light&#8208;harvesting functions is fascinating and attractive for materials design. Given the complexity of such a system, a simple design pathway is desirable. Here, we argue that associative phase separation of oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can provide such a path in an environmentally benign medium: water. We find that complexation between an exciton&#8211;donor and acceptor CPE leads to formation of a complex fluid. We interrogate exciton transfer from the donor to the acceptor CPE within the complex fluid and find that transfer is highly efficient. We also find that excess molecular ions can tune the modulus of the inter&#8208;CPE complex fluid. Even at high ion concentrations, CPEs remain complexed with significantly delocalized electronic wavefunctions. Our work lays the rational foundation for complex, tunable aqueous light&#8208;harvesting systems via the intrinsic thermodynamics of associative phase separation.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Reduction with NIR Light of Nucleus&#8208;Targeting PtIV Nanoparticles for Combined Tumor&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy and Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The example of PtIV nanoparticles that could be excited within the NIR region at 808&#8197;nm is reported. The complex was functionalized with a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy and nucleus/cancer&#8208;targeting peptides which self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles. Upon irradiation, the PtIV center is reduced to PtII, presenting a multimodal treatment by chemotherapy and photodynamic immunotherapy.







Abstract
The development of PtIV prodrugs which are selectively reduced within cancerous cells into their PtII therapeutically active species has received increasing attention within the last decade. Despite recent research progress, the majority of investigated compounds are excited using ultraviolet or blue light. As the light penetration depth is low at these wavelengths, the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors is limited. To overcome this limitation, herein, the example of PtIV&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles that could be excited within the NIR region at 808&#8197;nm is reported. The polymer backbone which can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles was functionalized with PtIV complexes for chemotherapy, photosensitizers for photodynamic immunotherapy, and nucleus/cancer&#8208;targeting peptides. Upon irradiation, the PtIV center is reduced to PtII and the axially coordinated ligands are released, presenting a multimodal treatment. While selectively accumulating in tumorous tissue, the nanoparticles demonstrated the ability to eradicate a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer tumor inside a mouse model.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; prodrugs which are selectively reduced within cancerous cells into their Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; therapeutically active species has received increasing attention within the last decade. Despite recent research progress, the majority of investigated compounds are excited using ultraviolet or blue light. As the light penetration depth is low at these wavelengths, the treatment of deep-seated or large tumors is limited. To overcome this limitation, herein, the example of Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;-functionalized nanoparticles that could be excited within the NIR region at 808&#8197;nm is reported.

         <title>Boosted Inner Surface Charge Transfer in Perovskite Nanodots@Mesoporous Titania Frameworks for Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites (Cs3Bi2Br9, Cs2AgBiBr6) are grown in situ in a mesoporous titania framework for efficient CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A benchmarked production rate of CH4 (32.9 and 24.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) is achieved with selectivity values of 88.7&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;%, respectively. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectronic spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy reveal that the inner surface built&#8208;in electric field between the perovskite nanodots and mesoporous titania channels can efficiently promote photo&#8208;induced charge transfer.







Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;efficiency and stable halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to methane is a challenge because of the intrinsic photo&#8208; and chemical instability of halide perovskites. In this study, halide perovskites (Cs3Bi2Br9 and Cs2AgBiBr6) were grown in situ in mesoporous TiO2 frameworks for an efficient CO2 reduction. Benchmarked CH4 production rates of 32.9 and 24.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with selectivities of 88.7&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;%, were achieved, respectively, which are better than most reported halide perovskite photocatalysts. Focused ion&#8208;beam sliced&#8208;imaging techniques were used to directly image the hyperdispersed perovskite nanodots confined in mesopores with tunable sizes ranging from 3.8 to 9.9&#8197;nm. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectronic spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy showed that the built&#8208;in electric field between the perovskite nanodots and mesoporous titania channels efficiently promoted photo&#8208;induced charge transfer. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the high methane selectivity was attributed to the Bi&#8208;adsorption&#8208;mediated hydrogenation of *CO to *HCO that dominates CO desorption.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Tunable Chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine Ligands: Application to the Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Arylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine scaffold SBpy was rationally designed and enabled a general and highly enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl halides to aldehydes. This approach is more step&#8208;economic than conventional strategies and allowed the preparation of various diaryl carbinols without the need to use preformed metallic reagents.







Abstract
A new class of chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligands, SBpy, featuring minimized short&#8208;range steric hindrance and structural tunability was rationally designed and developed, and the effectiveness was demonstrated in the first highly enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl halides to aldehydes. In comparison with known approaches using preformed aryl metallic reagents, this reaction is more step&#8208;economical and functional group tolerant. The reaction mechanism and a model of stereocontrol were proposed based on experimental and computational results.

         <title>Widefield SERS for High&#8208;Throughput Nanoparticle Screening</title>

         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;scale SERS particle screening is a multiplexed widefield screening approach for particle characterization. The method is 500&#8211;1000&#8197;times faster than typical confocal Raman implementations and simultaneously measures SERS and particle size.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging is a powerful technology with unprecedent potential for ultrasensitive chemical analysis. Point&#8208;by&#8208;point scanning and often excessively long spectral acquisition&#8208;times hamper the broad exploitation of the full analytical potential of SERS. Here, we introduce large&#8208;scale SERS particle screening (LSSPS), a multiplexed widefield screening approach to particle characterization, which is 500&#8211;1000&#8197;times faster than typical confocal Raman implementations. Beyond its higher throughput, LSSPS simultaneously quantifies both the sample's Raman and Rayleigh scattering to directly quantify the fraction of SERS&#8208;active particles which allows for an unprecedented correlation of SERS activity with particle size. .

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Following Repetitive Stimulation Reveals a Mechanism for Plasticity Changes with Iron Deficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron deficiency&#8208;induced neurochemical changes are linked to cognitive impairment. Alteration in plasticity is observed as a decrease in fractional release during repetitive stimulation and iron deficiency. This alteration in fractional release is likely to be one of the mechanisms that underlie the negative impact of iron deficiency on plasticity, and the long&#8208;term deficits in learning and memory.







Abstract
Deficiency of iron, the most abundant transition metal in the brain and important for neuronal activity, is known to affect synaptic plasticity, causing learning and memory deficits. How iron deficiency impacts plasticity by altering neurotransmission at the cellular level is not fully understood. We used electrochemical methods to study the effect of iron deficiency on plasticity with repetitive stimulation. We show that during iron deficiency, repetitive stimulation causes significant decrease in exocytotic release without changing vesicular content. This results in a lower fraction of release, opposite to the control group, upon repetitive stimulation. These changes were partially reversible by iron repletion. This finding suggests that iron deficiency has a negative effect on plasticity by decreasing the fraction of vesicular release in response to repetitive stimulation. This provides a putative mechanism for how iron deficiency modulates plasticity.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 3H&#8208;Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
General and efficient asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of 3H&#8208;indoles has been realized using a well&#8208;defined chiral pincer manganese catalyst, with up to 99&#8201;% ee and a record TON of 72&#8201;350 in an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;catalyzed AH reaction.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of 3H&#8208;indoles represents an ideal approach to the synthesis of useful chiral indoline scaffolds. However, very few catalytic systems based on precious metals have been developed to realize this challenging reaction. Herein, we report a Mn&#8208;catalyzed AH of 3H&#8208;indoles with excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The kinetic resolution of racemic 3H&#8208;indoles by AH was also achieved with high s&#8208;factors to construct quaternary stereocenters. Many acid&#8208;sensitive functional groups, which cannot be tolerated when using a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ruthenium catalyst, were compatible with manganese catalysis. This new process expands the scope of this transformation and highlights the uniqueness of earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis. The reaction could proceed with catalyst loadings at the parts per million (ppm) level with an exceptional turnover number of 72&#8201;350. This is the highest value yet reported for an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;catalyzed AH reaction.

         <title>Modification of Nitrate Ion Enables Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of NO3&#8722; is achieved by connecting NO3&#8722; to an ether&#8208;based moiety. The broken resonance structure of &#8722;NO3 improves its reducibility compared with NO3&#8722;. The decomposition of &#8722;NO3 forms a LiNxOy&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and induces uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
The lifespan of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is hindered by heterogeneous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The rational design of electrolytes is strongly considered to obtain uniform SEI in working batteries. Herein, a modification of nitrate ion (NO3&#8722;) is proposed and validated to improve the homogeneity of the SEI in practical LMBs. NO3&#8722; is connected to an ether&#8208;based moiety to form isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) to break the resonance structure of NO3&#8722; and improve the reducibility. The decomposition of non&#8208;resonant &#8722;NO3 in ISDN enriches SEI with abundant LiNxOy and induces uniform lithium deposition. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with ISDN additives deliver a capacity retention of 83.7&#8201;% for 100 cycles compared with rapid decay with LiNO3 after 55 cycles. Moreover, lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with ISDN additives provide a specific energy of 319&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and undergo 20 cycles. This work provides a realistic reference in designing additives to modify the SEI for stabilizing LMBs.

         <title>A Symmetry&#8208;Based Kinematic Theory for Nanocrystal Morphology Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT) based on classical growth theories to illustrate shape evolution is proposed. Based on the crystal lattice, nucleus symmetry, and the preferential growth directions under the experimental conditions, the SBKT can illustrate the growth trajectories of NPs. The theory accommodates the conventional theories for crystal growth and provides tools to better understand the symmetry&#8208;breaking.







Abstract
The growth of crystalline nanoparticles (NPs) generally involves three processes: nucleation, growth, and shape evolution. Among them, the shape evolution is less understood, despite the importance of morphology for NP properties. Here, we propose a symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT) based on classical growth theories to illustrate the process. Based on the crystal lattice, nucleus (or seed) symmetry, and the preferential growth directions under the experimental conditions, the SBKT can illustrate the growth trajectories. The theory accommodates the conventional criteria of the major existing theories for crystal growth and provides tools to better understand the symmetry&#8208;breaking process during the growth of anisotropic structures. Furthermore, complex dendritic growth is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. Thus, it provides a framework to explain the shape evolution, and extends the morphogenesis prediction to cases, which cannot be treated by other theories.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Fluorescent Monitoring of Kinetically Controlled Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Atom&#8208;Precise Cu8 Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the scheme of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), optical&#8208;engineering was performed for real&#8208;time monitoring of the self&#8208;assembly process of Cu8a with various kinetic long&#8208;lived intermediates, leading to a structure&#8211;property relationship being established.







Abstract
Kinetically stable and long&#8208;lived intermediates are crucial in monitoring the progress and understanding of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of diverse aggregated structures with collective functions. Herein, the complex dynamics of an atomically precise CuI nanocluster [Cu8(tBuC6H4S)8(PPh3)4] (Cu8a) is systematically investigated. Remarkably, by monitoring the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and electron microscopy of the kinetically stable intermediates in real time, the directed self&#8208;assembly (DSA) process of Cu8a is deduced. The polymorphism and different emission properties of Cu NCs aggregates were successfully captured, allowing the structure&#8211;optical property relationship to be established. More importantly, the utilization of a mathematical &#8220;permutation and combination&#8221; ideology by introducing a heterogeneous luminescent agent of a carbon dot (CD) to Cu8a aggregates enriches the &#8220;visualization&#8221; fluorescence window, which offers great potential in real time application for optical sensing of materials.

         <title>Back Cover: Cofactor&#8208;Driven Cascade Reactions Enable the Efficient Preparation of Sugar Nucleotides (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 20/2022)</title>

Sugar nucleotides are essential glycosylation donors in carbohydrate metabolism. In their Research Article (e202115696), Liuqing Wen and co&#8208;workers developed a general strategy for the efficient preparation of rare sugar nucleotides. Complex de&#8197;novo biosynthesis of rare sugar nucleotides was recognized as cascade reactions. The cascade reactions were driven toward the formation of the target sugar nucleotides through a cofactor regeneration system (CRS), thus resulting in clean conversion.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Tuning the Elasticity of Nanogels Improves Their Circulation Time by Evading Immune Cells (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 20/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
Mechanical properties of nanogels influence their cellular fate. Inspired by the natural ability of the cells to sense stiffness, Smriti Singh et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202116653) developed highly hydrophilic soft nanogels and show that the passive engulfment of the soft nanogels by the immune cells was drastically reduced compared to the stiffer counterpart. The delayed uptake resulted in an enhanced circulation time of the nanogels, an important criterion for drug delivery applications.

         <dc:description>
A series of sulfur species prodrugs (reactive sulfur species in a capsule) that can release pure hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and hydrogen persulfide (H2S2) was used by Bowen Ke et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202201668) to compare the pharmacological differences between sulfide and persulfide. The H2S2 prodrug exhibits increased activities and reduced toxicity as compared to the H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We focus on the field at the junction of inkjet printing and high&#8208;tech applications in optoelectronics, energy production and storage, and (bio)detection. We assess the micro&#8208; and nanostructuring inkjet printing methods and answer the following questions: What are the current strategies to improve the resolution of printed patterns? To what extent can advances in nanochemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and surface chemistry be integrated into printing strategies?







Abstract
Driven by the development of new functional inks, inkjet&#8208;printed electronics has achieved several milestones upon moving from the integration of simple electronic elements (e.g., temperature and pressure sensors, RFID antennas, etc.) to high&#8208;tech applications (e.g. in optoelectronics, energy storage and harvesting, medical diagnosis). Currently, inkjet printing techniques are limited by spatial resolution higher than several micrometers, which sets a redhibitorythreshold for miniaturization and for many applications that require the controlled organization of constituents at the nanometer scale. In this Review, we present the physico&#8208;chemical concepts and the equipment constraints underpinning the resolution limit of inkjet printing and describe the contributions from molecular, supramolecular, and nanomaterials&#8208;based approaches for their circumvention. Based on these considerations, we propose future trajectories for improving inkjet&#8208;printing resolution that will be driven and supported by breakthroughs coming from chemistry. Please check all text carefully as extensive language polishing was necessary. Title ok? Yes

         <title>Electrochemical Cage Activation of Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite a renaissance in the activation of carborane cages in the past decades, oxidative cage functionalizations generally require stoichiometric amounts of toxic chemical oxidants. In contrast, electrochemical functionalizations enable resource&#8208;economical cage activation.







Abstract
Carboranes are boron&#8211;carbon molecular clusters that possess unique properties, such as their icosahedron geometry, high boron content, and delocalized three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity. These features render carboranes valuable building blocks for applications in supramolecular design, nanomaterials, optoelectronics, organometallic coordination chemistry, and as boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) agents. Despite tremendous progress in this field, stoichiometric chemical redox reagents are largely required for the oxidative activation of carborane cages. In this context, electrosyntheses represent an alternative strategy for more sustainable molecular syntheses. It is only in recent few years that considerable progress has been made in electrochemical cage functionalization of carboranes, which are summarized in this Minireview. We anticipate that electrocatalysis will serve as an increasingly powerful stimulus within the current renaissance of carborane electrochemistry.

Selective reactions that combine H2, CO and organic electrophiles (aldehyde, ketones, isocyanide) to form hydrogenated C3 and C4 carbon chains are reported.







Abstract
Selective reactions that combine H2, CO and organic electrophiles (aldehyde, ketones, isocyanide) to form hydrogenated C3 and C4 carbon chains are reported. These reactions proceed by CO homologation mediated by [W(CO)6] and an aluminum(I) reductant, followed by functionalization and hydrogenation of the chain ends. A combination of kinetics (rates, KIEs) and DFT calculations has been used to gain insight into a key step which involves hydrogenation of a metallocarbene intermediate. These findings expand the extremely small scope of systems that combine H2 and CO to make well&#8208;defined products with complete control over chain length and functionality.

         <title>Microsecond Backbone Motions Modulate the Oligomerization of the DNAJB6 Chaperone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chaperone self&#8208;oligomerization that competes with substrate assembly is an important aspect of anti&#8208;aggregation chaperones that remains poorly understood. Using the J domain chaperone DNAJB6, how the Parkinson's related T193A mutation affects chaperone oligomerization has been explored. The C&#8208;terminal domain of DNAJB6b exhibits significant microsecond dynamics that are enhanced in the T193A mutant, leading to a monomeric partially&#8208;folded state.







Abstract
DNAJB6 is a prime example of an anti&#8208;aggregation chaperone that functions as an oligomer. DNAJB6 oligomers are dynamic and subunit exchange is critical for inhibiting client protein aggregation. The T193A mutation in the C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of DNAJB6 reduces both chaperone self&#8208;oligomerization and anti&#8208;aggregation of client proteins, and has recently been linked to Parkinson's disease. Here, we show by NMR, including relaxation&#8208;based methods, that the T193A mutation has minimal effects on the structure of the &#946;&#8208;stranded CTD but increases the population and rate of formation of a partially folded state. The results can be rationalized in terms of &#946;&#8208;strand peptide plane flips that occur on a timescale of &#8776;100&#8197;&#956;s and lead to global changes in the overall pleat/flatness of the CTD, thereby altering its ability to oligomerize. These findings help forge a link between chaperone dynamics, oligomerization and anti&#8208;aggregation activity which may possibly lead to new therapeutic avenues tuned to target specific substrates.

         <title>Leveraging Electron&#8208;Deficient Iminium Intermediates in a General Synthesis of Valuable Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of aminals as precursors for iminium ions has been limited to methylene derivatives, thus hampering its broader use. By employing electron&#8208;deficient iminium ions an obvious hurdle of the methodology is overcome, whilst generating highly desirable motifs. This broad concept is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage amination of quinine into a biologically interesting new analogue.







Abstract
The development of reactions converting alkenes and alkynes into valuable building blocks remains one of the main goals of synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present the leveraging of highly electron&#8208;deficient iminium ions, rare and fleeting intermediates, into a general amine synthesis. This enables the preparation of amines bearing e.g. valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl moieties under mild conditions. This broad concept is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage amination of quinine into a biologically interesting new analogue.

         <title>A Nanopore Sensing Assay Resolves Cascade Reactions in a Multienzyme System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanopore sensing assay is developed to resolve cascade reactions of an artificial three&#8208;enzyme system. In a confined environment such as liposomes, substrate&#8208;channelling effects are observed between two sets of the three enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymatic cascade reactions are widely used to synthesize complex molecules from simple precursors. The major underlying mechanism of cascade reactions is substrate channelling, where intermediates of different enzymatic steps are not in equilibrium with the bulk solution. Here, we report a nanopore sensing assay that allows accurate quantification of all the reaction intermediates and the product of an artificial three&#8208;enzyme system. A DNA&#8211;peptide complex is used as the initial substrate which undergoes sequential enzymatic cleavages in solution. All the temporal changes of the intermediates and product can be obtained through nanopore translocation recordings. Furthermore, we find that in a confined environment such as liposome, substrate channelling occurs between two sets of the three enzymes. Our results demonstrate a novel and powerful approach to determine and quantify substrate channelling effects, which is potentially useful for designing and evaluating multienzyme systems.

         <title>Activating a [FeFe] Hydrogenase Mimic for Hydrogen Evolution under Visible Light**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precious metal&#8208;free photocatalyst PS&#8208;CAT consisting of a [FeFe] hydrogenase mimic was utilized in the scope of hydrogen generation under visible light. The dyad comprising a &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligothiophene as light absorber shows a remarkably high photocatalytic activity. In accordance with theory, operando EPR spectroscopy using BIH as sacrificial donor reveals the generation of an active [FeIFe0] species during the irradiation experiment.







Abstract
Inspired by the active center of the natural [FeFe] hydrogenases, we designed a compact and precious metal&#8208;free photosensitizer&#8208;catalyst dyad (PS&#8208;CAT) for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. PS&#8208;CAT represents a prototype dyad comprising &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligothiophenes as light absorbers. PS&#8208;CAT and its interaction with the sacrificial donor 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenylbenzimidazoline were studied by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy coupled with electrochemical techniques and visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic investigations. Operando EPR spectroscopy revealed the formation of an active [FeIFe0] species&#8212;in accordance with theoretical calculations&#8212;presumably driving photocatalysis effectively (TON&#8776;210).

&lt;p&gt;A precious metal-free photocatalyst &lt;b&gt;PS-CAT&lt;/b&gt; consisting of a [FeFe] hydrogenase mimic was utilized in the scope of hydrogen generation under visible light. The dyad comprising a &#960;-conjugated oligothiophene as light absorber shows a remarkably high photocatalytic activity. In accordance with theory, &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; EPR spectroscopy using BIH as sacrificial donor reveals the generation of an active [Fe&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;] species during the irradiation experiment.

A silicon analogue of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion was synthesized. This compound exhibits an extremely elongated bridgehead Si&#8722;Si bond (3.0638(8)&#8197;&#197;) and a near&#8208;IR absorption (&#955;max=922&#8197;nm) in solution attributed to the HOMO&#8594;SOMO [&#960;(Si&#8722;Si)&#8594;&#960;*(Si&#8722;Si)] transition. Furthermore, this silicon radical anion presents a new bonding motif which appears to be the first example of a &#8220;&#960;&#8208;type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species&#8221;.







Abstract
&#963;&#8208;Type 3&#8208;electron&#8208;2&#8208;center (3e&#8208;2c) bonds have been extensively studied as one of the key bonding motifs in radical chemistry and some biological systems. &#8220;&#960;&#8208;Type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species&#8221; that contain a 3e&#8208;2c &#960;&#8208;bond without an underlying &#963;&#8208;bond framework, however, have been unexplored so far both theoretically and experimentally. Herein, we report the synthesis of the first stable &#960;&#8208;type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species, a silicon analogue of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion. This compound exhibits an extremely long bridgehead Si&#8722;Si bond (3.0638(8)&#8197;&#197;) and a strong near&#8208;IR absorption at 922&#8197;nm in solution which arises from a HOMO&#8594;SOMO [&#960;(Si&#8722;Si)&#8594;&#960;*(Si&#8722;Si)] transition. DFT calculations revealed a &#960;&#8208;type bonding interaction between the two bridgehead silicon atoms with an unpaired electron mainly delocalized across the corresponding &#960;*&#8208;type orbital, which introduces a novel bonding motif for constructing &#960;&#8208;electron systems.

         <title>Building a Beyond Concentrated Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Anode&#8208;Free Rechargeable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly aggregated ether electrolyte is rationally constructed by introducing a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film. Benefitting from the highly aggregated electrolyte configuration, it enables a dramatically improved oxidative stability. Under the extremely harsh anode&#8208;free conditions, the high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free Na battery configuration has an ultrahigh energy density of 369&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for 4.0&#8197;V class cathodes.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and scalable sodium ion (Na&#8208;ion) batteries serve as an ideal alternative to the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. To compensate for the shortage of energy density, the most accessible solution is developing a high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free configuration comprising a lightweight Al current collector on the anode and a high&#8208;voltage sodiumized cathode. However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high&#8208;voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. A 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It suppresses the trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5&#8197;V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91&#8201;%). Thus, we can make anode&#8208;free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for 4.0 and 4.25&#8197;V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250&#8197;cycles) for 4.0&#8197;V&#8208;class anode&#8208;free cells.

         <title>Direct Dehydrogenative Access to Unsymmetrical Phenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction is an emblematic method for constructing C&#8722;C bonds at aromatic positions. Rendering this reaction dehydrogenative on a broad scope of substrates under simple reaction conditions constitutes an important milestone for synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
The first non&#8208;directed dehydrogenative phenone coupling method of methylarenes with aromatic C&#8722;H bonds, displaying a large substrate scope, is herein reported. This reaction represents a far more direct atom&#8208; and step&#8208;efficient alternative to the classical Friedel&#8211;Crafts or Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura derived acylation reactions. The method can be carried out on a gram scale and was successfully applied to the synthesis of several Ketoprofen drug analogues.

         <title>An Isolable Vinylidene ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM), including crystallographic analysis, is described. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM causes its high reactivity, making it capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient aryl group. This study paves an avenue for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.







Abstract
Commonly, an elusive intermediate is generated from a precursor and then trapped and consumed in a reaction. Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been demonstrated as transient axially chiral intermediates in asymmetric catalysis due to their orthogonal &#960;&#8208;bonds forming an allene motif. The current understanding of VQMs is primarily based on time&#8208;resolved absorption, trapping experiments and computational studies. Herein, we report the first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a VQM, including crystallographic analysis. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM led to its high reactivity as an electrophile or a 4&#960;&#8208;component capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient phenyl group. Notably, the VQM could be isolated in enantiomerically enriched form, and the subsequent transformation was stereospecific, indicating that the generation of the VQM was involved in the enantiodetermining step. This study paves the way for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.

         <title>Activation of CO Using a 1,2&#8208;Disilylene: Facile Synthesis of an Abnormal N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a 1,2&#8208;disilylene with CO under ambient conditions leads to a bis(silylene), the five&#8208;membered heterocycle of which represents the first silicon analogue of an &#8220;abnormal&#8221; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (see picture). Reactions of the bis(silylene) with transition metal carbonyls lead to different outcomes, including a chelate complex of the Mo(CO)4 fragment.







Abstract
Reaction of the 1,2&#8208;disilylene, [{ArC(NDip)2}Si]2 1 (Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, Ar=4&#8208;C6H4But), with CO proceeds via insertion of CO into one Si&#8722;N bond, and Si&#8722;Si bond cleavage, to cleanly give the bis(silylene), {ArC(NDip)2}Si(:)O
 Ar 2, under ambient conditions. The reaction can be partially reversed when solutions of 2 are subjected to UV irradiation. The five&#8208;membered heterocyclic fragment of 2 represents the first silicon analogue of an &#8220;abnormal&#8221; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (aNHC), a view which is substantiated by a computational analysis of the compound. Reaction of 2 with [Mo(CO)6] under UV light affords the chelate complex, [Mo(CO)4(&#954;2&#8208;Si,Si&#8208;2)] 3, while reaction with [Fe(CO)5] gives the unusual silyleneyl bridged complex, [{Fe2(CO)6}{&#956;&#8208;Si[(NDip)2CAr]}2] 4. The same coordination complexes can be accessed by reaction of 1 with [Mo(CO)6] or [Fe(CO)5] under UV light. As is the case for aNHCs, d&#8208;block metal complexes of bis(silylene) 2 could prove useful as bespoke catalysts for organic transformations.

         <title>Prodrugs of Persulfide and Sulfide: Is There a Pharmacological Difference between the Two in the Context of Rapid Exchanges among Various Sulfur Species In Vivo?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delivery system which can release pure H2S, hydrogen persulfide, and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine persulfide was used to compare the pharmacological difference of sulfide and persulfide. Persulfide prodrugs exhibited increased activities compared to the H2S prodrug in vitro and in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs also exhibited reduced toxicity compared to H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.







Abstract
Sulfide and persulfide are chemically different and one might expect persulfide to be more effective in mediating sulfur signaling because persulfide can directly modify protein cysteine residue. However, rapid scrambling, and interconversions occur among sulfur species. Then there is the question of whether the chemical reactivity differences between sulfide and persulfide would translate into pharmacological differences. Utilizing a delivery system to generate pure hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrogen persulfide (H2S2), and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine persulfide (N&#8208;CysSSH), we examined the activities of sulfide and persulfide in vitro and in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs exhibited increased activities compared to the H2S prodrug. In particular, the H2S2 prodrug offers much&#8208;elevated analgesic effects compared to the H2S prodrug in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs also possess a reduced level of toxicity compared to the H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;2D Bilayer Surface Passivation for High Efficiency Narrow Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
TEASCN (2&#8208;thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate) was synthesized to construct a bilayer structure on a Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite surface, which can passivate perovskite and ensure effective carrier transfer, enabling the device to reach a certified efficiency of 21.1&#8201;%. The mechanism for the growth of the uniform bilayer structure is revealed by simulation based on density functional theory.







Abstract
The combination of comprehensive surface passivation and effective interface carriers transfer plays a critical role in high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. A 2D structure is an important approach for surface passivation of perovskite film, however, its large band gap could compromise carrier transfer. Herein, we synthesize a new molecule 2&#8208;thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate (TEASCN) for the construction of bilayer quasi&#8208;2D structure precisely on a tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite surface. This bilayer structure can passivate the perovskite surface and ensure effective carriers transfer simultaneously. As a result, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of the device is increased without sacrificing short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc), giving rise to a high certified efficiency from a credible third&#8208;party certification of narrow band gap perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, theoretical simulation indicates that the inclusion of TEASCN makes the bilayer structure thermodynamically more stable, which provides a strategy to tailor the number of layers of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite structures.

         <title>Expressed Protein Selenoester Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expressed protein selenoester ligation (EPSL) methodology that enables the efficient semi&#8208;synthesis of site&#8208;specifically modified proteins at high dilution is described. EPSL involves the one&#8208;pot conversion of protein acyl hydrazides (derived from recombinant intein fusion precursors) to protein aryl selenoesters, followed by ligation with synthetic modified selenopeptides and chemoselective deselenization.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the development and application of a novel expressed protein selenoester ligation (EPSL) methodology for the one&#8208;pot semi&#8208;synthesis of modified proteins. EPSL harnesses the rapid kinetics of ligation reactions between modified synthetic selenopeptides and protein aryl selenoesters (generated from expressed intein fusion precursors) followed by in situ chemoselective deselenization to afford target proteins at concentrations that preclude the use of traditional ligation methods. The utility of the EPSL technology is showcased through the efficient semi&#8208;synthesis of ubiquitinated polypeptides, lipidated analogues of the membrane&#8208;associated GTPase YPT6, and site&#8208;specifically phosphorylated variants of the oligomeric chaperone protein Hsp27 at high dilution.

An electrochemically switchable strategy was developed for the copolymerization of lactide (LA), CO2 and epoxides to easily synthesize multi&#8208;block copolymers of polylactide (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC).







Abstract
Electrochemical redox&#8208;control is an emerging strategy for the regulation of polymerization process without the addition of external oxidants and reductants, which enables the control over composition, microstructure and properties of the polymer products. In this paper, based on the chemical selectivity of heterometallic Salen&#8208;Co&#8208;Mn complexes of different valences, an electrochemically switchable strategy was developed for the copolymerization of lactide (LA), CO2 and epoxides. The switchable redox reactions endowed this system with the capability to easily synthesize a multi&#8208;block copolymer of polylactide (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC). Moreover, the multi&#8208;block copolymer could be further modified by introducing various monomers with different microstructures and functional groups.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Asymmetric Addition of Aryl Iodides across Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective aryl&#8208;addition has been accomplished using a combination of aryl iodides and aldehydes via asymmetric nickel catalysis. These mild catalytic conditions provide a new strategy for the enantioselective construction of secondary alcohols, avoiding the use of organometallic nucleophiles.







Abstract
Enantioenriched alcohols comprise much of the framework of organic molecules. Here, we first report that chiral nickel complexes can catalyze the intermolecular enantioselective addition of aryl iodides across aldehydes to provide diverse optically active secondary alcohols using zinc metal as the reducing agent. This method shows a broad substrate scope under mild reaction conditions and precludes the traditional strategy through the pre&#8208;generation of organometallic reagents. Mechanistic studies indicate that an in situ formed arylnickel, instead of an arylzinc, adds efficiently to aldehydes, forming a new C&#8722;C bond and a chiral nickel alkoxide that may be turned over by zinc powder.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene Stabilized Disilicon(0) Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene ligated disilicon(0) complex was synthesized and characterized, which revealed a Si0=Si0 double bond with significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; bonding. Its reaction with phenylacetylene gave the structurally interesting silatricyclic complex 6,8&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;trisilatricyclo[3.2.1.02,7]&#8208;oct&#8208;3&#8208;ene and reveals new aspects of low&#8208;valent silicon chemistry.







Abstract
Synthesis and reactivity of disilicon(0) complexes are of fundamental and application importance. Herein, we report the development of an N&#8208;heterocyclic imino&#8208;substituted silylene (1), which has strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability and is significantly sterically hindered. The one&#8208;pot reaction of this silylene with [IPr&#8594;SiCl2] (IPr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and KC8 (2&#8197;equiv) in THF at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C leads to a silylene&#8208;ligated disilicon(0) complex (2), isolated as red crystals in 60&#8201;% yield. Characterization data and DFT calculations show that the trans&#8208;bent Si4 skeleton in 2 features a Si0=Si0 double bond with significant &#960;&#8211;&#960; bonding and one lone pair of electrons on each of these two Si0 atoms. Complex 2 reacts readily with phenylacetylene, producing a structurally intriguing silatricyclic complex 6,8&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;trisilatricyclo&#8208;[3.2.1.02,7]&#8208;oct&#8208;3&#8208;ene (3), and revealing new aspects of low&#8208;valent silicon chemistry.

         <title>K3SbS4 as a Potassium Superionic Conductor with Low Activation Energy for K&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium superionic conductor with low activation energy: W&#8208;doped K3SbS4 possesses a two&#8208;dimensional K migration pathway and a low activation energy of 0.27&#8197;eV. Among them, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 40&#8201;&#176;C, which is among the best reported potassium&#8208;ion conductors at ambient temperature and is then used in K&#8722;S batteries to block the polysulfide shuttle.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state K&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are key elements to address the current problems in K secondary batteries. Here, we report a sulfide&#8208;based K&#8208;ion conductor K3SbS4 with a low&#8208;activation energy of 0.27&#8197;eV. W&#8208;doped K3&#8722;xSb1&#8722;xWxS4 (x=0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10 and 0.12) compounds were also explored for increasing vacancy concentrations and improving ionic conductivity. Among them, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 40&#8201;&#176;C, which is among the best reported potassium&#8208;ion conductors at ambient temperature. In addition, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 is electrochemically stable with long&#8208;chained potassium polysulfide of K2Sx. A room&#8208;temperature solid potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8722;S) battery system has therefore been successfully demonstrated, which is the first K&#8722;S battery prototype using non&#8208;commercial inorganic&#8208;based electrolyte to block the polysulfide shuttle.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;NHC&#8208;Catalyzed gem&#8208;Specific O&#8208;Selective Hydropyridonation of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;IPr catalyst was reported for the synthesis of gem&#8208;O&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;oxypyridines by selective O&#8208;addition of 2&#8208;pyridones to terminal alkynes. A preferable N&#8208;coordination mode within the metallacyclopropene intermediate species causes a seesaw effect responsible for the O&#8208;nucleophilic attack.







Abstract
The dinuclear complex [Rh(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(&#951;2&#8208;coe)(IPr)]2 is an efficient catalyst for the O&#8208;selective Markovnikov&#8208;type addition of 2&#8208;pyridones to terminal alkynes. DFT calculations support a hydride&#8208;free pathway entailing intramolecular oxidative protonation of a &#960;&#8208;alkyne by a &#954;1N&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligand. Subsequent O&#8208;nucleophilic attack on a metallacyclopropene species affords an O&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxypyridine chelate rhodium intermediate as the catalyst resting state. The release of the alkenyl ether is calculated as the rate&#8208;determining step.

&lt;p&gt;A Rh-IPr catalyst was reported for the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-alkenyl-oxypyridines by selective &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-addition of 2-pyridones to terminal alkynes. A preferable &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-coordination mode within the metallacyclopropene intermediate species causes a seesaw effect responsible for the &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-nucleophilic attack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dinuclear complex [Rh(&#956;-Cl)(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-coe)(IPr)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an efficient catalyst for the &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-selective Markovnikov-type addition of 2-pyridones to terminal alkynes. DFT calculations support a hydride-free pathway entailing intramolecular oxidative protonation of a &#960;-alkyne by a &#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxypyridine ligand. Subsequent &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-nucleophilic attack on a metallacyclopropene species affords an &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-alkenyl-2-oxypyridine chelate rhodium intermediate as the catalyst resting state. The release of the alkenyl ether is calculated as the rate-determining step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes via Catalytic Rhodium to Gold(III) Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic method for the straightforward synthesis of cyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) complexes is reported via an unprecedented, redox&#8208;neutral Rh&#8208;to&#8208;AuIII transmetalation. A rate&#8208;determining transfer of the C ligand followed by the subsequent incorporation of the N donor delivers the monocyclometalated (C^N) gold(III) species.







Abstract
A catalytic method to synthesize a broad array of cyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) complexes is reported here. An unprecedented Rh&#8208;to&#8208;AuIII transmetalation allows the facile transfer of (C^N) ligands between these two metals in a redox&#8208;neutral process. The reaction employs commercially available precursors and proceeds under mild and environmentally benign conditions. Both experimental and computational studies support a multistep transmetalation from rhodium to gold as the underlying mechanism for these transformations. This process involves first, a rate&#8208;determining transfer of the C ligand followed by the subsequent incorporation of the N donor to form the monocyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) species.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Doubly&#8208;Strapped Isolated Perylene Diimide Chromophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble perylene diimide (PDI) cyclophane consisting of a central PDI chromophore enclosed by double cationic molecular straps has been synthesized. Owing to the effective spatial isolation, self&#8208;aggregation of the chromophore in water is completely eliminated, which enables the cyclophane to be employed for lysosome&#8208;targetable live&#8208;cell imaging and antibacterial applications.







Abstract
Perylene diimides (PDIs), a well&#8208;studied class of organic dyes, have a strong tendency to self&#8208;aggregate in water, thus greatly restricting their phototheranostic applications. Herein, we report a water&#8208;soluble PDI cyclophane &#8220;Gemini Box&#8221; (GBox&#8208;14+), consisting of a central PDI chromophore enclosed by double&#8208;sided cationic molecular straps. Owing to the effective spatial isolation, the chromophore self&#8208;aggregation can be completely eliminated, even in a concentrated aqueous solution up to 2&#8197;mM. To our knowledge, GBox&#8208;14+ represents an interesting example of a fluorescent PDI cyclophane in water, capable of being employed for lysosome&#8208;targetable live&#8208;cell imaging. More importantly, the highly concentrated aqueous solution of PDI radical anion can be significantly stabilized by GBox&#8208;14+ to exhibit an excellent near&#8208;infrared photothermal effect, which was further exploited for efficient and selective antibacterial applications. This work provides a new access to water&#8208;soluble non&#8208;aggregated organic dyes and promotes their potential biomedical applications.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Microcapsules for On&#8208;Demand Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic fabrication (left) is used to prepare a two aqueous phase microcapsule (right), which releases a model drug payload on demand in response to focused ultrasound actuation.







Abstract
Traditional implanted drug delivery systems cannot easily change their release profile in real time to respond to physiological changes. Here we present a microfluidic aqueous two&#8208;phase system to generate microcapsules that can release drugs on demand as triggered by focused ultrasound (FUS). The biphasic microcapsules are made of hydrogels with an outer phase of mixed molecular weight (MW) poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate that mitigates premature payload release and an inner phase of high MW dextran with payload that breaks down in response to FUS. Compound release from microcapsules could be triggered as desired; 0.4&#8197;&#956;g of payload was released across 16 on&#8208;demand steps over days. We detected broadband acoustic signals amidst low heating, suggesting inertial cavitation as a key mechanism for payload release. Overall, FUS&#8208;responsive microcapsules are a biocompatible and wirelessly triggerable structure for on&#8208;demand drug delivery over days to weeks.

         <title>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Reveals Molecular Species in Carbon Nanodot Samples Disclosing Flaws</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 20, May 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The purification of carbon nanodots is a critical aspect in their preparation, especially for syntheses involving molecular precursors. Indeed, the presence of organic molecules in the final sample can lead to mistaken conclusions regarding their properties. In this work, NMR is proven to be an essential technique to verify the purification of carbon nanodots, thanks to its ability to disclose molecular species.







Abstract
Carbon nanodots are currently one of the hot topics in the nanomaterials world, due to their accessible synthesis and promising features. However, the purification of these materials is still a critical aspect, especially for syntheses involving molecular precursors. Indeed, the presence of unreacted species or small organic molecules formed during solvothermal treatments can affect the properties of the synthesized nanomaterials. To illustrate the extreme importance of this issue, we present two case studies in which insufficient purification results in misleading conclusions regarding the chiral and fluorescent properties of the investigated materials. Key to identify molecular species is the use of nuclear magnetic resonance, which proves to be an effective tool. Our work highlights the need to include nuclear magnetic resonance as a standard characterization technique for carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, to minimize the risk of observing properties that arise from molecular species, rather than the target carbon nanodots.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Zirconocene&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s and Its Extension to Synthesis of a Porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Nanobarrel</title>

         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valent zirconocene&#8208;mediated cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent treatment with acid affords porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with exocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiene motifs. These porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s can react with dienophiles to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with benzdiyne gives a nanobarrel which can hold two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Rosenthal's&#8208;reagent&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent acid treatment afforded a 1,3&#8208;butadiene&#8208;embedded porphyrin(2.1.2.1), 6, which served as a reactive diene towards dienophiles such as dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) and benzyne to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 6 and benzdiyne gave adducts 14, 15&#8201;a, and 15&#8201;b along with a trace amount of porphyrin(2.1.2.1) barrel 13. Stepwise routes using 14 or 15&#8201;a/15&#8201;b as a substrate allowed for the synthesis of 13 as a single stereoisomer. The nanobarrel structure for 13 was revealed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, where its cavity held two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. DFT calculations revealed that the electrostatic attraction was dominant with binding energy of 32.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;Low-valent zirconocene-mediated cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;-dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent treatment with acid affords porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with exocyclic 1,3-butadiene motifs. These porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s can react with dienophiles to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with benzdiyne gives a nanobarrel which can hold two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
