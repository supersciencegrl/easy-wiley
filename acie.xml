         <title>Synthesis of Glycolipid Library Reminiscent of Mycobacterial Cell Wall Motif A and Its Significance by Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) is distinguished by its unique glycolipid composition, notably mycolyl arabinogalactan, that features Araf, Galf, and mycolic acid. The terminal portion of arabinogalactan (AG) is motif A, a pentaarabinofuranoside characterized by two &#946;&#8208;1,2 linkages and one each of &#945;&#8208;1,5 and &#945;&#8208;1,3 linkages. The C5 positions of motif A are esterified with mycolic acids, further enriched by unusual cyclopropanes. In this study, we synthesized a diverse array of MTb cell wall glycolipids inspired by motif A and explored their self&#8208;assembly behavior using microscopy. This collection of glycolipids includes variations with &#945; or &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;2, 3, or 5) Araf linkages in di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and penta&#8208;arabinofuranosides, esterified with saturated, doubly unsaturated, or cyclopropanated long&#8208;chain fatty acids. The TEM analysis of the resulting self&#8208;assemblies revealed that subtle modifications in the anomeric linkages, length of the glycan, and the presence or absence of cyclopropanes impacted the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;industrial Preparation of SWCNTs&#8208;confined High&#8208;entropy Oxides as Self&#8208;supported Electrodes for Continuous Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) are emerging as highly promising materials for electrochemical applications due to their exceptional electronic properties and active sites. However, the synthesis of 1D HEO with high aspect ratios and mechanical properties has been challenging, particularly on an industrial scale. Herein, we report a spatially confined oxidation (SCO) method to synthesize 1D HEO@SWCNTs with high specific surface area and stability. This method enables the large&#8208;scale production of HEO@SWCNTs, achieving quasi&#8208;industrially quantities in a single batch, and can be extended to seven&#8208;element 1D HEO. The resulting exhibit a homogeneous distribution of elements and a single&#8208;phase solid solution structure, as confirmed by STEM&#8208;EDS and XRD analysis. The Fermi level of SWCNTs is downshifted into the valence band upon HEO doping, enhancing conductivity and electrochemical activity. The HEO@SWCNTs electrode demonstrates superior flexibility and self&#8208;supported properties, making it suitable for large&#8208;scale electrochemical applications. Chronoamperometric measurements reveal excellent stability, maintaining 94% current retention after 20 h. Notably, in the electrochemical epoxidation reaction cycloolefin, the HEO@SWCNTs self&#8208;supported electrode achieves an average FE of 70.7% for epoxy&#8208;cyclohexane over 24 h. This work provides a scalable and versatile approach to the synthesis of self&#8208;supported electrodes for advanced electrochemical systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Customizing Room&#8208;Temperature Perovskite Ferroelectrics toward the Multichannel Domain Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating domain structure in ferroelectrics by external stimuli presents a fascinating avenue for new&#8208;generation electronic devices. However, multichannel controlling of ferroelectric domains is still a challenge, due to the lack of knowledge on their bistability to diverse physical stimuli. Herein, we have customized a series of perovskite ferroelectrics, (CnH2n+1NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3Br10 (n = 2&#8208;7), of which the Curie temperatures are modulated in a wide temperature range (&#916;T = 74 K) by tailoring chain length of organic spacers. Strikingly, the n = 7 member is a room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric with bistable characteristics, thus endowing the manipulation of domains via four channels (i.e., thermal, stress, light, and electric fields). Such a non&#8208;volatile memory behavior of the stress&#8208;switching domain is unprecedented in hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics. This manipulation of domains reveals unique bistability of its ferroelectric orders, which sheds light on the future advance of customizing electric&#8208;ordered materials toward the smart device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Color Single&#8208;Molecule Blinking Ratiometricity: A Functional Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging Approach for Resolving Lysosomal pH and Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence super&#8208;resolution microscopy has enabled nanoscale imaging of intracellular structures, but it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve structural imaging and quantitative functional characterization, such as pH measurement, within the same region. Here, we introduce Two&#8208;Color Single&#8208;Molecule Blinking Ratiometricity (2C&#8208;SMBR), a novel method that integrates structural and functional imaging with single&#8208;molecule precision. By loading lysosomes with two pH&#8208;dependent spontaneously blinking fluorophores of distinct colors, 2C&#8208;SMBR leverages single&#8208;molecule localization of either fluorophore to achieve nanoscale structural imaging of lysosomes, while the ratiometric analysis of blinking dynamics between the two fluorophores provides&#160;quantitative pH measurement at the single&#8208;lysosome level. This dual&#8208;color ratiometric approach at the single&#8208;molecule level enables precise quantification of lysosomal pH with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution. Using 2C&#8208;SMBR, we reveal that lysosomal pH is highly heterogeneous at the single&#8208;lysosome level, with distinct subpopulations exhibiting diverse pH values. Our measurements show a pH range of 4.0 to 6.0 within lysosomes, with perinuclear lysosomes averaging a pH of approximately 4.88, while peripheral lysosomes average around 5.64. Crucially, 2C&#8208;SMBR enables real&#8208;time correlation between lysosomal dynamics and pH changes, overcoming a key limitation of super&#8208;resolution imaging. This approach not only advances nanoscale organelle characterization but also provides mechanistic insights into lysosomal physiology and function.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Reactivity of Unprotected Oximes via Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Dual Copper/Organophotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oximes are widely used precursors in synthetic chemistry due to their broad availability and versatile chemical properties, in which N&#8208;O bond fragmentation represents a key reactivity mode. However, these transformations typically require the use of oxygen&#8208;protected oximes, and a general strategy to directly utilize free oximes remains challenging due to their vulnerability to side reaction pathways, rendering low tendency towards N&#8208;OH bond cleavage. Here we report a unified platform to achieve direct cyclization of unprotected oximes with enals, as well as other coupling partners through dual copper/organophotoredox catalysis under green light irradiation. This protocol enables concurrent activation of both N&#8208;OH and &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds of free oximes to form multisubstituted pyridines with exceeding structural diversity and high functional group tolerance. In this process, the photocatalyst (Rose Bengal) also serves as a hydrogen atom transfer agent to generate radical intermediates. In the meanwhile, copper catalyst activates free oximes via single&#8208;electron reduction induced N&#8208;O bond fragmentation, and controls the selectivity for intermediate trapping. The synthetic utility of this approach is further demonstrated by its successful applications in late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active compounds and rapid assembly of solvatochromic fluorescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Accelerated Design of High&#8208;Efficient Lithium Adsorbents for Salt Lake Brines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urgent demand for lithium resources has been advancing the development of high&#8208;efficient lithium extraction from brines. Aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbent, as the only one used in salt lake industry, is limited to further improve the extraction efficiency due to the low adsorption capacity. Here, we develop a high&#8208;throughput screening framework via interpretable machine learning (ML) to rapidly determine high&#8208;performance modification strategies for the aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbent, avoiding huge workload from traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error doping experiments in view of multiple doping schemes and the unique trade&#8208;off between performance and structural stability. Relying on the recommended modifications, a series of doped adsorbents are prepared and verified the structure stability and cyclic adsorption performance, which match well with the uncovered correlation between dopant features and adsorption capacity. Experimental validations confirm the screened doped one exhibits an increased stable adsorption capacity by near 40% in various types of brine. These results indicate that ML&#8208;accelerated approach can significantly promote the upgrading of lithium resource adsorption industry in salt lakes.</dc:description>

Relying on the recommended modifications, a series of doped adsorbents are prepared and verified the structure stability and cyclic adsorption performance, which match well with the uncovered correlation between dopant features and adsorption capacity. Experimental validations confirm the screened doped one exhibits an increased stable adsorption capacity by near 40% in various types of brine. These results indicate that ML-accelerated approach can significantly promote the upgrading of lithium resource adsorption industry in salt lakes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anchor Peptide&#8208;based Immobilization Strategy Promote the Applications of Pickering Emulsion System in Natural Product&#160;Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pickering emulsion systems are an advanced platform for efficient fine chemical production in biphasic enzymatic catalysis, while their applications are currently limited to a few commercial enzyme classes. Herein, we designed an anchor peptide&#8208;based immobilization strategy for Pickering emulsions to achieve efficient glycosylation of natural products by glycosyltransferases (GTs). Firstly, through enzyme mining, natural GTs were utilized to synthesize pharmaceutically important acacetin glucoside and galactoside. However, the best&#8208;performing enzymes, BacGT and BarGT&#8208;3, still showed low conversions for acacetin glucoside (&lt;40%) and galactoside (&lt;10%). Then, Spy chemistry was employed to cyclize these two GTs (Spy_BacGT and Spy_BarGT&#8208;3) for improved robustness, and a Pickering emulsion was formed with the free two Spy_GTs, using 20% 2&#8208;hexanone and 1% mesoporous silica nanoparticles (CM), achieving 70% and 66% conversions of acacetin glucoside and galactoside, respectively. Further immobilization of the cyclized GTs onto CM via the anchor peptide LCI (Spy_BacGT/BarGT&#8208;3_LCI@CM) further enabled the system to reach more than 90% conversions of acacetin glycosides, retaining 90% conversions after 6&#8208;8 cycles. Moreover, this strategy was applied to GTs exhibiting substrate selectivity, achieving efficient non&#8208;selective catalysis. This study provides a simple and efficient immobilization strategy to broaden the applications of the Pickering emulsion system in enzymatic glycosylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Control of Chiral Phases for Higher Performance and Inverted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral luminescent materials have garnered increasing attention for their exceptional ability to emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) along with their excellent applications. Here, a cyclohexylidene scaffold was conceptualized as a chiral source for developing higher performance CPL materials in term of simultaneously enhanced quantum yields (PLQYs) and dissymmetry factor. It was found that the axially chiral scaffold attached with a cyanostilbene showed a pathway dependent assembly route to form chiral luminescent liquid crystals and crystal upon fast and slow cooling, respectively. A significant enhancement of PLQYs (98.4%) and a dissymmetry factor (glum) value (2.1&#215;10&#8208;2), and consequently, high Figure of Merit (FM) of up to 0.02 was achieved in chiral liquid crystal phase. Moreover, the liquid crystal and crystal phases showed the opposite CPL signals while maintained the same CD signs. Through a thorough evaluation of UV absorption, CPL emission, WAXD and theoretical calculations, it was revealed that the reversal of CPL sign was linked to distinct phases of excited state molecular packing. This research utilized a novel intrinsically axially chiral source to develop a pathway dependent and higher performance CPL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Linear Scaling Relation Limitations on a Dual&#8208;driven Single&#8208;atom Copper/Tungsten Oxide Catalyst for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8208;, NO3RR) on single&#8208;atom copper catalysts (Cu&#8208;SACs) offers a sustainable approach to ammonia (NH3) synthesis using NO3&#8208; pollutants as feedstocks. Nevertheless, this process suffers from inferior NO3RR kinetics and nitrite accumulation owing to the linear scaling relation limitations for SACs. To break these limitations, a single&#8208;atom Cu&#8208;bearing tungsten oxide catalyst (Cu1/WO3) was developed, which mediated a unique dual&#8208;driven NO3RR process. Specifically, WO3 dissociated water molecules and supplied the Cu1 site with ample protons, while the Cu1 site in an electron&#8208;deficient state converted NO3&#8208; to NH3 efficiently. The Cu1/WO3 delivered an impressive NH3 production rate of 1274.4 mgN h&#8208;1 gCu&#8208;1, a NH3 selectivity of 99.2%, and a Faradaic efficiency of 93.7% at &#8208;0.60 V, surpassing most reported catalysts. Furthermore, an integrated continuous&#8208;flow system consisting of NO3RR cell and vacuum&#8208;driven membrane separator was developed for NH3 synthesis from nitrate&#8208;contaminated water. Fed with the Yangtze River water containing ~22.5 mg L&#8208;1 of NO3&#8208;&#8208;N, this system realized an NH3 production rate of 325.9 mgN h&#8208;1 gCu&#8208;1 and a collection efficiency of 98.3% at energy consumption of 17.11 kwh gN&#8208;1. This study provides a new dual&#8208;driven concept for catalyst design and establishes a foundation for sustainable NH3 synthesis from waste.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organocatalyzed direct and asymmetric functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond is attractive yet challenging. Herein, we report the enantioselective acylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond via a cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, affording the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl ketones in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 er). The rational design of novel NHCs guided by initial evaluation of available catalysts and their application promote the asymmetric transformation. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the formation of benzyl radical and ketyl radical intermediates, and rationalize the coupling of these radical species via open&#8208;shell singlet transition states to be the enantiodetermining step. This redox neutral protocol features mild conditions, and free of transition&#8208;metals and pre&#8208;functionalized radical precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy Efficiency Limit in CO&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electroreduction and Method to Advance Towards</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrified synthesis of high&#8208;demand feedstocks (C2H4) from CO and H2O through a CO electroreduction (COR) protocol is attractive for large&#8208;scale applications; however, a high reaction potential and modest Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) limit its practical energy efficiency (EE). In this study, a quantitative reaction&#8211;transport model was constructed to analyze the root causes of low performance in COR, which revealed that the low volumetric exchange current density and limited intermediate surface reaction as key factors constraining the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ and CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion energetics and selectivities. Consequently, a robust, high active&#8208;site density electrode featuring nanometer&#8208;scale interspacing between the active, Nafion&#8482;&#8208;wrapped Cu+&#8211;Cu nanosheet catalysts was designed. This design increases volumetric COR activity with an efficient intermediate surface reaction mechanism for C2H4 production, substantially lowering the full&#8208;cell COR potential to 1.87 V at 4 A in a 25 cm2 membrane electrode assembly, thereby achieving a record &gt;50% C2+ EE with a 90&#177;1% FE along with a &gt;40% C2H4 EE with a 71&#177;1% FE throughout stable &gt;100 h operation. Similarly designed high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;activity Bi and Ag nanosheet catalysts enabled &gt;60% and &gt;55% EEs for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electroreduction, demonstrating the broader applicability of our electrochemical activity and EE enhancement concept on a three&#8208;phase interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Aza&#8208;diphosphazenanes: Inorganic Cyclohexane&#8208;like Connectors with Stereochemically Tunable Exit Vectors for Molecular and Macromolecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Robust organic molecules that place functional groups at well&#8208;defined angular and radial separations are valued as connectors in synthetic chemistry. Examples include rigid, polyvalent arenes and bicyclic compounds featuring strong C&#8208;C or C&#8208;H bonds. Non&#8208;aromatic rings like cyclohexane are rare in this context due to the challenge of stereochemical control over C&#8208;H functionalization. Here we investigate inorganic cyclohexane&#8208;like P2N4 rings (aza&#8208;diphosphinanes) and develop a model based on negative hyperconjugation and diaxial strain to explain their cis/trans isomerization patterns. Informed by this model, we rationally make cis&#8208;1,4 or trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;disubstituted aza&#8208;diphosphinanes, and stereoselectively oxidize them to aza&#8208;diphosphazenanes which retain their cis (77&#176;) or trans (180&#176;) covalent exit vectors. These compounds show high stability but nevertheless react smoothly as 1,4&#8208;dinucleophiles, supporting their classification as new cyclohexane&#8208;like connectors. Use of the appropriate connector in polycondensations enables the preferential synthesis of low molecular weight macrocyclic oligomers (from the cis variant) or the first example of high molecular weight cyclo&#8208;linear polyphosphazenes (from the trans variant). These results provide fundamental insight into the stereochemistry of inorganic heterocycles and the consequences of molecular dimensionality, debut connectors that fill a niche left by organic ones, and offer access to new classes of inorganic polymers for future investigation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Robust organic molecules that place functional groups at well-defined angular and radial separations are valued as connectors in synthetic chemistry. Examples include rigid, polyvalent arenes and bicyclic compounds featuring strong C-C or C-H bonds. Non-aromatic rings like cyclohexane are rare in this context due to the challenge of stereochemical control over C-H functionalization. Here we investigate inorganic cyclohexane-like P2N4 rings (aza-diphosphinanes) and develop a model based on negative hyperconjugation and diaxial strain to explain their cis/trans isomerization patterns. Informed by this model, we rationally make cis-1,4 or trans-1,4-disubstituted aza-diphosphinanes, and stereoselectively oxidize them to aza-diphosphazenanes which retain their cis (77&#176;) or trans (180&#176;) covalent exit vectors.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Robust Supraparticles for Spatially Orthogonal Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macroscopically sized supraparticles (SPs) are emerging as cutting&#8208;edge materials for industrial applications because of their unique properties unachievable for their nano&#8208;building blocks, but their effective methods are lacking. Here, we develop a conceptually novel strategy to assemble binary or ternary nanoparticles (NPs) within compartments of droplets through electrostatic interactions, making it possible to facilely fabricate millimeter&#8208;sized multicomponent ionic supraparticles (ISPs). The assembled ISPs possess unexpectedly high mechanical strength (50 N per bead), being amenable to practical applications. The key factors governing the assembly behavior of nano&#8208;building blocks within water droplet compartments have been identified through regulating the size and charge density of NPs or ionic strength, providing key insights into multilevelled assembly of NPs beyond the conventional assembly. Our strategy is demonstrated to be versatile since a library of tailor&#8208;made ISPs containing multicomponent, diversely shaped and differently sized NPs can be facilely fabricated. As a proof of this concept, we showcase that this method enables to prepare spatially orthogonal cascade catalysts by co&#8208;assembling acidic, basic and metal sites in a single millimeter&#8208;scaled particles. The catalysts exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency in a one&#8208;pot cascade synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkylated nitriles and high operational stability (200 h) in industrially preferred fixed&#8208;bed reactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Pair Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis Enables Cr&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation of Ketones Using Hydrocarbon Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a catalytic allylation of ketones using simple hydrocarbon alkenes, enabled by a synergistic system comprising chromocene and photo&#8208;activatable ion&#8208;pair hydrogen atom transfer (IP&#8208;HAT) catalysts derived from a thiophosphoryl imide and N&#8208;heteroaromatics. This catalyst system generates highly nucleophilic, electron&#8208;rich allylchromium(III) species directly from unactivated alkenes, demonstrating broad applicability to various ketones, including aromatic, aliphatic, and multifunctional ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with high functional group tolerance. The modular design of the IP&#8208;HAT catalysts allows precise tuning of redox potential and HAT activity, with the enhanced reduction potential of the reduced N&#8208;heteroaromatics catalyst playing a pivotal role in efficiently regenerating the electron&#8208;rich chromocene(II) catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulk measurement of membrane permeability for random cyclic peptides in living cells to guide drug development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides are attractive for drug discovery due to their excellent binding properties and the potential to cross cell membranes. However, by far not all cyclic peptides are cell permeable, and measuring or predicting their membrane permeability is not trivial. In this work, we assessed the membrane permeability of thioether&#8208;cyclized peptides, a widely used format in drug discovery. We developed a strategy for synthesizing hundreds of cyclic peptides carrying a short chloroalkane tag for the bulk quantification of membrane permeability in live cells using the chloroalkane penetration assay. Permeability data for random cyclic peptides established design rules, namely that the probability of peptides entering cells is strongly increasing if the molecular weight is below 800 Da, the polar surface is smaller than 250 &#197;2, or if there are less than six H&#8208;bond donors. From this, machine learning could predict the membrane permeability of random peptides with good confidence, facilitating the future development of membrane permeable cyclic peptide drugs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The integration of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with molecular chemistry to create molecule&#8208;2D material heterostructures presents a compelling strategy for advancing material design and applications. This approach provides precise control over the structure and properties of 2D materials, effectively addressing challenges in their production and fabrication. Among these, molecule&#8208;transition metal dichalcogenide (mTMD) heterostructures have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive electronic, optical, and catalytic properties, as well as the intriguing emergent states and phenomena resulting from interactions with adjacent molecular and material layers. Achieving the desired electronic and optical properties in these heterostructures hinges on carefully controlling the interactions at the molecule/TMD interfaces.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Supramolecular Organic Semiconductor Thin Films Realized via Thermal Precursor Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible organic semiconductors are regarded as an important class of functional materials enabling their fabrication via a solution&#8208;processed method. However, supramolecularly designed organic thin&#8208;film transistor (OTFT) devices using hydrogen bonds have not been sufficiently developed. This is because of the reduced solubility caused by introducing hydrogen bond sites and the difficulty in controlling molecular orientations and packing structures. Herein, we report a reasonable strategy for the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded semiconductor thin films of a tetrabenzoporphyrin derivative with amide groups using the thermal precursor approach. The thin films are successfully fabricated by thermal conversion of the corresponding precursor in the film state. Assembly structure with a hydrogen&#8208;bond network is revealed by the combination of X&#8208;ray diffraction and infrared p&#8208;polarized multiple&#8208;angle incidence resolution spectrometry. The OTFT devices exhibit high hole mobility of 0.25 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 among hydrogen&#8208;bonded OTFTs reported previously. Notably, we unveiled the high thermal stability of semiconductor films without decreasing device performance in air up to 250 &#176;C. This strategy can become a key methodology to form hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed organic electronic devices, namely supramolecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks in Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2DCOFs) are a unique class of crystalline porous materials interconnected by covalent bonds, which have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their chemical and structural diversity, as well as their applications in adsorption, separation, catalysis, and drug delivery. However, research on the electrical properties of 2DCOFs remains limited, despite their potential in organic electronics. Early studies recognized the poor electrical conductivity of 2DCOFs as a significant obstacle to their application in this field. To overcome this challenge, various strategies have been proposed to enhance conductivity. This review first introduces the concept of computational screening for 2DCOFs and explores approaches to improving their intrinsic conductivity, with a focus on four key aspects: in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport, topology, bandgap, and morphology. It then examines the application of pristine 2DCOFs in organic electronics, including applications in field&#8208;effect transistors, memristors, photodetectors, and chemiresistive gas sensors. We support these strategies with detailed statistical data, providing a comprehensive guide for the design and development of novel 2DCOFs for organic electronics. Finally, we outline future research directions, emphasizing the challenges that remain to be addressed in this emerging area.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternating Binary Droplets&#8208;based Protocell Networks Driven by Heterogeneous Liquid&#8208;liquid Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the emergence of prototissues promotes the evolutionary transformations of protolife, tissue&#8208;like networks derived from cytomimetic systems have been studied by using artificial cells as building blocks to mimic prototissues at a higher&#8208;organizational level. However, liquid&#8208;like networks originating from liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), especially heterogeneous LLPS, are less reported. Herein we report a binary liquid droplet&#8208;based protocell network composed of coacervates and aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS) droplets arranged in an alternating sequence, integrating both associative and segregative LLPS. This network with worm&#8208;like chains can be specifically achieved only when the attached droplets are partially engulfed, mediated by the interfacial tension between coacervate and ATPS droplets. Notably, the interconnected droplets within the network are capable of spatially self&#8208;sorting of biomacromolecules into separate domains, thereby facilitating biomacromolecular extraction and biological reactions within designated droplets. Upon changes in the external environment, the network can be reconfigured to enable morphological regulation of tri&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions. Overall, this work highlights that an all&#8208;aqueous network, coupling of associative and segregative LLPS, can be engineered as a possible route towards a hybrid prototissue&#8208;like system, offering new insights into the design of higher&#8208;order biomimetic systems utilizing liquid soft matter.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Halogen&#8208;Doped PbSnS2 with Optimized Thermoelectric Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we investigate PbSnS2, a wide band gap (1.13 eV) compound, as a promising thermoelectric material for power generation. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals its two&#8208;dimensional layered structure, akin to the GeSe structure type, with Pb and Sn atoms sharing the same crystallographic site. The polycrystalline PbSnS2 exhibits an intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of 0.37 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at 573 K. However, the low carrier concentration (n) leads to suboptimal electrical conductivity (&#963;), capping the ZT value at 0.1. Accordingly, the halogen elements (Cl, Br, and I) are employed as the n&#8208;type dopants to improve the n. The DFT results indicate a significant weakening of Pb/Sn&#8208;S bonds upon halogen doping, contributing to the observed reduction in &#954;lat. Our analysis indicates the activation of multi&#8208;conduction band transport driven by halogen substitution. The PbSnS1.96Br0.04 has a high power factor of five times that of intrinsic PbSnS2.&#160;Halogen&#8208;doping weaken the Pb/Sn&#8208;S bondsand enhanced the phonon scattering, leading to an ultralow &#954;lat of 0.29 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at&#160;873 K for&#160;PbSnS1.96Br0.04. Consequently, PbSnS1.96Br0.04 achieved a maximum ZT value of 0.82 at 873 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Masking of Active Sites in Zinc Metal via Galvanic Replacement Reaction for Highly Reversible Ah&#8208;level Zinc&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc metal anodes suffer from severe dendrite formation and corrosion due to active Zn sites. Here, we introduce an ultrathin, hydrophobic copper phosphate (CP) membrane that selectively masks active Zn sites with electrochemically inactive copper through a galvanic replacement reaction (Zn0 + Cu2+ = Cu0 + Zn2+). Copper is deliberately chosen for its higher redox potential (Cu2+/Cu0; +0.34 V vs. SHE), which effectively inhibits both the corrosion reaction (H+/H2; 0 V vs. SHE) and dendrite formation (Zn2+/Zn0; &#8208;0.76 V vs. SHE). In this way, CP layer masks protrusions and grain boundaries on the zinc anode surface with inactive copper, blocking corrosion and dendritic growth, while its hydrophobic top layer reduces water activity at the interface. Benefiting from the deactivated anode surface, the resulting CP/Zn anode demonstrates exceptional stability, sustaining over 11,000 plating/stripping cycles at 10&#8239;mA&#8239;cm&#8208;2 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98%. Moreover, a CP/Zn||I2 full cell with an N/P ratio of 1.85 achieves an energy density of 187&#8239;Wh&#8239;kg&#8211;1electrodes, while a 1.2&#8208;Ah pouch cell validates its practical feasibility. Our work highlights the importance of designing suitable surface chemistry to protect the Zn metal anode and indicates promising applications in other metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
The anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is promoted by an engineered variant of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA), giving rise to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes with excellent enantiopurity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
The enzyme 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate aldolase (DERA) naturally catalyzes the reversible aldol addition between acetaldehyde and D&#8208;glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate to yield 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribose&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate. Herein we describe the redesign of DERA into a proficient non&#8208;natural peroxygenase that promotes the asymmetric epoxidation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. This repurposed aldolase, named DERA&#8208;EP, is able to utilize H2O2 to accomplish both anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;selective epoxidations of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes to give the corresponding epoxides with moderate to high diastereoselectivity (diastereomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) and excellent enantioselectivity (enantiomeric ratio up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Crystallographic analysis of DERA&#8208;EP in a substrate&#8208;free and substrate&#8208;bound state provides a structural context for the evolved activity, a clear explanation for the high enantioselectivity, and compelling evidence for catalysis via enzyme&#8208;bound iminium ion intermediates. The unprecedented anti&#8208;selectivity of DERA&#8208;EP with multiple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is complementary to the syn&#8208;selectivity of previously reported enzyme&#8208;, metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysts, making DERA&#8208;EP an attractive new asset to the toolbox of epoxidation catalysts.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites are considered promising alternatives to overcome the toxicity in their Pb&#8208;based counterparts. However, it was found that there is a trade&#8208;off between toxicity and efficiency. Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites are intrinsically limited by much stronger nonradiative recombination. Future research should go beyond the Pb and Sn bases.







Abstract
Toxicity remains one of the major challenges that prevent Pb&#8208;based halide perovskites from widespread utilization. Ideally, non&#8208;toxic alternatives can be identified while still maintaining the superior power conversion efficiency of the Pb&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Using the currently most promising candidate, the Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites, as an example, we show that a trade&#8208;off exists between toxicity and efficiency in the Sn&#8208; versus Pb&#8208;based halide perovskites. Indeed, the dominant nonradiative recombination center in the Sn&#8208;based halide perovskites differs from the one in its Pb&#8208;based counterparts, resulting in the nonradiative capture coefficient in CsSnI3 being an order of magnitude higher than that in CsPbI3. We attribute this difference to the band alignment. Our results indicate that development of halide perovskites beyond the Pb and Sn bases is essential for efficient yet environmentally friendly perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Highly O&#8208;Glycosylated MUC7 Glycopeptides for Probing Inhibitory Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of four highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing different glycoforms has been achieved via an efficient chemoenzymatic approach, relying on the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis and enzyme&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that sialylated glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.







Abstract
MUC7, a highly glycosylated protein in saliva and respiratory tract, plays potential roles in facilitating bacterial clearance and preventing microbial invasion. The complexity of glycan structures and multiplicity of glycosylation sites of MUC7 make it very difficult to explore accurate biofunctions against pathogens. Here, we report an efficiently convergent chemoenzymatic approach to firstly synthesize highly O&#8208;glycosylated MUC7 glycopeptides with nine glycosylation sites bearing various glycoforms via the combined use of hydrophobic tag&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and enzymatic&#8208;catalyzed glycan elongation. Biological evaluations reveal that different glycoforms of synthetic MUC7 glycopeptides mediate unique activities against biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, among which sialylated MUC7 glycopeptide exhibits better inhibitory activity and has the potential to develop antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Enhanced Water Permeation in Positively Charged Water Channels: Insights into the Molecular Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The higher permeability of positively charged water channels Ch+ arises from shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes and faster water rotation at the entrance. This is due to weaker H&#8208;bond interactions of NH3+ groups with water compared to COO&#8722; groups in negatively charged channels Ch&#8722;, and K+ ions around COO&#8722; slowing water rotation more than Cl&#8722; ions around NH3+.







Abstract
The high selectivity and permeability of aquaporin proteins in water transport inspired the design of artificial water channels (AWCs). The water transport efficiency of both AQPs and AWCs is influenced by charged groups at the pore entrance. Here, we explored the mechanism of charge effects in pillar[5]arene AWCs using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations demonstrate that the positively charged AWCs (Ch+) exhibit higher water permeability compared to the negatively charged AWCs (Ch&#8722;). The higher permeability of Ch+ channels stems from the shorter hydrogen bond lifetimes between water molecules at the entrance region. In line with this, the rotational dynamics of water is faster in the entrance region of Ch+. Further analyses revealed two factors contributing to the distinct water dynamics in Ch+ and Ch&#8722; channels: the direct interactions of the NH3+/COO&#8722; groups with water and the counter ions (Cl&#8722;/K+) around these charged groups. NH3+ groups in Ch+ channels exert less stable H&#8208;bond interaction with water than the COO&#8722; group in Ch&#8722; channels. K+ ions concentrated around the COO&#8722; groups retard the water rotation more effectively than the Cl&#8722; ions around the NH3+ groups. These findings provide insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance AWCs at the molecular level.

         <title>Exploiting Bis&#8208;Sulfonimide Featuring Multiple d&#8211;p&#960; Bonds to Construct Interlayers for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), distinguished by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently introduced as an adaptable electron&#8208;withdrawing motif to construct interlayer materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). The unique conformational and electronic structure of BSI imparts excellent thickness tolerance and universal applicability to the interlayer materials, leading to 19.80&#8201;% efficiency OSCs with good operational stability.







Abstract
Herein, bis&#8208;sulfonimide (BSI), characterized by multiple d&#8208;p&#960; bonds rather than typical p&#8208;p&#960; bonds, is unprecedently utilized as a general and extendable building block to develop a series of multifunctional cathode interlayer materials (CIMs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). An illustrative CIM, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI, demonstrates favorable alcohol processability, superior work function tunability, appropriate energy levels, strong self&#8208;doping effect, and decent crystallinity. These attributes contribute to its high conductivity exceeding 5&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm, as well as precise optimization of the interfacial connection between the active layer and metal cathode. Therefore, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI&#8208;based OSCs delivers an outstanding efficiency of 18.08&#8201;% using PM6:Y6 active layer while retaining 84&#8201;% of its initial performance after tracking at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 1100&#8197;hours. Additionally, the devices maintain over 94&#8201;% of the optimal performance across a film thickness range of BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI from 5 to 90&#8197;nm. Moreover, BSIz&#8208;TT&#8208;PDI exhibits high compatibility with various active layers, enabling a record efficiency of 19.80&#8201;% with the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO active layer. This work not only introduces a new library of water/alcohol&#8208;soluble n&#8208;type semiconductors containing BSI, while also pioneers the creation of thickness&#8208;insensitive CIMs for stable and efficient OSCs by integrating electron&#8208;withdrawing components with d&#8208;p&#960; bonds.

         <title>A Trimming&#8208;&#960; Strategy for Constructing Functional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Using Metalloporphyrazine Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trimming&#8208;&#960; concept has been developed for the first time for the design and synthesis of a new family of functional conductive MOFs by interconnecting octaamino&#8208;metalloporphyrazine ligands with Cu ions, achieving high and feasibly tunable conductivity, as well as the function for highly sensitive chemiresistive sensing of gases.







Abstract
Developing functional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high electrical conductivity is crucial for their applications as advanced electronic materials. In this work, we for the first time construct a new family of functional and highly conductive MOFs using metalloporphyrazine (MPz) ligands based on a trimming&#8208;&#960; concept via cutting the benzene ring from molecular metallopthalocynine (MPc). The deprotonation&#8208;after&#8208;coordination synthetic method affords crystalline MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with square lattices. Four&#8208;point probe conductivity measurements reveal the high room temperature electrical conductivity of MPz&#8208;based MOFs ranging from 3.5&#215;10&#8722;2 to 1.3&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, two orders of magnitude higher than the MPc&#8208;based MOF counterparts. Temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements and electronic band structure analysis demonstrate ultra&#8208;small activation energies with potential metallic conducting behavior for the MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs. Encapsulation of the aromatic guest molecules with different electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing features allows the conductivity modulation of the CuPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH in a wide range spanning two orders of magnitude.

     alt="A Trimming-&#960; Strategy for Constructing Functional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Using Metalloporphyrazine Units"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trimming-&#960; concept has been developed for the first time for the design and synthesis of a new family of functional conductive MOFs by interconnecting octaamino-metalloporphyrazine ligands with Cu ions, achieving high and feasibly tunable conductivity, as well as the function for highly sensitive chemiresistive sensing of gases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing functional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high electrical conductivity is crucial for their applications as advanced electronic materials. In this work, we for the first time construct a new family of functional and highly conductive MOFs using metalloporphyrazine (MPz) ligands based on a trimming-&#960; concept via cutting the benzene ring from molecular metallopthalocynine (MPc). The deprotonation-after-coordination synthetic method affords crystalline MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with square lattices. Four-point probe conductivity measurements reveal the high room temperature electrical conductivity of MPz-based MOFs ranging from 3.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, two orders of magnitude higher than the MPc-based MOF counterparts. Temperature-dependent conductivity measurements and electronic band structure analysis demonstrate ultra-small activation energies with potential metallic conducting behavior for the MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs. Encapsulation of the aromatic guest molecules with different electron-donating and -withdrawing features allows the conductivity modulation of the CuPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH in a wide range spanning two orders of magnitude. These conductive MPz&#8722;Cu&#8722;NH MOFs with built-in MPz functional units exhibit MPz identity-dependent sensing performance, and realize highly sensitive detection of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using a low driving voltage of 0.1&#8197;V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Co Nanoparticle: An Efficient H&#8208;pump for Pt Single Atoms Towards Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy is applied to create NMP&#8208;SACs consisting of Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC) for exceptional HER activity. As an H&#8208;pump, Con supply hydrogen for Pt1 sites through accelerated water dissociation, enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8722;Pt bridge site&#8594;Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.







Abstract
Introducing OH&#8208;interaction sites to accelerate water dissociation can increase hydrogen coverage on active site surfaces and thus accelerate H&#8208;spillover, leading to an enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Recent studies on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) combined with nano&#8208;metal&#8208;particles (NMPs) have developed various homologous NMP&#8208;SACs, however, synthesizing the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs remains a significant challenge. Particularly for HER catalysts under alkaline conditions, the ideal heterologous structure requires a synergy between non&#8208;noble NMPs with strong oxophilicity and noble&#8208;metal SAs with suitable hydrogen binding energy. Herein, we report a facile pyrolysis&#8208;confinement strategy to create the heterologous NMP&#8208;SACs, comprising Co NMP (Con) and Pt SACs (Pt1) confined within N&#8208;doped hollow polyhedral carbons (Con&#8208;Pt1@NPC). This catalyst demonstrates outstanding HER activity and superior stability in alkaline electrolyzer. Calculations reveal that Co nanoparticles serve as an H&#8208;pump, dissociating water to supply hydrogen to Pt1 sites, thereby enhancing the HER through a short C site&#8594;C&#8722;Pt bridge site&#8594;Pt site hydrogen spillover pathway.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Heteroaryl Ketones by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Carbonylation of Alkenes and N&#8208;Alkenyl Heteroarenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;heteroaryl ketones by nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarbonylation of N&#8208;alkenyl arenes and alkenes is reported. The success of this reaction relies on the sorting of two different alkenes along with the control of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aminoketones serve as important substructures in life science and precursors for the synthesis of diverse value&#8208;added targets in organic and biochemistry. However, direct access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aminoketones from simple and readily available starting materials remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report an unprecedented nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling protocol for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;heteroaryl ketones from alkenes and enamines in the presence of a carbon monoxide surrogate. The success of this reaction relies on the sorting of two different alkenes along with the control of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This reductive&#8208;oxidative carbonylation of enamines and unactivated alkenes featuring the use of a carbon monoxide surrogate allows for the gas&#8208;free streamlined assembly of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;heteroaryl ketones from two distinct alkenes.

         <title>Chiral Bimetallic Pt@Au Octapods with Spiral Four&#8208;Petal Flower&#8208;Like Symmetric Configuration as Sensitive SERS Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral bimetallic Pt@Au octapods with a g&#8208;factor of 0.026 at 724 nm have been fabricated, which endow the strong SERS signal due to the chiral selective enhancement of localized electromagnetic fields. Thus, an ultrasensitive detection method for the early clinical detection of AD is presented.








Abstract
Here, we synthesized chiral bimetallic Pt@Au octapods by using l/d&#8208;cysteine&#8211;threonine (CT) dipeptide as chiral ligands. These had a distinct spiral four&#8208;petal flower&#8208;like symmetric configuration with a twisted concave morphology on each facet. The twisted concave structure of the Pt@Au octapods facilitated intraparticle coupling, resulting in highly concentrated electric fields within the concave regions, thus creating &#8220;hot spots&#8221; that produced a potent surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect. The l&#8208;Pt@Au octapods showed a nearly twofold stronger SERS response to A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 monomers and fibrils than the d&#8208;Pt@Au octapods. The different association constants arose from the unique chiral recognition capabilities of the CT ligands on the surfaces of the l&#8208;Pt@Au octapods, which allowed them to form specific hydrogen bonds with A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 monomers and fibrils, producing significant differences in their Raman spectra. The data from clinical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples showed that the quantitative analysis of the A&#946;42/A&#946;40 ratio with Raman spectroscopy can be used as an effective biomarker for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a cut&#8208;off value of 0.085. Our results pave the way for the use of chiral nanomaterials with strong optical activities in the development of clinical testing instruments with biomedical applications.

         <title>Compensating K Ions Through an Organic Salt in Electrolytes for Practical K&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KSCN, with a low decomposition potential and high solubility in electrolytes, undergoes an oxidative reaction at 3.6&#160;V during the initial charging, releasing active K&#8208;ion and an electrolyte cosolvent (SCN)2. This electrolyte&#8208;based K&#8208;ion compensation approach is compatible with the entire battery system, allowing seamlessly integration into existing battery technologies.








Abstract
K&#8208;ion batteries face significant challenges due to a severe shortage of active K ions, with cathode materials typically containing less than 70%&#160;K ions and first&#8208;cycle irreversible reactions consuming up to 20% more. Conventional K&#8208;ion compensation methods fail to supply sufficient K ions without compromising cell integrity. To address this, we introduce potassium sulfocyanate (KSCN) as an electrolyte additive capable of delivering up to 100% active K ions. During initial charging, KSCN undergoes oxidative decomposition at 3.6&#160;V, releasing active K ions and forming the cosolvent thiocyanogen ((SCN)2). This molecule, meeting diverse electrochemical properties, was identified using unsupervised machine learning and cheminformatics. The approach demonstrated full KSCN conversion and excellent compatibility with all cell components. The presence of (SCN)2 cosolvent enhanced the rate capability of anodes by promoting K&#8208;ion desolvation. In a hard carbon|K0.5Mg0.15[Mn0.8Mg0.05]O2 pouch cell, this approach tripled the capacity through supplying 58% active K ions, showcasing a practical solution for active K&#8208;ion compensation in K&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Concurrent Folding and Fluorescent Functionalization of Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles via Heterogeneous Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled folding of synthetic polymers, mimicking the complex behaviors of biomacromolecules, offers the potential to create sophisticated nanostructures with diverse functionalities. Of great significance is the integration of functionalization directly with chain folding, especially through the incorporation of artificial elements not found in nature, which allows unprecedented flexibility in materials design. However, this approach faces significant synthetic challenge, owing to the intricate integration of multiple chemical processes within a single chain. Here, we present a heterogeneous photochemistry strategy to achieve single&#8208;chain polymer folding alongside concurrent fluorescent functionalization, inspired by the stepwise folding mechanism of green fluorescent protein. This method involves pre&#8208;folding amphiphilic heterograft random copolymers in water, which facilitates heterogeneous aggregation into distinct domains within single&#8208;particle nanostructures, including closely aggregated and molecularly dispersed regions. By employing spatial organization&#8208;dependent photochemical reactivity of cyanostilbene moieties, we enable two concurrent processes: intrachain crosslinking via photodimerization in aggregated domains and fluorescent functionalization via photocyclization to form a green fluorophore in dispersed regions. Additionally, the incorporation of fluorescent dyes via intrachain excitation energy transfer allows for the modulation of emission properties, extending from green to red, and even including white light, making them promising candidates for bioimaging and related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNP&#8208;Supported Solid&#8208;State NMR Approach to Study Nucleic Acids in situ Reveals Berberine&#8208;Stabilized Hoogsteen Structures in Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria are central to cellular bioenergetics, with the unique ability to translate and transcribe a subset of their own proteome. Given the critical importance of energy production, mitochondria seem to utilize higher&#8208;order nucleic acid structures to regulate gene expression, much like nuclei. Herein, we introduce a tailored approach to probe the formation of such structures, specifically G&#8208;quadruplexes, within intact mitochondria using sensitivity&#8208;enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization&#8208;supported solid&#8208;state NMR (DNP&#8208;ssNMR). We acquired NMR spectra on isolated intact isotopically labeled mitochondria treated with berberine, a known high&#8208;affinity G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer. The DNP&#8208;ssNMR data revealed spectral changes in nucleic acid sugar correlations, increased signal intensity for guanosine carbons, and enhanced Hoogsteen hydrogen bond formation, providing evidence of in vivo G&#8208;quadruplex formation in mitochondria. Together, our workflow enables the study of mitochondrial nucleic acid&#8208;ligand interactions at endogenous concentrations within biologically relevant environments by DNP&#8208;ssNMR, paving the way for future research into mitochondrial diseases and their potential treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;Triazenylarenes Enable Vicinal Sandmeyer&#8208;Type Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of two nucleophiles in vicinal position of arenes via Sandmeyer&#8208;type reactions is compromised by the problematic diazotization of ortho&#8208;diaminoarenes. Herein, we show that vicinal substitution reactions are facilitated by the use of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;triazenylarenes. Two distinct methodologies for the synthesis of these triazenes are presented. The first approach involves the sequential conversion of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;iodoarenes into first mono&#8208; and then bis&#8208;triazenylarenes. The second procedure is based on Ru&#8208;catalyzed [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions between diynes and a 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;triazenylalkyne. The two triazene groups in the products can be substituted sequentially by a range of nucleophiles including fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, hydroxide, methoxide, and acetamide.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE Bottlebrush Polymers: Verification of Internal Crowdedness in Bottlebrush Polymers using the AIE Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bottlebrush polymers, characterized by densely grafted side chains along a central backbone, have gained significant interest due to their unique properties in bulk and solution states. However, a comprehensive understanding of the internal crowdedness within single polymer chains in dilute solutions remains challenging, and direct evidence to visualize and manifest this effect is scarce. AIE offers a novel method to address this challenge. To achieve this, a vinyl&#8208;derivatized AIE monomer was polymerized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in a controlled way. Afterwards, the end group of the synthesized polymer chain was transformed to azide which was coupled with an alkyne&#8208;derivatized norbornene unit using click chemistry to produce the macromonomer. ROMP of the norbornenyl macromonomer using Grubbs catalyst (G3), resulted in well&#8208;defined bottlebrush polymers in a highly efficient way. We studied the polymerization behavior and characterized the single chain conformation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution together with coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CG&#8208;MD) simulation. Photoluminescence investigation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution revealed the expected AIE phenomenon, thus verifying the steric crowding effects within bottlebrush polymers. By doing this, our research not only broadens bottlebrush polymer library but also provides insights into bottlebrush polymer chain study for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Sodium Ion Conductivity in Pristine Na8SnP4 &#8211; Synthesis, Structure and Properties of the two Polymorphs LT&#8208; Na8SnP4 and HT&#8208;Na8SnP4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high ionic conductivities in solid state electrolytes is crucial for the development of efficient all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries. Considering future availability and sustainability, sodium materials hold promises for an alternative for lithium materials in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, due to the higher abundance. Here we report on a sodium phosphide ion conductor Na8SnP4 with a conductivity of 0.53 mS cm&#8208;1&#160;at room temperature&#160;as pristine material.&#160;Due to the simple tetrahedral SnP4 structure units, Na8SnP4 has potential for optimization through aliovalent substitution as successfully applied in sulfide&#8208;based materials. Na8SnP4 is easily accessible from exclusively abundant elements and forms a high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature polymorph, which further allows for a fundamental understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship. Both polymorphs are structurally characterized by synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and MAS&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. Ion conductivity and activation energy for ion mobility was determined by temperature dependent impedance spectroscopy and static 23Na&#8208;NMR measurements. Both MEM analysis of scattering densities as well as structure determination by Rietveld&#8208;methods hint for ionic motion between special Na positions in the structure and that ion migration proceeds along pathways passing triangular faces of neighboring tetrahedral and octahedral voids. The specific voids filling in the disordered HT&#8208;phase is found to be a crucial parameter for ion migration.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry to Examine the Effects of Porosity and Catalyst&#8208;Support Interactions on CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bis&#8208;porphyrin nanocages (M2BiCage, M = FeCl, Co, Zn) and their host&#8208;guest complexes with C60 and C70 were used to examine how molecular porosity and interactions with carbon nanomaterials affect the CO2 reduction activity of metalloporphyrin electrocatalysts. The cages were found to adsorb on carbon black to provide electrocatalytic inks with excellent accessibilities of the metal sites (~50 %) even at high metal loadings (2500 nmol cm&#8722;2), enabling good activity for reducing CO2 to CO. A complex of C70 bound inside (FeCl)2BiCage achieved high current densities for CO formation at low overpotentials (|jCO| &gt; 7 mA cm&#8208;2, &#951; = 320 mV; &gt; 13.5 mA cm&#8208;2, &#951; = 520 mV) with &#8805; 95 % Faradaic efficiency (FECO), and Co2BiCage achieved high turnover frequencies (~1300 h&#8208;1, &#951; = 520 mV) with 90 % FECO. In general, blocking the pore with C60 or C70 improved the catalytic performance of (FeCl)2BiCage and had only small effects on Co2BiCage, indicating that the good catalytic properties of the cages cannot be attributed to their internal pores. Neither enhanced electron transfer rates nor metal&#8208;fullerene interactions appear to underlie the ability of C60/C70 to improve the performance of (FeCl)2BiCage, in contrast to effects often proposed for other carbon nanosupports.</dc:description>

         <title>Degradation of Glyphosate to Benign N&#8208;Formyl Glycine Using MOF&#8208;808 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glyphosate (N&#8208;phosphonomethyl glycine, GPh) is an industrial herbicide used worldwide in modern agricultural practices. With the growing concerns about cumulative environmental and health effects, pathways for catalytic GPh degradation to benign products are becoming a pressing societal need. This report demonstrates that Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF&#8208;808) with different crystal sizes and designed defect sites can be employed as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the complete degradation of GPh at room temperature. Importantly, the degradation mechanism produces N&#8722;formyl glycine and hydroxymethyl&#8208;phosphonate, which are largely innocuous chemicals, especially when compared to more common decomposition products that typically result in GPh degradation. Nanocrystalline MOF&#8722;808 (nMOF&#8722;808) exhibits enhanced reactivity than larger MOF&#8208;808 crystals, attributed to the higher coordination of hydroxyl and water molecules to the secondary building units (SBU) as determined using a range of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques. These studies indicate that the crystal size&#8208;dependency in GPh degradation is related to structural modifications on coordinative unsaturated Zr site that promote the fast exchange of weakly bonded ligands. Taken together, this study demonstrates that GPh degradation can be optimized through ligand field tuning in MOFs, which can help improve overall reactivity while also pushing the reaction toward desirable, non&#8208;toxic products.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic, Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated and Directed Diastereoselective Oxidation of Inert C&#8722;H Bonds in Cyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An I(III)&#8208;mediated, selective oxidation of remote C&#8722;H bonds is reported. This approach relies on the generation of a destabilized carbocation that is coerced into a predetermined position through charge relocation. In&#8208;depth experiments give insight into the mechanistic intricacies of this highly diastereoselective transformation.







Abstract
Over the past three decades, the functionalization of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds has become a workhorse of synthesis. In the field of C&#8722;H bond oxygenation, most established methods hinge on single&#8208;electron reactivity, encountering challenges pertaining to regio&#8208; and/or stereocontrol. Herein, we describe a conceptually distinct strategy relying on the unique features of carbocation chemistry. Our iodine(III)&#8208;mediated method achieves the diastereoselective oxygenation of remote C&#8722;H bonds at traditionally unreactive sites and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization at steroidal frameworks as well as an unusual chirality relay.

         <title>Reinforced Nonlinear Optical Performances Induced by P&#8208;P Homoatomic Bond in Phosphide SrIn3Si4P11</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of the P&#8722;P bond achieved the spectacle of &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;: the title phosphide SrIn3Si4P11 demonstrates superior second&#8208;harmonic generation response, wider band gap, and larger birefringence compared to its kindred SrIn3Si4P9.







Abstract
Phosphides exhibit great promise as a nonlinear optical (NLO) material system; however, the challenge of simultaneously achieving robust second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, wide band gap, and large birefringence within a single structure remains daunting. Herein, by leveraging the design concept of &#8220;multi&#8208;asymmetric&#8208;module integration&#8221;, we have successfully harvested a brand&#8208;new non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphide SrIn3Si4P11, which showcases the characteristics of a three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by diverse [Si3P10] and [In3P10] trimers, as well as P&#8722;P homoatomic bonds. The introduction of P&#8722;P bond distinguishes SrIn3Si4P11 from the kindred SrIn3Si4P9, ultimately resulting in &#8220;killing three birds with one stone&#8221;, including a remarkable 30&#8208;fold enhancement in SHG intensity, a 2.5&#8208;fold increase in birefringence, as well as a 0.50&#8197;eV broadening in band gap compared to SrIn3Si4P9. Theoretically calculated analysis reveals that the &#960; interactions and the significant polarization anisotropy of the P&#8722;P bond are critical factors contributing to the enhancement of NLO performances. The present study uncovers the pivotal significance of P&#8722;P bond in structural design and NLO properties optimization, and delineates a clear research direction for the extensive advancement of phosphides NLO materials.

         <title>Ferritin&#8208;Inspired Encapsulation and Stabilization of Gold Nanoclusters for High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferritin&#8208;inspired covalent organic cage encapsulates gold nanoclusters, stabilizing them against aggregation while achieving exceptional photothermal conversion efficiency and solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor generation performance. This system demonstrates durability, salt tolerance, and scalability, advancing sustainable solutions for energy and water purification technologies. 








Abstract
Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) are highly promising for applications in photothermal conversion due to their exceptional surface area and optical properties. However, their high surface energy often leads to aggregation, compromising stability and performance. To address this, we developed a ferritin&#8208;inspired covalent organic cage with a near&#8208;enclosed cavity to physically stabilize AuNCs. This superphane cage coordinates with Au3&#8314; ions, forming highly stable and uniform AuNCs upon reduction. The encapsulated AuNCs exhibit broad absorption (250&#8211;2500&#160;nm) and achieve remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency of 92.8% under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. At low power densities (0.5&#160;W/cm2), temperatures reach 150 &#176;C, and under one&#8208;sun illumination (1&#160;kW/m2), the solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor generation efficiency reaches 95.1%, with a water evaporation rate of 2.35&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1. Even after 20 seawater desalination cycles, the system maintains a stable evaporation rate of 2.24&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, demonstrating excellent salt tolerance and durability. This ferritin&#8208;inspired strategy offers a robust platform for enhancing the stability and performance of AuNCs, advancing sustainable energy and water purification technologies.

         <title>Photogeneration and Visualization of a Surface&#8208;Stabilized Dinitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this communication we report the formation of a stable, surface&#8208;supported dinitrene achieved through the photolysis of a diazide precursor on an Au(111) metal substrate. We combine high&#8208;resolution scanning probe techniques with theoretical calculations, providing the first real&#8208;space imaging of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface and exploring the associated photoreaction mechanism.







Abstract
Nitrenes are known as key intermediates in various chemical reactions. Nitrene transfer reactions are particularly effective for synthesizing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds, where metal catalysts play a crucial role in controlling nitrene reactivity and selectivity. In this study, we demonstrate the formation of a stable surface&#8208;supported dinitrene on Au(111) through UV irradiation of its diazide precursor, characterized by scanning probe techniques. The photoreaction mechanism is elucidated with wavelength&#8208;dependent experiments and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. Our findings present the first real&#8208;space visualization of a metal nitrene adsorbed on a surface, highlighting its potential in catalysis and surface functionalization.

         <title>Targeted Degradation of ZBP1 with Covalent PROTACs for Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Treatment of Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a covalent PROTAC (C&#8208;PROTAC) was developed to achieve precise and efficient degradation of ZBP1 by leveraging DNA aptamer targeting and NASA&#8208;mediated covalent binding. This approach suppresses necroptosis and mitigates inflammation, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for infection&#8208;induced inflammation and diseases. The findings highlight the potential of targeted protein degradation in modulating inflammatory responses and advancing treatment options.








Abstract
Z&#8208;DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) has emerged as a critical pathogen&#8208;sensing protein that upon activation, triggers necroptotic signaling cascades, leading to a potent inflammatory response and potentially causing significant tissue damage. However, available drugs specifically developed for the effective inhibition or degradation of ZBP1 is still lacking so far. In this study, we developed a potent covalent recognition&#8208;based PROTAC (C&#8208;PROTAC) molecule for the degradation of ZBP1. It consists of a DNA aptamer as the recognition moiety and an E3 enzyme&#8208;recruiting unit, connected by a linker containing N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamides (NASA) groups. The DNA aptamer specifically binds to ZBP1, while the NASA&#8208;containing linker facilitates the formation of a covalent bond between the PROTAC and the target protein. The E3 ligase&#8208;recruiting unit then directs the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system to degrade the ZBP1&#8208;PROTAC complex. This approach combines the high specificity of DNA aptamers with the efficiency of covalent binding and the degradation&#8208;inducing capabilities of PROTACs, providing a powerful tool for targeted protein degradation. The successful application of this technology to ZBP1 highlights its potential for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;associated proteins and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Volatile Imide Additives with Large Dipole and Special Film Formation Kinetics Enable High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three volatile imide additives with large dipole moments which improved the performance of the OSCs device by manipulating the crystallization process of the acceptor were reported. These additives could induce the acceptor to first nucleate and then grow, forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains and improving charge transport. One of the highest power conversion efficiencies of 19.04% was achieved for D18:L8&#8208;BO devices treated with pClPA.







Abstract
Large dipole moment additives have strong interactions with the host materials, which can optimize morphology and improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these additives are difficult to remove due to their strong intermolecular interactions, which may impair stability. Developing volatile additives with large dipole moments is challenging. Herein, we first report volatile imide additives that could effectively improve the performance of OSCs through morphology modification. Three additives N&#8208;(o&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (oClPA), N&#8208;(m&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (mClPA), and N&#8208;(p&#8208;chlorophenyl)phthalimide (pClPA) were screened to investigate the effort of positional isomerization on molecular configuration and interaction. These additives (ClPAs) have larger dipole moments (2.0664 Debye for oClPA, 4.2361 Debye for mClPA, and 4.7896 Debye for pClPA) compared to reported solid additives. In contrast to traditional simultaneous nucleation and crystal growth, ClPAs could induce the acceptor to nucleate first and then grow, which contributes to forming high&#8208;quality acceptor domains with better crystallinity. To our knowledge, this unique film formation kinetics was reported first. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 treated with pClPA was improved from 16.13&#8201;% to 18.58&#8201;%. Additive pClPA also performed well in PM6:L8&#8208;BO, PM6:Y6, and D18:L8&#8208;BO systems, and a high PCE of 19.04&#8201;% was achieved. Our results indicate using imide unit to construct solid additives is a simple and effective strategy, and the positional isomerization of halogen atom also has a large effect on the photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Electrochemical Responsive Alginate Chains Rendered Sol&#8208;to&#8208;Gel Gradient Electrolyte towards Practical Ah&#8208;level Zinc Metal Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte was designed to break the trade&#8208;off between high ionic conductivity from aqueous electrolyte and the stable interface from hydrogel electrolyte, through the high ionic conductive bulk electrolyte and lean&#8208;water hydrogel&#8208;like state interface. This work paves a new way for electrolyte design towards pratical zinc metal battery.







Abstract
Zinc metal batteries have been considered as an appealing candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage devices, but are hindered by the instable interface. Herein, we design a sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel gradient electrolyte through the simultaneous electrochemical deposition of Zn2+ and alginate. The electrochemical gelation of alginate creates a gradient sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel interface and enables the high ionic conductivity, where vehicular mechanism dominated transport is maintained in the bulk electrolyte, while a lean&#8208;water hydrogel like state is created at the Zn/electrolyte interface to reduce water activity. The electrochemical active alginate undergoes a gelation process to form an egg&#8208;shell to confine the Zn2+, rendering a 2D growth mode and inhibiting dendrite growth. By taking the advantages of both fast ion transport and stable interface, the full cell based on Zn/VO2 achieved a stable cycling of 400 cycles at an industrial&#8208;level areal capacity of over 4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity retention of 89.25&#8201;%. Additionally, we demonstrate the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell, which stably operates for over 200 cycles with an almost unity average coulombic efficiency (over 99.90&#8201;%). By demonstrating the remarkable performance, our work represents an advancement in zinc metal batteries toward a practical scale and is expected to set a stepping stone for transformative advancements in energy storage technologies.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity over an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6&#8197;V and a large CO partial current density of 608.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) coupled with biomass oxidation using renewable electricity is considered as a promising strategy for carbon management. However, achieving both high selectivity and large current density over wide potential window remains a significant challenge, hindering practical applications. In this study, a Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity across an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6&#8197;V, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Remarkably, this high CO selectivity is maintained above 98&#8201;% even after 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation at an industrial current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability. When integrated into a solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90&#8201;% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained. Theoretical calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting step for the CO2 reduction reaction varies with the applied potential, and the synergistic interaction between Ni and Fe atoms effectively lowers the limiting energy barrier. This work offers valuable insights for the strategic design and synthesis of catalysts with high activity and selectivity across wide potential window, providing a versatile platform for coupling CO2 reduction with diverse anodic biomass oxidation reactions and renewable energy sources.

         <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes by Interfacial Engineering of Atomically Precise Silver Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) disrupt the hydrogen bond network through the surface amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands, activate the interfacial water, and enrich the alkyne molecules. In addition, their unique enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets adsorb alkyne molecules through the &#963;&#8208;bonding mode, allowing the timely desorption of alkene, thereby improving the activity and selectivity of alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Owing to its green energy and hydrogen sources, electrocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes is an attractive alternative for industrial alkene production. However, its broad application is hindered by low selectivity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to side reactions like over&#8208;hydrogenation to alkanes. Here, we demonstrate that atomically precise Ag25(MHA)18 nanoclusters (NCs) can electrocatalyze alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation with 98&#8201;% conversion, 99&#8201;% selectivity, and 85&#8201;% FE, in a broad substrate pool. This is achieved by engineering the local environment at the catalytically active sites. We leverage amphiphilic MHA (6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid) ligands to pre&#8208;concentrate water molecules and alkynes near the ligand&#8208;layer/Ag25 interface. Long&#8208;chain ligands can disrupt the hydrogen&#8208;bond network at the interface, the high negative charge of Ag25 can attract weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water through counterions and promote the generation of active hydrogen (H*), while the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic pockets on the surface of Ag25 NCs facilitate adsorption of terminal alkynes via &#963;&#8208;bonding to the surface Ag atoms. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the preference of the &#963;&#8208;bonding model of alkyne and further revealed the facile release of product alkene. This work not only exemplifies an atomically precise interface engineering strategy to control the local environment of active sites for optimized activity and selectivity.

         <title>Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Ethylene&#8211;Acrylate Copolymers Synthesized with Highly Active Neutral Nickel Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh molecular weight ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers are directly synthesized with outstanding catalytic activities using a highly active, neutral, single&#8208;component nickel catalyst, which maintain the essential bulk properties of UHMWPE, reach an impressive tensile strength of 44&#160;MPa, and possess improved surface and dyeing properties.








Abstract
Molecular weight is a crucial parameter in catalytic olefin polymerization to determine the thermomechanical properties of polymers. Elevating the molecular weight of ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymer, a typical polar polyolefin has been a persistent challenge. This study presents the direct synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW) ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers using a highly active, neutral, single&#8208;component phosphine&#8208;phenolate nickel catalyst under mild conditions. The coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization of ethylene and various acrylates, such as methyl acrylate, n&#8208;butyl acrylate, and t&#8208;butyl acrylate, can yield ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers with UHMWs (Mn) ranging from 1000 to 2700&#160;kDa, with exceptional activities of up to 4.03&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. A relatively large&#8208;scale synthesis (30&#8211;50&#160;g) of UHMW ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers was notably achieved. The properties of these UHMW ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers were comprehensively evaluated, demonstrating that these copolymers retained the bulk properties of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) while exhibiting improved surface and dyeing properties. In particular, the tensile strength of the ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers significantly increased with higher molecular weights, reaching 44&#160;MPa (147&#160;MPa after a predrawing ratio of 3.1), which is comparable to that of UHMWPE.

         <title>Mechanochemically Enabled Formal Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Between Aryl Ethers and Aryl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving two electrophilic reagents are essential in modern synthetic chemistry. This study investigates a novel nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling between aryl ethers and aryl fluorides. The method is characterized by mild conditions, short reaction times, and the production of a range of aryl coupling compounds with high yields. Mechanistic studies show that nickel is involved in the activation of both C&#9472;O and C&#9472;F bonds.








Abstract
Reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving two electrophilic reagents have become increasingly important in modern synthetic chemistry. Previous studies have investigated electrophilic reagents featuring zero or one inactive bond; however, reactions involving electrophilic reagents with two inactive bonds remain unexplored. This study presents the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction under mechanical conditions, involving aryl ethers and aryl fluorides, both of which contain inactive bonds. The reaction successfully synthesized a series of multifunctional biphenyl compounds, specifically including several sparingly soluble substrates that are challenging to prepare in a solvent system. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that nickel and magnesium play a crucial role in the activation of C&#9472;F bonds. This novel coupling reaction offers a beneficial approach for polymer degradation and the development of luminescent materials.

         <title>Crystallization Modulation and Comprehensive Defect Passivation by Carbonyl Functionalized Spacer Cation Towards High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic modulation strategy was proposed of perovskite crystallization and the defects at grain boundaries (GBs) and interface by using a novel carbonyl functionalized spacer cation. By this synergetic strategy, improved crystallization, reduced defect density, released residual stress and minimized carrier nonradiative recombination losses were accomplished simultaneously. The inverted devices delivered a champion PCE of 25.77&#8201;%.







Abstract
The inverted cesium/formamidinium (CsFA)&#8208;based methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite solar cells possess great potential in simultaneously realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent stability. However, the uncontrollable crystallization process and poor film quality hinder further enhancement of photovoltaic performance and operational stability. Herein, we propose a synergistic modulation strategy of perovskite crystallization and the defects at grain boundaries (GBs) and interface by using a novel carbonyl functionalized spacer cation. L&#8208;Alanine benzyl ester hydrochloride (L&#8208;ABEHCl) containing carbonyl functionalized ammonium cation is incorporated into perovskite precursor solution, increasing the nucleation rate and reducing the crystal growth rate because of its strong interaction with precursor components, leading to increased grain size and crystallinity. No 2D perovskite is formed for L&#8208;ABEHCl as additive whereas 2D perovskite is formed upon L&#8208;ABEHCl post&#8208;treatment. It is revealed that FA+ and Cs+ in precursor solution suppress the formation of 2D perovskite. As a result, the L&#8208;ABEHCl passivates the defects at GBs in the form of organic salts and passivates interface defects in the form of 2D perovskite. Due to minimized carrier nonradiative recombination losses, the inverted devices using synergistic modulation strategy achieve a maximum PCE of 25.77&#8201;% (certified stabilized PCE of 25.59&#8201;%), which is one of the highest PCEs ever reported for the devices based on vacuum flash evaporation method. The unencapsulated target device maintains 90.85&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 2300&#8197;h of continuous maximum power point tracking, among the most excellent stabilities accomplished by inverted devices.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Acetaldehyde Production from CO2 and H2O via Synergistic Vacancies and Atomically Dispersed Cu Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of high bonding energy in photocatalytic CO2 conversion and the complexity and false positives in product detection associated with sacrificial agents, sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu are synergistically combined to enhance CO2 activation and lower the activation energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling on Cd0.6Zn0.4S, thereby achieving efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents for CH3CHO production.







Abstract
Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) is of great industrial importance and serves as a key intermediate in various organic transformations. Photocatalytic production of acetaldehyde from CO2 represents a sustainable route compared to conventional oxidation processes. However, current photocatalytic systems often face challenges, including limited product selectivity and dependence on sacrificial reagents. Here, we present a Cd0.6Zn0.4S (CZS) photocatalyst co&#8208;modified with sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu (Cu/CZS&#8722;Vs) for the efficient conversion of CO2 to acetaldehyde. Charge density analysis reveals that sulfur vacancies induce charge accumulation around the adjacent metal atoms, creating active sites that strongly anchor CO2 and H+, thereby promoting CO2 conversion while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The atomically dispersed Cu sites facilitate the conversion of key intermediates (i.e., *CHO and *CO) to the crucial C2 intermediate *OCCHO, which can subsequently be converted to acetaldehyde. As a result, this catalyst achieves an acetaldehyde yield of 121.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of ca. 80&#8201;% via photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents, along with a quantum efficiency of ca. 0.53&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, underscoring its potential for practical CO2 conversion applications. These results are expected to pave the way for future developments in green chemical processes.

&lt;p&gt;To address the challenge of high bonding energy in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion and the complexity and false positives in product detection associated with sacrificial agents, sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu are synergistically combined to enhance CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and lower the activation energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling on Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;S, thereby achieving efficient photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents for CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetaldehyde (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO) is of great industrial importance and serves as a key intermediate in various organic transformations. Photocatalytic production of acetaldehyde from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents a sustainable route compared to conventional oxidation processes. However, current photocatalytic systems often face challenges, including limited product selectivity and dependence on sacrificial reagents. Here, we present a Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;S (CZS) photocatalyst co-modified with sulfur vacancies and atomically dispersed Cu (Cu/CZS&#8722;Vs) for the efficient conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to acetaldehyde. Charge density analysis reveals that sulfur vacancies induce charge accumulation around the adjacent metal atoms, creating active sites that strongly anchor CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby promoting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The atomically dispersed Cu sites facilitate the conversion of key intermediates (i.e., *CHO and *CO) to the crucial C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate *OCCHO, which can subsequently be converted to acetaldehyde. As a result, this catalyst achieves an acetaldehyde yield of 121.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a selectivity of ca. 80&#8201;% via photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion in the absence of sacrificial agents, along with a quantum efficiency of ca. 0.53&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, underscoring its potential for practical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion applications. These results are expected to pave the way for future developments in green chemical processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective Electrocatalytic 1,4&#8208;NADH Regeneration Based on Host&#8211;Guest Recognition Mediated by Cucurbit[8]uril on NiO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the catalytic pocket and enzyme&#8211;substrate interaction, an electrochemical 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration route was designed based on host&#8211;guest recognition mediated by cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) on NiO. The anchored CB[8] could preorganize the NAD+ in a reaction&#8208;ready configuration to approach the Ni&#8208;Had on NiO, resulting in a high regioselectivity up to 97.8%. 








Abstract
Efficient regeneration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) cofactors, particularly 1,4&#8208;NADH, is crucial for advancing oxidoreductase catalysis. Electrocatalysis provides a promising route for 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration, but an expensive catalyst, typically a rhodium organometallic complex, is frequently required to guarantee the high selectivity of 1,4&#8208;NADH, significantly limiting its large&#8208;scale application. Herein, inspired by the catalytic pocket and enzyme&#8211;substrate interaction in nature, a direct electrochemical 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration route was designed by modification of the surface of nickel oxide (NiO) with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) (denoted as CB[8]&#8211;NiO). The host&#8211;guest interaction between CB[8] and NAD+ was proved, which is similar in principle to substrate&#8211;enzyme&#8208;specific recognition. CB[8] acted as a catalytic pocket for NAD+, providing a suitable cavity volume to accommodate the positively charged nicotinamide part of NAD+. NAD+ entered the CB[8] cavity and approached the surface&#8208;adsorbed hydrogen atoms on NiO in a reaction&#8208;ready configuration to achieve the regioselective 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. Remarkably higher 1,4&#8208;NADH selectivity of 97.8% on CB[8]&#8211;NiO was obtained at &#8722;0.47&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) than that of bare NiO (77.4%).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;quality, benzobisoxazole&#8208;bridged, fully conjugated covalent organic frameworks were constructed for the first time. COF&#8208;JLU45 displayed an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 272.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with superior reusability via water splitting under visible&#8208;light irradiation.








Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have attracted extensive interest in solar energy to hydrogen conversion. However, insufficient light harvesting and difficult exciton dissociation severely limit the improvement of photocatalytic activity for COFs, thereby impeding the progression of this advanced field. In this work, two benzobisoxazole&#8208;bridged and fully conjugated 2D&#8208;COFs with triazine (COF&#8208;JLU44) and pyrene (COF&#8208;JLU45) units were constructed for the first time via Knoevenagel polycondensation, and they hold long&#8208;range ordered structures, largely acceptable surface area, and fascinating photoelectric properties. Significantly, COF&#8208;JLU45 exhibits an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 272.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and superior reusability in the presence of 1.0 wt% Pt under light irradiation, coupled with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 12.9% at a long wavelength of 600&#160;nm. Multiple spectroscopy and theoretical simulation demonstrate the ingenious design of COF&#8208;JLU45 widen its light absorption and effectively promote the exciton dissociation. This finding contributes valuable insights for constructing metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and utilization.

         <title>Towards Ultra&#8208;Stable Wide&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries by Using Ion&#8208;Sieving Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;single&#8208;ion conducting COF&#8208;based separator (COF&#8208;Zn) was developed to enhance the performance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) under challenging conditions. By integrating the COF&#8208;Zn separator with limited electrolyte, this approach achieves exceptional cycling stability across both organic and inorganic cathode&#8208;based batteries, presenting a versatile strategy for constructing ultra&#8208;stable AZIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) offer notable advantages in safety and cost&#8208;efficiency, but Zn dendrite growth and unstable interfacial reactions hinder their commercial viability. A crucial factor in addressing these challenges lies in optimizing the separator to regulate ion transport and stabilize electrode interfaces. Herein, we propose a covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based separator with quasi&#8208;single&#8208;ion conduction, specifically a Zn2+&#8208;substituted sulfonate COF (COF&#8208;Zn) membrane, designed to tackle these issues. Featuring a high Zn transference number (0.87) and a thin 25&#8197;&#956;m profile, the COF&#8208;Zn separator allows for reduced electrolyte usage (20&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1) while effectively minimizing cathode dissolution. Its quasi&#8208;single&#8208;ion conductivity and electronegative properties improve Zn anode's stability by lowering water activity. This separator enables ultra&#8208;stable AZIBs, as demonstrated in various full cells including Zn//4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrenetetrone (PTO), Zn//I2 and Zn//V2O5. Remarkably, the Zn//PTO cell achieves an energy density of 260&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, 100&#8201;% capacity retention under reduced electrolyte conditions, and stable all&#8208;weather cycling from &#8722;40 to +100&#8201;&#176;C with a customized electrolyte.

         <title>Activating La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni Bridge in Ordered Macroporous Interface for Electrochemical Urea Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge was constructed and activated in the three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous La2O3&#8208;NiO, which acted as a kind of superior anode catalyst in urea electrooxidation and purification. 3DOM morphology increased the contact surface of the material with the solution and accelerates mass transfer. The electron transfer from La to Ni was proved to accelerat the formation of active phase, C=O adsorption and N&#8722;H bond cleavage during the catalysis. It provides insights from the microscale to the macroscale level demonstrating how morphology engineering and La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge boost urea oxidation performance.







Abstract
Electrochemical treatment of urea wastewater purification significantly aids in environmental protection, but it remains a considerable challenge in designing high performance anode urea oxidation electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a La&#8208;induced three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) NiO heterostructure to improve Ni sites electron density for urea electrooxidation by activating the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge. This material demonstrated exceptional performance in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device, characterized by a low cell voltage (1.49&#8197;V @ 80&#8201;&#176;C) and 280&#8197;h stability test at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density (25&#8201;&#176;C) and displayed promising efficiency in urea wastewater purification. Permeation experiments revealed the crucial role of 3DOM morphological in facilitating mass transfer processes. A high valence nickel mechanism (HNM) on the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge during catalysis was proposed, based on various in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Experimentally, in situ Raman and UV&#8208;vis spectra demonstrated that Ni active species Ni&#948;+ (&#948;&#8805;3) promote urea oxidation kinetics, while in situ ATR&#8208;IR proved strong adsorption of C=O with Ni sites and the enhancement of urea N&#8722;H bonds cleavage, supporting the HNM. This work enables us to underscore the critical importance of La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge with 3DOM architectures and promising contributions to urea wastewater purification.

&lt;p&gt;The La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge was constructed and activated in the three-dimensional ordered macroporous La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NiO, which acted as a kind of superior anode catalyst in urea electrooxidation and purification. 3DOM morphology increased the contact surface of the material with the solution and accelerates mass transfer. The electron transfer from La to Ni was proved to accelerat the formation of active phase, C=O adsorption and N&#8722;H bond cleavage during the catalysis. It provides insights from the microscale to the macroscale level demonstrating how morphology engineering and La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge boost urea oxidation performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical treatment of urea wastewater purification significantly aids in environmental protection, but it remains a considerable challenge in designing high performance anode urea oxidation electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a La-induced three-dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) NiO heterostructure to improve Ni sites electron density for urea electrooxidation by activating the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge. This material demonstrated exceptional performance in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device, characterized by a low cell voltage (1.49&#8197;V @ 80&#8201;&#176;C) and 280&#8197;h stability test at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density (25&#8201;&#176;C) and displayed promising efficiency in urea wastewater purification. Permeation experiments revealed the crucial role of 3DOM morphological in facilitating mass transfer processes. A high valence nickel mechanism (HNM) on the La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni bridge during catalysis was proposed, based on various in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Experimentally, in situ Raman and UV-vis spectra demonstrated that Ni active species Ni&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&#948;&#8805;3) promote urea oxidation kinetics, while in situ ATR-IR proved strong adsorption of C=O with Ni sites and the enhancement of urea N&#8722;H bonds cleavage, supporting the HNM. This work enables us to underscore the critical importance of La&#8722;O&#8722;Ni electron bridge with 3DOM architectures and promising contributions to urea wastewater purification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming Boundaries: Towards the Ambient Aqueous Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The traditional solvothermal method, often requiring harsh conditions, has limited the large&#8208;scale synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This mini&#8208;review highlights recent advances in the aqueous synthesis of COFs. It also presents the limitations and future perspectives of the aqueous synthesis methods.







Abstract
The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has traditionally been carried out under strict solvothermal and anaerobic conditions. The utilization of organic solvents in such reactions not only carries significant costs but also imposes a great burden on the environment. The fabrication of COFs using alternative synthetic pathways has, therefore, seen rapid development in recent years and much attention has been placed on green and sustainable methods in particular. The synthesis of COFs in purely aqueous media, however, remains challenging due to the delicate nature of the chemical reactions and the crystallization process in water. This mini&#8208;review discusses different synthetic strategies for the construction of crystalline COFs in aqueous media and offers a perspective on the future development of facile COF synthesis in ambient conditions.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8211;H Arylations and Alkenylations of 2&#8208;Aminobiaryls with Atmospheric Air as the Sole Oxidant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes a mild, enantioselective method for the arylation and alkenylation of 2&#8208;aminobiaryl compounds to produce highly valuable, enantioenriched anilines exhibiting axial chirality. The kinetic resolution process is catalyzed by Pd(II) in combination with an isobutyryl&#8208;protected isoleucine ligand (iBoc&#8208;Ile&#8208;OH), using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant and DMSO as cosolvent. The products can be divergently manipulated to give optically active, axially chiral derivatives of high interest for asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Optically active 2&#8208;aminobiaryls are valuable chiral frameworks with broad applications in catalysis, synthetic chemistry, and materials science. Here, we present a simple and practical methodology for their asymmetric synthesis via enantioselective palladium catalyzed C&#8722;H arylations or alkenylations of racemic precursors. The methodology utilizes a kinetic resolution strategy, producing two highly valuable enantioenriched axially chiral molecules: the C&#8722;C coupling product and the unreacted starting material. Notably, we have established reaction conditions that enable the in situ regeneration of the active Pd(II) catalyst using atmospheric air as the sole oxidant. Finally, we showcase the synthetic utility of this approach by preparing several derivatives relevant to the field of asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Tuning Zn2+ Deposition Kinetics towards Deep&#8208;Reversible Zinc Metal Batteries with All&#8208;Climate Adaptability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steric hindrance effect of reduced glutathione (RGSH) tunes Zn2+ electrochemical reduction kinetics to match Zn2+ migration, suppressing the concentration polarization. RGSH with abundant hydrogen bond donors and acceptors reconfigures H&#8208;bond networks for all&#8208;climate adaptability, eliminating &#8220;dead Zn&#8221; at low temperature and HER corrosion at high temperature. Thus, ultra&#8208;long lifespan and wide service temperature AZMBs are achieved.







Abstract
Uncontrollable Zn dendrites and severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) hamper the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries, which closely related to the deposition kinetics and thermodynamic stability of Zn anode. In this work, we returned to the classic perspectives of kinetics and thermodynamics, introducing a small amount of reduced glutathione (RGSH) to reshape the kinetic behavior of Zn2+ deposition and increasing the thermodynamic energy barrier of HER. Specifically, the steric hindrance effect of RGSH tuned the electrochemical reduction kinetics to match Zn2+ migration and increased the proportion of Zn2+ in the bulk phase migration, thereby inducing dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior with ordered (002) texturing. Meanwhile, RGSH with abundant hydrogen bond donors and acceptors reconfigures the coordination network of water molecules for all&#8208;climate adaptability, eliminating the accumulation of &#8220;dead Zn&#8221; at low temperature and the HER corrosion at high temperature. As a result, the advanced Zn||Zn symmetric cells deliver an extra&#8208;long cycling performance (over 4600&#8197;h) and a wide temperature tolerance (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C~70&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, the NH4V4O10||Zn full cell can operate stably for over 1000 cycles with 84.3&#8201;% capacity retention. Surprisingly, the practical NH4V4O10||Zn pouch cell with limited N/P ratio (2.3) reserved 84.1&#8201;% capacity after 150 cycles.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Bromine Battery with Highly Reversible Bromine Conversion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnSO4 solution is initially screened as the electrolyte for bromide cathodes. Subsequently, a targeted sequestration strategy is proposed to modify KBr cathode, achieving high&#8208;reversibility bromine conversion chemistry. In situ Raman spectra reveal a Br3&#8722;/Br&#8722;&#8208;dominated conversion mechanism. A large&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;Br pouch cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 98.46&#8201;% and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.92&#8201;% after 775 cycles at 3&#8197;C.







Abstract
Br2/Br&#8722; conversion reaction with a high operating potential (1.85&#8197;V vs. Zn2+/Zn) is promising for designing high&#8208;energy cathodes in aqueous Zn batteries. However, the ultrahigh solubility of polybromides causes significant shuttle effects, capacity deterioration, and self&#8208;discharge, rendering the study of static zinc&#8208;bromine batteries still in its infancy. Here, various aqueous zinc salt electrolytes are first screened, showing that, compared to other salts, ZnSO4 is more suitable for Br&#8208;based cathodes benefiting from its higher negative charge density and lower cost. Nevertheless, the significant shuttle effect of polybromides remains in such an electrolyte. We further develop a targeted sequestration strategy to fundamentally confine polybromide migration from KBr cathode into electrolyte. In high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading (22 mgKBr cm&#8722;2) pouch cells, the average Coulombic efficiency enhances from 92.3&#8201;% to 99.8&#8201;%, and self&#8208;discharge performance dramatically improves from 17.4&#8201;% capacity retention to 85.2&#8201;% after 72&#8197;h of resting, indicating the effectiveness of our strategy in confining the shuttle effects. Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell delivers an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.88&#8201;% and a zinc utilization of 22&#8201;% at a high rate of 3&#8197;C. Our findings also pave the way for the design of advanced Br&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Bimodal Ionic Conduction through Polymer Films due to Nano Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview revisits the phenomenon of nano&#8208;confined ion conduction through polymer films. Ions diffuse through polymer films in two distinct modes depending on the nano&#8208;structure and free space for the passage of hydrated or partially hydrated ions. The size of pathway and how it compares to the size of hydrated ion determines whether ions must shed water from the solvation shell which in essence governs the mode of ionic conduction.







Abstract
Kinetic and selectivity of ionic conduction through polymer films is a key factor in the function of many systems including membrane technology, energy devices, sensors, and corrosion. Typically, the ionic conduction is accelerated by increasing the ionic strength of the electrolyte. However, counterintuitively, polymer films with very high electrochemical impedance demonstrate the opposite effect, i.&#8197;e. ionic conduction slows down by increasing the ionic strength of the electrolyte. This bimodal nature of ionic conduction was discovered five decades ago and yet the mechanism has remained poorly understood. This minireview explains the long&#8208;standing anomaly through the lens of recent advances in nano&#8208;confinement electrochemistry. Emerging evidence shows that changes in solvation shells occurs due to the size of the channel through which ionic diffusion takes place. These solvation shells can significantly affect the mobility of ions, their interactions with functional groups of the polymer, and the overall conductivity of the electrolyte. At dimensions only a few nanometers, partially hydrated ions form stronger bonds with polymer slowing down the ionic conduction. Increasing ionic strength will add ion&#8208;pairing interactions further reducing ions mobility. The interplay of solvated ions, polymer chemistry, and ionic content offer an explanation for the anomalous bimodal ionic conduction.

         <title>Multisite Cross&#8208;Linked Ligand Suppressing Ion Migration for Efficient and Stable CsPbBr3 Perovskite Quantum Dot&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multisite cross&#8208;linked ligand strategy using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid molecules have been proposed to simultaneously passivate non&#8208;radiative defects and stabilize the surface of perovskite QDs, enabling efficient and stable green perovskite QLEDs with a peak EQE of over 25&#8201;% and an operating lifetime of more than 1300&#8197;h, among the highest for perovskite QLEDs based on cross&#8208;linked QDs.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs), as promisingly solution&#8208;processed emitters, have produced impressive external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the operational stability of perovskite QD&#8208;based LEDs (QLEDs) is still limited by severe ion migration. Here, we propose a multisite cross&#8208;linked ligand strategy using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA) molecules to simultaneously reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination and suppress ion migration in QLEDs. Meanwhile, the introduction of cross&#8208;linked LA ligands can reduce the roughness and contact potential difference variation of QD films, which facilitates the injection and recombination of carriers in devices. As a result, the colour&#8208;saturated green CsPbBr3&#8208;based QLED deliver a maximum EQE of 25.6&#8201;% together with an operational lifetime of 1340&#8197;h at an initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the most efficient and stable perovskite LEDs based on cross&#8208;linked QDs. The improvement in device stability is attributed to the reduced ion migration, which is confirmed by analyzing the current behavior of QLEDs and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry. This study provides a facile strategy for mitigating halide ion migration in perovskite fields toward more efficient and stable perovskite QLEDs.

         <title>Promoting the Kinetics of Ethylene Electrosynthesis via the Facet&#8208;Dependent Activation of Acetylene over Silver Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facet&#8208;dependent acetylene activation phenomenon over silver (Ag) catalysts is discovered, and Ag (100) is selected as a suitable candidate to increase the hydrogenation kinetics to improve the activity of ethylene electrosynthesis through the electrocatalytic acetylene conversion process. In addition, the activation of acetylene (C2H2) is a crucial factor in promoting the kinetics of acetylene hydrogenation, guiding future catalyst design.







Abstract
Metallic silver (Ag) sites exhibit a robust ability to suppress undesired C&#8722;C coupling in the electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) into ethylene (ESAE), leading to satisfactory selectivity and stability. However, the relatively low reaction kinetics still hinder its practical value. Here, the facet&#8208;dependent ESAE performance is first evaluated to increase the sluggish hydrogenation kinetics and provide mechanistic insight for subsequent catalyst design. As a result, the Ag nanocubes with {100} surfaces demonstrate a partial current density of 337&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, greatly outperforming their counterparts with {111} surfaces exposed. Further comparisons of H2O splitting and C2H2 hydrogenation reveal that the activation of C2H2 is a crucial factor in promoting the kinetics of ethylene electrosynthesis. Additionally, experimental and theoretical mechanistic characterizations demonstrate that stronger C2H2 adsorption over the {100} surface strengthens the &#960; conjugation of C2H2, leading to the delocalization of &#960; electrons to promote the activation of C2H2 for enhanced hydrogenation kinetics.

         <title>Anion Adsorption at the Inner&#8208;Helmholtz Plane Directs Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of anion adsorption at the inner&#8208;Helmholtz plane in directing CEI formation was investigated using multiple in situ/operando techniques. QCM&#8722;D directly observes its influence on interfacial structure, while in situ spectroscopy and EQCM&#8722;D confirm its impact on CEI chemistry. The anion&#8208;driven interphase leads to a more inorganic&#8208;rich CEI, suppressing electrolyte decomposition and enhancing LiCoO2 cycling stability at high voltages.







Abstract
Constructing a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (CEI) on cathode surface constitutes the foundation of realizing high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet its formation, a highly heterogeneous process involving irreversible reactions between electrolyte components and cathode materials, remains poorly understood. Herein, combining multiple in situ/operando interfacial characterization techniques, we establish the correlation between interfacial structure and interphasial chemistry, and reveal the key role played by adsorptive behavior of various electrolyte components in the inner&#8208;Helmholtz plane during CEI formation. Quartz crystal microbalance equipped with dissipation modification detects that difluorooxalatoborate (DFOB&#8722;) anion preferentially adsorbed on LiCoO2 tends to expel carbonate solvents from the adsorption layer, thus suppressing their electrochemical decomposition at high voltages and leading to a more compact CEI derived from anions with limited contribution from organic ingredients. Consequently, the CoO2 lattice structure protected by the dense CEI remains intact despite near&#8208;complete delithiation, thereby ensuring excellent cycling stability for 4.7&#8197;V operation of LiCoO2 cathode. The atomistic&#8208;level insight into the key factors that govern CEI formation provides directive knowledge that accelerates electrolyte design for high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>Engineering Solvent&#8208;coordinated Heterometallic&#8208;organic Frameworks for Wide&#8208;range Tuning of Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence towards Time&#8208;resolved Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proven promising ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials for anti&#8208;counterfeit due to their unique optical properties. However, it remains a major challenge to achieve the desired phosphorescent properties due to the limited regulatory methods and indistinct mechanism. Herein, the coordination solvent and second metal ion co&#8208;strategy is firstly proposed to prepare seven robust heterometallic&#8208;organic frameworks (HMOFs) with two configurations: ZnMg/Ca&#8208;sol [sol = H2O, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), and formyldiethylamine (DEF)] and ZnSr/Ba&#8208;H2O, exhibiting the different ultralong RTP. The tunable phosphorescence lifetimes within 14.5&#8208;195.4 ms are achieved gradually by altering the type of alkaline earth metals, coordination solvent, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding in the HMOFs. Significantly, the theoretical calculations reveal that the promotion of spin&#8208;orbit coupling by heavy metals and the rigid constraint on the skeleton by solvent result in excellent balance between high phosphorescence quantum yield (&#1060;P) and long lifetime, especially for ZnSr&#8208;H2O (6.8%, 195.4 ms). Depending on the wide&#8208;range tuning of ultralong RTP and great stability, the HMOFs are successfully applied in spatial&#8208;time resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multi&#8208;level information encryption. This work may provide a new approach to designing target phosphorescent materials while resolving the contradiction between high &#1060;P and long lifetime.</dc:description>

The tunable phosphorescence lifetimes within 14.5-195.4 ms are achieved gradually by altering the type of alkaline earth metals, coordination solvent, and hydrogen-bonding in the HMOFs. Significantly, the theoretical calculations reveal that the promotion of spin-orbit coupling by heavy metals and the rigid constraint on the skeleton by solvent result in excellent balance between high phosphorescence quantum yield (&#1060;P) and long lifetime, especially for ZnSr-H2O (6.8%, 195.4 ms). Depending on the wide-range tuning of ultralong RTP and great stability, the HMOFs are successfully applied in spatial-time resolved anti-counterfeiting and multi-level information encryption. This work may provide a new approach to designing target phosphorescent materials while resolving the contradiction between high &#1060;P and long lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Enabled Asymmetric C&#8208;H Acylation of Trifluoroethanol by Dual Nickel/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Serving as a bio&#8208;isostere for methyl groups, the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) has become a key area of interest in pharmaceutical lead optimization for its unique combination of steric bulk and high electronegativity. Recognizing the widespread application of optically pure &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy carbon centers in drug molecules, the introduction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxytrifluoroethyl groups into stereogenic centers holds significant potential. Herein, we describe an asymmetric trifluoroalkylation protocol utilizing nickel/photoredox co&#8208;catalysis to synthesize enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl acyloins via a 1,2&#8208;hydrogen atom migration strategy. DFT calculations guided the reaction design, revealing hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the transition state that control the chiral outcome. The resulting products can be further reduced through a one&#8208;pot process to yield fluoroalkyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols with adjacent stereocenters. This hydrogen&#8208;bonding synergistic methodology demonstrates excellent stereochemical control, mild conditions, and broad functional group tolerance, enabling the efficient asymmetric trifluoroalkylation of complex molecules and offering new avenues for chiral drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Laser&#8208;Polarization&#8208;Induced Anisotropy Enhances Protein Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein crystallization plays a critical role in structural biology and drug development, driving extensive research into its control. We present a novel approach for manipulating protein crystallization by controlling the anisotropy of the high&#8208;concentration domain (HCD) composed of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) through laser polarization in optical trapping. The anisotropy of the HCD was assessed through fluorescence anisotropy measurements and polarized Raman spectroscopy. The results revealed that linear polarization significantly enhances crystallization efficiency by inducing anisotropy of the HCD and promoting nucleation. In contrast, circular polarization resulted in weak anisotropy with minimal crystallization efficiency. This study highlights the crucial role of protein molecule anisotropy in crystallization under optical trapping conditions, providing a new strategy to optimize laser conditions for various protein molecules and pave the way for the development of innovative crystallization techniques, potentially revolutionizing structural biology and drug discovery efforts.</dc:description>

         <title>Formulating Electrophilic Electrolyte for In&#8208;Situ Stabilization of 4.8 V Li&#8208;Rich Batteries with 100% Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathodes are expected to overcome the energy density limitations, but their applicability is hindered by low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases with sluggish kinetics. Here we propose an elaborate electrophilic electrolyte that effectively stabilizes surface lattice oxygen of LLO cathode, facilitates the formation of dense and fast&#8208;ion&#8208;transport electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases, and prevents Li&#8208;dendrites on anode. The nucleophilic reaction mechanism driven by our electrolyte enables LLO to exhibit a reversible capacity of 310 mAh g&#8208;1 with a record ICE of 100%, as well as impressive 3C fast&#8208;charging stability, remarkably superior to that in the basic electrolyte. Using this engineered electrolyte, our assembled 4.5 Ah&#8208;class pouch cell of graphite||LLO displays high energy density and remarkable reversibility during cycling, demonstrating wide applicability. This work provides valuable insights and pragmatic strategies in electrolyte chemical engineering for advancing high&#8208;energy density and fast&#8208;charging batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Catalysis System Coupled with Redox Mediator Effect for Ultra&#8208;Long Cycle Life Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 batteries significantly limit their performance. To address this issue, the insulating characteristics of the discharge product Li2O2 and the reactivity of highly active superoxide species are examined. Herein, organic metal salts with weak electrolyte properties are utilized as bifunctional additives. The ionized metal ions can be reduced and doped Li2O2 through in&#8208;situ electrochemical implantation, thereby altering its insulating properties. Additionally, organic metal salts function as redox mediators (RMs), stabilizing the intermediate LiO2 and facilitating its further disproportionation to Li2O2, as well as enhancing the decomposition reaction during charging, which are further proven by the in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy. Notably, Li&#8208;O2 batteries incorporating Mn(acac)3 demonstrate an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 0.43 V and sustain 250 long cycles at 1000 mA g&#8208;1. Furthermore, when combined with optimized cathode, a remarkable cycle stability of 3850 cycles at 1000 mA g&#8208;1 is achieved. These findings offer novel insights for design of advanced Li&#8208;O2 battery systems and the enhancement of their performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular chemiluminescence probes with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offer promising benefits in deciphering complex pathological processes in a living system, as NIR chemiluminescence minimizes autofluorescence, enhances deep&#8208;tissue penetration, and improves signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Molecular engineering with single luminophore design and dual&#8208;luminophore design with intramolecular energy transfer provides way to develop conventional chemiluminophore scaffolds into NIR chemiluminescence probes with ideal chemiluminescence quantum yield and half&#8208;life. By virtue of the structural diversity, 1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;based NIR chemiluminophores with biomarker activity have been developed. This review summarizes the molecular design strategies of unimolecular NIR chemiluminescent probes (UNCPs), followed by introducing activatable UNCPs with their biomedical applications for disease theranostics. Lastly, future perspectives and potential challenges of NIR chemiluminescence imaging in preclinical research and clinical translational potential are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Three Birds with One Stone: Triple Defect Passivation of Tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) Phosphate Enables 25.69% Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defect passivation is widely acknowledged as a crucial strategy for enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it remains a formidable challenge to effectively address multiple defects simultaneously on both the top and bottom surfaces of perovskite films, as well as within the bulk, through a facile method. To tackle this dilemma, we have devised a triple passivation strategy, aiming to achieve a holistic passivation of defects at the aforementioned locations using a singular passivator. Specifically, a multifunctional molecule, tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TTFP), is meticulously engineered as an additive in the antisolvent. This approach capitalizes a top&#8208;down gradient distribution of TTFP along the perovskite film, thereby enabling to mitigate the interfacial and bulk defects. Meanwhile, the unique molecular structure of TTFP facilitates simultaneous interactions with both cationic and anionic defects. Additionally, TTFP exerts a pronounced influence on the crystallization kinetics, thereby promoting the formation of highly crystalline perovskite films with substantially enlarged grain sizes. Consequently, the TTFP&#8208;based devices exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.69%, accompanied by a notable improvement in stability. This work represents the successful implementation of comprehensive defect passivation, marking a significant instance in the advancement of efficient and stable PSC technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Access to P&#8208;Chiral Triarylphosphine Oxides via Insertion of P&#8722;H Bonds into Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While significant progress has been made in enantioselective insertion of carbenes into heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds, this chemistry is predominantly restricted to construction of carbon&#8208;based chirality. The asymmetric insertion of carbenes into P&#8208;H that delivers P&#8208;chiral products remains untouched. We herein report rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of P&#8208;chiral triarylphosphine oxides via asymmetric C&#8208;P coupling of a secondary phosphine oxide (SPO) with diazonaphthoquinone. Driven by aromatization, this protocol affords a variety of P&#8208;chiral triarylphosphine oxides tethered to a 2&#8208;naphthol functionality in excellent enantioselectivity by following a kinetic resolution reaction pattern. The diverse synthetic and catalytic applications of the P&#8208;chiral products highlight the value of this method, even though the derivatized trivalent chiral phosphine bears a rather low barrier of racemization.</dc:description>

         <title>High Entropy Boosts the Low Temperature Na+&#8208;storage Performance of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) has been considered as a promising cathode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the inferior electronic conductivity and inadequate Na+ ions diffusion kinetics of NFPP at low temperatures hinder its practical applications. In this study, high entropy Na4Fe2.95(MgCaAlCrMn)0.01(PO4)2P2O7 (HE&#8208;NFPP) have been synthesized via a spry&#8208;drying and high temperature sintering technique. The incorporation of transition metals (TMs) ions into NFPP using the HE strategy facilitates electron transportation by reducing the band gap between the conduction and valence bands. Meanwhile, the 3D network Na+ ions diffusion channels formed in HE&#8208;NFPP can effectively improve the Na+ ions diffusion efficiency, resulting in enhanced electrode reaction kinetics at low temperatures. Moreover, it leads to a significantly mitigated volume expansion/contraction in HE&#8208;NFPP caused by Na+ ions extraction/insertion during (de)sodiation process. Consequently, the fabricated HE&#8208;NFPP exhibits an excellent rate and cyclic performance at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible CO2&#160;Hydrogenation, Neutron Crystallography, and Hydride Reactivity of&#160;a Triiridium Heptahydride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the structure, reactivity, and catalytic utility of a triiridium complex,&#160;[Ir3H6(&#181;3&#8208;H)(PN)3]2+&#160;(2&#8208;H, PN = (2&#8208;pyridyl)CH2PBut2). Despite its unusual stability to unsaturated organics, electrophiles, and even CF3SO3D, we find that complex 2&#8208;H&#160;catalyzes hydrogenation of CO2&#160;to formate (TONIr&#160;= 9,600)&#160;and reverse formic acid dehydrogenation (TONIr&#160;= 54,400).

Neutron crystallography and DFT&#8208;supported neutron vibrational spectroscopy of 2&#8208;H&#160;reveal Ir&#8211;H&#160;bond lengths and elucidate the vibration modes within&#160;the&#160;Ir3H7&#160;core.

Further oxidation to class [Ir2H3(&#956;&#8208;X)2(PN)2]+&#160;is possible with AgOAc, Hg(OAc)2, or I2. Finally, a TEMPO/HCl system completely oxidizes the hydrides and gives [Ir2Cl4(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(PN)2] (11).</dc:description>

         <title>Developing the Tandem Structure to Regulate Interfacial Chemistry and Promote Ion Transport Kinetics towards High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical properties of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer and Cathode Electrolyte Interphase (CEI) are crucial for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries, especially under extreme operating conditions. Herein, we propose a delicately designed tandem separator (CYANO&#8208;COF|PP|SnF2) to regulate the chemical stability of dual interfaces. The cyano group in CYANO&#8208;COF induces a stable CN&#8208;enriched CEI on the surface of high&#8208;nickel LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode through the adsorption/coordination effect with transition metals (TMs), inhibiting irreversible phase transitions, TMs dissolution, and other side reactions. Meanwhile, a straightforward in&#8208;situ conversion is used to construct an artificial hybrid SEI layer comprising LiF and Li&#8208;Sn alloy. As demonstrated theoretically and experimentally, the hybrid SEI with enhanced electron&#8208;blocking ability and rapid transmission characteristics can decrease the electron from the Li anode into the SEI and allow Li+ to rapidly diffuse through the SEI layer, achieving even dendrite&#8208;free lithium plating at the SEI/Li interface. With the synergistic effect of dual interfaces, the NCM811||Li battery maintains a capacity retention of 81.8% within 200 cycles at 4.5 V and 55 &#176;C. This work emphasizes the significance of regulating the chemical properties of double interfaces and provides new insights into the rational design for tandem separators.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene Nanoribbon Core Thermotropic Liquid Crystal with A Well&#8208;Defined Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with hierarchical and well&#8208;ordered structures are believed to deliver superior performance in semiconductor device applications. Despite this potential, traditional alignment techniques for GNRs often fall short in producing defect&#8208;free and precisely defined molecular architectures. Here, we introduce a strategy for the fabrication of highly&#8208;ordered GNRs by empowering them with thermotropic liquid crystallinity, utilizing a bottom&#8208;up solution synthesis approach. The resulting GNR liquid crystal (GNR&#8208;LC) molecule can self&#8208;assemble into a hexagonal columnar phase. The homeotropic alignment of GNR&#8208;LC is enabled by the intrinsic self&#8208;assembly capabilities of the thermotropic liquid crystalline state, thereby forming one&#8208;dimensional charge transport pathways. Devices incorporating GNR&#8208;LC have demonstrated significantly enhanced hole mobility, reaching up to 2.4 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, underscoring their viability as organic semiconductors for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>La3ZrGa5O14: Band&#8208;inversion Strategy in Topology&#8208;Protected Octahedron for Large Nonlinear Response and Wide Bandgap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The contradictory relationship between band gaps and the second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response constitutes a formidable challenge in the rational design of infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. In oxide&#8208;based crystals, the incorporation of strongly distorted octahedra containing d0 cations as central elements is a common approach to enhance SHG responses, while inadvertently leading to a significant decrease in band gaps due to the unfavorable energy level splitting. In this study, we introduced an innovative "4d/5s electron band&#8208;inversion" strategy to enhance SHG response while preserving a wide band gap within the octahedron&#8208;symmetry&#8208;protected langasite structure. We successfully synthesized a novel high&#8208;performance IR NLO crystal, La3ZrGa5O14 (LGZr), where the unoccupied 4d orbitals of the Zr4+ cation underwent a transition from the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band, and the ZrO6 octahedra exhibited minimal distortion. Consequently, LGZr exhibited the largest SHG response observed to date (reaching up to 2.4&#215; La3Nb0.5Ga5.5O14) and the broadest band gap (5.16 eV) within the langasite family. Furthermore, LGZr was revealed with a remarkable laser damage threshold (1.66 GW/cm2) and broad IR transmission capabilities (~7.8 &#956;m), and supported the growth of centimeter&#8208;sized crystals. The "band&#8208;inversion strategy" offers significant advantages to realize high&#8208;performance IR NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Coupled NIR Organic Hybrid Solar Cells Achieving an 84.2% Fill Factor and a 25.2% Efficiency: A Comprehensive Mechanistic Exploration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of organic dyes in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to utilize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons remains a challenge. In this study, a selenium&#8208;incorporated ortho&#8208;benzodipyrrole&#8208;based NIR dye CB&#8208;2Se was developed. CB&#8208;2Se, featuring a lower bandgap of 1.35 eV, was blended with PCBM to form a bulk&#8208;heterojunction layer in PSCs for electron extraction and transport. Compared to Y6&#8208;16 acceptor, the removal of the Tz unit in CB&#8208;2Se suppresses self&#8208;aggregation, improving its compatibility with PCBM. A CB&#8208;2Se:PCBM&#8208;incorporated PSC achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.18% with a VOC of 1.164 V, a JSC of 25.71 mA/cm&#178;, a Fill Factor of 84.15%, outperforming that of the PCBM&#8208;only reference device (24.35%) and the PCBM:Y6&#8208;16&#8208;based device (24.49%). The PCBM:CB&#8208;2Se layer enhanced the long&#8208;term stability of PSCs, retaining 88% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h under ambient air and thermal conditions. The photophysical interactions between NIR dyes and PSCs have been comprehensively investigated by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Ultrafast exciton separation into free charges occurs within 200 femtoseconds at the interfaces between PCBM and CB&#8208;2Se. For the first time, a transfer of holes from CB&#8208;2Se back to the perovskite was detected, providing valuable insights into the charge dynamics of PSCs utilizing NIR dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Catalysts for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Ni Single Atom and MoC Nanoclusters Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of sulfur (S) cathodes in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is hindered by the shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. Addressing these challenges requires advanced catalytic host materials capable of trapping LiPSs and accelerating Li&#8208;S redox reactions. However, single&#8208;site catalysts struggle to effectively mediate the complex multi&#8208;step and multi&#8208;phase sulfur conversion processes. In this study, we present a novel dual&#8208;site catalyst, featuring nickel single atoms anchored to nitrogen sites (Ni&#8208;N4) within a carbon nitride (NC) matrix and molybdenum carbide (MoC) nanoclusters. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that MoC sites efficiently catalyze the reduction of long&#8208;chain LiPSs, while Ni&#8208;N4&#160;sites drive the reduction of short&#8208;chain LiPSs.&#160;When incorporated as a coating on the cathode side of a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator, the Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC catalyst enhances sulfur utilization, suppresses LiPSs&#160;shuttling, and facilitates a uniform Li+&#8208;ion distribution. Thereby, Li&#8208;S batteries demonstrate outstanding performance, including an initial capacity of 1624 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 0.2C and 1142 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 1C. At a sulfur loading of 8.3 mg cm&#8315;&#178; and an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6 &#181;L mg&#8315;&#185;, the system achieves an initial areal capacity of 9.57 mAh cm&#8315;&#178; at 0.1C, showcasing significant promise for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208; Density Post&#8208;Perovskite for Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Hard X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The density properties of semiconductors play a crucial role in applications such as radiation detection, electronic devices, and aerospace technologies. However, controlling the density of semiconductors often leads to significant alterations in their electronic structure, which can result in the loss of their original semiconductor properties. Perovskite semiconductors, known for their excellent carrier transport properties, face limitations in hard X&#8208;ray detection due to their relatively low density and loos atomic packing. This study explores a series of post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors with densities exceeding 5 g cm&#8722;3, achieved through edge&#8208; and face&#8208;sharing connectivity of octahedra and strong polarization between metal and chalcogenide ions. These dense materials retain semiconductor properties while exhibiting superior electrical transport characteristics. When applied to hard X&#8208;ray detection, the post&#8208;perovskite materials demonstrated superior attenuation cross&#8208;sections compared to the heaviest 3D CsPbI3 perovskite and 0D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite. Specifically, the BiCuSCl2 post&#8208;perovskite detector exhibited a high sensitivity of 4126 &#956;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and a minimum detection limit of 4.3 nGyair s&#8208;1. The enhanced density also mitigates ionic migration, ensuring excellent electrical stability. These findings underscore the potential of post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors for advanced optoelectronic and radiation detection applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Polymeric Microspheres with Synergistic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Nanotraps and Multi&#8208;site adsorption for Ultrafast Herbicide Decontamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ultrafast removal of trace herbicides like paraquat (PQ) and diquat (DQ) from water is urgent yet challenging due to their highwater stability and strong binding properties. Here, efficient PQ and DQ removal based on hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps dominant multi&#8208;site adsorption were developed. Two crosslinked polymeric microspheres, &#946;CD&#8208;PF and &#947;CD&#8208;PF, were synthesized from cyclodextrins (CDs) and hexafluorocyclotriphosphazene (HFP). The &#947;CD&#8208;PF microsphere with sufficient hydrogen bonding nanotraps on the pore surface prompts adsorption kinetics constants of PQ and DQ up to 127.09 and 192.64 g mg&#8208;1 min&#8208;1, achieving 99% removal efficiency for PQ and DQ within 5 s. &#947;CD&#8208;PF exhibits exceptional selectivity for PQ and DQ over larger competing dyes. Importantly, trace PQ (1 ppm) can be effectively treated with &#947;CD&#8208;PF to achieve a concentration far below the U.S. EPA standard (0.003 ppm) within 30 seconds. The ultrafast adsorption is driven by a multi&#8208;site mechanism: electrostatic and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions from HFP promote adsorbate accumulation on the CD surface, while the high&#8208;density hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps in &#947;CD&#8208;PF enhance hydrogen bond strength, enabling rapid capture. This work provides a valuable strategy for designing ultrafast adsorbents for effective herbicide removal from water.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ High Selectivity Contact&#8208;Electroreduction of CO2 to Methanol Using an Imine&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8208;Free Vitrimer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal catalysts for CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR) face challenges such as high cost, limited durability and environmental impact. Although various diverse and functional metal&#8208;free catalysts have been developed, they often suffer from slow kinetics, low selectivity, and non&#8208;recyclability, significantly limiting their practical applications. In this study, we introduce a recyclable non&#8208;metallic polymer material (vitrimer) for a new platform in contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis. This approach harnesses the contact charges generated between water droplets and vitrimer to drive CO2RR, achieving methanol selectivity exceeding 90%.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal catalysts for CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR) face challenges such as high cost, limited durability and environmental impact. Although various diverse and functional metal-free catalysts have been developed, they often suffer from slow kinetics, low selectivity, and non-recyclability, significantly limiting their practical applications. In this study, we introduce a recyclable non-metallic polymer material (vitrimer) for a new platform in contact-electro-catalysis. This approach harnesses the contact charges generated between water droplets and vitrimer to drive CO2RR, achieving methanol selectivity exceeding 90%. The imine groups within the vitrimer play a dual role, facilitating CO2&#160;adsorption and enriching friction-generated electrons, thereby mediating efficient electron transfer between the imine groups and CO2&#160;to promote CO2RR. After 84 h, the system achieved a methanol production rate of 13 nmol&#183;h-1, demonstrating the excellent stability of the method. Moreover, the vitrimer retains its high-performance electrocatalytic activity even after recycling. Mechanistic studies reveal that, compared to traditional metal catalysts, the N-O bond in the imine, which adsorbs the key intermediate *OCH3, breaks more readily to produce methanol, resulting in enhanced product selectivity and yield. This efficient and environmentally friendly contact-electroreduction strategy for CO2&#160;offers a promising pathway toward a circular carbon economy by leveraging natural water droplet-based contact-electrochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed ammonia synthesis by using zero&#8208;valent metal powder with alcohols or water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have recently achieved a highly effective ammonia formation from dinitrogen using samarium diiodide and water under ambient reaction conditions. However, further research is needed to establish a carbon&#8208;free green ammonia production route without carbon dioxide emissions. In this study, we have developed a novel molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation method using a combination of zero&#8208;valent metal powders as reductants and alcohols or H2O as a proton source under ambient reaction conditions. In this reaction system, samarium compounds serve as crucial electron mediators for the molybdenum complexes. Remarkably, the combination of zinc powder and water in the presence of samarium triiodide facilitates highly selective ammonia production over dihydrogen under ambient reaction conditions, yielding up to 900 equiv. of ammonia per Mo atom in the catalyst. Intriguingly, using magnesium powder, known for its potent reducing capability, reduces the requisite amount of samarium compounds to catalytic levels. We believe that the novel insights gained from this reaction system represent a substantial step toward achieving green ammonia production.</dc:description>

         <title>Gem&#8208;Diboronic Acids: A Motif For Anion Recognition In Competitive Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gem&#8208;diboronic acid derivatives have previously been demonstrated to facilitate substrate binding within a metal&#8217;s secondary coordination sphere but their use as an anion recognition motif has not been explored. Here, we introduce the gem&#8208;diboronic acid motif as a highly effective group for recognition of oxoanions in aqueous solution. Anion receptors based on this motif demonstrate higher binding affinities than other common neutral motifs such as amides and (thio)ureas, and display a unique selectivity profile. Studies with a receptor bearing two gem&#8208;diboronic acid groups, receptor 2, indicate that the interaction with anions is highly directional. Despite its simplicity, receptor 2 represents one of the most selective receptors for malonate reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Multishelled Hollow Covalent Organic Framework Nanospheres for Stable Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multishelled hollow covalent organic framework nanospheres (MH&#8208;COFs) with at least two shells integrate the merits of the porous crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) matrix with the complex hollow architecture, which can motivate new functions for exceptional performance. However, the fabrication of MH&#8208;COFs is still uncultivated and remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we reported a facile template&#8208;free protocol for the general synthesis of different MH&#8208;COFs by controlling the simultaneous processes of surface crystallization and core etching of the crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity nanospheres of COFs precursor. The crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity solid covalent organic polymer nanospheres (COPs) with robust crystalline surface but vulnerable amorphous core were designed. Subsequently, an acetic acid aqueous solution treatment of crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity COPs not only induced selective etching of the vulnerable cores but also promote the further crystallization of the surface layers, thereby producing hollow COFs. A further step&#8208;by&#8208;step expansion of seeded growth for inhomogeneous COP layers and then similar acid solution treatment can output the intriguing MH&#8208;COFs. An extraordinarily stable K&#8208;ion battery anode with high capacity was demonstrated with a MH&#8208;COFs/S nanocomposite fabricated by covalently bonding chain sulfur into the MH&#8208;COFs matrix. This work opened a simple but powerful avenue in designing complex hollow COFs architectures to boost their potential for applications.</dc:description>

Abstract
High&#8208;nuclearity intermetallic nanoclusters are important for investigating the evolution of alloy materials from atoms to plasmonic alloy nanoparticles. However, the synthesis of large&#8208;size alloy nanoclusters (&#8764;2&#160;nm) is still challenging. In this work, an all&#8208;alkynyl protected trimetallic nanocluster of unprecedented size, Au9Ag126&#8208;xCux(PhC&#63741;C)68(BF4)5 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;20) (1) (PhC&#63741;C&#160;=&#160;phenylacetylene), has been synthesized and its total structure determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). The metal core of 1 is rod&#8208;like in structure, with a length of 1.92&#160;nm and a width of 1.45&#160;nm. Cluster 1 contains a concentric metal kernel in the manner of shell&#8208;by&#8208;shell arrangements of Au3Ag34@Au6Ag64@(AgCu)28 protected by 68 PhC&#63741;C ligands with 15 distinct alkynyl&#8211;metal binding configurations. Theoretic calculation reveals that 1 features a HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap of 0.29&#160;eV. This suggests that 1 is situated at the boundary of the transition from a molecular to a metallic state. Remarkably, compared to other reported Au/Ag/Cu/Pd based nanoclusters, 1 exhibits significantly enhanced photothermal conversion capability. A substantial temperature rise of &#8764;51.5 &#176;C within 5&#160;min (&#955;ex&#160;=&#160;660&#160;nm, 0.5&#160;W cm&#8722;2) and a record high photothermal conversion efficiency of 84.7% at 12&#160;&#181;M in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) were observed. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy reveals that the electron&#8211;phonon coupling (&#964;e&#8208;ph) of excited 1 occurs on the femtosecond timescale, resulting in an ultrafast electronic relaxation process and excellent photothermal performance. Cluster 1, when employed as a photothermal material, shows promise in biothermal therapy, photothermal catalysis, and photothermal imaging.

         <title>Uniform Ion Flow Effect of Dynamic Electrostatic Shielding Layer for Facilitating Homogeneous Nucleation and Deposition on Aluminum Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aluminum batteries present considerable potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, particularly within power stations. Nonetheless, their operational lifespan and commercialization are hindered by issues like Al anode dendrite formation and electrolyte corrosion. To address aforementioned issues, a stabilizer has been proposed to enhance the electrolyte/anode interface. Experimental and computational simulation results indicate that the surface tension of the SDBS alkyl chain facilitates its preferential adsorption onto the electrode surface, thereby establishing a protective layer that mitigates the corrosion of the chloroaluminate ionic liquid (ILs). Additionally, the suitable electronegativity of the phenyl&#8208;SO3 group generates an electrostatic shielding effect that not only dynamically regulates ion flow but also equilibrates the nucleation and deposition velocity, ultimately promoting the stable planar Al deposition. Consequently, the SDBS modified Al/Al symmetric battery demonstrates stable cycling for 500 h and 1000 h under high current density (5 mA cm&#8722;2) and large area capacity (5 mAh cm&#8722;2), respectively. The Al//flake graphite full battery achieves reversible capacity of 90.01 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, significantly improving capacity retention. This study also further explores the effect of additive functional groups and ions on Al anode, offering insights for the rational design of RABs electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>A Compact&#8208;Solvation Electrolyte under Low Concentration for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) faces significant challenges due to the lack of suitable electrolytes to achieve satisfactory energy density and long&#8208;term stability. This work reports an innovative compact&#8208;solvation electrolyte (CSE) strategy leveraging ionic liquid&#8208;induced manipulation of solvation structures under low concentration for high&#8208;performance PIBs. The CSE, formulated with a low salt concentration of 0.8 M, simultaneously exhibits compact solvation structures with abundant F&#8208;rich anions, high ionic conductivity, and low desolvation energy. These features lead to enhanced K&#8208;storage thermodynamics and kinetics through the formation of a robust KF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) as well as accelerated K+ transport kinetics. Consequently, the graphite electrode in CSE delivers a high reversible capacity of 252 mAh/g with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% after 300 cycles at 50 mA/g. Furthermore, the designed CSE enables the PB||Graphite full cell to operate for over 1450 cycles at 50 mA/g, maintaining an impressive capacity retention of 88%. This work represents a significant advance in the development of safe and compatible electrolytes for advanced PIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Cerium&#8208;Mediated C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage for the Deconstructive Diversification of Cyclic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective cleavage of inert carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in unstrained rings continues to pose a formidable challenge in chemical synthesis. Current methods for C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bond cleavage are highly limited, typically relying on transition&#8208;metal catalysis to facilitate ring&#8208;opening via small&#8208;ring strain, or inducing &#946;&#8208;fragmentation after generating radicals from oxygen or nitrogen atoms pre&#8208;installed in the substrate. In this work, we introduce an effective strategy for the decarboxylative ring&#8208;opening functionalization of &#945;&#8208;trisubstituted carboxylic acids, mediated by both light and cerium. This method enables the ring&#8208;opening of carboxylic acids with ring sizes ranging from 3 to 12 members, allowing the construction of C&#8208;CN, C&#8208;halide, C&#8208;C, C&#8208;Se, and C&#8208;oxime bonds. Notably, this reaction does not require the pre&#8208;installation of an oxygen atom in the substrate, as the carbonyl group is derived from atmospheric oxygen. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage modification establishes distally functionalized carbonyl compounds, which serve as versatile synthons for accessing valuable building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyarylmethylpiperidinium&#160;(PAMP) for Next Generation Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terawatt&#8208;scale hydrogen production using anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs) requires the development of facilely prepared, alkali&#8208;stable, and high&#8208;performance anion exchange membranes (AEMs). State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyarylpiperidinium AEMs fail to match the alkaline stability of piperidinium due to conformational deformation caused by the stiff cardo structure. Herein, we constructed polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant structure by utilizing 4&#8208;formylpiperidine as a functional monomer. The inclusion of an aldehyde group in the synthesis enhances polymerization reactivity, reduces the amount of superacid required, and ensures that the piperidinium is suspended from the ether&#8208;free polymer backbone. The accelerated aging analysis demonstrates that the pendant structure of piperidinium effectively suppresses the Hofmann elimination, resulting in PAMP AEM with exceptional alkali stability, surpassing that of the commercial PiperION&#8208;A40. Most importantly, when assembled with non&#8208;noble metal OER/HER catalysts, the related AEM&#8208;WE achieves a remarkably high transient current density of 7.35 A cm&#8722;2 (@2 V, 80 &#8451;, 1 M KOH). Moreover, the AEM&#8208;WE can operate stably&#160;at industrial current density over 1500 h (~ 1.70 V at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2).</dc:description>

         <title>Robust p&#8208;d Orbital Coupling in PtCoIn@Pt Core&#8208;shell Catalysts for Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pt&#8208;based catalysts are&#160;playing&#160;increasingly&#160;important roles&#160;in fuel cells&#160;owing&#160;to their high catalytic activity.&#160;However, harsh electrocatalytic conditions often trigger atomic migration and dissolution in these catalysts, causing rapid performance deterioration. Here, we introduce a&#160;novel&#160;L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt core&#8208;shell catalyst, where indium (In) was incorporated into&#160;a&#160;PtCo matrix.&#160;This integration promotes&#160;p&#8208;d orbital coupling,&#160;optimizing the electronic structure of Pt and causing additional lattice strain within PtCo. Impressively, L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt exhibits&#160;remarkable&#160;activity and durability, with only a 5.1% reduction in mass activity (MA) after 120,000 potential cycles. In H2&#8208;O2&#160;fuel cells, this cathode achieves a peak power density of 1.99 W cm&#8208;2&#160;and maintains a high MA of 0.73 A mgPt&#8208;1&#160;at 0.9 V. After&#160;enduring&#160;60,000 square wave potential cycles, the catalyst maintains its initial MA and sustains the cell voltage at 0.8 A cm&#8208;2, exceeding the U.S.&#160;Department of Energy (DOE)&#160;2025 targets. Theoretical studies&#160;highlight&#160;the enhancements originate from&#160;the&#160;modulated electronic structures and shifted d&#8208;band center of Pt induced by In doping,and&#160;increased vacancy formation energies in Pt and Co atoms, affirming the catalyst's superior durability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Promising Deep Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Crystal Activated by the Ordered Structure Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) crystals play a vitally important role in many scientific and technological fields, yet their rational design remains an ongoing challenge. Here, through utilizing the ordered structure design, a new  KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like DUV transparent NLO crystalCs2KY(B3O6)2 has been successfully designed and synthesized, in which we firstly use the largest &#960;&#8208;conjugated B3O6 &#8216;functional groups&#8217; to substitute the BO3 to &#8216;maximize&#8217; the second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response and utilize the K/YO6 &#8216;connecting groups&#8217; to replace two BeO3F groups to &#8216;optimize&#8217; the layer connections. Eventually, Cs2KY(B3O6)2 exhibits not only the largest SHG responses in KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like DUV borates but also the best growth rate along c axis (the strong layer&#8208;habit along c axis has been being the greatest obstacle to prohibit the practical application of KBe2BO3F2 and its derivative). Clearly, the substitution from &#8216;BO3 triangles to similar topological B3O6 groups&#8217; and from &#8216;(BeO3F)2 groups to similar topological K/YO6 octahedra&#8217; can better modulate the functional properties of materials in the larger scale. That results in the superior comprehensive properties of Cs2KY(B3O6)2 and makes it a promising DUV NLO crystal. Therefore, the ordered structure design provides some new insights for assembling the functional and connecting groups to rationally design materials with high&#8208;performance.</dc:description>

Clearly, the substitution from &#8216;BO3 triangles to similar topological B3O6 groups&#8217; and from &#8216;(BeO3F)2 groups to similar topological K/YO6 octahedra&#8217; can better modulate the functional properties of materials in the larger scale. That results in the superior comprehensive properties of Cs2KY(B3O6)2 and makes it a promising DUV NLO crystal. Therefore, the ordered structure design provides some new insights for assembling the functional and connecting groups to rationally design materials with high-performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steering the Product Selectivity of CO2&#160;Electroreduction by Single Atom Switching in Isostructural Copper Nanocluster Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Even single atom manipulation can cause drastically changes in catalytic activity and selectivity, especially in atomic&#8208;level catalysts. However, it is challenging to accurately elucidate the influence of specific atom on performance due to the intertwined factors in catalysts. Atomically precise isostructural nanoclusters (NCs) can serve as ideal platforms to uncover the impact of individual atom on catalytic property. Herein, a pair of isostructural Cu NCs ([Cu13(SC6H3F2)3(P(PhF)3)7H10]0 and [Cu14(SC6H3F2)3(P(PhF)3)8H10]+ namely as Cu13 and Cu14) were synthesized. In electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, Cu13 shows barely activity towards only 2e product CO with maximum 13% FE at &#8208;1.1 V. In contrast, Cu14 can promote CO2 deep reduction to hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) with maximum FE of 54.3% at &#8208;1.2 V. Based on the crystallographic and computational analyses, the extra Cu at the top in Cu14 squeezes the H connected with three core Cu into the center of the same plane, optimizing the electronic structure and thereby promoting CO2 activation and H2O dissociation, which is further confirmed by comprehensive in situ characterizations, kinetic experiments, and theoretical calculations. This work provides a unique isostructural NCs system to gain fundamental insights into switching catalytic reactivity by single atom manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Hydroallylation of Acrylates Enabled by &#947;&#8208;Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allyl Acetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution provides an efficient route to chiral organic molecules featuring an allyl moiety, key intermediates in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, the use of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl electrophiles has been severely constrained by the challenges of achieving both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity simultaneously. Herein, we present &#947;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allyl acetates as highly effective electrophiles for a regio&#8208; and enantioconvergent hydroallylation, enabling the construction of vicinal stereogenic centers. This method delivers allylated products in 44&#8211;93% yield with 79:21 to &gt;95:5 dr and 88 to &gt;99% ee. Additionally, the silyl group in the products can be readily converted into other functional groups, such as acyl and aryl groups, enhancing their synthetic utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Excitation and High&#8208;Energy Reactions Originate from Anionic Microdroplets Formed by Electrospray or Pneumatic Nebulization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formation of energetic species at the surface of aqueous microdroplets, including abundant hydroxyl radicals, oxidation products, and ionized N2 and O2 gas, has been previously attributed to the high electric field at the droplet surface. Here, evidence for a new mechanism for electronic excitation involving electron emission from negatively charged water droplets is shown. Droplet evaporation can lead to emission of ions and droplet fission, but unlike positively charged droplets, negatively charged droplets can also shed charge by electron emission. With nanoelectrospray, no anions or negatively charged droplets are produced with a positive electrospray potential. In contrast, abundant O2+&#8226; and H3O+(H2O) are formed with negative electrospray. When toluene vapor is introduced with negative electrospray, abundant toluene radical cations and fragments are produced. Both O2+&#8226; and toluene radical cations are produced with pneumatic nebulization. The electrons produced from evaporating negatively charged droplets can be accelerated by an external electric field in electrospray, or by the field generated between droplets with opposite polarities produced by pneumatic nebulization. This electron emission/ionization mechanism leads to electronic excitation &gt;10 eV, and it may explain some of the surprising chemistries that were previously attributed to the high electric field at the surface of aqueous droplets.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Short Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network Enhancing Hydrophilicity in Biomimetic Membranes with Artificial Water Channels for Efficient Removal of Dyes and Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated biomimetic membrane combining I&#8208;quartet water channels and sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyamide achieves simultaneous dye and salt rejection with high water permeance. Leveraging dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, this design enhances antifouling performance and provides an energy&#8208;efficient solution for textile wastewater treatment.







Abstract
The development of an integrated biomimetic membrane capable of rejecting both dyes and salts in a single step, while sustaining stable water permeation, presents a promising solution for textile wastewater treatment. Herein, we report a novel integrated biomimetic membrane integrating an I&#8208;quartet artificial water channel (AWC) with sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyamide (PA&#8208;SO3H), which can stably reject both dyes and inorganic salts. The I&#8208;quartet channels (2.68&#8197;&#197;), formed via self&#8208;assembly of alkyl&#8208;ureido&#8208;ethyl&#8208;imidazole (HC8) molecules, facilitate selective water transport and rejection of both dyes and inorganic salts. Concurrently, the sulfonic acid groups (&#8722;SO3H) could grab water molecules, forming dynamic short hydrogen&#8208;bonding network (O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O). These hydrogen bonds not only serve as jumping force, lowering the energy barrier for water transport through the alternating hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic matrix, but also act as an effective antifouling barrier, significantly reducing membrane fouling. The optimal HC83.0&#8208;PA&#8208;SO3H membrane exhibits a water permeance of 13.4&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8208;2&#8197;h&#8208;1&#8197;MPa&#8208;1, approximately 2.7&#8208;fold higher than that of the pristine PA membrane, and both high dyes and salts rejection efficiency. Moreover, the membrane sustains stable antifouling characteristics throughout a 19&#8208;day endurance test. This innovative membrane design provides a promising solution for the efficient separation of both dyes and inorganic salts in textile wastewater treatment.

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Boosted Stability and Kinetics under a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce silk fibroin (SF) as a multifunctional additive into ZnCl2&#8208;based &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte, boosting the reaction kinetics and cycling stability of aqueous Zn ion batteries across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. SF disrupts H&#8208;bond networks in H2O and coordinates Zn2+, reducing viscosity and suppressing side reactions. It also forms a hydrophilic/zincophilic SF&#8208;film on both electrodes, enabling uniform Zn plating and preventing cathode dissolution.







Abstract
Sustainable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) necessitate a wide operational temperature range to ensure practicability, yet achieving this often compromises either reaction kinetics at low temperatures or cycling stability at high temperatures. Here we present an electrolyte design that balances this trade&#8208;off, enhancing the stability and kinetics of AZIBs across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. Our approach incorporates silk fibroin as a multifunctional additive into ZnCl2&#8208;based &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte, which modifies both electrolyte structure and electrode interphase. Specifically, Zn||Zn half&#8208;cells with this electrolyte realize low hysteresis (180&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, and stable operation (200&#8197;hours at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This electrolyte is compatible with both inorganic and organic cathode materials. Remarkably, an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level Zn||V2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O pouch cell with this electrolyte achieves an energy density of &#8764;72&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;L&#8722;1 with minimal capacity decay after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the pouch cell stably cycles across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy provides a powerful solution to the challenges of aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries at extreme temperatures.

Remarkably, an ampere-hour-level Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O pouch cell with this electrolyte achieves an energy density of &#8764;72&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with minimal capacity decay after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the pouch cell stably cycles across &#8722;60 to 60&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy provides a powerful solution to the challenges of aqueous metal-ion batteries at extreme temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A new &#8220;atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst&#8221; system comprising single&#8208;atom MNx and local sp3 carbon defects is proposed, which marries the advantages of typical single&#8208;/dual&#8208;atom catalysts while addressing their respective weaknesses, thus synergistically achieves high electrocatalytic activity and battery efficiency.







Abstract
Atomic&#8208;level designed electrocatalysts, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;atom catalysts, have attracted extensive interests due to their maximized atom utilization efficiency and increased activity. Herein, a new electrocatalyst system termed as &#8220;atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst&#8221;, that marries the advantages of typical single&#8208;/dual&#8208;atom catalysts while addressing their respective weaknesses, was proposed. In atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst, single&#8208;atom MNx and local carbon defects formed under a specific thermodynamic condition, act synergistically to achieve high electrocatalytic activity and battery efficiency. This symbiotic&#8208;catalyst shows greater structural precision and preparation accessibility than those of dual&#8208;atom catalysts owing to its reduced complexity in chemical space. Meanwhile, it outperforms the intrinsic activities of conventional single&#8208;atom catalysts due to multi&#8208;active&#8208;sites synergistic effect. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, an atomic symbiotic&#8208;catalyst comprising single&#8208;atom MnN4 moieties and abundant sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon defects was constructed for low&#8208;temperature zinc&#8208;air battery, which exhibited a high peak power density of 76&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with long&#8208;term stability at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, representing a top&#8208;level performance of such batteries.

         <title>Dynamic Ultralong Phosphorescence and Optical Waveguiding Switches in Silver&#8208;Organic Complex via Reversible Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
By leveraging single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal conversion and the heavy&#8208;atom effect, dynamically controllable ultralong phosphorescence and color&#8208;tunable optical waveguide can be designed within an Ag&#8208;organic complex. This approach provides a straightforward way to expand room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence towards intelligent switches and Information storage.







Abstract
Dynamic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials with stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have attracted considerable interest for applications in sensors, light&#8208;emitting devices, and information security. Here, we introduce a novel class of silver (Ag)&#8208;organic complexes exhibiting rare, direct ultralong RTP, achieved through the heavy&#8208;atom effect of Ag+ ions and highly ordered assembly of coordination polymers. The Ag&#8208;based complex displays reversible solvent&#8208;responsive RTP, shifting from green to yellow emission in response to humidity and solvent variations. This transformation is driven by a solvent&#8208;mediated single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) conversion, enabling color&#8208;tunable active optical waveguides and one&#8208;dimensional (1D) polarization switching. Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for creating dynamically controllable ultralong all&#8208;phosphorescent metal&#8208;organic complexes and advances the design of stimuli&#8208;responsive 1D photonic systems for promising information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Triple&#8208;Atom Sites Combined with Oxygen Vacancy for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to Propionic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a defect engineering strategy to create asymmetric triple&#8208;atom sites (Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+) on CuWO4 with oxygen vacancies (OVs), which achieves high propionic acid synthesis rates and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to the key roles of OVs and triple&#8208;atom sites. Such OVs&#8208;engineered asymmetric catalytic sites efficiently promote the multistep C&#8722;C coupling process.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to multicarbon products is an emerging approach for achieving carbon neutrality; however, the design of active sites that effectively promote multistep C&#8722;C coupling remains a challenge. Here, we propose a straightforward defect engineering approach to construct asymmetric triple&#8208;atom sites (Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+) on CuWO4 with oxygen vacancies (OVs) (named CWO&#8208;OVs). The optimized CWO&#8208;OVs achieve a photochemical synthesis rate of propionic acid (C3H6O2, PA) of 86.46&#177;2.92&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with an electron&#8208;based selectivity of 89.27&#8201;%, which exhibits a remarkable advantage in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations corroborate the prominent role of OVs in inducing the triple&#8208;atom sites: (1) the asymmetric Cu&#8208;Cu&#948;+ triggers the first step of C1&#8208;C1 coupling to form *CH2CH3; (2) Cu&#948;+&#8208;W&#948;+ facilitates subsequent C2&#8208;C1 bonding, ultimately leading to PA production. This charge&#8208;asymmetric cascade reaction system offers new insights into the design of efficient photocatalysts for the synthesis of multi&#8208;carbon products.

         <title>Dehydrogenative Dual Ammonia Activation and Transfer by an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Boryloxy Aluminyl Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases the first single&#8208;site main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated dual activation of ammonia (NH3) to hydrogen (H2) using a low&#8208;valent aluminyl compound. This transformation is driven by a (coordination/proton shuttling) N&#8722;H oxidative addition pathway and selective protonolysis. These findings highlight the potential of main&#8208;group complexes in traditionally transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dominated transformations.







Abstract
The reactivity of an N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) ligated aluminyl compound has been harnessed for main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative dual activation of ammonia. The Al(I) system K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al] reacts with excess NH3 to give the Al(III) bis(amide) K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al(NH2)2] and in the process generates H2. The initial stage of the reaction proceeds via formal N&#8722;H oxidative addition at Al(I) (via a coordination/proton shuttling sequence) to give an aluminium(III) primary amido hydride. Subsequent protonolysis of the strongly hydridic Al&#8722;H bond selectively yields the corresponding aluminium bis(amide) and H2. This step occurs without competing protolytic ligand loss &#8211; exploiting the limited basicity of the supporting [(boryl)O]&#8722; donors. In terms of amide transfer reactivity, the utility of K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al(NH2)2] in delivering one or both equivalents of [NH2]&#8722; to electrophilic substrates (HBpin, CO2 and Ph2CO) has been demonstrated.

         <title>Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen to Enable Durable MnO2 Electrocatalyst for Simultaneous Acidic Hydrogen Production and Biomass Valorization</title>

MnO2 is one of the promising anode catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, but it suffers from overoxidation and dissolution. This study observed that the lattice oxygen in &#947;&#8208;MnO2 was involved in water oxidation via Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen mechanism, which possibly accelerates the Mn dissolution. Instead, glucose oxidized to formic acid on &#947;&#8208;MnO2 via Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood mechanism, improving the durability of anode catalyst and product value of anodic product.







Abstract
Understanding and steering the stability of earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts in acidic medium is essential for proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer. Manganese oxide (MnO2) is one of the promising candidates for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but it still suffers from the overoxidation and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we observed that lattice oxygen was involved in the OER process on &#947;&#8208;MnO2 via Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen mechanism. Combined with theoretical calculation, we revealed that the release of lattice oxygen lowers the energy barrier of Mn dissolution and compromises the electrode durability. Based on this finding, we propose a strategy to efficiently stabilize lattice oxygen and suppress Mn overoxidation by replacing OER with glucose oxidation to formic acid, which follows a Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood mechanism. As a result, the durability of &#947;&#8208;MnO2 was enhanced by 1100 times, enabling long stability up to 960&#8197;hours. Moreover, we demonstrated a production rate of 487.1&#8197;mmol h&#8722;1 for formic acid and 16.7&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1 for H2 at 40&#8197;A in a PEM electrolyzer, providing a sustainable and scalable route for converting water and biomass into valuable chemicals and fuels.

         <title>Bridging the Oxo Wall: A New Perspective on High&#8208;valent Metal&#8208;Oxo Species and Their Reactivity in Mn, Fe, and Co Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel perspective on high&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species, particularly in Mn, Fe, and Co complexes. It reveals a surprising quantum mechanical mixture of CoIV=O and CoIII&#8211;O&#8226; species influenced by ligand design and symmetry. Additionally, the study uncovers correlations between oxyl radical character and C&#8722;H bond activation kinetics, challenging existing theories on reactivity.







Abstract
The &#8220;oxo&#8208;wall&#8221; is a well&#8208;established concept in the area of bioinorganic chemistry, which refers to the instability of the terminal metal&#8208;oxo complexes in the +4 oxidation state, with tetragonal C4v symmetry beyond group 8 elements. This leads to a diverse and highly reactive chemistry of Co&#8208;oxo complexes, as evidenced in the literature, ranging from challenging C&#8722;H bond activation to efficient water oxidation. Despite extensive research on first&#8208;row terminal metal&#8208;oxo complexes and the &#8220;oxo&#8208;wall&#8221; concept, studies correlating the reactivity of these species across the periodic table remain scarce. In this work, using a combination of DFT and ab initio CASSCF calculations, we have explored the structure, bonding, and reactivity of [MIV/V(15&#8208;TMC)(O)(CH3CN)]m+ (M= Mn, Fe and Co) species. Our study reveals several intriguing outcomes: (i) while existing literature typically indicates the presence of either CoIV=O or CoIII&#8211;O&#8226; species beyond the wall, we propose a quantum mechanical mixture of these two species (termed as CoIV=O CoIII&#8211;O&#8226;), with the per cent of mixing dictated by ligand architecture and symmetry considerations; (ii) we observe that the oxyl radical character increases beyond the wall, correlating with larger Ntrans&#8208;M&#8722;O tilt angles; and (iii) we identify an inverse relationship between the percentage of M&#8211;O&#8226; character and the kinetic barriers for C&#8722;H bond activation. These findings offer a new perspective on the roles of oxidation states, spin states, and the nature of the metal ion in reactivity.

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates 515 candidate structures featuring a planar tetracoordinate oxygen (ptO) atom, adhering to the 18 valence electron rule and formulated as OXnYmq. Among these, 35 global minima were identified, primarily stabilized by Group 13 elements with charge states spanning &#8722;1 to +1. Notably, bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions&#8212;from covalent to polar ionic&#8212;that challenge traditional assumptions about unconventional oxygen bonding motifs.







Abstract
Planar tetracoordinate oxygen (ptO) atoms are rare, with only a few examples confirmed to date. This study systematically investigates 515 potential structures, formulated as OXnYmq, where n+m=4, q ranging from +2 to &#8722;2, and following the 18&#8208;valence electron rule. High&#8208;level ab initio calculations identified 35 global minima containing a ptO atom, predominantly stabilized by Group&#8197;13 elements. Bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions, from covalent to polar ionic, and confirms high electron delocalization. The findings challenge traditional bonding paradigms, improve the understanding of ptO&#8208;containing clusters, and propose viable ptO clusters for gas&#8208;phase detection, advancing the study of unconventional oxygen bonding.

         <title>Efficient Generation of Negative Hydrogen with Bimetallic&#8208;Ternary&#8208;Structured Catalysts for Nitrobenzene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalysts Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 catalysts exhibited highest activity for hydrogen evolution form AB hydrolysis with a TOF value of 2716&#8197;min&#8722;1 and achieved &gt;90&#8201;% yields within 3&#8211;4&#8197;hours using AB as H in converting nitrobenzene to anilines.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation (TH) with in situ negative hydrogen (H&#8722;) has received extensive attention as an alternative to conventional high&#8208;pressure hydrogenation processes. However, the insufficient activity of hydrogen production and unclear the conversion process of hydrogenation remain a great challenge. In this work, brand new bimetallic ternary&#8208;structured catalysts (Ru1+nM1&#8208;TiO2, M=Co, Cu, Fe, Ni) were synthesized to efficiently generate H&#8722; donors from ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) for nitrobenzene hydrogenation under moderate conditions. The Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 catalysts exhibited highest activity for hydrogen production form AB hydrolysis with a TOF value of 2716&#8197;min&#8722;1. The Ru1+nCo1&#8208;TiO2 achieved &gt;90&#8201;% yields within 3&#8211;4&#8197;hours in converting nitrobenzene to anilines using AB. Mechanistic studies revealed that the high hydrolysis activity was due to that the Ru SA and Co SA sites of the bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalyst required the lowest energy for the activation of AB and H2O, respectively. Remarkably, the Co SA and Ru clusters exhibited an obvious synergistic effect in the TH process, which promoted the tandem hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. This work demonstrated an efficient approach to generate H&#8722; donor with bimetallic&#8208;ternary&#8208;structured catalysts in TH process and further provided new inspiration on the development of multifunctional catalysts.

         <title>Twist and Shine: Ultra&#8208;Narrow Red Emission from Nitrogen and Oxygen Co&#8208;Doped Hetero&#8208;Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly twisted hetero&#8208;nanographenes co&#8208;doped with nitrogen and oxygen are synthesized via a three&#8208;step strategy. These molecules feature a bis&#8208;fused diazacoronene core, with benzopyran rings fused at the periphery to enhance the rigidity of &#960;&#8208;framework. This unique design enables ultra&#8208;narrow red emission, highlighting their potential for optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Nanographenes, known for their exceptional optoelectronic properties, have garnered significant interest for their tunable electronic structures, particularly through heteroatom doping. Herein, we report the synthesis of two twisted hetero&#8208;nanographenes (h&#8208;NGs) co&#8208;doped with nitrogen and oxygen via a three&#8208;step strategy, where the tandem Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization and ipso&#8208;aromatic substitution serve as a key step. Both h&#8208;NGs incorporate a unique bis&#8208;fused diazacoronene (BFDAC) core, with one further extending the &#960;&#8208;system via peri&#8208;fusion of four benzopyran units. Single&#8208;crystal analyses reveal that BFDAC core of both h&#8208;NGs adopts a highly twisted geometry, whereas the benzopyran&#8208;fused one has enhanced rigidity. Theoretical studies confirm a global aromaticity with 30 &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalized along BFDAC periphery. Notably, co&#8208;doping enables precise electronic tuning, with pyridinic nitrogen lowering the LUMO level and benzopyran oxygen raising the HOMO level. Both h&#8208;NGs display the red photoluminescence (PL), and the benzopyran&#8208;fused derivative exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrow emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 19&#8197;nm, among the narrowest reported for organic red&#8208;emitting materials. Both h&#8208;NGs exhibit acid&#8208;responsive optical behavior including near&#8208;infrared absorption shift and PL quenching, providing additional functional versatility.

         <title>Nucleation Engineering to Strengthen Interface Contacts in Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through regulating the nucleation barrier at the substrate surface, the nucleation process is prone to occur at the substrate, resulting in intimate interface contact, balanced electron/hole carrier extraction and suppressed interface nonradiative recombination. An impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.8&#8201;% with improved thermal stability is achieved, setting a new efficiency benchmark for single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on single crystals hold potential for higher efficiency and stability, while the incomplete interface contact hinders hole carrier extraction and device performance. Herein, we report strengthening crystal/substrate contact by nucleation engineering based on in situ growth strategy. Through modulating the hole transport layer (HTL) to induce the nucleation process at substrate surface, interface residual solution, voids, and small&#8208;sized crystals are eliminated, thus ensuring intimate interface contact physically. Combining with strong interaction between perovskites and HTL, balanced electron/hole carrier extraction and suppressed nonradiative recombination are achieved. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8&#8201;% is obtained, setting a new efficiency benchmark for single&#8208;crystal PSCs. Moreover, the thermal&#8208;induced peeling&#8208;off of crystals from substrates is mitigated, which improves the device thermal stability distinctly.

         <title>From Holodirected to Hemidirected Coordination Activated by Oxygenation Strategy: A Facile Route to Long Wave Infrared Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that the 5&#8197;s2 lone pair electrons of Sb3+ in halides can be activated by oxygen atom, which inspired the creation of the first alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalide Rb2Sb2OCl6. Its birefringence has been increased by an order of magnitude compared with the holodirected coordination Rb13Sb8Cl37. Large&#8208;sized crystal measurements show that Rb2Sb2OCl6 features a good transmittance from 0.4 to 13.5&#8197;&#956;m, covering the near, mid and long wave infrared range, confirming its potential as a long wave infrared birefringent crystal.







Abstract
Long wave infrared (LWIR) birefringent crystals are essential for infrared optical applications but such materials are rarely reported due to the requirements of large birefringence and wide infrared transmission range. This study proposes a facile route to create new LWIR birefringent crystal by oxygenation strategy in halides with cations containing lone pair electrons. Given the tendency of such cations to form holodirected geometry, a divalent oxygen was introduced to substitute the monovalent halogen to decrease the coordination number and activate the lone pair electrons. Our efforts in Rb+&#8208;Sb3+&#8208;Cl&#8722; system result three new structures, namely, Rb13Sb8Cl37, Rb3Sb2OCl7 and Rb2Sb2OCl6. The holodirected SbCl6 in Rb13Sb8Cl37 has been successfully translated to hemidirected SbOCl4 in Rb3Sb2OCl7 and Rb2Sb2OCl6, which are the first examples in alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides. The birefringence of Rb2Sb2OCl6 reached to 0.191@550&#8197;nm, which is 11.2 times that of Rb13Sb8Cl37 (0.017@550&#8197;nm). Large&#8208;sized crystal of Rb2Sb2OCl6 have been successfully grown (6&#215;6&#215;2&#8197;mm3). It can exhibit good transmission performance in the range of 0.4&#8211;13.5&#8197;&#956;m, indicating its potential as a promising LWIR birefringent crystal. Our research not only opens up a new material system &#8211; alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides, but also provides a new strategy to create LWIR birefringent crystals.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We illustrate the first Pd catalyzed regioselective distal and atroposelective olefination through dynamic kinetic resolution of simple arenes/biaryl via an electrooxidative reaction pathway. Electricity plays a significant role in streamlining the &#8216;regio&#8208;resolved&#8217; reaction furnishing chiral molecules synthesis without the requirement of metal oxidants and thermal energy. Both electroanalytical studies and DFT calculation suggest the involvement of a Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalytic cycle via a Pd(III) intermediate for both the distal and atroposelective olefination reaction.@dm_lab; @maiti_iitb







Abstract
Regioselective and enantioselective C&#8208;H functionalization is a valuable method for synthesizing chiral and complex molecules. However, it often requires large amounts of toxic oxidants and high temperature, making it environmentally and economically adverse. Additionally, these traditional approaches generally suffer from regioselectivity and enantioselectivity issues. To overcome these limitations, a new mechanism is needed to control both of these simultaneously. Herein, we report the first Pd catalyzed regioselective distal and atroposelective olefination of simple arenes/biaryls via an electrooxidative reaction pathway. This unique electro&#8208;oxidative strategy with Pd(II) catalysis demonstrates unprecedented access to &#8216;regio&#8208;resolved&#8217; reactions, furnishing chiral molecule synthesis under dynamic kinetic resolution without the conventional requirement of metal&#8208;based oxidants and thermal energy. Both electroanalytical studies and DFT calculations suggest the involvement of a Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalytic cycle via a crucial Pd(III) intermediate that initiates both the distal and atroposelective olefination reactions.

         <title>A Mechanochromic Rotaxane that Releases Azetidine&#8208;Trityl&#8208;Maleimide, a Versatile Fluorescent Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochromic rotaxane capable of releasing azetidine&#8208;trityl&#8208;maleimide (ATM), a new fluorescent probe displaying excellent optical properties (rigidochromic, large Stokes shift, solvent insensitive) and chemical stability (pH, nucleophiles, dienes), is presented. The mechanochemical generation of ATM is only possible with a rotaxane actuator, and this device should find applications in materials and biological science.







Abstract
Force sensing at the molecular level has enabled the study of materials failure and it offers great promises for the investigation of mechanobiological processes. Traditional force probes rely on the reversible or irreversible activation of mechanochromic precursors to assess transient or permanent changes in polymer networks. A promising approach involves force&#8208;controlled release of sensing molecules, as the accumulation of chromic molecules at specific sites would enable the recording of deformation histories. However, many fluorescent probes are limited by environmental sensitivity, specific release conditions, or low release efficiency. Maleimide&#8208;based dyes, especially amino maleimides, offer a robust alternative due to their small size, structural versatility, and tuneable fluorescence properties. Here, we present a mechanochromic rotaxane device that releases an azetidine&#8208;trityl&#8208;maleimide (ATM) fluorescent probe via a retro&#8208;[4+2] cycloaddition reaction. ATM is a rigidochromic, chemically stable, and environmentally insensitive probe, generated exclusively through rotaxane actuation, underscoring the unique mechanochemical properties of rotaxanes. This device holds potential for applications in material science and biology, such as the investigation of polymer networks and active tissues.

         <title>Nanourchin&#8208;like Uricase&#8208;Poly(L&#8208;proline) Conjugate with Retained Enzymatic Activity, Mitigated Immunogenicity, and Sustained Efficacy Upon Repeated Administrations</title>

Poly(L&#8208;proline) conjugated uricase was facilely produced via a grafting&#8208;from approach, which showed mitigated immunogenicity and preserved activity in vivo after repeated injections.







Abstract
The poor half&#8208;life and strong immunogenicity of proteins such as uricase (UOx), a therapeutic enzyme for chronic refractory gout and hyperuricemia, are pressing clinical challenges. Although conjugation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEGylation) of UOx can improve the pharmacokinetics, preexisting or induced anti&#8208;PEG antibodies, which lead to accelerate blood clearance (ABC) and reduced response rate, have been a major clinical hurdle. Herein, we report the facile &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; preparation of a nanourchin&#8208;like uricase&#8208;poly(L&#8208;proline) conjugate, namely UOx&#8208;PLP, with high grafting&#8208;density, enhanced thermal, lyophilization, freeze&#8208;thaw, and proteolytic stability. Through a transient preblocking strategy in the synthesis, the UOx&#8208;PLP overcomes activity loss and retains ~82&#8201;% enzyme activity. In Sprague&#8208;Dawley rats, UOx&#8208;PLP stimulates minimum complement activation and anti&#8208;UOx antibodies. Unlike PEG&#8208;UOx gave a significantly reduced half&#8208;life after repetitive administrations, UOx&#8208;PLP shows no sign of ABC effect. Moreover, the half&#8208;life of UOx&#8208;PLP remain almost unchanged when cross&#8208;administrated to rats previously received PEG&#8208;UOx and with high titers of anti&#8208;UOx antibodies. Finally, UOx&#8208;PLP shows minimum loss of efficacy after five straight administrations in a UOx knock&#8208;out hyperuricemia mice model, whereas PEG&#8208;UOx experiences sharp loss of efficacy upon the same treatment. Overall, the simple preparation and outstanding nonclinical results highlight the enormous potential of UOx&#8208;PLP for future clinical translation.

         <title>Evolution&#8208;Guided Discovery of Antimycobacterial Triculamin&#8208;Like Lasso Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hypothesized convergent biosynthesis of triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides from different biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) types represented across multiple bacterial phyla. The elucidation of the triculamin non&#8208;canonical BGC and resistance mechanism by heterologous expression in Streptomyces albus and in&#8197;vitro acetylation with resistance conveying enzyme. Discovery and characterization of two triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides from canonical lasso peptide BGCs.







Abstract
Triculamin is a ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) lasso peptide with potent antimycobacterial activity, produced by an unusual, non&#8208;canonical biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). In this study, we elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of triculamin through heterologous expression and show that the biosynthesis proceeds in the presence of a precursor (triA), macrocyclase (triC), and N&#8208;acetyltransferase (triT). Through in&#8197;vitro triT acetylation and bioactivity assays, we show that acetylation functions as a resistance mechanism. Genomic searches of triculamin BGC genes across bacteria show that triculamin is more widely distributed than previously anticipated, as triculamin&#8208;like core peptides are found in at least three phyla in contrast to previously described lasso peptides that are typically restricted to one phylum. Triculamin BGCs with both canonical and non&#8208;canonical RiPP biosynthetic genes were identified. Two strains containing canonical triculamin&#8208;like BGCs were chemically characterized and shown to produce the novel triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides palmamin and gelatinamin, the latter of which appears to have an unprecedented additional ring formation. Detailed phylogenetic investigation of the macrocyclases from triculamin&#8208;like BGCs suggests that these molecules are products of convergent evolution. These findings broaden the evolutionary and functional landscape of lasso peptides, revealing their unexpected diversification and cross&#8208;phylum distribution.

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of Alkenes and Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is a new masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent that enables previously inaccessible radical chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of alkenes, as well as highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of heteroarenes. The method involves conversion of the weakly electrophilic bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate into a masked electrophile, significantly increasing its reactivity, allowing late&#8208;stage functionalization of diverse pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Structural modification of drug candidates with fluorine atoms has revolutionized drug discovery, frequently enhancing pharmacological properties. However, the strategic integration of privileged bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol moiety remains challenging, primarily due to the overreliance on closed&#8208;shell strategies typically involving toxic gaseous hexafluoroacetone. Alternative radical&#8208;based strategies exist but are constrained by the inherently weak electrophilicity of the key bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate, significantly limiting the scope of accessible transformations. Here we report the development of a novel masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent, enabling the efficient generation of bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical species with significantly enhanced electrophilicity under mild photocatalytic conditions. This approach facilitates chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of versatile alkenes, alongside highly selective C2&#8722;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of diverse heteroarenes, providing streamlined access to a structurally diverse array of alkyl and aryl bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols previously considered synthetically challenging.

         <title>Formation of the Diketopiperazine Moiety by a Distinct Condensation&#8208;Like Domain in Hangtaimycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of structural biology, genetics, biochemistry, and computational chemistry revealed a specific mechanism by which a CT domain with the &#8220;PW&#215;&#215;&#215;DG&#8221; motif stabilizes an amidate intermediate through a protonated arginine residue R2776 outside the motif to mediate nucleophilic attack. The findings expand knowledge of C domain functions in non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are key enzymes in pharmaceutical synthesis, with condensation (C) domains catalyzing amide bond formation between aminoacyl substrates. However, recent research has elucidated that the catalytic capabilities of C domains extend beyond the traditional formation of peptide bonds. In this study, we elucidate the cyclization mechanism of the NRPS&#8208;derived natural products hangtaimycin (HTM), characterized by the formation of a 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine (DKP) moiety which involves an intramolecular vinylamide&#8208;mediated nucleophilic attack instead of an N&#8208;terminal amino group. This cyclization is catalyzed by a terminal condensation&#8208;like (CT) domain within the NRPS enzyme HtmB2. We investigated the evolutionary specificity of the HtmB2&#8208;CT within Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417. Employing a multidisciplinary analytical approach, we have delineated the molecular underpinnings of DKP formation within the HTM biosynthesis. This process is facilitated by residue R2776, which modulates the formation of reactive species and stabilizes the amidate through electrostatic interactions. Besides, we found a positive correlation between the alkaline strength of the residue at position 2776 and the activity of HtmB2&#8208;CT. Our study elucidates the formation mechanism of DKPs in NRPS&#8208;derived natural products, thereby bridging a critical gap in the structural and mechanistic understanding of this field.

         <title>6H&#8208;Intermediate Phase Enabled Slow Crystal Growth of Tin Halide Perovskites for Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We controlled the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. High&#8208;quality FASnI2Br perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects, which resulted in an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;% under indoor illumination at 1000&#8197;lux.







Abstract
The rapid expansion of Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) has driven significant advancements in indoor photovoltaics (IPVs), which provide power to wireless IoT devices. Tin halide perovskites (THPs) have garnered significant attention for IPVs due to their excellent optoelectronic properties without the environmental risks of lead exposure. However, THPs face challenges in controlling their fast crystallization process. Here, we introduce a novel approach to precisely control the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. The grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements indicated the formation of 6H&#8208;intermediate phase for the FASnI2Br&#8208;4APCl perovskite during the crystallization process. The in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy during the spin coating and annealing process confirmed the reduction of crystal growth rate after the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase formation. Thus, high&#8208;quality perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects. The resulting IPVs achieved an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;% under indoor illumination at 1000 lux, exceeding all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs.

         <title>Chemocatalytic Cell Tagging Platform for Recording Cell&#8208;Cell Interactions via Engineered Palladium&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an innovative chemocatalytic proximity labeling platform&#8208;Artificial Metalloenzyme Tagging Technology (ArM&#8208;Tag). The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a protein scaffold to catalyze a bioorthogonal O&#8208;deallylation reaction directly on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range.







Abstract
Proximity labeling platforms (PLPs) have become a powerful tool for studying spatial cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs) in living organisms. However, their effectiveness often relies on membranal catalytic modules of bait cells, such as natural enzymes or small&#8208;molecule photocatalysts, which are typically constrained by complex genetic modifications or the limited applicability of visible light. Here, we present a novel chemocatalytic approach, ArM&#8208;Tag, which utilizes an engineered artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) for cell surface&#8208;localized tagging. The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a streptavidin (SAV) scaffold to catalyze the O&#8208;deallylation reaction on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range. By integrating Biotin&#8208;SAV technology with directed evolution, we engineered a series of biotinylated Pd complexes and optimized the ArM for efficient catalysis. We demonstrate the power of this approach by applying the ArM&#8208;Tag system to selectively record antigen&#8208;specific CCIs, specifically showing how CAR&#8722;T cells interact with tumor cells through the mesothelin/anti&#8208;mesothelin axis. This versatile, non&#8208;genetic system provides a powerful tool for probing CCIs and offers exciting prospects for advancing immunotherapy, particularly in targeted cancer treatments and immune cell&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Behavior by Single&#8208;site Pt on RuO2 for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Glycolic Acid from Plastic Wastes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site Pt&#8208;doped RuO2 was developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for synthesis of GA and H2 fuels from PET wastes. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500&#8197;h at 6&#8197;A with a GA and H2 yield rate of 4.06&#8197;g h&#8722;1 and 2.38&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, using a membrane electrode assembly.







Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes into valuable glycolic acid (GA) is an ideal solution for resource utilization. However, simultaneously achieving high activity and selectivity remains challenging due to the over&#8208;oxidation and C&#8722;C cleavage during ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation in PET hydrolysate. Herein, we develop an atomically isolated Pt on RuO2 (Pt1/RuO2) catalyst composed of high&#8208;density Pt&#8722;Ru interfaces that ensure single&#8208;site adsorption of EG, enrich surface *OH coverage and weaken *CO&#8722;CH2OH intermediate adsorption, thereby synergistically promoting GA generation. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 delivers a remarkable mass activity of 8.09&#8197;A/mgPt, as well as a high GA Faradaic efficiency (95.3&#8201;%) and selectivity (96.9&#8201;%). Under membrane electrode assembly conditions, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500&#8197;h at 6&#8197;A with a GA yield rate of 4.06&#8197;g h&#8722;1. In&#8208;depth theoretical and in situ spectroscopic investigations reveal the synergy between isolated Pt and oxophilic RuO2 plays a crucial role in high&#8208;efficiency EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion. This study offers valuable insights for the rational design of advanced catalysts for GA synthesis from PET wastes via a single&#8208;site doped bimetallic strategy.

         <title>Achieving Highly Reversible Mn2+/MnO2 Conversion Reaction in Electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 Batteries via Electrochemical&#8208;Chemical Process Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiO2 and FeSO4 are introduced into the electrolyte to construct a colloidal electrolyte, which synergistically promotes efficient conversion of MnO2/Mn2+. During charging, SiO2 promotes efficient deposition of Mn2+ and Mn3+, while during discharge, the introduction of Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pairs facilitate efficient dissolution of MnO2. The synergistic effect enhances the reversibility of MnO2/Mn2+ reaction.







Abstract
Despite the widespread interest in electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries with excellent output voltage and high theoretical capacity, the spontaneous disproportionation reaction of free Mn3+ along with the disorderly deposited inactive MnO2 results in the low Mn2+/MnO2 conversion reversibility, which seriously affects their cycling stability. Here, we propose a novel aqueous SiO2 colloidal electrolyte with FeSO4 mediator (denoted as SF electrolyte) based on a bidirectional electrochemical&#8208;chemical model to achieve dual regulation of the MnO2 deposition/dissolution process. During the charging process, the SiO2 colloidal particles located at the carbon felt interface and the electrolyte bulk phase simultaneously provide sufficient disproportionation sites for the diffused Mn3+ to guide the orderly rapid deposition of MnO2. Meanwhile, the introduction of Fe2+ mediators during the discharge process can sufficiently react with MnO2 on the SiO2 particles in the electrolyte, thereby further enabling the efficient conversion of Mn2+/MnO2. Consequently, electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 battery with SF electrolyte can stably run for 550&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and achieve superior reversibility at a high area capacity of 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of colloidal electrolytes in modulating electrochemical&#8208;chemical processes to stabilize electrolytic Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence by Knocking Out Gold Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passivating oxide formation in ideal gold electrodes reflects in weaker ECL intensity of conventional [Ru(bpy)3]2+/TPrA systems. Such hampering behavior were eliminated by selective knocking out of surface asperities and catalytic deactivation via Cu&#8208;Fenton reagent. Results exhibited 2.7&#8208;fold increase in ECL intensity with switching mechanism from direct oxidation to catalytic pathway.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of the conventional system of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminophore and amine&#8208;based coreactants is particularly inefficient on noble metal electrodes. This is due to the formation of a passivating oxide layer on the metal surface inhibiting the electro&#8208;oxidation of amines like tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) coreactant. Herein, we demonstrated the enhancement of ECL emission on gold surface by hydroxyl radicals attack that are chemically generated with Cu&#8208;Fenton reagent. These radicals selectively deactivate the gold active sites and knockout the metal surface asperities that counterintuitively led to an amplification of the ECL emission. Atomic force microscopy shows a massive smoothening of the surface. The electrochemical characterization proves that the involved ECL reaction mechanism switches from direct oxidation to catalytic route, where the kinetics of indirect TPrA oxidation is facilitated on deactivated gold surface. Besides, in situ smoothening of a rough electrode in presence of tandem [Ru(bpy)3]2+/TPrA enables Cu2+ sensing with good reliability and limit of detection. Such atomically smoothened and corrosion&#8208;resistant gold surface readily tuned the ECL reactivity and opened new directions on influence of topography and reactivity on ECL mechanisms, thus will be extremely useful for the future development of ECL imaging strategies and highly sensitive ECL sensors.

         <title>Bionic Hollow Porous Carbon Nanofibers for Energy&#8208;Dense and Rapid Zinc Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging electrospinning technology in combination with coordination chemistry, capillary&#8208;like hollow carbon nanofibers were synthesized. Attributable to their unique microstructure and optimized nanopore size, those nanofibers, when employed as cathodes in zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor, achieve battery&#8208;level energy density at high power outputs, coupled with remarkable cycling stability.







Abstract
Suboptimal spatial utilization and inefficient access to internal porosity preclude porous carbon cathodes from delivering high energy density in zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs). Inspired by the function of capillaries in biological systems, this study proposes a facile coordination&#8208;pyrolysis method to fabricate thin&#8208;walled hollow carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with optimized pore structure and surface functional groups for ZIHCs. The capillary&#8208;like CNFs maximize the electrode/electrolyte interface area, facilitating the optimal utilization of energy storage sites. The precision&#8208;engineered pore sizes in the fiber walls are specifically tailored to accommodate solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+, thus enhancing ion storage capacity and supporting accelerated transport kinetics. The resultant ZIHCs achieve a battery&#8208;grade energy density of 132.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 (based on active material), remarkable stability (98.7&#8201;% retention after 80,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), along with practically high areal capacities. Combined in situ/ex&#8197;situ spectroscopic characterizations, kinetic analyses, and theoretical calculations revealed that the superior energy storage performance arises from the advantageous microstructure of the biomimetic CNFs and the reversible physical/chemical adsorption process. This investigation offers a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency zinc ion storage carbon nanomaterials and provides insights into the cathodic storage mechanisms essential for advancing ZIHCs.

         <title>A Highly Selective and Versatile Probe Platform for Visualization of Monoacylglycerol Lipase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a key enzyme in the endocannabinoid system. We developed a highly flexible and specific probe platform to visualize MAGL in several cell types such as neurons or primary human immune cells. These results demonstrate the potential of the probe platform to unravel the manifold (patho)physiological roles and functions of MAGL in the endocannabinoid system.







Abstract
Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a key enzyme for signal termination in the endocannabinoid system (ECS). MAGL inhibition results in indirect activation of the cannabinoid receptors, which offers unique advantages for the treatment of, e.g., multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders. Molecular imaging techniques are valuable tools to overcome the current poor understanding of MAGL's distribution and role in patho&#8208; and physiological processes within ECS signaling. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and validation of highly selective versatile fluorescent and click&#8208;chemistry probes for MAGL. Structure&#8208;based design combined with a reverse&#8208;design approach allowed the development of a structural unit that selectively and effectively recognizes MAGL while offering a versatile platform to attach different fluorophores and further reporter units. In this way, labeled probes with sub&#8208;nanomolar potency carrying diverse fluorescent dyes were obtained. Probe affinity and selectivity remained invariant to changes in the fluorophore subunit, showing the remarkable robustness of this platform in delivering tailor&#8208;made probes. Highly consistent inhibition across species supports pharmacological model translatability. Extensive profiling and validation in various cellular systems shows the ability of these highly potent and selective probes to elucidate the complex role of MAGL in ECS cellular signaling, inflammatory processes, and disease progression.

         <title>Building Localized NADP(H) Recycling Circuits to Advance Enzyme Cascadetronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A consequence of the high catalytic activities and selectivities of many enzymes is that cascades enclosed within a mesoporous conducting material using NADP(H) and intermediates as internal current carriers display the almost instantaneous information&#8208;transfer properties usually associated with electronic circuits. Such collective behavior of enzymes is demonstrated by incorporating a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing pair to compete against the external potential bias.







Abstract
The catalytic action of enzymes in a cascade trapped within a mesoporous electrode material is simultaneously energized, controlled and observed through the efficient, reversible electrochemical NAD(P)(H) recycling catalyzed by one of the enzymes. In their nanoconfined state, nicotinamide cofactors are tightly channeled current carriers, mediating multi&#8208;step reactions in either direction (oxidation or reduction) with a rapid response time. By incorporating a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing enzyme pair, the internal action of which opposes the external voltage bias driving oxidation or reduction, a reduction process can be performed under overall oxidizing conditions, and vice versa. The power of the method to control and resolve complex metabolic pathways is demonstrated using a non&#8208;linear, three&#8208;enzyme cascade extended by incorporating a fourth enzyme, urease. The latter generates in situ ammonia, which is enzymatically consumed in a reductive process, but the immediate current response to each addition of urea is observed, unusually, by applying an oxidizing potential. A practical consequence is that enzyme&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical reduction reactions requiring anaerobic conditions (to avoid O2 interference) can readily be studied under ambient aerobic conditions. The results illustrate how a complex enzyme cascade confined within a porous electrode and connected to an electrical power source manifests characteristics associated with electronic circuits.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Hydrolysis of Nitriles to Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive hydrolysis of inexpensive and easily accessible nitriles using Ni&#8208;tripos complex allows for the synthesis of functionalized and structurally diverse benzylic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic primary alcohols including the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Nitriles are an abundant class of compounds that are widely used as versatile feedstocks to produce various chemicals including pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals as well as materials. Here we report Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydrolysis of nitriles to alcohols in the presence of molecular hydrogen. This conversion likely occurs in a domino reaction sequence that first involves the hydrogenation of nitrile to primary imine, then the hydrolysis of imine, and subsequent deamination to the aldehyde, which is finally hydrogenated to the desired alcohol. Crucial for this reductive hydrolysis process is the commercially available triphos&#8208;ligated Ni&#8208;complex that enables highly efficient and selective transformation of aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic nitriles including fatty nitriles to prepare functionalized primary alcohols. Further, the synthetic applicability of this Ni&#8208;based protocol is presented for the selective conversion of nitrile to alcoholic group in structurally diverse and complex drug molecules as well as agrochemicals. The resulting products, alcohols are indispensable chemicals commonly used in organic synthesis and life sciences as well as material and energy technologies.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Micelle&#8208;Driven Hydrodefluorination for Accessing Unprotected Monofluorinated Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micelles derived from non&#8208;ionic surfactants serve a dual purpose as both solvents and electrolytes, facilitating a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, eco&#8208;friendly hydrodefluorination reaction and thereby minimizing the environmental impact. By utilizing aqueous micelles of PS&#8208;750&#8208;M in the presence of an electric field, an efficient hydrodefluorination of diverse difluorinated indoles is accomplished. This approach reduces waste, enhances atom economy, and enables recycling of aqueous micelles.







Abstract
Toxic organic solvents and electrolytes, traditionally indispensable for electro&#8208;organic synthesis, are now being reconsidered. In developing more sustainable electro&#8208;organic synthesis, we've harnessed the aqueous micelles as solvents and electrolyte&#8208;like structures when deformed under an electric field. The technology is showcased in synthetically highly valued hydrodefluorination reactions of difluorinated indoles. This mild electrosynthetic method produces monofluorinated unprotected indole scaffolds. Our approach minimizes waste and enhances atom economy, reducing reliance on expensive and hazardous solvents and electrolytes. The surfactant's potential for recycling was verified for two cycles. Cyclic voltammetry analysis has corroborated that PS&#8208;750&#8208;M micelles in water establish a more efficient platform for hydrodefluorination. Our technology simplifies the production of monofluorinated indoles, which are crucial for many drug&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Esterification of Phosphoric, Phosphonic and Phosphinic Acids with Organosilicates: Phosphorus Chemical Recycling of Sewage Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical recycling of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) recovered from sewage sludge ash into valuable phosphate triesters has been achieved via a novel esterification method with tetraalkyl orthosilicate. The approach offers an innovative recycling pathway, producing key industrial phosphorus chemicals without the use of white phosphorus while addressing phosphorus resource limitations and environmental impact.







Abstract
Global concerns regarding the depletion and strategic importance of phosphorus resources have increased demand for the recovery and recycling. However, waste&#8208;derived phosphorus compounds, primarily as chemically inert phosphoric acid or its salts, present a challenge to their direct conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals. We aimed to develop an innovative technology that utilizes the large quantities of sewage waste, bypasses the use of white phosphorus, and enables esterification of phosphoric acid to produce widely applicable phosphate triesters. Tetraalkyl orthosilicates emerged as highly effective reagents for the direct triple esterification of 85&#8201;% phosphoric acid, as well as the esterification of organophosphinic and phosphonic acids. Furthermore, we achieved esterification of recovered phosphoric acid with tetraalkyl orthosilicate, thus pioneering a recycling pathway from sewage waste to valuable phosphorus chemicals. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed a novel mechanism, wherein tetraalkyl orthosilicates facilitate multimolecular aggregation to achieve alkyl transfer from tetraalkylorthosilicate to phosphoric acid via multiple proton shuttling.

         <title>Imine&#8208;Based Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors Featuring Degradability and Biocompatibility for Transient Bioinspired Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a regiochemistry&#8208;regulated backbone curvature approach to achieve two novel imine&#8208;based polymeric mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors. These materials exhibit excellent electrochemical transistor performance with structural disorder&#8208;tolerance upon doping, efficient acid&#8208;degradability, and tunable film crystallinity, enabling the conversion from volatile to non&#8208;volatile operation in OECT based artificial synapses. This demonstrates great potential for advancing sustainable, bio&#8208;inspired transient electronics.







Abstract
Degradable features are highly desirable to advance next&#8208;generation organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) for transient bioinspired artificial intelligence devices. It is highly challenging that OMIECs exhibit excellent mixed ionic&#8208;electronic behavior and show degradability simultaneously. Specially, in OMIECs, doping is often a tradeoff between structural disorder and charge carrier mobilities. Here, we describe a regiochemistry&#8208;driven backbone curvature approach to prepare OMIECs, enabling doped state ordered within efficient ionic&#8208;electronic conduction in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) and presenting degradable characteristics. Significantly, i&#8208;3gTIT shows an outstanding mobility (1.99&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) and &#956;C* (302&#8197;F&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and presents higher disorder&#8208;tolerance upon doping and faster degradation behavior than its regioisomer, o&#8208;3gTIT. Especially, the resulting OECT&#8208;based inverter shows a high voltage gain of 31.6&#8197;V&#8201;V&#8722;1 at a low driving voltage of 0.6&#8197;V. Moreover, we demonstrate an application of transient OECT, i.&#8197;e., biodegradable solid&#8208;state electrolyte of OECT&#8208;based artificial synapses. Remarkably, the regiochemistry&#8208;driven film crystallinity modulation enables the conversion from volatile to non&#8208;volatile operation in such synapses. The transient synapse based on i&#8208;3gTIT achieves over 90&#8201;% recognition accuracy for small digit handwritten images, showing potential in security neuromorphic computing. Our work is the first presentation enabling excellent mixed conduction of OMIECs with degradable features for transient bioinspired electronics.

         <title>Bridging Electrolyte Bulk and Interfacial Chemistry: Dynamic Protective Strategy Enable Ultra&#8208;Long Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior service lifespan aqueous Zn battery was built by taking advantage of the biomass&#8208;derived chitin nanocrystals colloid electrolyte to bridge electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry for achieving dynamic protective strategy. This unique strategy not only enables continuous optimization of electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry within the battery but also facilitates self&#8208;repairing of mechanical damages both internally and externally, resulting in building comprehensive, persistent, and dynamic protection for aqueous Zn batteries.







Abstract
The main bottleneck of rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) is their limited cycle lifespans stemming from the unhealthy electrolyte bulk and fragile interface, especially in the absence of dynamic protection mechanism between them. To overcome this limitation, benefitting from their synergistic physical and chemical properties, chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs) are employed as superior colloid electrolyte to bridge electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry for ultra&#8208;long lifespan AZBs. This unique strategy not only enables continuous optimization of the electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry within the battery but also facilitates self&#8208;repairing of mechanical damage both internally and externally, thereby achieving comprehensive, persistent, and dynamic protection. As a result, the modified zinc (Zn) cells present high Zn plating/stripping coulombic efficiencies of 97.71&#8201;% ~99.81&#8201;% from 5 to 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and remarkably service lifespan up to 8,200&#8197;h (more than 11&#8197;months). Additionally, the Zn//MnO2 full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 70.1&#8201;% after 3,000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This dynamic protective strategy to challenge aqueous Zn chemistry may open up a new avenue for building better AZBs and beyond.

As a result, the modified zinc (Zn) cells present high Zn plating/stripping coulombic efficiencies of 97.71&#8201;% ~99.81&#8201;% from 5 to 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and remarkably service lifespan up to 8,200&#8197;h (more than 11&#8197;months). Additionally, the Zn//MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 70.1&#8201;% after 3,000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This dynamic protective strategy to challenge aqueous Zn chemistry may open up a new avenue for building better AZBs and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diplatinum Single&#8208;Molecular Photocatalyst Capable of Driving Hydrogen Production from Water via Singlet&#8208;to&#8208;Triplet Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new diplatinum(II) complex Pt2(bpia)Cl3 (bpia=bis(2&#8208;pyridylimidoyl)amido) is proven to serve as a single&#8208;molecular photocatalyst enabling the H2 production from water in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor by irradiating the visible light above 500&#8197;nm. This work for the first time demonstrates that the direct singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet (S&#8208;T) transitions can be used to drive photocatalytic H2 production.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is regarded as one of the most ideal methods to achieve a sustainable society. In order to artificially establish efficient photosynthetic systems, efforts have been made to develop single&#8208;molecular photocatalysts capable of serving both as a photosensitizer (PS) and a catalyst (Cat) in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Although examples of such hybrid molecular photocatalysts have been demonstrated in the literature, their solar energy conversion efficiencies still remain quite limited. Here we demonstrate that a new dinuclear platinum(II) complex Pt2(bpia)Cl3 (bpia=bis(2&#8208;pyridylimidoyl)amido) serves as a single&#8208;molecular photocatalyst for HER with its performance significantly higher than that of the PtCl(tpy)&#8208; and PtCl2(bpy)&#8208;type photocatalysts developed in our group (tpy=2,2':6&#8242;,2''&#8208;terpyridine, bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine). The outstanding feature is that Pt2(bpia)Cl3 can produce H2 even by irradiating the lower&#8208;energy light above 500&#8197;nm, which is rationalized due to the direct population of triplet states via singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet transitions (i.e., S&#8208;T transitions) accelerated by the diplatinum core. To the best of our knowledge, Pt2(bpia)Cl3 is the first example of a single&#8208;molecular photocatalyst enabling hydrogen production from water via the S&#8208;T transitions using lower&#8208;energy light (&gt;580&#8197;nm).

         <title>Bias&#8208;Induced Ga&#8722;O&#8208;Ir Interface Breaks the Limits of Adsorption&#8208;Energy Scaling Relationships for High&#8208;Performing Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active Ir catalyst supported on Ga2O3 was developed through bias&#8208;induced Ga leaching, promoting dynamic migration of oxygen species. Ga&#8722;O&#8722;Ir interfaces enhance water dissociation and OH* migration, improving catalytic activity. The catalyst showed a low overpotential (197&#8197;mV), and impressive performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) with a cell voltage of 1.63&#8197;V at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 1000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Rationally manipulating the in situ formed catalytically active surface of catalysts remains a significant challenge for achieving highly efficient water electrolysis. Herein, we present a bias&#8208;induced activation strategy to modulate in situ Ga leaching and trigger the dynamic surface restructuring of lamellar Ir@Ga2O3 for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. The in situ reconstructed Ga&#8722;O&#8722;Ir interface sustains high water oxidation rates at oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials. We found that OER at the Ga&#8722;O&#8722;Ir interface follows a bi&#8208;nuclear adsorbate evolution mechanism with unsaturated IrOx as the active sites, while GaOx atoms play an indirect role in promoting water dissociation to form OH* and transferring OH* to Ir sites. This breaks the scaling relationship of the adsorption energies between OH* and OOH*, significantly lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step and greatly increasing reactivity. The Ir@Ga2O3 catalyst achieves lower overpotentials, a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.76&#8197;V, and stable operation up to 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in scalable proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) at 1.63&#8197;V, maintaining stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 1000&#8197;hours with a degradation rate of 11.5&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work prompted us to jointly address substrate&#8211;catalyst interactions and catalyst reconstruction, an underexplored path, to improve activity and stability in Ir PEMWE anodes.

         <title>Dry&#8208;Solid&#8208;Electrochemical Synthesis: A General Method for Large Scale Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with High Metal loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal Dry&#8208;solid&#8208;electrochemical synthesis (DSES) method was proposed to fabricate single atom catalysts with high metal loadings. A unique redox mechanism for DSES process is proposed: metal precursors on conductive supports are reduced to individual metal atoms via a homolytic cleavage of metal precursors by the attacking of electrons flowing through the dry solid phase.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal loadings are highly desirable but still challenging for large scale synthesis. Here we report a new technique named as dry&#8208;solid&#8208;electrochemical synthesis (DSES) for a general large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs with high metal loadings in an energy&#8208;conservation and environment&#8208;friendly way. With it, a series of pure carbon&#8208;supported metal SACs (Platinum up to 35.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%, Iridium 21.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%, Ruthenium 20.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% and Iron 17.6&#8197;wt&#8201;%) with high metal loadings were obtained. Particularly, a Pt SAC with Pt 23.9&#8197;wt&#8201;% and remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in fuel cells is synthesized on kilogram scale. Based on multiple control experiments, a unique redox mechanism for DSES process is proposed: metal precursors on conductive supports are reduced to metals via a homolytic cleavage of metal&#8208;halogen bonds by the attacking of electrons flowing through the dry solid phase. Such versatile technique paves a new economical and environment&#8208;friendly pathway for fabricating high&#8208;metal&#8208;loading SACs or atomic dispersion catalysts.

         <title>Non&#8208;Monotonic Variation of Potential&#8208;Dependent Surface Diffusion at Electrochemical Interfaces in the Presence of Coadsorbates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using fast scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements and complementary simulations, the diffusion of adsorbates at electrochemical interfaces is shown to depend in complex and unexpected ways on potential and coadsorbates. For the case of sulfur diffusion on halide&#8208;covered Ag(100) electrodes, first a pronounced increase in sulfur mobility with increasing halide surface density is found, followed by a strong decrease at halide saturation coverage.







Abstract
The influence of coadsorbed ions on adsorbate diffusion, an inherent effect at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces, was studied for adsorbed sulfur on Ag(100) electrodes in the presence of bromide or iodide. Quantitative in situ high&#8208;speed scanning tunnelling microscopy (video&#8208;STM) measurements were performed both in the potential regime of the c(2&#215;2) halide adlayer at its saturation coverage and in the regime of a disordered adlayer where the halide coverage increases with potential. These studies reveal a surprising non&#8208;monotonic potential dependence of Sad diffusion with an initial increase with halide coverage, followed by a decrease upon halide adlayer ordering into the c(2&#215;2) structure. Density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations only qualitatively reproduce the rise in Sad mobility with halide coverage, suggesting that many&#8208;adsorbate interactions and the presence of the electrolyte need to be considered.

     alt="Non-Monotonic Variation of Potential-Dependent Surface Diffusion at Electrochemical Interfaces in the Presence of Coadsorbates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using fast scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements and complementary simulations, the diffusion of adsorbates at electrochemical interfaces is shown to depend in complex and unexpected ways on potential and coadsorbates. For the case of sulfur diffusion on halide-covered Ag(100) electrodes, first a pronounced increase in sulfur mobility with increasing halide surface density is found, followed by a strong decrease at halide saturation coverage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influence of coadsorbed ions on adsorbate diffusion, an inherent effect at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces, was studied for adsorbed sulfur on Ag(100) electrodes in the presence of bromide or iodide. Quantitative in situ high-speed scanning tunnelling microscopy (video-STM) measurements were performed both in the potential regime of the c(2&#215;2) halide adlayer at its saturation coverage and in the regime of a disordered adlayer where the halide coverage increases with potential. These studies reveal a surprising non-monotonic potential dependence of S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; diffusion with an initial increase with halide coverage, followed by a decrease upon halide adlayer ordering into the c(2&#215;2) structure. Density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations only qualitatively reproduce the rise in S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; mobility with halide coverage, suggesting that many-adsorbate interactions and the presence of the electrolyte need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Operando Nanoscale Characterization Reveals Fe Doping of Ni Oxide Enhances Oxygen Evolution Reaction via Fragmentation and Formation of Dual Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando nanoscale characterization of Ni oxide catalysts (NiOx) reveals that Fe doping enhances oxygen evolution activity by increasing the active surface area via island fragmentation and forming dual active centers of Ni and Fe atoms. Combining atomically precise growth under ultra&#8208;high vacuum and exfoliation of 2D materials for electrocatalytic studies, we uncover both the hydroxylation step and the dynamic nature of active sites under OER conditions.







Abstract
Efficient catalytic water splitting demands advanced catalysts to improve the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal oxides show promising OER activity in alkaline media. However, most experimental information available is either from post&#8208;mortem studies or in&#8197;situ space&#8208;averaged X&#8208;ray techniques in the micrometer range. Therefore, the composition of the active centers under operando conditions is still under debate. In this work, we combine nanoscopic and spectroscopic measurements on the hydroxylation of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)&#8208;prepared Ni and NiFe oxides nanoislands with operando local investigations of Ni and NiFe hydroxide electrocatalysts under OER conditions to reveal the nature of the active centers in 2D OER catalysts. Our results reveal that Fe doping increases the active surface area by island fragmentation, and boosts the intrinsic activity by creating optimized active centers consisting of both Ni and Fe atoms. In addition, our findings show that operando characterization at the nanoscale is crucial to reveal the dynamic nature of the interface of 2D catalysts under reaction conditions.

         <title>Non&#8208;Substituted Aromatic Pyridine N&#8208;Oxide Additives with an Intrinsic N&#8594;O Acceptor for Ultra&#8208;Long&#8208;Life Zn||MnO2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;substituted aromatic pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PNO) containing an N&#8594;O acceptor is reported as a highly effective additive to the ZS electrolyte in ZIBs. This additive is distinct from previously reported organic molecules or salts. The N&#8594;O group acts as an un&#8208;ionized, appropriately polarized ligand&#8208;bonded acceptor, significantly enhancing the cyclic lifetime of ZIBs.







Abstract
Various organic and inorganic reagents containing N/O functional groups have been developed as additives to aqueous electrolytes (e.g., ZnSO4, ZS) of zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). However, finding an additive that can significantly enhance the durability of Zn anodes by inhibiting Zn dendrites and side reactions remains a considerable challenge. Herein, pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PNO), a non&#8208;substituted aromatic compound with a nitrogen positive charge&#8208;induced N&#8594;O bond, is explored as ZS additives for highly durable Zn plating/stripping electrolytes (i.e., PNO/ZS). The optimized PNO0.03/ZS mixture demonstrates exceptional stability for Zn anodes, achieving a cycle life exceeding 4200&#8197;h and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It maintains over 1000&#8197;h of life and a cumulative capacity of 2.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even when subjected to plating/stripping conditions intensified by a factor of 5. Importantly, it enables Zn||&#945;&#8208;MnO2 cells to sustain high&#8208;current charge/discharge cycles for over 5000 cycles, retaining 80&#8201;% (125&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) of the initial capacity, which is the best performance reported for similar additive systems. This exceptional stability is ascribed to the highly reversible Zn anode plating/stripping, facilitated by the suitable coordination interactions between the N&#8594;O acceptor of PNO and the Zn2+/H2O donor, effectively inhibiting side reactions.

Abstract
Charged channels are considered an effective design for achieving efficient monovalent cation transport; however, it remains challenging to establish a direct relationship between charge microenvironments and ionic conductivity within the pores. Herein, we report a series of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with identical skeletons but different charge microenvironments and explore their intra&#8208;pore charge&#8208;driven ion transport performance and mechanism differences. We found that the charged nature determines ion&#8208;pair action sites, modes, host&#8208;guest interaction, thereby influencing the dissociation efficiency of ion pairs, the hopping ability of cations, and the effective carrier concentration. The order of transport efficiency for Li+, Na+, and H+ follows anion &gt; zwitterion &gt; cation &gt; neutrality. Ionic COFs exhibit up to 11&#8208;fold higher ionic conductivity than neutral COFs. Notably, the ionic conductivity of anionic COF achieves 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for Li+ at 30&#8201;&#176;C and 3.8 &#215; 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for H+ at 160&#8201;&#176;C, surpassing most COF&#8208;based ionic conductors. This COF platform for efficient ion migration and stable battery cycling in lithium&#8208;metal quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries has also been verified as proof of concept. This work offers new insights into the development and structure&#8208;activity relationship studies of the next generation of solid&#8208;state ionic conductors.

An amorphous Co2P@MoOx heterostructure is rationally developed as excellent bifunctional catalysts for the coupling NO2RR||GOR overall reaction, realizing excellent activity and stability towards the co&#8208;electrosynthesis of NH3 and formate products by membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer at industrial&#8208;level current density.







Abstract
Paired electrosynthetic technology is of significance to realize the co&#8208;production of high&#8208;added value chemicals. However, exploiting efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst of the concurrent electrocatalysis to achieve the industrial&#8208;level performance is still challenging. Herein, an amorphous Co2P@MoOx heterostructure is rationally designed by in situ electrodeposition strategy, which is acted as excellent bifunctional catalysts for the electrocatalytic nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) and glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). The membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer realizes a low voltage of 1.30&#8197;V, robust stability over 200&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high Faraday efficiencies and yield of NH3 (above 95&#8201;%, 49.7&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and formate (above 95&#8201;%, 304.4&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at industrial&#8208;level current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy studies have shown that high&#8208;valence CoOOH is the main active material of GOR, and the main catalytic conversion pathway of NO2RR involves key *NH2OH reaction intermediates. In addition, theoretical calculations confirm that the Co2P@MoOx heterostructure has strong interfacial electronic interaction and optimized reaction energy barriers, which endows its intrinsically high electrocatalytic activity for the co&#8208;electrosynthesis of NH3 and formate.

         <title>CO Cryo&#8208;Sorption as a Surface&#8208;Sensitive Spectroscopic Probe of the Active Site Density of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
The first identification of the spectroscopic fingerprint and quantification for CO probe molecules adsorbed to Fe&#8208;N4 sites by a corroborated investigation of in situ surface X&#8208;ray spectroscopic techniques (NAP&#8208;XPS and &#8208;NEXAFS) and ab initio DFT calculations. The DFT calculations suggest explanations for the low&#8208;temperature CO adsorption.







Abstract
Quantifying the number of active sites is a crucial aspect in the performance evaluation of single metal&#8208;atom electrocatalysts. A possible realization is using adsorbing gas molecules that selectively bind to the single&#8208;atom transition metal and then probing their surface density using spectroscopic tools. Herein, using in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, we detect adsorbed CO gas molecules on a FeNC oxygen reduction single atom catalyst. Correlating XPS and NEXAFS, we develop a simple surface&#8208; and chemically&#8208;sensitive protocol to accurately and quickly quantify the active site density. Density functional theory&#8208;based X&#8208;ray spectra simulations reaffirm the assignment of the spectroscopic fingerprints of the CO molecules adsorbed at Fe&#8208;N4&#8208;C sites, and provide additional unexpected structural insights about the active site needed to explain the low&#8208;temperature CO adsorption. Our work represents an important step towards an accurate quantitative catalytic performance evaluation, and thus towards developing reliable material design principles and catalysts.

         <title>Efficient Hole Extraction and *OH Alleviation by Pd Nanoparticles on GaN Nanowires in Seawater for Solar&#8208;Driven H2 and H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd NPs/GaN NWs enable photocatalytic seawater splitting into H2 and H2O2 under sunlight. Chloride ions enhance charge dynamics and reduce energy barriers, achieving high H2 production (2.5&#8197;mmol&#8901;cm&#8722;2&#8901;h&#8722;1) and H2O2 yield (300&#8197;&#956;mol/L). The system exhibits remarkable stability and efficiency, demonstrating its potential for sustainable solar energy conversion and chemical production.







Abstract
Photocatalytic seawater splitting into hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide (2H2O&#8594;H2&#8593; + H2O2) offers an ultimate solution for simultaneously generating green fuel and value&#8208;added chemicals by the two most earth&#8208;abundant resources i.e., solar energy and natural seawater. In this study, Pd nanoparticles are integrated with one&#8208;dimensional gallium nitride nanowires (Pd NPs/GaN NWs) on a silicon wafer to produce H2 and H2O2 from seawater powered by sunlight. In situ spectroscopic characterizations combined with computational investigations reveal that in this nanohybrid, Pd NPs function as an efficient hole extractor and *OH alleviator during photocatalysis. Meanwhile, the chloride ions in seawater facilitate the H2O&#8594; H2 + H2O2 conversion by improving the charge dynamics and lowering the energy barrier of the key *OH self&#8208;coupling step over Pd sites in the catalytic system. As a result, the photocatalyst delivers an appreciable hydrogen production rate of 2.5&#8197;mmol&#8901;cm&#8722;2&#8901;h&#8722;1 with a light&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (LTH) efficiency of 4.38&#8201;% in natural seawater under concentrated light irradiation of 3&#8197;W&#8901;cm&#8722;2 without sacrificial agents and external energies. Notably, the water oxidation reaction produces 300&#8197;&#956;mol/L of valuable H2O2 over a duration of 2&#8197;hours under a light intensity of 3&#8197;W/cm2 using a 20&#8197;mL water sample, achieving a light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical efficiency of 0.53&#8201;%. The photocatalyst shows excellent stability for up to 60&#8197;hours with a considerable turnover number of 1.42&#215;107 moles H2 per mole of Pd. The outdoor test further suggests the great potential for solar&#8208;driven seawater splitting into green fuels and chemicals.

         <title>Rendering Proteins Fluorescent Inconspicuously: Genetically Encoded 4&#8208;Cyanotryptophan Conserves Their Structure and Enables the Detection of Ligand Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hiding in plain sight: 4&#8208;Cyanotryptophan (4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp) renders proteins visibly fluorescent. Replacing a Trp residue with 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp inside a protein confers fluorescence without changing the surface structure; this can be used for microscopy, to measure ligand binding with subnanomolar sensitivity, and to detect proximity to the ligand. Systems are provided for genetic encoding of CN&#8208;Trp isomers, including 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp, in high yield.







Abstract
Cyanotryptophans (CN&#8208;Trp) are privileged multimodal reporters on protein structure. They are similar in size to the canonical amino acid tryptophan and some of them exhibit bright fluorescence which responds sensitively to changes in the environment. We selected aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases specific for 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp for high&#8208;yield in vivo production of proteins with a single, site&#8208;specifically introduced nitrile label. The absorption maximum of 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp is distinct from Trp, allowing the selective excitation of its intense fluorescence. 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp fluoresces in the visible range with an intensity rivalling that of 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;coumarin. Crystal structures of maltose binding protein demonstrate near&#8208;complete structural conservation when a native buried Trp residue is replaced by 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp. Besides presenting an inconspicuous tag for live cell microscopy, the intense fluorescence of 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp enables measurements of subnanomolar ligand binding affinities in isotropic solution, as demonstrated by the complex between rapamycin and the peptidyl&#8211;prolyl isomerase FKBP12 furnished with a 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp residue in the substrate binding pocket. Furthermore, 4&#8208;CN&#8208;Trp residues positioned at different locations of a protein containing multiple tryptophan residues permits using fluorescence quenching experiments to detect the proximity of individual Trp residues to the binding site of aromatic ligands.

         <title>A Conductive Cu&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Ribbon with High&#8208;Density Redox&#8208;Active Centers as Cathode for Stable High&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A conductive Cu&#8208;MOF featuring a coordination ribbon with high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active centers is constructed using DDA (1, 5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;4, 8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9, 10&#8208;anthraceneedione) and double redox&#8208;active centers (Cu&#8208;O3N) via &#960;&#8208;d conjugation. As LIBs cathode, the resultant Cu&#8208;MOF could deliver a combination of high capacity (353&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), impressive high&#8208;rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability.







Abstract
Conductive Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MOF) materials hold significant potential as cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their flexible structural design, high electronic conductivity, and independence from costly resources. However, their practical application is often limited by their capacity and cyclability. In this study, we report a one&#8208;dimensional Cu&#8208;MOF (DDA&#8722;Cu, DDA=1, 5&#8208;Diamino&#8208;4, 8&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9, 10&#8208;anthraceneedione) featuring extended &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination ribbon and high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active centers, making it a stable, high&#8208;capacity cathode for LIBs. The &#960;&#8208;d conjugated Cu&#8722;O3N motifs embedded within the ribbon not only serve as redox&#8208;active centers for enhanced lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity but also contribute to structural robustness, enabling resistance against electrode solubility in organic electrolytes, thus ensuring superior cyclability. Furthermore, these &#960;&#8208;d conjugated Cu&#8722;O3N units promote efficient charge transfer, leading to high electronic conductivity at room temperature. These advantageous properties allow the Cu&#8208;MOF cathode to deliver a remarkable capacity (353&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and exceptional cyclability, achieving capacity retention of 78&#8201;% after 1000 cycles, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MOF electrodes. Additionally, this DDA&#8722;Cu demonstrates considerable wettability with the electrolyte, achieving outstanding performance even when tested in a lean electrolyte environment (2&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1) with a high mass loading of the MOF (6.8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Controlled Introduction of sp3 Quantum Defects in Fluorescent Carbon Nanotubes by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the photophysics of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) holds immense potential for their applications in sensing and imaging. By using mechanochemistry, sp3 quantum defects are introduced in fluorescent SWCNTs via a solid&#8208;state reaction within 5&#8197;min. This method allows by varying the mechanochemical energy impact to create quantum defects at extremely low defect densities and chemical control without diminishing fluorescence.







Abstract
Precise control over low&#8208;dimensional materials holds an immense potential for their applications in sensing, imaging and information processing. The controlled introduction of sp3 quantum defects (color centers) can be used to tailor the optoelectronic properties of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the tissue transparency (&gt;800&#8197;nm) and the telecommunication window. However, an uncontrolled functionalization of SWCNTs with defects leads to a loss of the NIR fluorescence. Here, we use mechanochemistry with aryldiazonium salts to create quantum defects in SWCNTs. The reaction proceeds within 5&#8197;min without solvents or illumination and can be controlled by a varied mechanochemical energy impact. By working in the solid&#8208;state, this method presents an alternative synthetic route and marks a crucial step for tailoring photophysics of SWCNTs.

Site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of oxime ethers by controlling the orientation of a directing group using electron&#8208;deficient Cp*CF3Ir(III) and a photosensitizer is reported. Switchable and successive C(sp3)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H double functionalization was accomplished by manipulating the order of C&#8722;H activation to construct densely functionalized structures.







Abstract
A site&#8208;selective functionalization of a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond was achieved in the presence of an intrinsically more reactive C(sp2)&#8722;H bond by controlling the orientation of a directing group via a photo&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization of an oxime ether. By combining E/Z isomerization and an electron deficient Cp*CF3Ir(III) catalyst, the scope of oxime ethers in C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization was successfully expanded. Based on this strategy, the order of C&#8722;H activation was switchable and successive C(sp3)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H double functionalizations were accomplished to construct densely functionalized structures.

         <title>Electron Delocalized Ni Active Sites in Spinel Catalysts Enable Efficient Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulating the electron delocalization of Ni active sites can significantly alter the attack sites of OH&#8722; ions, modulate the dissociation pattern of urea molecules, effectively optimizing the product selectivity and enhancing the reaction efficiency in urea oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has attracted much attention as an efficient alternative reaction to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its low required overpotential. Despite significant progress in efficient nickel&#8208;based catalysts, the fundamental issues regarding product selectivity control and dissociation mechanism during the UOR process have not been clarified. Here, we report that tuning the electron delocalization strength of Ni sites significantly affects the OH&#8722; binding sites, altering urea molecule dissociation patterns in alkaline systems. Using spinel NiCo2O4 as a model catalyst, the charge delocalization strength of nickel active centers is influenced by the degree of phosphorus&#8208;substituted anions. Specifically, complete phosphorus&#8208;substituted spinel enhances N2 selectivity up to 26.8&#8201;% with a peak current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, while partial phosphorus&#8208;substituted spinel achieves a Faraday efficiency of 78.1&#8201;% for liquid products (NOx&#8722;). Experiments and theory reveal that strong charge delocalization at Ni sites favors remote&#8208;site attack on urea molecules by hydroxide ions, whereas weak delocalization prefers nearby&#8208;site attack, enhancing UOR efficiency and suppressing OER in both pathways.

         <title>Thermal Modulation of Exciton Recombination for High&#8208;Temperature Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient high&#8208;temperature afterglow (HTA) in a metal&#8208;free doping system was developed by leveraging a meticulously crafted synergy of thermally electron releasing, Dexter energy transfer, and electron&#8208;hole recombination, which marks the first instance of a tunable afterglow combining a bright blue HTA with lifetime of 1.04&#8197;s even at 150&#8201;&#176;C and a rigidity&#8208;induced yellow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
Developing smart materials with tunable high&#8208;temperature afterglow (HTA) luminescence remains a formidable challenge. This study presents a metal&#8208;free doping system using boric acid as matrix and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as dopants. This composition achieves dynamically tunable afterglow combining a bright blue HTA lasting for over ten seconds even at 150&#8201;&#176;C and an ultra&#8208;long yellow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence below 110&#8201;&#176;C. The observed HTA is attributed to the thermally released exciton recombination within the dopant molecules, which shows excellent temperature tolerance compared to traditional triplet related phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The planarity of dopants is extensively investigated playing a pivotal role in modulating Dexter electron transfer (ET) for capturing released electrons and thereby affecting the overall performance of tunable HTA. This work provides an efficient and universal doping strategy to engineer tunable HTA through the synergistic action of thermally releasing electrons, Dexter ET and exciton recombination.

         <title>Programmed Charge Transfer in Conjugated Polymers with Pendant Benzothiadiazole Acceptor for Simultaneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production and Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;donor backbone incorporating with pendant benzothiadiazole acceptor are elaborately designed to create directional charge&#8208;transfer channels in linear conjugated polymers (LCPs). This design efficiently directs electrons towards reduction centers, facilitating reactive oxygen species generation, while simultaneously guiding holes towards oxidation centers, thus significantly boosting photocatalytic H2O2 production and organic synthesis.







Abstract
While being important candidate for heterogeneous photocatalyst, conjugated polymer typically exhibits random charge transfers between the alternating donor and acceptor units, which severely limits its catalytic efficiency. Herein, inspired by natural photosystem, the concept of guiding the charge migration to specific reaction sites is employed to significantly boost photocatalytic performance of linear conjugated polymers (LCPs) with pendant functional groups via creating programmed charge&#8208;transfer channels from the backbone to its pendant moiety. The pendant benzothiadiazole, as revealed in both in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, can act as electron &#8220;reservoir&#8221; that aggregates electrons at the active sites. Moreover, the presence of charge&#8208;transfer channels, evidenced by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), accelerates the electron transfer, preventing the recombination of electrons and holes. As a result, in this elaborately&#8208;designed architecture, the photogenerated electron can move smoothly towards the reduction sites, facilitating the reduction of O2 into H2O2, while remaining holes are directed to oxidation centers, simultaneously oxidizing furfuryl alcohol to furoic acid. The optimized photocatalyst LCP&#8208;BT demonstrates a competitive catalytic performance with H2O2 productivity of 868.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (9.8&#8197;times higher than conventional random charge&#8208;transfer polymer LCP&#8208;1) and furfuryl alcohol conversion over 95&#8201;% after 6&#8197;h.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Tri&#8208;Axis Naphthalenes via Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction and Dehydrative Aromatization of Isobenzofurans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of naphthalenes with 1,3,4&#8208;triaxes were successfully synthesized with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities via sequential Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and TfOH&#8208;promoted dehydrative aromatization, using modular 1,3&#8208;biaryl&#8208;isobenzofurans and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles as reaction partners. Based on these novel tri&#8208;axis structural skeletons, a CPL&#8208;active dye with high values of |glum| (0.019) and &#216;FL (0.29) was obtained, demonstrating the great potential of triaxially chiral ring scaffolds in the design of chiroptical organic materials.







Abstract
Atropisomers with multiple stereogenic axes have attracted much attention due to their increasing significance in the fields of natural products, chiral materials, and drug discoveries. However, the catalytic stereoselective construction of axially chiral ring scaffolds with more than two axes on a single benzene ring remains a challenging task. Herein, we present an efficient method for synthesizing triaxially chiral polysubstituted naphthalene scaffolds via sequential Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of isobenzofurans and TfOH&#8208;promoted dehydrative aromatization reaction. Using 1,3&#8208;biarylisobenzofurans and &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles as modular reaction partners, a series of naphthalenes with 1,3,4&#8208;triaxes were synthesized with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, by attaching two pyrene chromophores to this novel triaxially chiral ring scaffold, a circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active dye exhibiting a remarkable luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum=&#8722;0.019) and high fluorescence quantum efficiency (&#216;FL=0.29) was obtained, highlighting the potential applications of atropisomers with multiple stereogenic axes in the design of chiroptical organic materials.

         <title>Investigating Interaction Dynamics of an Enantioselective Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Acylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation of a highly selective peptide&#8208;catalysed acetylation reaction using computations and NMR techniques sensitive to dynamics on the &#956;s to s timescale is presented. 13C&#8208;Relaxation dispersion measurements and 1H&#8208;CEST reveal differences in dynamics, providing insight into the molecular recognition of enantiomeric substrates by the peptide catalyst.







Abstract
Modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods like carbon relaxation dispersion in the rotating frame (13C&#8722;R1&#961;) and proton chemical exchange saturation transfer (1H&#8208;CEST) are key methods to investigate molecular recognition in biomacromolecules and to detect molecular motions on the &#956;s to s timescale, revealing transient conformational states. Changes in kinetics can be linked to binding, folding, or catalytic events. Here, we investigated whether these methods allow detection of changes in the dynamics of a small, highly selective peptide catalyst during recognition of its enantiomeric substrates. The flexible tetrapeptide Boc&#8208;l&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;Me)&#8722;His&#8722;AGly&#8208;l&#8722;Cha&#8722;l&#8208;Phe&#8722;OMe, used for the monoacetylation of cycloalkane&#8208;diols, is probed at natural abundance using 13C&#8208;R1&#961; and 1H&#8208;CEST. Indeed, we detected differences in dynamics of the peptide upon interaction with the diol. Importantly, these differ depending on the enantiomer of the substrate used. These enantiospecific influences of the substrates on the dynamics of the peptide are rationalized using computational techniques. We find that even though one enantiomer reacts faster, as confirmed by reaction monitoring, the other is more tightly bound in DCM (as confirmed by 1H&#8208;saturation transfer difference (STD) measurements). These findings provide insights into the recognition of the substrates and explain the selectivity differences observed between the solvents toluene and DCM.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Cross&#8208;Linked Polymers for Enhanced Thermal Cycling Stability in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preventing crack and delamination during thermal cycling is crucial for mechanical reliability of flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs). An innovative approach, using an in&#8208;situ polymerization molecule with extended functional end groups simultaneously cross&#8208;links neighboring grains and coordinate with SnO2, allowing the device to withstand temperature fluctuations. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency and thermal&#8208;mechanical stability of FPSCs, critical for commercialization of FPSCs.







Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) are a promising emerging photovoltaic technology, with certified power conversion efficiencies reaching 24.9&#8201;%. However, the frequent occurrence of grain fractures and interface delamination raises concerns about their ability to endure the mechanical stresses caused by temperature fluctuations. In this study, we employ an in situ polymerization molecule with extended functional end groups to preserve mechanical integrity during thermal cycling. The AMPS&#8208;DEA molecule chemically anchors to grain boundaries and cross&#8208;links neighboring grains, protecting the structure from stress accumulation. Additionally, its hydroxyl groups form bidentate chelation with SnO2, enhancing interfacial adhesion and preventing delamination. More importantly, the relaxed residual stress provided by AMPS&#8208;DEA allows the perovskite layer to adapt to temperature changes, effectively matching adjacent layers and preventing mechanical failure. Our findings demonstrate that AMPS&#8208;DEA modification not only boosts PCE to 25.78&#8201;% in rigid PSCs and 24.54&#8201;% in flexible PSCs but also improves stability, maintaining over 95&#8201;% efficiency after 10,000 bending cycles and 200 thermal cycles.

         <title>Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes by Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free In Situ Generation of Benzylic Nucleophiles Using Tetramethyldisiloxane and Potassium tert&#8208;Butoxide</title>

         <dc:description>
The combination of Lewis bases and hydrosilanes has recently emerged as a mechanistically diverse manifold to facilitate various defunctionalizations, silylations, and intramolecular rearrangements. This article presents the first example applying this remarkable reagent combination towards intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation. A transition metal&#8208;free hydroalkylation reaction is described, alongside mechanistic experiments that support a plausible pathway wherein the silane acts as both an H atom and electron donor, enabling the synthesis of highly reactive carbanions via reductive radical polar crossover.







Abstract
Hydrosilanes and Lewis bases are known to promote various reductive defunctionalizations, rearrangements, and silylation reactions, facilitated by enigmatic silicon/Lewis base&#8208;derived reactive intermediates. Despite the wide variety of transformations enabled by this reagent combination, no examples of intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) forming reactions have been reported. In this work, we've identified 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDSO) and KOtBu as a unique reagent combination capable of generating benzylic nucleophiles in&#8197;situ from styrene derivatives, which can subsequently react with alkyl halides to give a new C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) linkage via formal hydroalkylation. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds through a key hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step from a hydrosilane reducing agent to styrene, affording a benzylic radical that undergoes reductive radical polar crossover (RRPC) and subsequent SN2 alkylation.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy Engineering on Sustainable Anionic Redox Mn&#8208;Based Cathode with Retardant Stress for High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found the high&#8208;entropy construction in the Mn&#8208;based layered oxide could provide high reversible capacity, cycle life and fast Na+ kinetic behaviors through the strong and sustainable oxygen anion redox. And the lattice framework could be greatly strengthened and the stress concentration could also be alleviated. The demonstration of this concept shed lights onto the development of long&#8208;lasting and high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based (Mn&#8208;based) layered oxides have emerged as competitive cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), primarily due to their high energy density, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and potential for mass production. However, these materials often suffer from irreversible oxygen redox reactions, significant phase transitions, and microcrack formation, which lead to considerable internal stress and degradation of electrochemical performance. This study introduces a high&#8208;entropy engineering strategy for P2&#8208;type Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes (HE&#8208;NMCO), wherein a multi&#8208;ingredient cocktail effect strengthens the lattice framework by modulating the local environmental chemistry. This innovative approach fosters sustainable reversible oxygen activity, mitigates stress concentrations at grain boundaries, and accelerates Na+ transport kinetics. The resulting robust lattice framework with optimized elemental interactions significantly improves structural integrity and reduces the formation of intragranular fractures. Consequently, HE&#8208;NMCO demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, retaining 93.5&#8201;% capacity after 100 deep (de)sodiation cycles, alongside an enhanced rate capability of 134.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C. Notably, comparative studies through multimodal characterization techniques highlight HE&#8208;NMCO&#8242;s superior reversibility in oxygen anion redox (OAR) reactions over extensive cycling, contrasting sharply with conventional NMCO cathode. This work elucidates the potential for advancing high energy and power density Mn&#8208;based cathodes for SIBs through local species diversity.

         <title>A Robust Dual&#8208;Layered Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enabled by Cation Specific Adsorption&#8208;Induced Built&#8208;In Electrostatic Field for Long&#8208;Cycling Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase is constructed through a cation specific adsorption&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electrostatic field. This dual&#8208;layered SEI consists of a mechanically flexible organic&#8208;rich surface layer and a rigid, conductive inorganic&#8208;rich bottom layer, which together effectively accommodate stress and strain while inhibiting Li dendrite formation during repeated Li plating and stripping.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (SSLMBs) are considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation battery technologies due to their high energy density and intrinsic safety. However, interfacial issues such as side reactions and Li dendrite growth severely hinder the practical application of SSLMBs. In this contribution, we proposed a cationic built&#8208;in electrostatic field to drive the generation of an anion&#8208;derived dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The specific adsorption of tributylmethyl&#8208;phosphonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TMPB) cations onto negatively charged Li anode surface significantly prevents interfacial side reactions between vulnerable polyethylene oxide (PEO) and Li metal. More importantly, the formed cationic built&#8208;in electrostatic field induces the targeted trapping of Li&#8208;salt anions onto the Li metal surface, leading to the generation of an anion&#8208;derived dual&#8208;layered SEI, composed of a mechanically flexible organic&#8208;rich surface layer and a Li&#8208;ion conductive inorganic&#8208;rich bottom layer. As a result, the Li||Li cell demonstrated an extended lifespan of over 1900&#8197;hours with the reduced polarization voltage. The Li||LiFePO4 full cell also exhibited excellent cycling stability, maintaining an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% over 200 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. This work provides valuable insights into mitigating interfacial degradation and promoting uniform Li deposition through surface electrostatic field regulation.

         <title>An Efficient Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Yellow Emitter Based on a Double&#8208;Boron&#8208;Embedded Tetraazacyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of two boron atoms within a tetraazacyclophane architecture by a multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence design has led to a highly efficient ultra&#8208;narrowband yellow emitter, HBN, with a maximum at 572&#8197;nm and an impressively narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 17&#8197;nm. Incorporation of HBN into an organic light&#8208;emitting diode led a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;narrowband and highly modifiable multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are crucial for realizing high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut display applications. Despite progress, most MR&#8208;TADF emitters remain confined to blue and green wavelengths, with difficulties extending into longer wavelengths without significant spectral broadening, which compromises color purity in full&#8208;color organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. In this work, we present a novel tetraazacyclophane&#8208;based architecture embedding dual boron atoms to remarkedly enhance intramolecular charge transfer through the strategic positioning of boron and nitrogen atoms. This arrangement induces a substantial redshift while maintaining structural rigidity and molecular orbital symmetry, with a hole&#8208;electron central distance of 0&#8197;&#197;, allowing for ultra&#8208;narrowband emission. The resulting MR&#8208;TADF material, HBN, delivers yellow emission peaking at 572&#8197;nm (2.168&#8197;eV) with an impressively narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 17&#8197;nm (0.064&#8197;eV) in dilute toluene. Moreover, the corresponding phosphorescent&#8208;sensitized fluorescence OLED achieves yellow emission maximum at 581&#8197;nm, with a narrow FWHM of 25&#8197;nm, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.1&#8201;%, and a luminance exceeding 40,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. These outstanding photoluminescent and electroluminescent performances validate the superiority of our molecular design strategy, highlighting its significant potential for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A Bifunctional Imidazolyl Iodide Mediator of Electrolyte Boosts Cathode Kinetics and Anode Stability Towards Low Overpotential and Long&#8208;Life Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>

A novel bifunctional soluble catalyst of 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazole iodide (DMII) is proposed for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The anion I&#8722; enhances the cathode redox kinetics while the cation DMI+ promotes the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and reduces the shuttle effect, thus realizing narrow overpotential and long&#8208;life Li&#8208;O2 battery.







Abstract
The addition of a redox mediator as soluble catalyst into electrolyte can effectively overcome the bottlenecks of poor energy efficiency and limited cyclability for Li&#8208;O2 batteries caused by passivation of insulating discharge products and unfavorable byproducts. Herein we report a novel soluble catalyst of bifunctional imidazolyl iodide salt additive, 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), to successfully construct highly efficient and durable Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The anion I&#8722; can effectively promote the charge transport of Li2O2 and accelerate the redox kinetics of oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions on the cathode side, thereby significantly decreasing the charge/discharge overpotential. Simultaneously, the cation DMI+ forms an ultrathin stably solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase film on Li metal, greatly inhibiting the shuttle effect of I&#8722; and improving the stability of anode. Using this DMII additive, our Li&#8208;O2 batteries achieve an extremely low voltage of 0.52&#8197;V and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability over 960&#8197;h. Notably, up to 95.8&#8201;% of the Li2O2 yield further proves the reversible generation/decomposition of Li2O2 without the occurrence of side reactions. Both experimental and theoretical results disclose that DMII enables Li+ easily solvated, testifying the dominance of the solution&#8208;induced reaction mechanism. This work provides the possibility to design the soluble catalysts towards high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <dc:description>
A new chiral triangular macrocycle (NDI&#8208;&#9653;) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity in the molecular state is designed and synthesized. It can not only self&#8208;assemble into nanoscale helices with inversion of CPL signals and enhancement of CPL properties, but also co&#8208;assemble with anthracene via its outer &#960;&#8208;surface to form a macrocycle&#8208;based charge transfer (CT) complex exhibiting CT&#8208;CPL emission.

The enantiomeric NDI&#8208;&#916; is synthesized by condensation of (RR) or (SS)&#8208;trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine and 2,3,6,7&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylic 2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;dianhydride, in which the chirality of the macrocycles is controlled by the diamine. With the rigid outer &#960;&#8208;surface, the macrocycle exhibits unique chiroptical properties and self&#8208;assembly modes. The NDI&#8208;&#916; shows circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in solution and can self&#8208;assemble into helical structures with the inversion of CPL signal and the enhancement of |glum|. Moreover, the NDI&#8208;&#916; has a tailored electron&#8208;deficient outer &#960;&#8208;surface, which can co&#8208;assemble with an electron&#8208;rich anthracene (AN) to form an intermolecular charge transfer (CT) complex, generating a yellow&#8208;green CT&#8208;CPL.

         <title>Red Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining lignin with Upy, results in a red RTP material (Lig&#8208;Upy) with emission centered at 625&#8197;nm and a lifetime of 24.2&#8197;ms. Materials exhibiting time&#8208;dependent phosphorescent colors could be prepared using the multiple hydrogen bonding interactions within Lig&#8208;Upy when embedded into different polymer matrices.







Abstract
Materials with red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) derived from sustainable resources are crucial but rarely reported. Here, we produced red RTP materials from lignin. Lignin was covalently modified with Upy (1&#8208;(6&#8208;isocyanatohexyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl) urea) to obtain Lig&#8208;Upy. The Upy in the Lig&#8208;Upy promoted the interaction between the aromatic units of lignin and reduced energy gaps of these molecules. As a result, Lig&#8208;Upy exhibited red RTP centered at 625&#8197;nm with a lifetime of 24.2&#8197;ms. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding interactions in Lig&#8208;Upy varied when embedded into different matrices, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or sodium montmorillonite (MTM), inducing a change in RTP wavelength and lifetime. Utilizing these properties, Lig&#8208;Upy was used as building blocks for producing materials exhibiting time&#8208;dependent phosphorescent colors (TDPCs). Such TDPCs materials have exhibited great potential for visual decorations, information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting logos for medicine bottles.

         <title>High&#8208;Nuclearity Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Oxidative Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks were constructed from giant {W58} and {W64} via controlled stepwise assembly from {W48} precursor, and the nanosheets derived from exfoliation of 2D layer&#8208;like {W64}&#8208;based MOF exhibited much enhanced activity towards photocatalytic oxidative cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond.







Abstract
High&#8208;nuclearity polyoxometalate (POM) clusters are attractive building blocks (BBs) for the synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their high connectivity and inherently multiple metal centers as functional sites. This work demonstrates a strategy of step&#8208;wise growth on ring&#8208;shaped [P8W48O184]40&#8722; precursor, which produced two new high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxotungstates, a half&#8208;closed [H16P8W58O218]32&#8722; {W58} and a fully&#8208;closed [H16P8W64O236]32&#8722; {W64}. By in situ synthesis, unique MOFs of copper triazole&#8208;benzoic acid (HL) complexes incorporating the negatively&#8208;charged {W58} and {W64} as nodes, {Cu11(HL)9W58} HNPOMOF&#8208;1 and {Cu9(HL)9W64} HNPOMOF&#8208;2, were constructed by delicately tuning the reaction conditions, mainly solution pH, which controls the formation of {W58} and {W64}, and at the same time the protonation of triazole&#8208;benzoic acid ligand thus its coordination mode to copper ion that creates the highest nuclearity POM&#8208;derived MOFs reported to date. HNPOMOF&#8208;1 features 3D framework possessing cage&#8208;like cavities filled with exposed carboxyl groups, while the inherent 2D layer&#8208;like HNPOMOF&#8208;2 allows for facile exfoliation into ultrathin nanosheets, and the resulted HNPOMOF&#8208;2NS exhibits superior activity towards photocatalytic oxidative cleavage of C&#8722;C bond for a series of lignin models. This work not only provides a strategy to build high&#8208;nuclearity POM cluster&#8208;based frameworks, but also demonstrates their great potential as functional materials for green catalysis.

         <title>Chiral Pd2L4 Capsules from Readily Accessible Tr&#246;ger's Base Ligands Inducing Circular Dichroism on Fullerenes C60 and C70</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Pd2L4 capsule based on Tr&#246;ger's base is reported and shown to bind several polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). It shows strong affinity for fullerenes C70 and C60 and is able to extract the latter from complex mixtures. Host&#8208;to&#8208;guest chirality transfer onto the fullerenes is observed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and theoretically analyzed by sTDA time&#8208;dependent DFT methods.







Abstract
The induction of chirality on pristine fullerenes through non&#8208;covalent embedding in an asymmetric nano&#8208;confinement has only been rarely reported. Bringing molecules with such a unique electronic structure and broad application range into a chiral environment is particularly appealing for the development of chiroptical materials, enantioselective photoredox catalysts and systems showing chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this study, we report the formation of a chiral, configurationally stable Pd2L4 capsule assembled from a C2&#8208;symmetric, &#8216;ribbon&#8208;shaped&#8217; ligand with a Tr&#246;ger's base naphthalimide (TbNaps) backbone, easily synthesized in three steps from commercially available compounds. Embedding chirality directly into the ligand backbone ensures a relatively lightweight receptor design whose aromatic panels create a strongly shielded inner cavity of about 700&#8197;&#197;3 volume. Fullerenes C60 and C70, as well as a pair of corannulenes, can be bound in acetonitrile (where unsubstituted fullerenes are insoluble) and X&#8208;ray structures of host&#8208;guest complexes were obtained. Tight interactions between the chiral host and the fullerene guests leads to the induction of a circular dichroism (CD) on the characteristic absorption bands of the forbidden &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transitions of the fullerenes, backed up by sTDA TD&#8208;DFT calculations and detailed investigation of the electronic excited states.

         <title>Selective Electroreduction of CO2 to CO over Ultrawide Potential Window via Implanting Active Site with Long&#8208;Range P Regulation on Periodic Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implanting bismuth atomic site with long&#8208;range P regulation on an ordered macroporous carbon skeleton with mesoporous &#8220;wall&#8221; is able to establish an electronic transport bridge for the activation of CO2 and an unblocked channel for the delivery of CO, thus enabling a high&#8208;efficiency electroreduction of CO2 to CO over ultrawide potential window.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to CO represents a highly promising way for artificial carbon cycling, but obtaining high selectivity over a wide potential window remains a challenge due to the sluggish CO generation and diffusion kinetics. Here we report an integration of long&#8208;range P modified bismuth atomic site on an ordered macroporous carbon skeleton with mesoporous &#8220;wall&#8221; (MW&#8208;BiN3&#8208;POMC) for efficient electroreduction of CO2. In&#8208;depth in situ investigations with theoretical computations reveal that the incorporation of long&#8208;range P atom is able to strengthen the orbital interaction between the C 2p of CO2 and Bi 6p, thereby establishing an electronic transport bridge for the activation of CO2 molecule. Additionally, the ordered macropore with mesoporous wall effectively facilitates the diffusion of CO. As a result, MW&#8208;BiN3&#8208;POMC exhibits an ultrawide potential window of 1000&#8197;mV for high CO selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;%) and a maximal CO partial current density of 414&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, MW&#8208;BiN3&#8208;POMC can also be employed as the cathode to integrate the solar&#8208;driven electrolytic cell (anode of Co3O4&#8208;OMC) toward CO2 reduction coupled with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation to simultaneously yield CO and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid.

         <title>Synergistic Pathways in PLA Breakdown and PTMC Formation: A One&#8208;Pot Eutectic&#8208;Driven Recycling Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PLA is efficiently depolymerized in a one&#8208;pot process. LA formed during degradation creates an eutectic mixture with TMC, enabling milder recycling conditions without extensive drying. The 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;phenolate of potassium catalyzes selective depolymerization, followed by TMC polymerization, yielding lactic acid end&#8208;capped PTMC with high efficiency.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel one&#8208;pot strategy for the chemical valorization of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), coupling its base&#8208;catalyzed depolymerization with the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of trimethylene carbonate (TMC). The process exploits an eutectic mixture of lactide (LA) and TMC, which lowers the thermal input required for PLA degradation. Using potassium aryloxide (KOArtBu) as a bifunctional catalyst, the PLA is first quickly hydrolyzed into oligomers or lactic acid, which subsequently initiate the slower polymerization of TMC. Notably, this transformation operates in the presence of residual water, eliminating the need for tedious drying steps. The method achieves selective PLA breakdown conversion and produces (oligo)lactic acid end&#8208;capped poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) with tunable molar mass, depending on water content.

&lt;p&gt;PLA is efficiently depolymerized in a one-pot process. LA formed during degradation creates an eutectic mixture with TMC, enabling milder recycling conditions without extensive drying. The 2,4,6-tri-tert-butyl-phenolate of potassium catalyzes selective depolymerization, followed by TMC polymerization, yielding lactic acid end-capped PTMC with high efficiency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a novel one-pot strategy for the chemical valorization of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), coupling its base-catalyzed depolymerization with the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of trimethylene carbonate (TMC). The process exploits an eutectic mixture of lactide (LA) and TMC, which lowers the thermal input required for PLA degradation. Using potassium aryloxide (KOAr&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;/sup&gt;) as a bifunctional catalyst, the PLA is first quickly hydrolyzed into oligomers or lactic acid, which subsequently initiate the slower polymerization of TMC. Notably, this transformation operates in the presence of residual water, eliminating the need for tedious drying steps. The method achieves selective PLA breakdown conversion and produces (oligo)lactic acid end-capped poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) with tunable molar mass, depending on water content.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Valent Cobalt&#8208;Difluoride in Oxidative Fluorination of Saturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyamine&#8208;supported CoII complexes catalyzed the oxidative fluorination of saturated hydrocarbons, in some instances selectively, when combined with Selectfluor and CsF, producing fluorinated products in near&#8208;quantitative yields. Mechanistic analysis supported the involvement of a CoIV&#8208;(F)2 oxidant in C&#8722;H activation and a CoIII&#8722;F F&#8208;atom donor for radical rebound.







Abstract
The heme paradigm where Fe=O acts as the C&#8722;H oxidant and Fe&#8722;OH rebounds with the formed carbon&#8208;centered radical guides the design of the prototypical synthetic hydroxylation catalyst. We are exploring methods to evolve beyond the metal&#8208;oxo oxidant and hydroxide rebound, to incorporate a wider array of functional group. We have demonstrated the application of CoII(OTf)2 (10&#8197;mol% catalyst; OTf=trimfluoromethanesulfonate) in combination with polydentate N&#8208;donor ligands (e.&#8201;g. BPMEN=N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) and Selectfluor in the oxidative fluorination of saturated hydrocarbons in high yields. The addition of CsF to the reaction mixture induced near&#8208;quantitative yields of fluorinated saturated hydrocarbons (&gt;90&#8201;% yield of fluorinated product). For 1&#8208;hydroxy, 1&#8208;acetyl, 1&#8208;carboxy&#8208;, and 1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;adamantane, we demonstrated selective fluorination at the 3&#8208;position. We propose two mechanisms for the CoII&#8208;catalyzed reaction: either (i)&#8197;an N&#8208;radical, derived from Selectfluor, acted as the C&#8722;H oxidant followed by radical rebound with CoIII&#8722;F; or (ii)&#8197;a CoIV&#8722;(F)2 species was the C&#8722;H oxidant followed by radical rebound with CoIII&#8722;F. Our combined spectroscopic, kinetic, and chemical trapping evidence suggested that an N&#8208;radical was not the active oxidant. We concluded that a CoIV&#8722;(F)2 species was the likely active oxidant and CoIII&#8722;F was the likely F&#8208;atom donor to a carbon centered radical producing a C&#8722;F bond.

         <title>4D Printing of Liquid Crystal Emulsions for Smart Structures with Multiple Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel 4D printing approach using digital light processing (DLP) to fabricate complex, multifunctional 3D structures from liquid crystal (LC) emulsions. This method preserves LC ordering, imparting tunable shape memory, light responsiveness, and porosity. The addition of chiral nematic LCs enables adjustable reflective properties, offering potential for applications in adaptive optics, robotics, and photonics.







Abstract
3D printing, and more recently 4D printing, has emerged as a transformative technology for fabricating structures with complex geometries and responsive properties. However, employing functional colloidal solutions as inks for printing remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel and versatile 4D printing approach for fabricating functional and complex&#8208;shaped objects using polymerizable liquid crystal (LC) emulsion droplets. Leveraging a digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing technique, we achieve rapid production of intricate 3D geometries with high resolution. The printed structures retain the LC ordering from the precursor droplets, imparting the final objects with shape memory properties, including shape fixation and recovery upon heating or light exposure. Light&#8208;responsive behavior is introduced post&#8208;printing by embedding an azo dye into the 3D structures. Additionally, we explore the potential to create intrinsically porous 3D structures by selectively removing non&#8208;reactive components from the printed geometries, adding an extra level of functionality to the printed objects. Furthermore, we incorporate chiral nematic LCs into the emulsion droplets, producing 3D objects with tunable reflective properties. To our knowledge, this is the first example of DLP 3D printing with emulsions, offering an effective and versatile pathway for developing 4D&#8208;printed materials with potential applications in optics, robotics, microfluidics, and biomedicine.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe2 and Ni Sites for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>

A new ternary&#8208;atom catalyst Fe2/Ni&#8722;N&#8722;HCMs composed of paired Fe sites and single Ni sites (Fe2&#8722;N6 and Ni&#8722;N4) coordinated onto hollow N&#8208;doped carbon microspheres is synthesized by a simple process. Because of the synergistic effects of the two groups, the catalysts electrocatalyze the oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions effectively through a dual&#8208;site mechanism, promoting direct O&#8722;O radical breakage without going through *OOH intermediates, enabling a zinc&#8208;air battery to perform superbly.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient, cost&#8208;effective, and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of renewable fuel cells and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, a new ternary&#8208;atom catalyst that is composed of paired Fe sites and single Ni sites (as Fe2&#8722;N6 and Ni&#8722;N4) coordinated onto hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon microspheres is developed. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst exhibits remarkable activities toward both the ORR and OER in alkaline media, with superior performances to those of the control materials that contain only Fe2&#8722;N6 or Ni&#8722;N4 sites. Density functional theory calculations and in&#8197;situ infrared (IR) spectroscopic studies clearly reveal that the Fe2&#8722;N6 centers are the active sites for both ORR and OER, and their electrocatalytic activities are synergistically enhanced through optimization of their d&#8208;band centers by the Ni&#8722;N4 sites. This ternary&#8208;atom catalyst can potentially be a promising, alternative, sustainable catalyst to commercially used Pt&#8208; and Ru&#8208;based catalysts to drive both the ORR and the OER in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries and other related applications.

         <title>Discovering Cell&#8208;Targeting Ligands and Cell&#8208;Surface Receptors by Selection of DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries against Cancer Cells without Predefined Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>

An unbiased DEL selection method against cancer cells without predefined targets has been developed. Small&#8208;molecule ligands targeting aggressive cancer cells have been identified and applied in targeted delivery applications, including cancer photodynamic therapy and drug delivery. It is shown that DELs can be a useful tool to identify specific surface receptors on cancer cells.







Abstract
Small molecules that can bind to specific cells have broad application in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Screening large chemical libraries against live cells is an effective strategy for discovering cell&#8208;targeting ligands. The DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL or DECL) technology has emerged as a robust tool in drug discovery and has been successfully utilized in identifying ligands for biological targets. However, nearly all DEL selections have predefined targets, while target&#8208;agnostic DEL selections interrogating the entire cell surface remain underexplored. Herein, we systematically optimized a cell&#8208;based DEL selection method against cancer cells without predefined targets. A 104.96&#8208;million&#8208;member DEL was selected against MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells, representing high and low metastatic properties, respectively, which led to the identification of cell&#8208;specific small molecules. We further demonstrated cell&#8208;targeting applications of these ligands in cancer photodynamic therapy and targeted drug delivery. Finally, leveraging the DNA tag of DEL compounds, we identified &#945;&#8208;enolase (ENO1) as the cell surface receptor of one of the ligands targeting the more aggressive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells. Overall, this work offers an efficient approach for discovering cell&#8208;targeting small molecule ligands by using DELs and demonstrates that DELs can be a useful tool to identify specific surface receptors on cancer cells.

It is shown that DELs can be a useful tool to identify specific surface receptors on cancer cells.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small molecules that can bind to specific cells have broad application in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Screening large chemical libraries against live cells is an effective strategy for discovering cell-targeting ligands. The DNA-encoded chemical library (DEL or DECL) technology has emerged as a robust tool in drug discovery and has been successfully utilized in identifying ligands for biological targets. However, nearly all DEL selections have predefined targets, while target-agnostic DEL selections interrogating the entire cell surface remain underexplored. Herein, we systematically optimized a cell-based DEL selection method against cancer cells without predefined targets. A 104.96-million-member DEL was selected against MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, representing high and low metastatic properties, respectively, which led to the identification of cell-specific small molecules. We further demonstrated cell-targeting applications of these ligands in cancer photodynamic therapy and targeted drug delivery. Finally, leveraging the DNA tag of DEL compounds, we identified &#945;-enolase (ENO1) as the cell surface receptor of one of the ligands targeting the more aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells. Overall, this work offers an efficient approach for discovering cell-targeting small molecule ligands by using DELs and demonstrates that DELs can be a useful tool to identify specific surface receptors on cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In situ Polymerization Induced Seed&#8208;Root Anchoring Structure for Enhancing Stability and Efficiency in Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells, we used thiol&#8208;functionalized particles as a &#8220;seed&#8221; for in situ polymerization of 2,2,3,4,4,4&#8208;hexafluorobutyl methacrylate as a &#8220;root&#8221; at the bottom of the perovskite layer. This design prevents void formation under high temperatures and vacuum, enhancing the operational stability of perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
The escape of organic cations over time from defective perovskite interface leads to non&#8208;stoichiometric terminals, significantly affecting the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). How to stabilize the interface composition under environmental stress remains a grand challenge. To address this issue, we utilize thiol&#8208;functionalized particles as a &#8220;seed&#8221; and conduct in situ polymerization of 2,2,3,4,4,4&#8208;hexafluorobutyl methacrylate (HFMA) as a &#8220;root&#8221; at the bottom of the perovskite layer. In this process, the thiol group acts as the initiation site for the polymerization of HFMA, while the fluorine groups in HFMA firmly anchor the organic cations of the perovskite through multiple hydrogen bonds. This strategy resembles how seeds take root in soil to prevent soil erosion. This bionic seed&#8208;rooting structure effectively stabilizes the stoichiometry of the perovskite, thus suppressing the escape of organic cations. As a result, the perovskite films with seed&#8208;rooting structures exhibit enhanced stability under harsh vacuum thermal conditions (150&#8201;&#176;C, &lt;10&#8197;Pa). The resulting PCS achieves an efficiency of 25.64&#8201;% and a 22.4&#8197;cm2 module efficiency of 22.61&#8201;%. After 1300&#8197;hours of 1&#8208;sun illumination at 85&#8201;% relative humidity and 65&#8201;&#176;C (ISOS&#8722;L&#8208;3 protocol), the perovskite solar module maintains 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency.

         <title>Photoswitchable Topological Regulation of Covalent Macrocycles, Molecular Recognition, and Interlocked Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic macrocycles are distinguished by their reversible and adaptable formation, and potential topological transformation. A concept of photoswitchable topological regulation of dynamic macrocycles was developed and used to modulate molecular recognition and the formation of various mechanically interlocked molecules, including rotaxanes and catenanes, offering a versatile platform for complex structures and functions.







Abstract
Macrocycles represent one important class of functional molecules, and dynamic macrocycles with the potential of cleavability, adaptability, and topological conversion are challenging. Herein we report photoswitchable allosteric and topological control of dynamic covalent macrocycles and further the use in guest binding and mechanically interlocked molecules. The manipulation of competing ring&#8208;chain equilibria and bond formation/scission within reaction systems enabled light&#8208;induced structural regulation over dithioacetal and thioacetal dynamic bonds, accordingly realizing bidirectional switching between crown ether&#8208;like covalent macrocycles and their linear counterparts. The on&#8208;demand photoswitchable topological transformation of macrocycles further allowed guest recognition/release exhibiting controllable binding affinity and selectivity. To showcase the capability light&#8208;triggered assembly/disassembly of diverse mechanically interlocked structures, such as rotaxanes and catenanes, was achieved. The realization of photoswitchable topological conversion of covalent macrocycles, which has been rarely reported before, demonstrates the potential of light&#8208;triggered reactivity control and structural reconfiguration for enhanced complexity and sophisticated function. The strategies and results should be appealing to endeavors in molecular recognition, dynamic assemblies, molecular machines, and intelligent materials.

         <title>Electrolyte Anions Suppress Hydrogen Generation in Electrochemical CO Reduction on Cu</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the role of halide anions in Cu catalyzed electrochemical CO reduction (eCOR). Our findings show that anions suppress the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By pairing our experimental results with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we propose a model wherein anions modulate the interplay between adsorbed CO* and H* at the catalyst surface, controlling the outcome of the CO reduction reaction.







Abstract
In this study, we employed electrochemical&#8208;mass spectrometry (EC&#8208;MS) to elucidate the role of halide anions in electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction. We found that the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was significantly suppressed by the anion used. Specifically, the rates of H2 production decreased in the order KF &gt; KCl &gt; KI, meaning that I&#8722; most strongly suppressed HER. Interestingly, CO reduction products showed an inverse relationship to HER, with KI leading to the highest rate of CO reduction. By pairing our experimental findings with classical molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a mechanism wherein halide anions influence the dynamic interplay between CO reduction and HER by modulating the competition of H* and CO* for active sites on the Cu surface. We propose that this interaction is enabled by the interfacial concentration of K+ being greater in the presence of F&#8722; than in I&#8722;. Our results highlight the need to more broadly consider the properties of ions at electrocatalytic interfaces and they point to thus far underappreciated avenues to optimize hydrocarbon production while suppressing hydrogen evolution.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Tiered Golf Anode towards Ultralong&#8208;Life Zn&#8722;Mn Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly conductive and three&#8208;tiered golf anode was developed to simultaneously enhance the reversibility of Zn and Mn metals. The experiment characterizations and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the three&#8208;tiered golf anode is achieved by inner zinc powder, intermediate carbon and outer bismuth layer, which can effectively enhance the Gibbs free energy and mitigate the volume change of the anode.







Abstract
Zn&#8722;Mn aqueous batteries (ZMABs) are widely recognized as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high safety and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of ZMABs is hindered by inherent electrical contact loss, hydrogen evolution and dendrite growth on traditional anodes. Here, a three&#8208;tiered golf anode with high conductivity is developed to simultaneously enhance the reversibility of Zn and Mn metals. The three&#8208;tiered golf anode is achieved by inner zinc powder, intermediate carbon and outer bismuth layer, which can effectively enhance the Gibbs free energy and mitigate the volume change of the anode, thus enabling stable Zn&#8722;Mn cycling. As a proof of concept, Zn&#8722;Mn full cells (coupled to CNT@MnO2) achieve an ultralong cycle life with 94.6&#8201;% capacity retention at 2&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 16,000&#8197;cycles. This study presents valuable insights into the structural design of anodes aimed at enhancing the stability and durability of ZMABs.

         <title>Highly Durable Rh Single Atom Catalyst Modulated by Surface Defects on Fe&#8208;Ce Oxide Solid Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh single atom catalysts were prepared by anchoring Rh atoms on the defect sites of Fe&#8722;Ce oxide solid solution. Upon reduction at 500&#8201;&#176;C, the Rh single atom catalyst with oxygen&#8208;deficient coordination presented high activity and durability for selective catalytic reduction of NO with CO. Rh single atoms with oxygen&#8208;rich coordination suffered from surface poisoning more.







Abstract
Forming defect sites on catalyst supports and immobilizing precious metal atoms at these sites offers an efficient approach for preparing single&#8208;atom catalysts. In this study, we employed an Fe&#8722;Ce oxide solid solution (FC), which has surface oxygen that reduces more readily than that of ceria, to anchor Rh single atoms (Rh1). When utilized in the selective catalytic reduction of NO with CO (CO&#8208;SCR), Rh1/FC reduced at 500&#8201;&#176;C&#8212;characterized by less oxidic Rh state induced by an oxygen&#8208;deficient coordination&#8212;exhibited superior activity and durability compared to Rh1/ceria and Rh1/FC reduced at 300&#8201;&#176;C. This Rh single&#8208;atom structure was sustained after 100&#8197;hours of CO&#8208;SCR at 400&#8201;&#176;C. Reaction intermediates formed on the catalyst surface were analyzed using in&#8197;situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) under NO and CO flow conditions. Additionally, the catalyst structure and the CO&#8208;SCR reaction mechanism were investigated using density functional theory (DFT). While Rh atoms located near surface Fe sites were found to be thermodynamically most stable, both NO and CO preferentially adsorbed on Rh sites. Fe plays a role in stabilizing Rh sites and facilitating oxygen transfer. This work provides valuable insights into the design of highly active and durable single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of Iron(IV) Alkynylide Complexes and Their Reactivity to Form 1,3&#8208;Diynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;electron oxidation of alkynylferrates(III) enables the synthesis of the corresponding high&#8208;valent Fe(IV) alkynylides. These organoiron complexes have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, EPR, NMR, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;Ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies and theoretical calculations (DFT and CASSCF). The isolated Fe(IV) alkynylide complexes react at room temperature to form 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
The isolation of thermally unstable and highly reactive organoiron(IV) complexes is a challenge for synthetic chemists. In particular, the number of examples where the C&#8208;based ligand is not part of the chelating ligand remains scarce. These compounds are of interest because they could pave the way to designing catalytic cycles of bond forming reactions proceeding via organoiron(IV) intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization, including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, of a family of alkynylferrates(III) and Fe(IV) alkynylide complexes. The alkynylferrates(III) are formed by transmetalation of the Fe(III) precursor [(N3N&#8217;)FeIII] (N3N&#8217;3&#8722; is tris(N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl&#8208;2&#8208;amidoethyl)amine) with lithium alkynylides, and their further one&#8208;electron oxidation enables the synthesis of the corresponding Fe(IV) alkynylides. The electronic structure of this family of organometallic Fe(III) and Fe(IV) complexes has been thoroughly investigated by spectroscopic methods (EPR, NMR, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;Ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies) and theoretical calculations. While alkynylferrates(III) are sluggish to engage into C&#8722;C bond forming processes, the Fe(IV) alkynylides react to afford 1,3&#8208;diynes at room temperature. A bimolecular reductive elimination from a bimetallic Fe(IV) intermediate to form the 1,3&#8208;diynes is proposed based on the mechanistic investigations performed.

         <title>Employing Octahedral Net Charge Descriptors for Designing High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the octahedral net charge descriptor to design high&#8208;performance aqueous MXene proton batteries. By influencing electron transfer and distribution, this descriptor correlates well with HER, capacity and proton transfer processes. This research provides a theoretical foundation for optimizing MXene electrodes in sustainable energy storage.







Abstract
Recently, aqueous proton batteries have shown promise for electrochemical energy storage using MXene electrodes. However, designing high&#8208;performance MXene proton batteries remains challenging due to the inevitable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the vast chemical composition space of MXene, and the unclear proton transport mechanism. To tackle these challenges, we established a general descriptor based on structural units of MXenes, termed the octahedral net charge descriptor (Qoct). This descriptor correlates well with HER activity, capacity, and proton transport performance. Based on the descriptor, prediction reveals a dual&#8208;proton storage mechanism per site in N&#8208;functionalized MXene. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the descriptor is verified across a broader MXene chemical space. Additionally, the kinetic process shows the topological transformation energy barrier of the interfacial solution is profoundly influenced by Qoct, thereby impacting the proton transfer performance. This universal descriptor originates from the different electron filling states on the molecular orbitals of the octahedron. Overall, this work provides an efficient strategy for designing MXene proton batteries and can be extended to other battery and catalysis fields.

         <title>Initiator&#8208;Free Thiol&#8208;Aldehyde Photo Polycondensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo polymerizations are normally promoted by a photo&#8208;catalyst and few cases create degradable chemical bonds. The polycondensation between aldehyde monomers and polymercaptans was discovered to proceed well under direct photo irradiation without a catalyst, producing linear polymers and hydrolytic&#8208;resistant dynamic networks, which undergo cation&#8208;triggered rapid degradation to recover the aldehyde monomers.







Abstract
Traditional photopolymerizations generally require an initiator for initiating the polymerization while few cases have created degradable chemical bonds. Moreover, the migration instability and cytotoxicity of photo initiators are posing issues to human health and the environment. In this work, we discovered an initiator&#8208;free photo polycondensation system (IFPPC) between polymercaptans and aldehyde monomers, producing elastic and high strength plastic materials with exchangeable and degradable dithioacetal groups. IFPPC proceeds through a radical mechanism and is applicable in producing linear polymers and crosslinked networks. Nano&#8208;composites can also be obtained via an organic solvent&#8208;free Pickering emulsion polymerization using cellulose nanofibers as the stabilizer. The dithioacetal groups afford excellent stability under hydrolytic conditions and repeated thermal processing of cross&#8208;linked polymers, while their cleavage in aqueous solution of salts (silver nitrate, zinc iodide, copper bromide, etc.) results in fast degradation for recovering the aldehyde monomer. This is a successful demonstration of producing recyclable and degradable plastics through photo irradiation while avoiding the problematic issues of photo initiators.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Topology&#8208;Controlled BODIPY and CO2&#8208;Based Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first successful direct synthesis of topology&#8208;controlled BODIPY&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOFs with distinct fcu and hcp topologies, utilizing CO2 as a feedstock. Both materials exhibited excellent crystallinity and demonstrated suitable photocatalytic redox potentials for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO, using H2O as the electron donor, achieving the high CO yields up to 16.72&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity.







Abstract
Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based zirconium metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) possess strong light&#8208;harvesting capabilities and great potential for artificial photosynthesis without the use of sacrificial reagents. However, their direct preparation has not yet been achieved due to challenges in synthesizing suitable ligands. Herein, we reported the first successful direct synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOFs, utilizing CO2 as a feedstock. By controlling synthetic conditions, we successfully obtained two distinct Zr&#8208;MOFs. The first, CO2&#8208;Zr6&#8208;DEPB, exhibits a face&#8208;centered cubic (fcu) topology based on a Zr6(&#956;3&#8208;O)4(&#956;3&#8208;OH)4 node, while the second, CO2&#8208;Zr12&#8208;DEPB, features a hexagonal closed packed (hcp) topology, structured around a Zr12(&#956;3&#8208;O)8(&#956;3&#8208;OH)8(&#956;2&#8208;OH)6 node. Both MOFs demonstrated excellent crystallinity, as verified through powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses. These MOF catalysts displayed suitable photocatalytic redox potentials for the reduction of CO2 to CO using H2O as the electron donor in the absence of co&#8208;catalyst or toxic sacrificial reagent. Under light irradiation, CO2&#8208;Zr12&#8208;DEPB and CO2&#8208;Zr6&#8208;DEPB offered high CO yields of 16.72 and 13.91&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity. CO2 uptake and photoelectrochemical experiments revealed key insights into the mechanisms driving the different catalytic activities of the two MOFs. These BODIPY and CO2&#8208;based, light&#8208;responsive Zr&#8208;MOFs represent a promising platform for the development of efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Preparation of High&#8208;Crystalline Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Triazine Frameworks via Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular confined Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction strategy is developed to achieve rapid and kilogram&#8208;scale preparation of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with tailorable functionality for the first time. The obtained functionalized CTFs exhibited excellent aqueous dispersibility and micropollutant removal efficiency as well as superior solution processability.







Abstract
The Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction has been extensively applied to the preparation of various porous organic polymers because of its simple operation and abundant building blocks. However, due to its poor reversibility and excessive random reactive sites, the synthesis of crystalline organic polymers/frameworks by Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction has never been realized so far. Herein, we develop a molecular confined Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction strategy to achieve rapid preparation (within only 30 minutes) of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with tailorable functionality for the first time. Theoretical calculations and detailed experiments revealed the critical role of carboxyl groups in aromatic benzene monomer during the CTFs crystallization, which can not only effectively cause a suitable activation barrier for the electrophilic attack of 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine through their electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, but also introduce anchoring effects (molecular confinement effects) to facilitate the ordered polymerization at specific sites in 2D planar direction. Benefiting from the convenient synthetic route and low&#8208;cost raw materials, we could unprecedentedly realize the kilogram&#8208;scale fabrication of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized high&#8208;crystalline CTFs. Moreover, thanks to the hydrophilic and ionizable properties of carboxyl groups, the obtained functionalized CTFs exhibited excellent aqueous dispersibility and superior solution processability.

         <title>Heterocoupling Two Similar Benzyl Radicals by Dual Photoredox/Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective catalytic synthesis method comprising dual photoredox and cobalt catalysis is established for heterocoupling two similar benzyl radicals from abundant methylarenes and benzyl NHPI esters. The results showed successful 1&#176;&#8211;1&#176;, 1&#176;&#8211;2&#176;, 1&#176;&#8211;3&#176;, 2&#176;&#8211;2&#176;, 2&#176;&#8211;3&#176; and 3&#176;&#8211;3&#176; benzyl couplings, benzylation of drug structure&#8208;containing molecules, scale&#8208;up experiments, continuous photochemical flow synthesis, and a one&#8208;pot procedure.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;regulated radical cross coupling enables the selective bonding of two distinct transient radicals, whereas the catalytic method for sorting two almost identical transient radicals, especially similar benzyl radicals, is still rare. Herein, we show that leveraging dual photoredox/cobalt catalysis can selectively couple two similar benzyl radicals. Using easily accessible methylarenes and phenylacetates (benzyl N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters) as benzyl radical sources, a range of unsymmetrical 1,2&#8208;diarylethane classes via the 1&#176;&#8211;1&#176;, 1&#176;&#8211;2&#176;, 1&#176;&#8211;3&#176;, 2&#176;&#8211;2&#176;, 2&#176;&#8211;3&#176; and 3&#176;&#8211;3&#176; couplings were obtained with broad functional group tolerance. Besides the photochemical continuous flow synthesis, the one&#8208;pot procedure that directly uses phenylacetic acids and NHPI as the starting materials to avoid the pre&#8208;preparation of benzyl NHPI esters for the gram&#8208;scale synthesis is also feasible and affords good yields, showcasing the synthetic utility of our protocol.

         <title>Sequential Infiltration Synthesis of Cadmium Sulfide Discrete Atom Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) method to form cadmium sulfide discrete atom clusters within poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) polymer thin films. By alternating exposures to dimethyl cadmium and hydrogen sulfide, researchers synthesized cubane&#8208;type Cd4S4 core clusters. The clusters, capped with methyl, thiol, and hydroxy groups, were structurally validated through spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray scattering, and simulations. This SIS technique offers a new pathway for creating precisely structured materials with potential applications in light&#8208;absorbing technologies, including solar energy harvesting.







Abstract
Exposure of soft material templates to alternating volatile chemical precursors can produce inorganic deposition within the permeable template (e.g. a polymer thin film) in a process akin to atomic layer deposition (ALD). While such sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) processes have now been demonstrated for many metal oxides, we report an SIS process for a transition metal sulfide &#8211; CdS. Gas phase dimethyl cadmium and hydrogen sulfide precursors infiltrated into poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) thin films result in the 3D&#8208;nucleation of clusters consistent with a cubane&#8208;type Cd4S4 core that are variably terminated with methyl, thiol and hydroxy capping ligands. First principles models and simulation of few&#8208;atom Cd&#8208;based clusters are consistent with electronic and vibrational spectroscopy and grazing&#8208;incidence total X&#8208;ray scattering measurements of 3D&#8208;cluster&#8208;arrays synthesized at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The direct synthesis of few&#8208;atom transition metal sulfide clusters within polymer thin films will provide a versatile new route to precision architectures for light&#8208;absorbing materials including solar energy harvesting and conversion applications.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Strategy to Enhance Long&#8208;Range Order of Poly(Heptazine Imide) Nanorods for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Methanation</title>

Poly(heptazine imide) nanorods with improved long&#8208;range order was prepared by a bottom&#8208;up strategy. The improvement of long&#8208;range order greatly enhances the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges as well as the adsorption for *CO intermediate, resulting in excellent activity for photocatalytic CO2 methanation.







Abstract
Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), one of the crystalline or long&#8208;range ordered allotropes of polymeric carbon nitride, is a promising polymeric photocatalyst; however, preparation of highly crystalline PHI remains a challenge. Herein, through a bottom&#8208;up strategy involving repair of structural defects and increase of specific surface area of melon precursor, we prepared PHI nanorods with dramatically improved long&#8208;range order. The resulting PHI exhibited a shift of product selectivity in CO2 photoreduction from CO to CH4 with a high methanation activity in contrast to the pristine PHI with relatively low long&#8208;range order. The improvement of long&#8208;range order for PHI remarkably enhanced the separation efficiency and transfer kinetics of photogenerated charges as well as the adsorption for *CO intermediate. This study revealed the relationship between the precursor structure and PHI crystal growth in ionothermal synthesis, and also showcased the great potential of highly crystalline PHI in artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Remote Carbon Monoxide Spillover Improves Tandem Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;gold alloys are paired with ruthenium dioxides to facilitate efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO* and NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2* conversions, respectively. The minimization of the work function difference between Pd2Au1 and RuO2 promotes the remote spillover of CO* from Pd2Au1 to RuO2, improving effective coupling with spatially isolated NH2* for urea production. As a result, a high&#8208;efficiency urea production efficiency was achieved at record&#8208;low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic urea synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) offers a promising alternative to traditional industrial methods. However, current catalysts face limitations in the supplies of CO* and Nrelated* intermediates, and their coupling, resulting in unsatisfactory urea production efficiency and energy consumption. To overcome these challenges, we carried out tandem electrosynthesis approach using ruthenium dioxide&#8208;supported palladium&#8208;gold alloys (Pd2Au1/RuO2). This catalyst system effectively catalyzes CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO* conversion on Pd2Au1 and NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH2* conversion on RuO2. Crucially, the minimized work function difference between two components promotes remote CO* spillover from Pd2Au1 to RuO2, improving effective coupling of CO* and NH2* for urea production. Our catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving a record&#8208;high Faradaic efficiency for urea (FEurea) of 75.6&#177;0.5&#8201;% and a urea production rate (rurea) of 73.5&#177;0.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Notably, this was accomplished with an ultralow energy consumption of 18.9&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgurea&#8722;1. We also successfully demonstrate the long&#8208;term stability of our catalyst in a flow cell, achieving over 160&#8197;h of uninterrupted urea and formate production with consistent profitability. This achievement represents a significant step towards the large&#8208;scale practical application of sustainable urea electrosynthesis.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Drug for the Self&#8208;Checking of Mitophagy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a innovative &#8220;one&#8208;two punch&#8221; drug design strategy, exemplified by the mitophagy self&#8208;check drug. This strategy integrates both target&#8208;zone drug functionality and non&#8208;target zone biological reporting into a single small&#8208;molecule drug, effectively addressing the challenges associated with conventional marker interference in drug evaluation.







Abstract
Mitophagy, particularly in the context of drugs that disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), represents a critical focus in pharmacology. However, the discovery and evaluation of MMP&#8208;disrupting drugs are often hampered using commercially available marker molecules that target similar or identical zones. These markers can significantly interfere with, obscure, or amplify the functional effects of MMP&#8208;targeting drugs, frequently leading to clinical failures. In response to this challenge, we propose a &#8220;one&#8208;two punch&#8221; drug design strategy that integrates both target&#8208;zone drug functionality and non&#8208;target zone biological reporting within a single small&#8208;molecule drug. We have developed a novel proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept mitophagy self&#8208;check drug (MitoSC) that exhibits dual&#8208;color and dual&#8208;localization properties. The functional component of this system is a variable MitoSC that disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) homeostasis, thereby inducing mitophagy. Upon activation, this component transforms into a blue&#8208;fluorescent monomer (MitoSC&#8208;fun) specifically within the mitochondrial target zone. Concurrently, the biological reporting component is represented by a red&#8208;fluorescent monomer (MitoSC&#8208;rep) that localizes to lysosomes, the non&#8208;target zone. As mitophagy progresses, the fluorescent signals from MitoSC&#8208;rep (lysosomes) and MitoSC&#8208;fun (mitochondria) converge, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of the mitophagic process. This strategy combines potent drug functionality with robust biological reporting, thereby minimizing interference and eliminating the complexities associated with external detection. Our findings underscore the potential of a single&#8208;molecule drug to exert target&#8208;zone specific actions while simultaneously providing non&#8208;target zone self&#8208;checking, offering a new perspective for drug design.

         <title>Supramolecular Rotor Assembly for the Design of a Hybrid Ferroelectric&#8208;Antiferromagnetic Multiferroic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first crown ether&#8208;based hybrid ferroelectric&#8208;antiferromagnetic multiferroic material with excellent X&#8208;ray radiation detection response was prepared by the self&#8208;assembly of a supramolecular rotor and a magnetic module. This study demonstrates the great advantages this approach in the design of multiferroic materials and provides a new avenue for developing ferroic functional materials.







Abstract
Ferroelectric (FE)&#8208;antiferromagnetic (AFM) multiferroic materials have sparked growing interest due to their huge possibilities in energy&#8208;saving, photoelectric devices, nonvolatile storage, and switches. However, realizing FE&#8208;AFM properties in a hybrid molecular material is difficult because ferroelectric and magnetic orders are commonly mutually exclusive. Here, we report an FE&#8208;AFM multiferroic semiconductor [NH4(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]2[Mn(SCN)4] (NCMS) by supramolecular assembly approach via molecular rotor synthon [NH4(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] and inorganic magnetic module [Mn(SCN)4]. Interestingly, NCMS shows good ferroelectricity with a spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 5.94&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2 higher than most crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based ferroelectrics. Especially, the realization of antiferromagnetism is for the first time in the crown ether hybrid perovskite ferroic systems. Additionally, semiconductor NCMS displays an X&#8208;ray radiation detection response with a large photo/dark current on&#8208;off ratio (197). Our study not only gives a deep insight into understanding multiferroic properties but also provides a novel and efficient approach to realizing high&#8208;performance hybrid multiferroic materials.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;mediated Assembly of New Heterocycles: From Borylenes to Oxaboroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;stabilized rhodium borylene, generated by metal&#8208;ligand cooperative dehydrogenation of H2BMes (Mes=mesityl), regioselectively adds a series of alkynes (R=Ph, Me, H, CO2Et) across boron and the carbon atom of a CO ligand. Subsequent reaction with CO(g) releases a highly functionalized oxaborole.

         <title>Coaxial Helices in Chiral Supramolecular Aggregates from Highly Hindered Chiral Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular helical aggregates describing two coaxial helices rotating in the same or opposite direction are obtained from the self&#8208;assembly of chiral allenes. The internal helix is described by the allene stack, while the external one, a 4&#8208;helix, is described by the four allene substituents. The two coaxial helices can rotate in the same or opposite direction depending on the magnitude of the tilting degree between allenes along the supramolecular aggregate.







Abstract
Chiral allenes self&#8208;assembly following a cooperative mechanism into a supramolecular chiral aggregate consisting of two coaxial helices: the internal helix described by the allene stack and the external helix which consist in a 4&#8208;helix described by the four allene substituents. More precisely, this supramolecular aggregate possesses six axially chiral elements within its structure&#8212;the allene, the allene stack (internal helix) and the stacks of the four allene substituents (external 4&#8208;helix)&#8212;. Interestingly, slight variations in the magnitude of the tilting degree while keeping its P&#8208; or M&#8208; orientation (internal helix) can vary the orientation of the 4&#8208;axial motifs at the external helix. Thus, while (P)&#8208;1 produces a supramolecular helix with a &#920; ca. 15&#176; (Pint) and a M1/P2/M1&#8217;/P2&#8217; orientation of the four axial motifs at the periphery, (P)&#8208;2 produces a supramolecular helix with a &#920; ca. 23&#176; (Pint) and a P1/P2/P1&#8217;/P2&#8217; orientation of the four axial motifs at the external helix. As a result, the ECD spectra and the AFM images of the (P)&#8208;1 and (P)&#8208;2 supramolecular aggregates dominated by the 1 and 1&#8217; substituents of the chiral allene indicate opposite handedness although the chirality of the building block and the orientation of the allene stack are the same

         <title>Scalable and Precise Synthesis of Structurally Colored Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: Enabling Refined Color Calibration for Sustainable Photonic Pigments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel, scalable, precise, and sustainable strategy for synthesizing structural colored bottlebrush block copolymers, effectively bridging the gap between laboratory research and practical applications. This approach may be extended to the synthesis of diverse block copolymers with various functions, opening up new possibilities across multiple fields, including supersoft elastomers, organic optoelectronics, photolithography, energy storage, and biomedical devices.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) offer a vibrant, eco&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional toxic pigments and dyes, providing vivid structural colors with significantly reduced environmental impact. Scaling up the synthesis of these polymers for practical applications has been challenging with conventional batch methods, which suffer from slow mass and heat transfer, inadequate mixing, and issues with reproducibility. Precise control over molecular weight and dispersity remains a significant challenge for achieving finely tuned color appearances. Here, we present an alternative strategy to overcome the challenges by integrating a rapid continuous flow technique with an in&#8208;line self&#8208;assembly procedure. This strategy enables the rapid, stable and large&#8208;scale synthesis of narrow&#8208;dispersed BBCPs, exceeding 2&#8197;kg/day, a significant improvement over conventional gram&#8208;scale methods. Furthermore, precise control over the degree of polymerization is achieved with an unprecedented interval accuracy of four repeat units. This level of precision enables refined color calibration in the resulting photonic pigments, effectively eliminating the need for labor&#8208;intensive and costly multiple batch syntheses.

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry to Probe Sequences in Supramolecular Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion mobility &#8208; mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS) allows discrimination of isomers of a supramolecular copolymer based on their collision cross&#8208;section (CCS). Our study carried out with benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide co&#8208;assemblies opens the door to the identification and quantification of sequences in the field of supramolecular copolymers.







Abstract
The analysis of the microstructure of supramolecular copolymers is difficult because of their dynamic character. Here, benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) co&#8208;assemblies are analysed by ion mobility &#8211; mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS) to reveal the presence of various sequences. For example, the IM&#8211;MS mobilogram for hexamers composed of 4&#8197;units from a first monomer and 2&#8197;units from a second monomer is a broad distribution due to the presence of 9 possible isomeric sequences, which can be sorted out based on calculated collision cross&#8208;sections. This approach gives unprecedented information on supramolecular copolymer sequences.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Layer Pickering Emulsion: Molecular&#8208;Level Gating of Water Delivery at Water&#8208;Oil Interface for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogenation Using H2O as a Hydrogen Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the as&#8208;prepared MOF&#8208;CdS dual&#8208;layer Pickering emulsion, the molecularly regulated hydrophobicity of MOF layer acted as a gate to control the mass transfer (e.g., water delivery) at water&#8208;oil interface. Hence, the water&#8208;phase hydrogenation was effectively coupled with oil&#8208;phase photocatalytic HER. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, our work boosts the development of biphasic catalytic system and paves a novel avenue for tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Biphasic system not only presents a promising opportunity for complex catalytic processes, but also is a grand challenge in efficient tandem reactions. As an emerging solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and water&#8208;donating hydrogenation combines the sustainability of photocatalysis and economic&#8208;value of hydrogenation. However, the key and challenging point is to couple water&#8208;soluble photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with oil&#8208;soluble hydrogenation. Herein, we employed metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and CdS nanorods to construct a MOF&#8208;CdS dual&#8208;layer Pickering emulsion (water in oil, W/O), which compartmented aqueous phase for photocatalytic HER and oil phase for hydrogenation. The hydrophobic MOF and hydrophilic CdS were isolated at the inner and outer layers of W/O emulsion, respectively. The molecularly regulated hydrophobicity of MOF controlled the water delivery onto CdS photocatalysts, which realized the synergistic regulation of HER and hydrogenation. In the photocatalytic hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, the highest yield of MOF&#8208;CdS Pickering emulsion reached 187.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, 30&#8197;times that of the counterpart without emulsion (6.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1). Its apparent quantum yield reached 43.24&#8201;% without co&#8208;catalysts. To our knowledge, this performance is at a top&#8208;level so far. Our work realized the precise regulation of water&#8208;oil interface to effectively couple two reactions in different phases, providing new perspective for challenging tandem catalysis.

         <title>Anomalous Role of Carbon in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface carbonaceous species can frustrate ethylene adsorption on catalyst surfaces by confinement effect, thus facilitating its desorption as opposed to overhydrogenation to form undesired ethane. This mechanism for selectivity control is analogous to enzyme catalysis, where the active centers selectively attract reactants and release products. Similar mechanism might be present in CO/CO2 hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Carbonaceous species, including subsurface carbidic carbon and surface carbon, play crucial roles in heterogeneous catalysis. Many reports suggested the importance of subsurface carbon in the selective hydrogenation of alkynes over Pd&#8208;based catalysts. However, the role of surface carbon has been largely overlooked. We demonstrate that subsurface carbon in Pd is not responsible for the selectivity in acetylene hydrogenation. In contrast, the structure of surface carbonaceous species plays a decisive role in hydrogenation selectivity. Electron microscopy and spectroscopy evidence, along with theoretical modelling, reveal that partial graphitization of surface carbonaceous species results in unique spatial confinement of surface reaction intermediates, thus altering the reaction energy landscape in favour of ethylene desorption as opposed to over&#8208;hydrogenation. This mechanism for selectivity control is analogous to enzyme catalysis, where the active centers selectively attract reactants and release products. Similar mechanism may be present in CO/CO2 hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Induced C&#8722;C Coupling for C2H4 Photosynthesis from Atmospheric&#8208;Concentration CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Loading highly active metal clusters on a semiconductor nanosheet can enable the introduced metal atom and the metal atom in substrate materials to construct the heteroatom pair sites. Having two different metal atoms on the interface as active sites may effectively accelerate C&#8722;C coupling to form C2H4 for CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
Producing ethylene (C2H4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) photoreduction under mild conditions is primarily restricted by the difficulty of C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we designed highly active metal atom clusters anchored on semiconductor nanosheets, which established heteroatom sites on the interface to steer C&#8722;C coupling, realizing air&#8208;concentration CO2 photoreduction into C2H4 in pure water. As an example, the Pd nanoclusters loaded on ZnO nanosheets are prepared, demonstrated by the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field image. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the C&#8722;C coupling step over the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets, while quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy illustrates the active sites of Pd and Zn atoms on the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets during CO2 photoreduction. Density functional theoretical calculations unveil the transition state energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling of CO* and COH* intermediates are only 0.998&#8197;eV, hinting the easy C&#8722;C coupling to produce C2 fuels. Therefore, the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets realize C2H4 photosynthesis by atmospheric&#8208;concentration CO2 reduction with the formation rate of 1.03&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, while the ZnO nanosheets only acquired the carbon monoxide product.

         <title>Conformationally Restricted Macrocycles as Improved FKBP51 Inhibitors Enabled by Systematic Linker Derivatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic linkerology: Linking two positions is the key step of macrocyclization, i.e. the transformation of &#8216;linear&#8217; protein ligands to macrocycles. Here we show that longer linkers can be remarkable flexible, with the same backbone giving rise to multiple series with distinct conformations and binding modes. Derivatization of these linkers is highly efficient to control conformations and to improve multiple drug&#8208;like properties in macrocycles.







Abstract
Macrocycles are increasingly considered as promising modalities to target challenging intracellular proteins. However, strategies for transitioning from active linear starting points to improved macrocycles are still underdeveloped. Here we explored the derivatization of linkers as an approach for macrocycle optimization. Using the FK506&#8208;binding protein 51 (FKBP51) as a model system we prepared &gt;140 macrocycles with systematically derivatized linkers. Two backbones were identified as promising frameworks for subsequent optimization. Surprisingly, co&#8208;crystal structure analyses revealed that these chemical templates represent an ensemble of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) conformations that can give rise to several distinct 3D&#8208;scaffolds. This resulted in a set of macrocycles with consistently improved affinity, plasma stability, and aqueous solubility compared to the linear precursors or the non&#8208;functionalized macrocycles. Our results highlight linkers as an opportunity for macrocyclic drug development, show how linker derivatization can improve the performance of macrocycles, and emphasizes the need to track macrocyclic scaffold evolution at a three&#8208;dimensional level.

         <title>Conformational Plasticity and Binding Affinity Enhancement Controlled by Linker Derivatization in Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>

A link to success: Nature repeatedly used highly functionalized macrocycles to create sophisticated bioactive small molecules. Non&#8208;peptidic macrocycles are also emerging as drug modalities to tackle challenging, intracellular drug targets but guidelines for their design are still premature. Here we show how subtle linker modifications in macrocycles can refine and improve their conformational plasticity and their properties simultaneously.







Abstract
Macrocycles are abundantly used by nature to enable cell&#8208;permeable bioactive molecules. Synthetic non&#8208;peptidic macrocycles are also increasingly considered as modalities for difficult&#8208;to&#8208;bind proteins but guidelines for macrocyclization are only beginning to emerge. Macrocycles are thought to constrain the available conformations but also to allow for residual flexibility, the latter being poorly understood. Here we show that even medium&#8208;sized macrocycles display an unexpected high conformational plasticity, even when bound to their protein target. Minor modification of the linker region of macrocycles can shift the conformational ensemble to distinct conformational subclasses, each constituting distinct three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds for further optimization. This led to several new ligands with improved affinity and beneficial physicochemical parameters for the FK506&#8208;binding protein&#8197;51, a promising target for depression, obesity and chronic pain. Importantly, none of the beneficial modifications could have been identified by classical medicinal chemistry as they only work in the macrocyclic context.
Our results show that macrocyclization can do more than keeping loose ends together but rather provide a platform for multiple series of macrocycles with distinct binding modes.

         <title>Unconventional Interconnected High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanodendrites for Remarkably Efficient C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage toward Complete Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional PtIrRhCoFeNiCu high&#8208;entropy alloy nanodendrites are successfully designed and show excellent ethanol oxidation activity, long&#8208;term stability, resistance to CO poisoning and efficient C1 pathway. The combined effect of intrinsically active Pt, Fe/Co/Ni/Cu in synergy for OHads formation, and Ir/Rh for C&#8722;C bond scission serves to favor C1 pathway over sluggish C2 pathway.







Abstract
Developing ethanol oxidation electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity, durability, and resistance to CO poisoning remains a major challenge. In recent years, high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with unique physical and chemical properties have garnered substantial attention. Herein, a class of HEA nanodendrites are designed by a simple wet&#8208;chemical method. The mass activity and specific activity of the septenary PtIrRhCoFeNiCu high&#8208;entropy alloy catalyst are 2.13&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1/1.05&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt+Ir+Rh&#8722;1 and 2.95&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which reach 5.76&#8208;/2.84&#8208;fold and 5.57&#8208;fold improvements relative to commercial Pt/C (0.37&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and 0.53&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), respectively. Remarkably, after the i&#8208;t test of up to 100,000&#8201;s and the accelerated durability test of 1500&#8197;cycles, 81.22&#8201;% and 68.54&#8201;% of the initial mass activity are well retained, respectively. The lattice distortion&#8208;associated local tensile strain as demonstrated by increased Pt&#8722;Pt bond length enhances ethanol adsorption and reduces reaction barriers. Moreover, hysteresis diffusion effect induced by lattice distortion in the HEA nanodendrites contributes to their superb ethanol oxidation stability. In situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the three HEA nanodendrites mainly follow C1 pathway with C&#8722;C bond breaking to form CO followed by CO oxidation especially at a wide range of high potentials. Theoretical calculations reveal that among these HEAs, PtIrRhCoFeNiCu possesses the lowest energy barrier for C&#8722;C bond scission due to synergy among Pt/Ir/Rh and water dissociation due to synergy among Co/Fe/Ni/Cu. This work provides insights to design unique HEA nanostructures with extraordinary catalytic performances and selectivity compared to conventional nanoparticles.

         <title>How Carbene Ligands Transform AuAg Alloy Nanoclusters for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we prepare an AuAg alloy nanocluster ligated by carbene, [Au13Ag12(PPh3)8(BMIm)2I8]SbF6, which is the first of its kind to show higher thermostability and higher sensitivity to light. It is attributed to a unique delocalization of electrons within the frontier orbitals. The Au13Ag12&#8201;:&#8201;BMIm anchored on NiFe&#8208;LDH exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the electrosynthesis of urea.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have attracted increasing interest for their special structures and diverse applications. However, developing synthetic strategies and extending the database of NHC&#8208;protected nanoclusters are still challenging tasks. In this work, a novel and rapid synthetic method is developed to prepare AuAg alloy nanocluster ligated by carbene based on the reactivity of nanoclusters. The rod&#8208;like carbene&#8208;capped bimetal nanocluster, [Au13Ag12(PPh3)8(BMIm)2I8]SbF6 (Au13Ag12&#8201;:&#8201;BMIm), was achieved and characterized by a series of techniques. The alloy nanocluster consists of two vertex&#8208;sharing icosahedrons and carbene ligands, phosphine ligands, and I atoms. Interestingly, the introduced carbene ligands show strong coordination capabilities with Au, enhancing the interaction between metal core and ligands. To the best of our knowledge, the carbene&#8208;capped Au13Ag12&#8201;:&#8201;BMIm nanocluster is the first of its kind to show higher thermostability and higher sensitivity to light compared with the homogeneously capped analogue nanocluster ([Au13Ag12(PPh3)10I8]SbF6). Density functional theory calculations attribute these properties to a unique delocalization of electrons within the frontier orbitals. Finally, the Au13Ag12&#8201;:&#8201;BMIm anchored on NiFe&#8208;LDH exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2, achieving a urea production rate of 29.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 34&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V (vs. RHE).

         <title>Polymer&#8208;MOF Network Enabling Ultrathin Coating for Post&#8208;Combustion Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a strategy to create CO2 highways by chemically linking UiO&#8208;66&#8208;MA to form MOF&#8208;polymer networks, enabling sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm thin layer coating with an MOF content of up to 40&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Theses MOFs help maintain high diffusivity selectivity at elevated temperatures, achieving a CO2 permeance of 2793 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 21.6 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and 83&#8201;% relative humidity with mixed gases.







Abstract
Permeance&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off and high temperature resilience are key challenges in development of membranes for post&#8208;combustion carbon capture. While mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) consisting of polymers and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer the potential to address the challenges, they are limited by the low loading of MOFs in the thin film layer. Herein, we propose an inverse synthesis strategy to form polymer&#8208;MOF networks by copolymerizing monomers with functionalized UiO&#8208;66 nanoparticles. This process yields a finely dispersed, easily processable solution, enabling defect&#8208;free, thin polymer&#8208;MOF coatings with up to 40&#8197;wt&#8201;% MOF loading within the polyethylene oxide&#8208;based polymers on polyacrylonitrile supports. The membrane with 40&#8197;wt&#8201;% MOF demonstrated a 212&#8201;% increment in CO2 permeance at 25&#8201;&#176;C and maintained a selectivity of 20 at 60&#8201;&#176;C, which is attributed to the stable diffusivity selectivity of MOFs at high temperature. Furthermore, the membrane was evaluated with mixed gas and 83&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) at 60&#8201;&#176;C, achieving a CO2 permeance up to 2793 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 21.6. This work offers insights into the design of practical mixed matrix membranes, which not only paves the way towards energy efficient carbon capture from flue gas, but also provides more possibilities for other applications.

Theses MOFs help maintain high diffusivity selectivity at elevated temperatures, achieving a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of 2793 GPU and a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 21.6 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and 83&#8201;% relative humidity with mixed gases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permeance-selectivity trade-off and high temperature resilience are key challenges in development of membranes for post-combustion carbon capture. While mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) consisting of polymers and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer the potential to address the challenges, they are limited by the low loading of MOFs in the thin film layer. Herein, we propose an inverse synthesis strategy to form polymer-MOF networks by copolymerizing monomers with functionalized UiO-66 nanoparticles. This process yields a finely dispersed, easily processable solution, enabling defect-free, thin polymer-MOF coatings with up to 40&#8197;wt&#8201;% MOF loading within the polyethylene oxide-based polymers on polyacrylonitrile supports. The membrane with 40&#8197;wt&#8201;% MOF demonstrated a 212&#8201;% increment in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance at 25&#8201;&#176;C and maintained a selectivity of 20 at 60&#8201;&#176;C, which is attributed to the stable diffusivity selectivity of MOFs at high temperature. Furthermore, the membrane was evaluated with mixed gas and 83&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) at 60&#8201;&#176;C, achieving a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance up to 2793 GPU and a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 21.6. This work offers insights into the design of practical mixed matrix membranes, which not only paves the way towards energy efficient carbon capture from flue gas, but also provides more possibilities for other applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radar&#8208;Terahertz&#8208;Infrared Compatible Stealth Coaxial Silver Nanowire@Carbon Nano&#8208;Cable Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elaborately designed silver nanowire@amorphous&#8208;graphitized carbon composite aerogel (AgNW@C) with regular coaxial nano&#8208;cable structure has been facilely fabricated, applying radar&#8208;terahertz&#8208;infrared multi&#8208;spectrum compatible stealth. This material system addresses the long&#8208;standing challenge in the field of material science, specifically the contradictory in materials properties for radar and infrared stealth. The AgNW@C aerogels offer practical solutions for enhancing the performance of electromagnetic protection, military camouflage materials and thermal management devices.







Abstract
Achieving multi&#8208;spectrum compatible stealth in radar&#8208;terahertz&#8208;infrared bands with robust performance has great prospects for both military and civilian applications. However, the progress of materials encounters substantial challenges due to the significant variability in frequency coupling properties across different electromagnetic wave bands. Here, this work presents the design of a multi&#8208;scale structure and fabricates a lightweight aerogel (silver nanowire@carbon, AgNW@C) consisting of a regular coaxial nano&#8208;cable, with silver nanowire as the core and amorphous&#8208;graphitized hybrid carbon as the outer&#8208;layer. The design utilizes the one&#8208;dimensional conductive network and electric coupling heterogeneous interface, the low infrared emission of silver nanowires, and the thermal insulation caused by three&#8208;dimensional pore structure found in aerogels. This conception achieves the long&#8208;standing goal of multi&#8208;spectrum compatible stealth in an integrated material. The AgNW@C aerogel exhibits an optimal reflection loss of &#8722;66.50&#8197;dB and an effective absorption bandwidth of 8.80&#8197;GHz in the gigahertz band, while an average total shielding performance of 71.92&#8197;dB and over 50.00&#8197;dB reflection loss in the terahertz band. Furthermore, the AgNW@C aerogel demonstrates remarkable thermal infrared stealth capabilities with a low infrared emissivity of 0.28 and thermal insulation up to 150&#8201;&#176;C under 200&#8201;&#176;C. These exceptional multispectral stealth properties allow the aerogel for potential applications in military camouflage technology and electromagnetic protection.

         <title>Precisely Tailoring the Second Coordination Sphere of a Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Halogenated Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co single&#8208;atom catalyst with an unsymmetric Co&#8208;N4P1 coordination configuration is developed by tailoring second coordination sphere. Due to the greatly improved H2 dissociation and product desorption, the catalyst exhibits superior activity, selectivity and stability for hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes to corresponding amines (20 examples, &gt;99&#8201;% yields) at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 0.5&#8197;MPa H2 pressure.







Abstract
The development of highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective nonprecious metal catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes is very appealing yet challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) can be tuned by tailoring the structure of second coordination sphere via P doping. As revealed by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations, such a P doping on N&#8208;coordinated Co SAC results in the unsymmetric Co&#8208;N4P1 coordination structure. With a combination of experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, we find that tailoring the second coordination sphere can greatly improve H2 dissociation and product desorption. As a result, the Co&#8208;N4P1 SAC exhibits superior activity, selectivity and stability for the hydrogenation of halogenated nitroarenes to corresponding amines (20 examples, &gt;99&#8201;% yields) at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 0.5&#8197;MPa H2 pressure, significantly outperforming most heterogeneous catalysts reported in the literature. We expect that this work opens a new avenue for the design of highly efficient nonprecious metal SACs for important hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Unsymmetric Protonation Driven Highly Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis in Supramolecular Photocatalysts via One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst (SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+) with an unsymmetric protonation structure significantly boosts H2O2 production from water and air. This design enhances charge separation and promotes dual active sites for Yeager&#8208;type O2 adsorption, enabling a selective one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron ORR pathway. SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ shows an H2O2 rate of 4666.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 100&#8201;% antibacterial efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production has emerged as an attractive alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. However, its performance is often hindered by low selectivity and sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report an anthrazoline&#8208;based supramolecular photocatalyst, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+, featuring an unsymmetric protonation structure for H2O2 photosynthesis from water and air. The introduction of unsymmetric protonation disrupts the initial mirror symmetry of SADF, significantly enhancing the molecular dipole and facilitating efficient charge separation and electron transfer. Additionally, this modification increases the hydrophilicity of SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+, enabling the interaction of water and dissolved oxygen with the catalytic sites. The altered electron density distribution creates numerous dual active sites for Yeager&#8208;type O2 adsorption, facilitating an efficient ORR towards H2O2 via a direct one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ achieves an outstanding photocatalytic H2O2 production at a rate of 4666.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, with a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) of 1.35&#8201;%, surpassing most organic photocatalytic systems. Furthermore, SA&#8208;SADF&#8208;H+ demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic antibacterial activity, achieving 100&#8201;% antibacterial efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus within 60&#8197;min.

         <title>Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Stereotactic Anchoring and Spatial Separation of Porphyrins for Amplified Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Pyroptosis and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

A dual&#8208;solvent strategy was employed to synthesize a porphyrin&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF) with novel crystal structure and unique morphology. The exquisite configuration ensured the orderly anchoring and precise spatial separation of porphyrin molecules, effectively circumventing the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect and suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions. This unique structural design endows Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF with excellent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capabilities, and under ultrasound activation, it can effectively induce tumor cell pyroptosis and activate immune responses.







Abstract
Ultrasound&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is pivotal in specifically inducing pyroptosis of tumor cells. However, the effectiveness of pyroptosis is generally hindered by the constraints of ROS generation efficiency. Herein, a new porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF) was rationally designed via an innovative dual&#8208;solvent strategy to amplify ROS generation for ultrasound&#8208;controlled pyroptosis. The crystal structure of Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF was elucidated by continuous rotation electron diffraction technique, revealing its regular and rigid conformation. The porphyrin molecules were precisely oriented and firmly confined within the scaffold, effectively restricting intramolecular motion. The ample distance of 6.8&#8197;&#197; between two porphyrin molecules, combined with the interaction region indicator visualization, confirmed the absence of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions in the Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF framework, thereby avoiding the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect. Furthermore, the permanent porosity and expansive surface area of Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF enhanced its interaction with oxygen. These ingenious structural features endowed Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF with a unique ability to generate a large amount of singlet oxygen under ultrasound activation. Meanwhile, the impetus of ultrasound also accelerated the rate of the Fenton reaction catalyzed by iron ions, significantly boosting the generation of hydroxyl radicals. Benefiting from the dual amplification of ROS, Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF could efficiently induce tumor cells pyroptosis under ultrasound stimulation, thereby intensifying the potency of cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;A dual-solvent strategy was employed to synthesize a porphyrin-based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (Fe(TCPP)-MOF) with novel crystal structure and unique morphology. The exquisite configuration ensured the orderly anchoring and precise spatial separation of porphyrin molecules, effectively circumventing the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect and suppressing non-radiative transitions. This unique structural design endows Fe(TCPP)-MOF with excellent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capabilities, and under ultrasound activation, it can effectively induce tumor cell pyroptosis and activate immune responses.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Benzylic C&#8722;H Radical Sulfation by Persulfates (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 10/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfation, spanning the fields of biology and chemistry, is still in its early stages compared to other important post&#8208;translational modifications. The lack of efficient synthetic methods for sulfation poses a significant obstacle to its application, which is both thermodynamically and kinetically challenging transformation. In their Communication (e202413847), Jiakun Li and co&#8208;workers leverage modular control over reactivity of persulfate and the stability of radical sulfate anion to achieve C&#8211;H sulfation via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (SH2) process.

Non&#8208;ionic designer aqueous micelles hold significant promise as versatile media, functioning as solvents, electrolytes, and reaction boosters in electrocatalysis. Their unique structures and properties enhance the efficiency of transition metal&#8208;free hydrodefluorination of geminal difluorinated indoles, thereby eliminating the need for toxic organic solvents and supporting electrolytes. This process sustainably and selectively removes a fluorine atom, producing valuable monofluorinated indoles, as reported by Sachin Handa et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202416132).

Macrocycles like the ones depicted in the rod&#8208;and&#8208;ball representation shown in the picture can enable powerful drugs but their exploration has been difficult. The build&#8208;&#8208;pair&#8208;&#8208;couple strategy reported by Felix Hausch et al. in their Research Article (e202418512) allows the rapid assembly of diversely decorated macrocycles, especially in the linker part (highlighted in orange).

Amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers with hydrophobic brush segments self&#8208;assemble into nanodiscs in water. Their size, pH&#8208;responsiveness, and drug loading capacity can be controlled. Different hydrolysis rates enable time&#8208;dependent degradation and drug release. In their Communication (e202424269), Markus M&#195;1/4llner et al. show how the functional nanodisc core can switch from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, allowing loaded cargo to be released.

         <title>Fighting Antimicrobial Resistance: Innovative Drugs in Antibacterial Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article provides an overview over antibacterial drugs investigated in the past three decades. Aspects of the compound's origins, their cellular targets, the antibacterial spectrum and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in animal studies are covered and current trends are highlighted.







Abstract
In the fight against bacterial infections, particularly those caused by multi&#8208;resistant pathogens known as &#8220;superbugs&#8221;, the need for new antibacterials is undoubted in scientific communities and is by now also widely perceived by the general population. However, the antibacterial research landscape has changed considerably over the past years. With few exceptions, the majority of big pharma companies has left the field and thus, the decline in R&amp;D on antibacterials severely impacts the drug pipeline. In recent years, antibacterial research has increasingly relied on smaller companies or academic research institutions, which mostly have only limited financial resources, to carry a drug discovery and development process from the beginning and through to the beginning of clinical phases. This review formulates the requirements for an antibacterial in regard of targeted pathogens, resistance mechanisms and drug discovery. Strategies are shown for the discovery of new antibacterial structures originating from natural sources, by chemical synthesis and more recently from artificial intelligence approaches. This is complemented by principles for the computer&#8208;aided design of antibacterials and the refinement of a lead structure. The second part of the article comprises a compilation of antibacterial molecules classified according to bacterial target structures, e.g. cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, as well as more recently emerging target classes, e.g. fatty acid synthesis, proteases and membrane proteins. Aspects of the origin, the antibacterial spectrum, resistance and the current development status of the presented drug molecules are highlighted.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable luminescent diradicals, each containing two unpaired electrons, exhibit highly sensitive spin states and luminescence under external stimuli such as temperature, magnetic fields and microwaves, setting them apart from traditional closed&#8208;shell luminophores and monoradicals. This minireview highlights recent advances in their design, synthesis, photophysical properties and potential applications, as well as challenges and future prospects.







Abstract
Stable luminescent diradicals, characterized by the presence of two unpaired electrons, exhibit unique photophysical properties that are sensitive to external stimuli such as temperature, magnetic fields, and microwaves. This sensitivity allows the manipulation of their spin states and luminescence, setting them apart from traditional closed&#8208;shell luminescent molecules and luminescent monoradicals. As a result, luminescent diradicals are emerging as promising candidates for a variety of applications. This minireview discusses recent advances in the design and synthesis of luminescent diradicals, explores their photophysical properties and potential applications. It also examines the challenges and prospects in the development of these materials, shedding light on their potential to drive technological innovation.

         <title>Kauzmann Paradox, Supercooling, and Finding Order in Chaos</title>

         <dc:description>
80&#8201;years later: Kauzmann temperature (Tk), and associated entropy catastrophe/paradox remains an enigma for nearly 80&#8197;years without any unifying resolution. Potential resolutions to the Kauzmann paradox, however, have so far been limited in the existence of an equilibrium ideal glass transition and traditional description of phase transition. Continued evolution of our understanding in thermodynamics, however, has revealed more knowledge on the subject matter, leading us closer to the resolution of this paradox. This review undergoes a historical perspective of the journey from Kauzmann's day until now.







Abstract
Prediction of a liquidus state with lower entropy than the corresponding solid at Kauzmann temperature (Tk), and associated entropy catastrophe/paradox, remains an enigma. Despite efforts to resolve this paradox for nearly 80&#8197;years, no unifying resolution has been reported. Potential resolutions to the Kauzmann paradox rely on an ideal glass transition, however, this limits the interpretation of Tk as an equilibrium critical point rather than an instability. Focusing on entropy, statistical mechanics and non&#8208;equilibrium dynamics becomes a key tenet in resolving this paradox. Expansion in phase space beyond 2D and consideration of Tk as a non&#8208;equilibrium critical point is necessary to understand the extent of liquid relaxation beyond Tk. In this review, we provide an entropic perspective of the relaxation behavior of supercooled liquids, associated expanded phase diagram, and the potential resolution to the Kauzmann paradox. This work integrates the historical evolution of our understanding of entropy/thermodynamics with modern interpretation of quantum states through renormalization group and thermodynamic speed limits.

         <title>Benzylic C&#8722;H Radical Sulfation by Persulfates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical sulfation with persulfates via C&#8722;O bond formation facilitates the introduction of sulfate functional groups onto readily&#8208;available C&#8722;H compounds. The modular control over reactivity of persulfate, along with the generation of radical sulfate anion, enables the radical C&#8722;O sulfation via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (SH2) process.







Abstract
Sulfation is a highly valuable pathological and physiological process, yet it is often underappreciated considering the rather difficult accessibility of organosulfates. O&#8208;sulfonation (O&#8722;SO3), a conventional and still common way to make organosulfates, restricts its applicability to hydroxyl compounds and therein lies a major challenge of library construction. Here, we describe a benzylic C&#8722;H radical sulfation with persulfates via C&#8722;O bond formation. This strategy leverages modular control over the reactivity of persulfates and the stability of sulfate radicals by coutercations. K+/NH4+ stabilized sulfate radicals act as the oxidant to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals from substrates, and activation of persulfates by n&#8208;NBu4+ provides O&#8722;O resource pool to facilitate C&#8722;OSO3&#8722; bond formation via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (SH2) process.

The modular control over reactivity of persulfate, along with the generation of radical sulfate anion, enables the radical C&#8722;O sulfation via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (S&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2) process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfation is a highly valuable pathological and physiological process, yet it is often underappreciated considering the rather difficult accessibility of organosulfates. &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfonation (&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), a conventional and still common way to make organosulfates, restricts its applicability to hydroxyl compounds and therein lies a major challenge of library construction. Here, we describe a benzylic C&#8722;H radical sulfation with persulfates via C&#8722;O bond formation. This strategy leverages modular control over the reactivity of persulfates and the stability of sulfate radicals by coutercations. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stabilized sulfate radicals act as the oxidant to generate carbon-centered radicals from substrates, and activation of persulfates by &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-NBu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; provides O&#8722;O resource pool to facilitate C&#8722;OSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; bond formation via a bimolecular homolytic substitution (S&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2) process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Discobahamin A and Putative Structure of Discobahamin B via an Isocyanide&#8208;based Macrocyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isocyanide&#8208;based macrocyclization, involving the formation of a C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) bond and the concurrent generation of an &#945;&#8208;acyloxy amide functional group, has been developed and successfully applied to the total synthesis of discobahamin A, a 24&#8208;membered macrocyclopeptide.







Abstract
We report in this paper the first total synthesis of discobahamin A, a 24&#8208;membered macrocyclopeptide containing an &#945;&#8208;keto amide functional group. We assign the absolute configuration of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methylpentanoic acid (Hmp), the side chain capping the N&#8208;terminus of the macrocycle, as the (2S, 3S) stereoisomer. A novel macrocyclization strategy was developed, utilizing an intramolecular Passerini reaction between &#969;&#8208;isocyano aldehyde and acetic acid. Notably, this macrocyclization proceeds via C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) bond formation and de novo generation of an &#945;&#8208;keto amide functional group. Furthermore, we synthesized both the proposed structure of discobahamin B and its diastereomer. However, the spectroscopic data for these two compounds do not fully align with those reported for discobahamin B.

         <title>Cationic Polyhedral Chalcogenaboranes: Activation without breaking Wade's Rules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents the first cationic chalcogenaboranes having the same skeletal electron pair count as their neutral precursors but bearing a positive charge. This is in contrast with Wade's rules, which claim that a change in the shape or number of skeletal electron pairs is inevitable. The enhanced electrophilicity of these compounds is demonstrated by their reactivity with weak bases.







Abstract
Wade's rules are a well&#8208;established tool for the description of the geometry of inorganic clusters. Among others, they state that a decrease or increase in charge is always accompanied by a change in the number of skeletal electron pairs (SEPs). This work reports the synthesis of the first cationic chalcogenaboranes closo&#8208;[12&#8208;X&#8208;2&#8208;IPr&#8208;1&#8208;EB11H10]BF4 (IPr=1,3&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; X=H, I; E=S, Se 3&#8201;a/b, 4&#8201;a/b) featuring the same SEP count as their neutral precursors, EB11H11, but bearing a positive charge. This ionisation significantly enhances the activity towards the electrophiles. It unlocks reactivity with very weak bases and offers the control of the regioselectivity towards hard/soft bases by the modulation of LUMO. The localisation of the positive charge within the borane cluster has been confirmed experimentally, spectroscopically and theoretically.

         <title>Room Temperature Ethene to Propene (ETP) Tandem Catalysis using Single Crystalline Solid&#8208;State Molecular Pre&#8208;Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular, molecular, in crystallo tandem catalysis approach, that sequentially combines three crystalline organometallic catalysts, delivers ethene to propene (ETP) by a combination of ethene dimerization, butenes isomerization and cross&#8208;metathesis under flow rector conditions at ambient temperature and low pressure.







Abstract
A tandem catalytic ensemble of solid&#8208;state molecular organometallic (SMOM) crystalline pre&#8208;catalysts are deployed under batch or flow conditions for the ethene to propene process (ETP). These catalysts operate at ambient temperature and low pressure, via sequential ethene dimerization, butenes isomerization and cross&#8208;metathesis. Under flow conditions the on&#8208;stream ethene conversion (55&#8201;%), initial propene selectivity (92&#8201;%), stability (71&#8201;% selectivity after 7&#8197;h) and low temperature/pressures are competitive with the best&#8208;in&#8208;class heterogeneous systems, marking a new, in crystallo, approach to ETP.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Free Synthesis of High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Y with Aluminophosphate as the Aluminum Carrier</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum Carrier for High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Synthesis. Inspired by the kinetical&#8208;controlled drug delivery, a unique approach based on the controlled aluminum&#8208;incorporation mechanism is proposed to synthesize the most siliceous zeolite Y under organic&#8208;free condition. The introduction of aluminophosphate as Al carrier regulates crystallization kinetics of zeolite Y, which exhibits an improved hydrothermal stability and catalytic performance in benchmark reaction.







Abstract
The wide application of zeolite Y in petrochemical industry is well&#8208;known as one of the milestones in zeolite chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. However, the traditional organic&#8208;free synthesis typically produces (hydro)thermally unstable zeolite Y with Si/Al atomic ratio (SAR) less than 2.5. Inspired by drug delivery process in which active components are kinetically controlled released, we develop a unique approach based on the pre&#8208;synthesized aluminum carrier to prepare one of the most siliceous zeolite Y with SAR up to 3.44 without using organics. The crystalline or amorphous aluminophosphates serve as the ideal carrier for the controlled incorporation of Al into zeolite framework during zeolite Y crystallization. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the partial introduction of aluminophosphate as Al source would rationally regulate the crystallization kinetics, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;silica zeolite Y with random Al distribution. This approach enhances the hydrothermal stability and catalytic performance of zeolite Y in benchmark reaction.

         <title>Enantioselective Borylcupration/Cyclization of Alkene&#8208;Tethered Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric synthesis of boryl&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;pyrrolines is reported. A range of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters are compatible in the reaction and the borylated products are shown to be used in the synthesis of novel prolinol derivatives through a directed reduction of the cyclic imines. Experimental and computational investigations reveal that the reaction likely proceeds via a stereoretentive cyclization of the benzylic copper intermediates.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of borylated 1&#8208;pyrrolines from &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters is reported. Twenty&#8208;four novel 1&#8208;pyrroline derivatives are reported in yields ranging from 26% to 96% and enantioselectivities from 74.5:25.5 er to 99:1 er. Examples derived from &#945;&#8208;unsubstituted, non&#8208;fluorinated oxime esters are reported. The hydroxyl group following oxidation of the Bpin moiety acts as a directing group in highly diastereoselective reductions of the pyrrolines to the corresponding prolinol derivatives. Additionally, the Bpin group can be retained in the products following a simplified, chromatography&#8208;free workup procedure. DFT supports a reaction mechanism which proceeds through the formation of an (R)&#8208;benzylic copper intermediate, followed by stereoretentive cyclization with respect to the configuration at the metalated carbon. The conclusions of the computational data are corroborated through control experiments and deuterium&#8208;labelling studies.

         <title>Access to Quaternary&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutylsilanes by Ring Opening of Arylbicyclobutanes with Silyllithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the silyllithium&#8208;mediated generation and in&#8208;situ cleavage of quaternary&#8208;substituted bicyclobutanes to diastereoselectively afford cyclobutylsilanes. Formally, this reaction is a nucleophilic substitution at a tertiary or quaternary carbon atom with a carbon leaving group. The utility of the generated products was demonstrated by a Tamao&#8722;Fleming oxidation to prepare a substituted cyclobutanol.







Abstract
Disclosed herein is the reaction of silyllithium reagents with quaternary&#8208;substituted arylbicyclobutanes to diastereoselectively form polysubstituted cyclobutylsilanes by C&#8722;C bond cleavage. The bicyclobutanes are generated in&#8197;situ, by lithium&#8208;halogen exchange, from readily accessible (bromomethyl)iodocyclopropane precursors, rendering this a one&#8208;pot transformation. The trapping of a generated cyclobutyllithium intermediate with an electrophile was also demonstrated, providing a cyclobutane product with vicinal quaternary stereocenters. The utility of the cyclobutylsilane products was showcased by Tamao&#8722;Fleming oxidation to prepare a quaternary&#8208;substituted cyclobutanol.

         <title>Radical Homopolymerization of Arylsulfonylated &#945;&#8208;Olefins to Synthesize Polysulfones &#8211; a &#8220;SO2&#8208;free&#8221; Approach</title>

Insert text for Table of Contents here: Radical homopolymerization of sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;olefins has been developed. The success of this polymerization relies on the high efficiency of aryl migration. This &#8220;SO2&#8208;free&#8221; approach enables us to synthesize ABC sequenced regulated polysulfones.







Abstract
Traditionally, &#945;&#8208;olefins have been regarded as non&#8208;homopolymerizable substrates in textbook examples. However, they have the ability to copolymerize with sulfur dioxide, leading to the creation of alternating copolymers. These commodity poly(olefin sulfone)s exhibit a wide array of applications. Nevertheless, the synthesis process involving sulfur dioxide pose considerable hazards and practical difficulties. In this study, we report on the &#8220;SO2&#8208;free&#8221; radical homopolymerization of sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;olefin monomers, resulting in the production of ABC sequence&#8208;controlled poly(vinylbenzothiazole&#8208;olefin&#8208;sulfone)s. This unique radical polymerization process is enhanced by 1,4/1,5&#8208;aryl migration, facilitated by the sulfonyl radicals involved in propagation. This demonstrated aryl group migration radical polymerization opens up new possibilities for synthesizing polysulfones with unprecedented main chain sequences and structures, which hold great promise as candidates for innovative polymeric materials.

         <title>Ph3PC &#8211; A Monosubstituted C(0) Atom in Its Triplet State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to divalent C(0) compounds, such as carbodiphosphoranes, monovalent C(0) compounds are largely underrepresented in chemistry. Now the first monovalent C(0) compound, Ph3P&#8594;C, has been characterized, in which triphenylphosphine forms a bond to a carbon atom in its electronic 3P ground state. Owing to its diradical nature, EPR and ENDOR studies clearly confirm this assignment with support from quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel class of carbon&#8208;centered diradicals: a monosubstituted C atom stabilized by a phosphine. The diradical Ph3P&#8594;C was photochemically generated from a diazophosphorus ylide precursor (Ph3PCN2) and characterized by EPR and isotope&#8208;sensitive ENDOR spectroscopy at low temperatures. Ph3P&#8594;C features an axial zero&#8208;field splitting parameter D=0.543&#8197;cm&#8722;1 with a vanishingly small rhombicity |E|/D=0.002. Time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent measurements confirm a triplet ground state with a lifetime of approximately 10&#8197;min at 127&#8197;K in toluene&#8208;d8. Multireference electronic structure calculations predict a clear triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet gap greater than 20&#8197;kcal/mol. In contrast to divalent C(0) compounds, such as Ph3P&#8594;C&#8592;PPh3, in which carbon needs excitation into a highly&#8208;excited closed&#8208;shell 2s02p4 configuration, Ph3P&#8594;C can be explained by direct involvement of carbon in its natural 3P state arising from the 2s22p2 configuration.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Amorphous 2D Polymer Nanodiscs with Tuneable Size, pH&#8208;Responsive Degradation and Controlled Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tadpole&#8208;like amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCs) with pH&#8208;responsive side chains are synthesized to prepare self&#8208;assembled nanodiscs, with sizes from 200&#8197;nm to over 1&#8197;&#956;m controlled by sidechain compositions. These nanodiscs enter cancer cells, degrade in acidic conditions, with different hydrolysis kinetics, enabling targeted drug release, demonstrating significant potential for therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCs) with tadpole&#8208;like, coil&#8208;rod architecture can be used to self&#8208;assemble into functional polymer nanodiscs directly in water. The hydrophobic segments of the BBC were tuned via the ratio of ethoxy&#8208;ethyl glycidyl ether (EE) to tetrahydropyranyl glycidyl ether (TP) within the grafted polymer sidechains. In turn, this variation controlled the sizes, pH&#8208;responsiveness, and drug loading capacity of the self&#8208;assembled nanodiscs. Notably, as EE exhibited faster hydrolysis than TP, the nanodiscs featured variable degradation rates under mild acidic conditions, aiding small molecule release and time&#8208;dependent and complete degradation of discs into fully water&#8208;soluble copolymers. The nanodiscs demonstrated biocompatibility and cellular uptake by breast cancer cells, underscoring their potential development into drug delivery systems.

&lt;p&gt;Amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCs) with tadpole-like, coil-rod architecture can be used to self-assemble into functional polymer nanodiscs directly in water. The hydrophobic segments of the BBC were tuned via the ratio of ethoxy-ethyl glycidyl ether (EE) to tetrahydropyranyl glycidyl ether (TP) within the grafted polymer sidechains. In turn, this variation controlled the sizes, pH-responsiveness, and drug loading capacity of the self-assembled nanodiscs. Notably, as EE exhibited faster hydrolysis than TP, the nanodiscs featured variable degradation rates under mild acidic conditions, aiding small molecule release and time-dependent and complete degradation of discs into fully water-soluble copolymers. The nanodiscs demonstrated biocompatibility and cellular uptake by breast cancer cells, underscoring their potential development into drug delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Axially Chiral TADF Imidazolium Salts for Circularly Polarized Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of chiral thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) imidazolium compounds are synthesized by attaching imidazolium hexafluorophosphate to an axially chiral TADF framework. The chiral imidazolium salts showed small &#916;EST, high PLQY, strong CPL and excellent redox properties. Moreover, circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (CP&#8208;LECs) prepared with this compound, without additional ionic liquids, exhibit CPEL signals with |gEL| of 3.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and EQEmax of 5.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
A pair of axially chiral thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) enantiomers, R&#8208;TCBN&#8208;ImEtPF6 and S&#8208;TCBN&#8208;ImEtPF6, with intrinsic ionic characteristics were efficiently synthesized by introducing imidazolium hexafluorophosphate to chiral TADF unit. The TADF imidazolium salts exhibited a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 92&#8201;%, a small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#9653;EST) of 0.04&#8197;eV, as well as reversible redox properties. Furthermore, the enantiomers showed distinct mirror&#8208;image CD and CPL activities with glum values of &#8722;3.7&#215;10&#8722;3 and +3.4&#215;10&#8722;3. Notably, by doping the axial TADF imidazolium salts into achiral TADF sensitizer, sandwich&#8208;structured light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) without the addition of ionic liquids (ILs) or ionic transition&#8208;metal compounds (iTMCs) were fabricated. When driven at 50&#8197;A m&#8722;2, the LECs displayed an EQE of up to 5.2&#8201;% and strong circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with gEL values of +3.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. This represents the first CP&#8208;LEC based on TADF materials and offers a promising strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance CPEL devices.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonance 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;Heteroarene for Filterless Narrowband Photodetector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;heteroarene has been employed for narrowband photodetectors with a phototransistor configuration for the first time by anchoring narrowband&#8208;absorption MR molecules onto a high&#8208;mobility indium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IZO) semiconductor. Such a device enables excellent photodetection performance and a record&#8208;small detecting full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 33&#8197;nm among intrinsic narrowband absorbing materials.







Abstract
As an emerging class of optoelectronic materials, multi&#8208;resonance (MR) 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;heteroarenes have been extensively employed as narrowband electroluminescence materials, whereas their absorption feature has largely been neglected. Here we construct the first MR&#8208;molecule&#8208;based phototransistor for filterless narrowband photodetectors (NBPDs) by anchoring narrowband absorption MR molecules on a high&#8208;mobility semiconductor indium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IZO) film. The resulting device exhibits high&#8208;performance photodetection with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 33&#8197;nm, which represents a new record for NBPDs based on intrinsic narrowband absorbing materials. These results demonstrate the great potential of MR materials as a new molecular platform for developing high&#8208;performance NBPDs.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Enhanced Spleen&#8208;Targeted mRNA Delivery via Fluorinated PEGylated Lipid Nanoparticles for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 10, March 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel approach combining fluorinated PEG lipids and ultrasound to enhance spleen&#8208;targeted mRNA delivery. Ultrasound&#8208;induced rapid PEG lipid shedding promotes membrane fusion and efficient mRNA translation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells, significantly improving organ&#8208;specific delivery and transfection. This strategy holds great promise for advancing mRNA&#8208;based immunotherapy.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) based messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics hold immense promise for treating a wide array of diseases, while their nonhepatic organs targeting and insufficient endosomal escape efficiency remain challenges. For LNPs, polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids have a crucial role in stabilizing them in aqueous medium, but they severely hinder cellular uptake and reduce transfection efficiency. In this study, we designed ultrasound (US)&#8208;assisted fluorinated PEGylated LNPs (F&#8208;LNPs) to enhance spleen&#8208;targeted mRNA delivery and transfection. Through liquid&#8208;to&#8208;gas phase transition, we enabled the controlled shedding of fluorinated PEG lipids from F&#8208;LNPs, facilitating cellular uptake, membrane fusion, and mRNA release. In vivo results demonstrated that US&#8208;assisted F&#8208;LNPs increased mRNA transfection approximately 4.0&#8208;fold in the spleen following intravenous administration. Notably, the F&#8208;LNPs achieved effective mRNA delivery to antigen&#8208;presenting cell subsets, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. The targeted delivery of full&#8208;length ovalbumin&#8208;encoding mRNA vaccine induced significant CD8+ T cell response and exhibited excellent therapeutic effect against the ovalbumin&#8208;transduced B16F10 tumor model. These findings establish a novel strategy for spleen&#8208;specific mRNA delivery through the combination of fluorinated PEG lipids and US treatment, which holds substantial promise for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy, potentially broadening the scope of clinical applications for mRNA&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Selective Gold Recycling from Electronic Waste Using a Highly Stable Porous Aromatic Framework/Polymer and Its Application for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous aromatic framework/polymer composite, PAF&#8208;147/polydopamine (PDA), is constructed via a mild in situ polymerization method for rapid and selective gold recovery from electronic waste leachate. Leveraging the redox adsorption mechanism and the unique microenvironment of PAF&#8208;147/PDA, the adsorbent post&#8208;adsorption is directly applicable for highly efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Recycling gold from electronic waste represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly strategy for both resource recovery and waste reduction. In this study, we designed an innovative and highly stable porous aromatic framework (PAF)/polymer composite, PAF&#8208;147/polydopamine (PDA), as an efficient adsorbent for selective gold recovery for the first time. The maximum gold adsorption capacity of PAF&#8208;147/PDA reached 1700&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, it could rapidly extract over 95&#8201;% of gold from solutions in a pH range of 0&#8211;10 within just 2&#8197;minutes. Importantly, as a real application demonstration, the PAF&#8208;147/PDA composite selectively recovered 99&#8201;% of gold from the leachate of discarded central processing units. When the recovered Au&#8208;containing composite was applied to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, the Faradaic efficiency for CO production exceeded 95&#8201;% across acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, outperforming most reported gold&#8208;based catalysts due to the cooperation effect of the composite and Au. This work opens a new way for the combination of selective gold recovery from electronic waste with highly efficient CO2 conversion.
