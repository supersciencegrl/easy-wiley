         <title>Unveiling the High&#8208;valence Oxygen Degradation Across the Delithiated Cathode Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge compensation on anionic redox reaction (ARR) has been promising to realize extra capacity beyond transition metal redox in battery cathodes. The practical development of ARR capacity has been hindered by high&#8208;valence oxygen instability, particularly at cathode surfaces. However, the direct probe of surface oxygen behavior has been challenging. Here, the electronic states of surface oxygen are investigated by combining mapping of resonant Auger electronic spectroscopy (mRAS) and ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) on a model LiCoO2 cathode. The mRAS verified that no high&#8208;valence oxygen can sustain at cathode surfaces, while APXPS proves that cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer evolves and oxidizes upon oxygen gas contact. This work provides valuable insights into the high&#8208;valence oxygen degradation mode across the interface. Oxygen stabilization from surface architecture is proven a prerequisite to the practical development of ARR active cathodes.</dc:description>

A type&#8197;II photoresponsive porous ionic liquid (PPIL) with permanent cavities is formed by dissolving Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) in bulky ionic liquid .The MOP carries azobenzene moieties as pendant groups which undergo trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;isomerization under visible and UV light irradiation and thus, a controlled CO2 uptake and release is realized.







Abstract
A porous liquid is a unique liquid medium that combines the cavity of porous solids with the fluidity of liquids. This special characteristic offers potential in various applications. Here we report a type&#8197;II photoresponsive porous ionic liquid (PPIL) from dissolving a photoresponsive metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (PMOP, constructed from dicopper and azobenzene&#8208;containing carboxylate) in a polyethylene&#8208;glycol&#8208;functionalized bulky ionic liquid (IL). Owing to favorable ion interactions, bulky IL molecules encircle outside PMOP, and the inter cavities are maintained. The azobenzene moieties can be isomerized freely in the PPILs to expose and shelter active sites upon visible and UV light irradiation. Hence, the adsorption capacity of PPILs is controllable by light irradiation, and the change in CO2 uptake is up to 30&#8201;% compared to neat IL. This study may inspire the development of new adsorption process regulated by light instead of pressure and temperature swing adsorption.

         <title>Nanoporous Single&#8208;Crystalline Oxide Catalysts for Preferential Oxidation of CO in H2 with an Ultra&#8208;wide Temperature Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we fabricate porous single&#8208;crystalline oxide monoliths with deposited Pt clusters to create interfacial system for efficient and durable preferential oxidation of CO in H2 with ultra&#8208;wide temperature window.







Abstract
Preferential oxidation of CO in H2 (PROX) reaction is a promising solution to the on&#8208;board purification of CO&#8208;contaminated H2 fuel for use in next&#8208;generation proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). However, achieving high CO selectivity, activity and structural stability across the wide temperature window remains a great challenge. Herein, we fabricate centimeter scale interfacial PROX catalysts grown from nanoporous single&#8208;crystalline Pr2O3 and Nd2O3 monoliths with lattice surface&#8208;deposited Pt clusters at nanoscale. We demonstrate complete and selective removal of CO in H2 over an unprecedented wide temperature window (253&#8211;403&#8197;K). The monoliths are integrated with an operational PEMFC to purify the H2 fuel contaminated with CO (30&#8197;ppm) and enable stable power output for &gt;400&#8197;h; over two thousand times longer than without. This work demonstrates that the nanoporous single&#8208;crystalline oxide monoliths can simultaneously achieve the stability and overall performance required to realize practically useful PEMFCs.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Controlled Substrate Engineering Strategy for Site&#8208;Specific Enzymatic Fucosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A galactose oxidase&#8208;mediated redox system was coupled with enzymatic modular assembly strategy to control the site&#8208;selectivity of &#945;1,3&#8208;fucosylation. This redox&#8208;controlled site&#8208;specific fucosylation strategy provides a general and operational simple approach for the precisely enzymatic synthesis of various complex fucosylated oligo&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (oligo&#8208;LacNAc) containing O&#8208; and N&#8208;glycans with defined fucosylation patterns.







Abstract
Fucosylation is one of the most common modifications of oligo&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (oligo&#8208;LacNAc) glycans. However, none of known fucosyltransferases (FucTs) could install the &#945;1,3&#8208;linked fucose to the oligo&#8208;LacNAc substrates in a site&#8208;specific manner. Here, we report a facile and general redox&#8208;controlled substrate engineering strategy for the site&#8208;specific &#945;1,3&#8208;fucosylation of complex glycans containing multiple LacNAc units. This strategy takes advantage of an operationally simple oxidation enzyme module by using galactose oxidase (GOase) to convert the LacNAc unit into oxidized C6&#8242;&#8208;aldehyde LacNAc sequence, which is not a good substrate for recombinant &#945;1,3&#8208;FucT from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695 (Hp&#945;1,3FucT), enabling the site&#8208;specific &#945;1,3&#8208;fucosylation at intact LacNAc sites. The general applicability and robustness of this strategy were demonstrated by the synthesis of a variety of structurally well&#8208;defined fucosides of linear and branched O&#8208; and N&#8208;linked glycans.

         <title>Light, Heat and Electricity Integrated Energy Conversion System: Photothermal&#8208;Assisted Co&#8208;Electrolysis of CO2 and Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>

A kind of bifunctional viologen&#8208;containing covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal&#8208;assisted co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and methanol. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF that enhance the photothermal effect to accelerate faster charge&#8208;transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products.







Abstract
Strategy that can design powerful photothermal&#8208;catalysts to achieve photothermal&#8208;effect assisted coupling&#8208;catalysis is much desired for the improvement of energy conversion efficiency and redox product value in CO2 electroreduction system. Herein, a kind of bifunctional viologen&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF) has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal&#8208;assisted co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and methanol. Specifically, the FECO (cathode) and FEHCOOH (anode) for Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF can reach up to &#8776;100&#8201;% at 1.9&#8197;V with &#8776;31.5&#8201;% saved overall electricity&#8208;consumption when the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is replaced by methanol oxidation. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni&#8208;2CBpy2+&#8208;COF that enhance the photothermal effect (&#916;T=49.1&#8201;&#176;C) to accelerate faster charge transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products as revealed by DFT calculations and characterizations.

&lt;p&gt;A kind of bifunctional viologen-containing covalent-organic-framework has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal-assisted co-electrolysis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and methanol. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni-2CBpy&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-COF that enhance the photothermal effect to accelerate faster charge-transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategy that can design powerful photothermal-catalysts to achieve photothermal-effect assisted coupling-catalysis is much desired for the improvement of energy conversion efficiency and redox product value in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction system. Herein, a kind of bifunctional viologen-containing covalent organic framework (Ni-2CBpy&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-COF) has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal-assisted co-electrolysis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and methanol. Specifically, the FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; (cathode) and FE&lt;sub&gt;HCOOH&lt;/sub&gt; (anode) for Ni-2CBpy&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-COF can reach up to &#8776;100&#8201;% at 1.9&#8197;V with &#8776;31.5&#8201;% saved overall electricity-consumption when the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is replaced by methanol oxidation. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni-2CBpy&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-COF that enhance the photothermal effect (&#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;=49.1&#8201;&#176;C) to accelerate faster charge transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products as revealed by DFT calculations and characterizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Nanoradiosensitizers Enhance Radiotherapy by Combining ROS Generation and CO Gas Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional X&#8208;ray reactor, ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem, was developed to enhance radiotherapy by combining ROS generation and CO gas release. The well&#8208;designed nanostructures can increase the direct absorption of radiation doses (primary radiation) and promote the deposition of photons and electrons (secondary radiation). Furthermore, the coating of the targeting cell membrane improved this radiosensitizer with a certain degree of targeting and biocompatibility.







Abstract
A lack of targeting accuracy and radiosensitivity severely limits clinical radiotherapy. In this study, we developed a radiosensitizer comprised of Ru&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic nanostructures (ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem) to optimize irradiation by maximizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and CO release in X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced dynamic therapy (XDT). The well&#8208;designed nanostructures increase the direct absorption of radiation doses (primary radiation) and promote the deposition of photons and electrons (secondary radiation). The secondary electrons were trapped and transferred in the constrained MONs where they induce a cascade of reactions to increase the therapeutic efficiency. Meanwhile, the full&#8208;length antiglypican 3 (GPC3) antibody (hGC33) expressed a cell membrane coating enabling active targeting of tumor sites with optimized biocompatibility. The ZrRuMn&#8208;MONs@mem represents a starting point for advancing an all&#8208;around radiosensitizer that operates efficiently in clinical XDT.

         <title>Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction through Spontaneous Charge Separation in End&#8208;Capping Assembly of Heterostructured Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient end&#8208;capping strategy is developed to construct intramolecular heterostructures by incorporating polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs). Thanks to the photoinduced spontaneous charge separation between COFs and PAHs, the heterostructured COFs exhibit outstanding activity and selectivity for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
It is well known that charge separation is crucial for efficient photocatalytic solar conversion. Although some covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit visible&#8208;light harvest, the large exciton binding energies reduce their photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, we developed a novel method to post&#8208;treat the olefin&#8208;linked COFs with end&#8208;capping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for spontaneous charge separation. Interestingly, a type&#8208;II heterostructure is constructed in our perylene&#8208;modified COFs which displays drastically enhanced performance for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, with an efficiency of 8&#8208;fold higher than that of unmodified COF. A combination of electrochemical, steady&#8208;state, and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic measurements indicates that such drastically enhanced performance should be attributed to photoinduced spontaneous charge separation in the heterostructure. These results illustrate the feasibility of engineering the charge&#8208;separation properties of crystalline porous frameworks at a molecular level for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Wide Band&#8208;Gap Polymer Donors Functionalized with Unconventional Carbamate Side Chains for Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique conformation lock is formed in a polymer donor using an unconventional carbamate side chain. It gives wide band&#8208;gap polymer donors for application in organic solar cells. Devices incorporating these donors yield power conversion efficiencies up to 18.76&#8201;%.







Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering with heteroatoms is not only effective in tuning frontier molecular orbitals, but also possible for forming secondary bonds which can be utilized to planarize the molecular backbone, hence, improving the photon absorption as well as charge&#8208;transport abilities of polymer solar&#8208;cell (PSC) materials. Herein, two types of unconventional side chains, namely carboxylate and carbamate, containing various heteroatoms are introduced to the thiophene bridges in high performance benzodithiophene (BDT) based donor polymers to from the novel polymers PTzTz&#8208;C and PTzTz&#8208;N, respectively. In these polymers, non&#8208;covalent O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S and N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions induce a high tendency to aggregation. In a ternary&#8208;blend PSC with PTzTz&#8208;N added to the high&#8208;performance D18&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, complimentary absorption and improved thin&#8208;film morphology were observed with a top power conversion efficiency of 18.76&#8201;%, which is an improvement of almost 5&#8201;% over the D18&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 binary blends.

         <title>In Vivo Nitroreductase Imaging via Fluorescence and Chemical Shift Dependent 19F NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a bimodal probe to detect hypoxic tumors by both fluorescence and chemical shift dependent 19F NMR imaging under the catalysis of nitroreductase. Specifically, the concentration of nitroreductase can be detected in a broad range by fluorescence and 19F NMR, which is &#8804;1.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 and 10&#8211;50&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Nitroreductase (NTR) is an important biomarker widely used to evaluate the degree of tumor hypoxia. Although a few optical methods have been reported for detecting nitroreductase at low concentration ranges, an effective strategy for nitroreductase monitoring in vivo without limits to the imaging depth is still lacking. Herein, a novel dual&#8208;mode NIR fluorescence and 19F MRI agent, FCy7&#8208;NO2, is proposed for imaging tumor hypoxia. We show that FCy7&#8208;NO2 serves as not only a rapid NIR fluorescence enhanced probe for monitoring and bioimaging of nitroreductase in tumors, but also a novel 19F MR chemical shift&#8208;sensitive contrast agent for selectively detecting nitroreductase catalyzed reduction. Notably, integrating two complementary imaging technologies into FCy7&#8208;NO2 enables sensitive detection of nitroreductase in a broad concentration range without tissue&#8208;depth limit. In general, this agent has a remarkable response to nitroreductase, which provides a promising method for understanding tumor evolution and its physiological role in the hypoxic microenvironment.

         <title>Unveiling the Protonation Kinetics&#8208;Dependent Selectivity in Nitrogen Electroreduction: Achieving 75.05&#8201;% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the key intermediates&#8242; behaviors on the catalyst&#8216;s surface through modifying the electronic interplay among active sites can realize the adjusting of protonation kinetics. This work unravels the crucial factors of protonation kinetics to obtain superior alkaline nitrogen electroreduction selectivity and describes the protonation kinetics&#8208;independent selectivity relation, giving a deep understanding of the complicated and elusive nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) mechanisms.







Abstract
While higher selectivity of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) to ammonia (NH3) is always achieved in alkali, the selectivity dependence on nitrogen (N2) protonation and mechanisms therein are unrevealed. Herein, we profile how the NRR selectivity theoretically relies upon the first protonation that is collectively regulated by proton (H) abundance and adsorption&#8208;desorption, along with intermediate&#8208;*NNH formation. By incorporating electronic metal modulators (M=Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) in nitrogenase&#8208;imitated model&#8208;iron polysulfide (FeSx), a series of FeMSx catalysts with tailorable protonation kinetics are obtained. The key intermediates behaviors traced by in situ FT&#8208;IR and Raman spectroscopy and operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrate the strong protonation kinetics&#8208;dependent selectivity that mathematically follows a log&#8208;linear Bradley curve. Strikingly, FeCuSx exhibits a record&#8208;high selectivity of 75.05&#8201;% at &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (vs. RHE) for NH3 production in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte.

         <title>Competitive Non&#8208;Radical Nucleophilic Attack Pathways for NH3 Oxidation and H2O Oxidation on Hematite Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 is found to be a highly effective and stable catalyst for driving photoelectrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction via a novel non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack mechanism under near&#8208;neutral pH. The selectivity of the ammonia oxidation reaction can be precisely tuned by manipulating the proportion of two surface species including Fe&#8722;O species and Fe&#8722;N species on &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3.







Abstract
The sluggish H2O oxidation kinetics on photoanodes severely obstructs the overall solar&#8208;to&#8208;energy efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. Herein, we find a 10 to 55&#8208;fold increase of photocurrent by conducting ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) on hematite (&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3) photoanodes under near&#8208;neutral pH (9&#8211;11) and moderate applied potentials (1.0&#8211;1.4&#8197;VRHE) compared to H2O oxidation. By rate law analysis and operando spectroscopic studies, we confirm the non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack of NH3 molecules on high&#8208;valent surface Fe&#8722;O species (e.g., FeIV=O) and Fe&#8722;N species that produces NOx&#8722; and N2, respectively, which overwhelms the nucleophilic attack of H2O on surface FeIV=O and contributes to a high Faradaic efficiency of above 80&#8201;% for AOR. This work reveals a novel non&#8208;radical nucleophilic attack strategy, which is significantly different from the conventional indirect radical&#8208;mediated AOR mechanism, for the rational design of high&#8208;performance AOR photoelectrocatalysts.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Programmed Separation of Hexane Isomers by a Porous Calcium Chloranilate Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel calcium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework shows temperature&#8208; and adsorbate&#8208;dependent adsorption of hexane isomers with different branching, leading to temperature&#8208;programmed separation of the isomers as a function of different degrees of branching.







Abstract
The full separation of alkane isomers as a function of different degrees of branching remains a daunting challenge due to its stringent requirement with respect to pore dimensions of the adsorbents. In this work, we report a novel microporous coordination network built on calcium (II) and chloranilate. The compound has a flexible framework and exhibits temperature&#8208;dependent adsorption behavior toward hexane isomers. At 30&#8201;&#176;C, it accommodates substantial amounts of linear and monobranched hexanes but fully excludes their dibranched isomer, and at elevated temperatures such as 150&#8201;&#176;C, it acts as a splitter for linear and branched alkanes. Its capability of efficient discrimination of hexane isomers as a function of branching is verified by experimental breakthrough measurements. Ab initio calculations have uncovered the underlying selective size&#8208;exclusion separation mechanism.

         <title>Host Spin&#8208;Crossover Thermodynamics Indicate Guest Fit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degree of fit between the binding partners within a host&#8211;guest complex is crucial for a highly selective interaction, yet difficult to separate from non&#8208;covalent interactions between the partners. The spin&#8208;crossover of a metallo&#8208;supramolecular host can be used to quantify guest fit, providing a new tool to describe host&#8211;guest binding that is complementary to binding constant determination.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) metal&#8208;organic cages capable of switching between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin states have the potential to be used as magnetic sensors and switches. Variation of the donor strength of heterocyclic aldehyde subcomponents in imine&#8208;based ligands can tune the ligand field for a FeII center, which results in both homoleptic and heteroleptic cages with diverse SCO behaviors. The tetrahedral SCO cage built from 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde is capable of encapsulating various guests, which stabilize different cage spin states depending on guest size. Conversely, the SCO tetrahedron exhibits different affinities for guests in different spin states, which is inferred to result from subtle structural differences of the cavity caused by the change in metal center spin state. Examination of SCO thermodynamics across a series of host&#8211;guest complexes enabled sensitive probing of guest fit to the host cavity, providing information complementary to binding&#8208;constant determination.

         <title>A Photoresponsive Battery Based on a Redox&#8208;Coupled Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Hybrid Photoelectrochemical Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>

A porous&#8208;shell/core hybrid (TN&#8208;COF@CNT) enables a long&#8208;range charge transfer relay and a high&#8208;rate dual&#8208;redox for the realization of efficient photo coupled ions transfer process. Equipped with such a photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery achieves reliable photoresponses, enhanced battery efficiency, stability and a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage efficiency of 1.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photoresponsive batteries promise flexible and low&#8208;cost solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage (SES), but suffer from a limited SES efficiency due to rapid charge recombination and sluggish redox. Here, we present a porous&#8208;shell/core hybrid of covalent organic framework@carbon nanotube. This hybrid ensures long&#8208;lived separated charges (&#964;ave=3.0&#8197;ns) by an electron transfer relay starting from the donor&#8208;acceptor molecules to the nanoscale heterojunction. These charges are further allowed to drive high&#8208;rate redox of &#8722;C=O/&#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722; and &#8722;C&#8722;N/&#8722;C=N+ with facile kinetics. Equipped with this photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery shows a 5&#8208;fold enhancement in SES efficiency (1.1&#8201;% at 1&#8197;sun) over their counterparts. It is unveiled that the electron relay favors the formation of electron&#8208;enriching &#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722; and hole&#8208;enriching &#8722;C=N+ groups responsible for photoelectrochemical Zn2+ and OTf&#8722; storage cascade; and further, the general photo coupled ions transfer (PCIT) process is proposed. This work presents an inspiring photoelectrochemical cathode design and theoretical insight for photoresponsive batteries.

     alt="A Photoresponsive Battery Based on a Redox-Coupled Covalent-Organic-Framework Hybrid Photoelectrochemical Cathode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A porous-shell/core hybrid (TN-COF@CNT) enables a long-range charge transfer relay and a high-rate dual-redox for the realization of efficient photo coupled ions transfer process. Equipped with such a photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery achieves reliable photoresponses, enhanced battery efficiency, stability and a remarkable solar-to-electrochemical energy storage efficiency of 1.1&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoresponsive batteries promise flexible and low-cost solar-to-electrochemical energy storage (SES), but suffer from a limited SES efficiency due to rapid charge recombination and sluggish redox. Here, we present a porous-shell/core hybrid of covalent organic framework@carbon nanotube. This hybrid ensures long-lived separated charges (&#964;&lt;sub&gt;ave&lt;/sub&gt;=3.0&#8197;ns) by an electron transfer relay starting from the donor-acceptor molecules to the nanoscale heterojunction. These charges are further allowed to drive high-rate redox of &#8722;C=O/&#8722;C&#8722;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8722;C&#8722;N/&#8722;C=N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with facile kinetics. Equipped with this photoelectrochemical cathode, a photoresponsive aqueous battery shows a 5-fold enhancement in SES efficiency (1.1&#8201;% at 1&#8197;sun) over their counterparts. It is unveiled that the electron relay favors the formation of electron-enriching &#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722; and hole-enriching &#8722;C=N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups responsible for photoelectrochemical Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and OTf&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; storage cascade; and further, the general photo coupled ions transfer (PCIT) process is proposed. This work presents an inspiring photoelectrochemical cathode design and theoretical insight for photoresponsive batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough and Recyclable Ionogels Constructed by Coordinated Supramolecular Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;tough and recyclable ionogels are constructed by physical cross&#8208;linking of coordinated supramolecular solvents and linear polymer segments. The solvents in ionogels function as 3D supramolecular networks, which provide strong mechanical support for ionogels.







Abstract
The mechanical properties of most hydrogels (ionogels) are considerably affected by covalently cross&#8208;linked networks. However, the interactions between solvent/solvent molecules and solvent/polymer chains are usually ignored. Herein, a series of ultra&#8208;tough ionogels were prepared via a supramolecular solvent, halometallate ionic liquid, in which cations and coordinating anions form a 3D supramolecular network. The linear polymer chains are physically cross&#8208;linked with supramolecular solvents synergistically enhancing the strength (14.3&#8197;MPa), toughness (78&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), and Young's modulus (55&#8197;MPa) of ionogels, effectively dispersing the stress concentration under load, and obtaining better fatigue resistance and higher fracture energy (198&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2). Furthermore, the reversible cross&#8208;linking enables green recovery and recycling of ionogels, simply by water. This strategy shows broad applicability based on a variety of supramolecular solvents and coordinatable polymers.

Immersion of porous phenolic pillar[5]arene crystals in liquid lactones induced ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;valerolactone and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone at room temperature. This is due to catalytic activity of the phenols via the hydrogen bonds and capture of linear polyesters by pillar[5]arene crystals. After the reaction, pillar[5]arene and polyesters formed pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxanes.







Abstract
Confined space provides a reaction platform with altered reaction rate and selectivity compared with a homogeneous solution. In this work, porous phenolic pillar[5]arene crystals were used as a reaction space to promote and perturb equilibrium between lactones and their corresponding polyesters. Immersion of porous pillar[5]arene crystals in liquid lactones induced ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;valerolactone and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone at room temperature because the phenolic hydroxy groups have catalytic activity via hydrogen bonds and the pillar[5]arene cavities prefer linear guests. After the reaction, pillar[5]arene and polyesters formed pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxanes.

         <title>Rational Design of Carbon Nitride Photoelectrodes with High Activity Toward Organic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;based photoelectrodes were produced by co&#8208;deposition of a blend of cyanamide&#8208;functionalized carbon nitride (NCNCNx) and indium tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticles on top of thin, alumina&#8208;coated conducting FTO&#8208;glass. The composite photoanodes display benchmark photocurrents with a range of different alcohol substrates, a low onset potential, and an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) up to 60&#8201;% at 350&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Carbon nitride (CNx) is a light&#8208;absorber with excellent performance in photocatalytic suspension systems, but the activity of CNx photoelectrodes has remained low. Here, cyanamide&#8208;functionalized CNx (NCNCNx) was co&#8208;deposited with ITO nanoparticles on a 1.8&#8197;&#197; thick alumina&#8208;coated FTO electrode. Transient absorption spectroscopy and impedance measurements support that ITO acts as a conductive binder and improves electron extraction from the NCNCNx, whilst the alumina underlayer reduces recombination losses between the ITO and the FTO glass. The Al2O3|ITO&#8201;:&#8201;NCNCNx film displays a benchmark performance for CNx&#8208;based photoanodes with an onset of &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and 1.4&#177;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs RHE during AM1.5G irradiation for the selective oxidation of 4&#8208;methylbenzyl alcohol. This assembly strategy will improve the exploration of CNx in fundamental and applied photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies.

         <title>Actinide Pnictinidene Chemistry: A Terminal Thorium Parent&#8208;Arsinidene Complex Stabilised by a Super&#8208;Bulky Triamidoamine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a new super&#8208;bulky triamidoamine ligand to actinide chemistry has enabled the previously elusive terminal parent thorium&#8208;arsinidene linkage, that is the first terminal thorium&#8208;arsinidene, to be synthesised and isolated. Quantum chemical calculations reveal a surprisingly large change to the Th=AsH linkage compared to an electrostatically&#8208;bound potassium&#8208;capped analogue.







Abstract
We report the direct synthesis of the terminal pnictidenes [An(TrenTCHS)(PnH)][M(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand)] (TrenTCHS={N(CH2CH2NSiCy3)3}3&#8722;; An/Pn/M=Th/P/Na 5, Th/As/K 6, U/P/Na 7, U/As/K 8) and their conversion to the pnictides [An(TrenTCHS)(PnH2)] (An/Pn=Th/P 9, Th/As 10, U/P 11, U/As 12). Use of the super&#8208;bulky TrenTCHS ligand was essential to accessing complete families, and 6 is an unprecedented example of a terminal thorium&#8208;arsinidene complex and only the second structurally authenticated parent terminal arsinidene complex of any metal. Comparison of the terminal Th=AsH unit of 6 to the bridging ThAs(H)K linkage in structurally analogous [Th(TrenTIPS){&#956;&#8208;As(H)K(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)}] (TrenTIPS={N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)3}3&#8722;) reveals a stronger Th&#8722;As bond in the former compared to the latter, and a large response overall to the nature of the Th=AsH bonding upon removal of the electrostatically&#8208;bound K&#8208;ion; the &#963;&#8208;bond changes little but the &#960;&#8208;bond is significantly perturbed.

&lt;p&gt;We report the direct synthesis of the terminal pnictidenes [An(Tren&lt;sup&gt;TCHS&lt;/sup&gt;)(PnH)][M(2,2,2-cryptand)] (Tren&lt;sup&gt;TCHS&lt;/sup&gt;={N(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NSiCy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;; An/Pn/M=Th/P/Na &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, Th/As/K &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, U/P/Na &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, U/As/K &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;) and their conversion to the pnictides [An(Tren&lt;sup&gt;TCHS&lt;/sup&gt;)(PnH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] (An/Pn=Th/P &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, Th/As &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;, U/P &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;, U/As &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;). Use of the super-bulky Tren&lt;sup&gt;TCHS&lt;/sup&gt; ligand was essential to accessing complete families, and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; is an unprecedented example of a terminal thorium-arsinidene complex and only the second structurally authenticated parent terminal arsinidene complex of any metal. Comparison of the terminal Th=AsH unit of &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; to the bridging ThAs(H)K linkage in structurally analogous [Th(Tren&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;){&#956;-As(H)K(15-crown-5)}] (Tren&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;={N(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NSiPr&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) reveals a stronger Th&#8722;As bond in the former compared to the latter, and a large response overall to the nature of the Th=AsH bonding upon removal of the electrostatically-bound K-ion; the &#963;-bond changes little but the &#960;-bond is significantly perturbed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Zr&#8208;Carbide promoted Methane Dry Reforming on NixZry: Graphitic deposits anti&#8208;segregate into Ni0 nanoparticles to provide restored CH4 adsorption sites and near&#8208;surface/dissolved C atoms, which migrate toward the Ni0/ZrO2 interface and induce local ZrxCy formation. The resulting oxygen&#8208;deficient carbidic phase boundary sites assist in kinetically enhanced CO2 activation toward CO(g).







Abstract
Graphitic deposits anti&#8208;segregate into Ni0 nanoparticles to provide restored CH4 adsorption sites and near&#8208;surface/dissolved C atoms, which migrate to the Ni0/ZrO2 interface and induce local ZrxCy formation. The resulting oxygen&#8208;deficient carbidic phase boundary sites assist in the kinetically enhanced CO2 activation toward CO(g). This interface carbide mechanism allows for enhanced spillover of carbon to the ZrO2 support, and represents an alternative catalyst regeneration pathway with respect to the reverse oxygen spillover on Ni&#8208;CeZrxOy catalysts. It is therefore rather likely on supports with limited oxygen storage/exchange kinetics but significant carbothermal reducibility.

         <title>A Sensitive and Nonoptical CRISPR Detection Mechanism by Sizing Double&#8208;Stranded &#955; DNA Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>

A DNA sizing&#8208;based biosensor utilizing the trans cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a against &#955; DNA is reported. The concept of target concentration dependent size reduction of &#955; DNA unlocks the possibility of using a variety of double&#8208;stranded DNA as nonoptical CRISPR reporters for developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care and easy&#8208;to&#8208;read nucleic acid detection biosensors.







Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;based biosensors often rely on colorimetric, fluorescent, or electrochemical signaling mechanism, which involves expensive reporters and/or sophisticated equipment. Here, we demonstrated a simple, inexpensive, nonoptical, and sensitive CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based sensing platform to detect ssDNA targets by sizing double&#8208;stranded &#955; DNA as novel report molecules. In this platform, the size reduction of &#955; DNA was quantified by gel electrophoresis analysis. We hypothesize that the massive trans&#8208;nuclease activity of Cas12a toward &#955; DNA is due to the presence of single&#8208;stranded looped structures along the &#955; DNA sequence. In addition, we observed a strong binding affinity between Cas12a and &#955; DNA, which further promotes the trans&#8208;cleavage activity and helps achieve sub&#8208;picomolar detection sensitivity, &#8776;100&#8197;times more sensitive than the fluorescent counterpart. The concept of utilizing the physical size change of &#955; DNA unlocks the possibility of using a variety of dsDNA as CRISPR reporters.

         <title>Electrifying Adipic Acid Production: Copper&#8208;Promoted Oxidation and C&#8722;C Cleavage of Cyclohexanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol into adipate was achieved by incorporating copper into a nickel hydroxide electrode. Cu2+ plays a key role in weakening the interaction between the surface&#8208;adsorbed O&#8208;centered radical and the NiOOH surface, thereby facilitating C&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract
Adipic acid is a central platform molecule for the polymer industry. Production of adipic acid with electroreforming technology is more sustainable compared to the thermochemical synthesis route. We discovered that incorporation of Cu2+ into a Ni hydroxide lattice significantly improved the electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol into adipate with a high yield (84&#8201;%) and selectivity (87&#8201;%). This Cu promotion effect serves as a mechanistic probe that can be combined with product analysis, steady&#8208;state kinetics, and in situ spectroscopy. A two&#8208;electron oxidation into cyclohexanone first occurs, followed by consecutive hydroxylation and C&#8722;C cleavage before dione formation. The central role of Cu2+ is to weaken the interaction between the NiOOH and surface&#8208;adsorbed O&#8208;centered radical that facilitates subsequent C&#8722;C cleavage. This enables a highly efficient two&#8208;electrode system capable of electroreforming KA oil into adipate and pure H2.

         <title>Photocatalytic Dissolution of Precious Metals by TiO2 through Photogenerated Free Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on experimental and theoretical results, this work explores the mechanism of photocatalytic precious metal dissolution. It is clear that photogenerated radicals and ligand molecules are key to precious metal dissolution, and the process has potential significance for enhancing photocatalytic selective recovery of precious metals.







Abstract
Exploring the pathways for photocatalytic dissolution of precious metals (PMs) is crucial for optimizing recovery. In this work, we systematically investigated the selectivity and solvation effects observed for dissolution by focusing on photocatalysis, precious metals and solvents. By combining transient characterization, reaction kinetics, and density functional theory, we determined that the radicals generated in photocatalysis were the key active species in the entire reaction. The cyano functional group in the solvent was the driving factor for dissolution of gold, and the importance of chlorine radicals for dissolution of platinum group precious metals was further confirmed. In addition, the catalytic properties of different precious metals can promote different transformations of functional groups, leading to selective dissolution. The structures of photocatalytic precious metal leaches also precisely explains the special coordination forms of precious metals and functional group ligands.

         <title>Unusual Scaffold Rearrangement in Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons Driven by Concerted Action of Single Gold Atoms on a Gold Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface synthesis of a polyaromatic hydrocarbon molecule is described. Mechanistically, the synthesis involves an unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage catalyzed by Au adatoms with a molecular scaffold rearrangement. This rearrangement in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular scaffold is possible because of the concerted action of two Au adatoms that catalyze the reaction on the gold surface.







Abstract
Chemical transformation of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules following different reaction strategies has always been the focus of organic synthesis. In this work, we report the synthesis of a PAH molecule, formation of which consists of an unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage accompanied by a complex &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular scaffold rearrangement. We demonstrate that the complex chemical transformation is steered by concerted motion of individual Au0 gold atoms on a supporting Au(111) surface. This observation underpins the importance of single&#8208;atom catalysis mediated by adatoms in on&#8208;surface synthesis as well as catalytic activity of single Au0 atoms facilitating cleavage of covalent carbon bonds.

         <title>Programmed Iteration Controls the Assembly of the Nonanoic Acid Side Chain of the Antibiotic Mupirocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic in which the polyketide fragment, monic acid, is esterified to a 9&#8208;hydroxynonanoic acid (9HN) side chain, which is essential for biological activity. NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, chemical probes and in vitro assays were used to establish how 9HN is assembled through the action of multiple acyl carrier proteins, two ketosynthases and fatty acid &#946;&#8208;keto processing enzymes.







Abstract
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586 that is assembled by a complex trans&#8208;AT polyketide synthase. The polyketide fragment, monic acid, is esterified by a 9&#8208;hydroxynonanoic acid (9HN) side chain which is essential for biological activity. The ester side chain assembly is initialised from a 3&#8208;hydroxypropionate (3HP) starter unit attached to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) MacpD, but the fate of this species is unknown. Herein we report the application of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, chemical probes and in vitro assays to establish the remaining steps of 9HN biosynthesis. These investigations reveal a complex interplay between a novel iterative or &#8220;stuttering&#8221; KS&#8208;AT didomain (MmpF), the multidomain module MmpB and multiple ACPs. This work has important implications for understanding the late&#8208;stage biosynthetic steps of mupirocin and will be important for future engineering of related trans&#8208;AT biosynthetic pathways (e.g. thiomarinol).

         <title>A Vitamin B2&#8208;Photocatalysed Approach to Methionine Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite their emerging role in medicinal and biological chemistry, synthetic methods to access non&#8208;natural methionine analogues remain underdeveloped. Using vitamin B2&#8208;photocatalysis, simple sulfides undergo radical &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization with unsaturated amino acid partners to deliver an array of new methionine derivatives. The approach also facilitates the chemoselective modification of peptide side&#8208;chains.







Abstract
Access to new non&#8208;canonical amino acid residues is crucial for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. Analogues of the amino acid methionine have been far less explored&#8212;despite their use in biochemistry, pharmacology and peptide bioconjugation. This is largely due to limited synthetic access. Herein, we exploit a new disconnection to access non&#8208;natural methionines through the development of a photochemical method for the radical &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfides with alkenes, in water, using inexpensive and commercially&#8208;available riboflavin (vitamin B2) as a photocatalyst. Our photochemical conditions allow the two&#8208;step synthesis of novel methionine analogues&#8212;by radical addition to unsaturated amino acid derivatives&#8212;and the chemoselective modification of peptide side&#8208;chains to yield non&#8208;natural methionine residues within small peptides. The mechanism of the bio&#8208;inspired flavin photocatalysis has been probed by experimental, DFT and TDDFT studies.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Kinetic States of a [2]Rotaxane&#8208;Based Molecular Shuttle Controlled by Acid Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2]rotaxane&#8208;based molecular shuttle with an acid&#8208;responsive asymmetric macrocycle on a symmetric dumbbell axle has been synthesized. The shuttling kinetics can be controlled by the acid concentration and the kinetic intermediate can even be captured at a high concentration of acid. This was explained by invoking different protonation states of the rotaxane at different concentrations of acid.







Abstract
A [2]rotaxane&#8208;based molecular shuttle with an acid&#8208;responsive asymmetric macrocycle on a symmetric dumbbell axle is reported. Upon adding TFA, the macrocycle, namely the amine naphthotube, is protonated and translocates from the di(quaternary ammonium) station to the triazole stations because of electrostatic repulsion and weakened binding. The shuttling kinetics are slow due to the steric hindrance caused by the ethyl group on the quaternary ammonium center and can be followed by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, it was found that the shuttling kinetics depends on the concentration of TFA. A kinetic intermediate was detected and can even be captured in the presence of a high concentration of TFA. Extensive control experiments revealed that the shuttling kinetics and the capture of the kinetic intermediate are related to the different protonation states of the rotaxanes.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Deaminative Amino&#8208; and Alkoxycarbonylation of Aryl Trialkylammonium Salts Promoted by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed aminocarbonylation of aniline&#8208;derived trialkylammonium salts promoted by visible light via a challenging C(sp2)&#8722;N cleavage. The reaction is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization and is amenable to telescoped carbonylations directly from anilines. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations support a novel mechanism involving a key visible light&#8208;induced carbonyl photodissociation and SNAr&#8208;type oxidative addition.







Abstract
Catalytic carbonylations of aryl electrophiles via C(sp2)&#8722;N cleavage remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an aminocarbonylation of aniline&#8208;derived trialkylammonium salts promoted by visible light with a simple cobalt catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization and is amenable to telescoped carbonylations directly from anilines. A range of alkylamines are successful partners, and alkoxycarbonylation is also demonstrated. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations support a novel mechanism for catalytic carbonylations of aryl electrophiles involving a key visible light&#8208;induced carbonyl photodissociation.

         <title>Facet&#8208;specific Active Surface Regulation of BixMOy (M=Mo, V, W) Nanosheets for Boosted Photocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports (010) specific surface&#8208;regulated Bi2MoO6 nanosheets. The modified surface exhibits boosted CO2 photoreduction because of increased activation/adsorption of CO2 molecules. A combination of advanced characterizations and theoretical simulation confirmed performance and mechanism.







Abstract
Photocatalytic performance can be optimized via introduction of reactive sites. However, it is practically difficult to engineer these on specific photocatalyst surfaces, because of limited understanding of atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity. Here we report a facile sonication&#8208;assisted chemical reduction for specific facets regulation via oxygen deprivation on Bi&#8208;based photocatalysts. The modified Bi2MoO6 nanosheets exhibit 61.5 and 12.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO and CH4 production respectively, &#8776;3 times greater than for pristine catalyst, together with excellent stability/reproducibility of &#8776;20&#8197;h. By combining advanced characterizations and simulation, we confirm the reaction mechanism on surface&#8208;regulated photocatalysts, namely, induced defects on highly&#8208;active surface accelerate charge separation/transfer and lower the energy barrier for surface CO2 adsorption/activation/reduction. Promisingly, this method appears generalizable to a wider range of materials.

         <title>A Facile Structural Isomerization&#8208;Induced 3D Spatial D&#8208;A Interlocked Network for Achieving NIR&#8208;II Phototheranostic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) were constructed based on a facile strategy of structural isomerization&#8208;induced 3D spatial donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) interlocked network packing. Outstanding NIR&#8208;II tiny capillary vasculature/tumor imaging ability and synergistic photothermal/photodynamic anti&#8208;cancer effect in vivo were achieved with 6MNVDPP NPs.







Abstract
The performances of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) depend on both molecular structure and molecular packing when used as nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we proposed a facile structural isomerization&#8208;induced 3D spatial donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) interlocked network for achieving NIR&#8208;II OPTAs. Two isomers, 4MNVDPP and 6MNVDPP were synthesized and formulated into NPs. 6MNVDPP, which has a larger electrostatic potential difference, exhibits a compact 3D spatial D&#8208;A interlocked network in the crystal form, while 4MNVDPP forms 2D D&#8208;D type J&#8208;aggregates. Thus, 6MNVDPP NPs show red&#8208;shifted NIR absorption and larger molar extinction coefficient than 4MNVDPP NPs. Thanks to the typical NIR&#8208;II emission, superior photothermal&#8208;stability, high photothermal conversion efficiency (89&#8201;%) and reactive oxygen species production capacity, 6MNVDPP NPs exhibit outstanding NIR&#8208;II tiny capillary vasculature/tumor imaging ability and synergistic photothermal/photodynamic anti&#8208;cancer effect in vivo.

         <title>Design of a Protein with Improved Thermal Stability by an Evolution&#8208;Based Generative Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein design bears great interest in both research and industry. Evolutionary&#8208;based methods have been promising in designing new sequences based on the concept that the evolutionary fitness of a sequence is closely related to folding stability. Here we present a computational pipeline that, thanks to a combination of sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;based methods, can design new sequences translating in functional proteins with enhanced thermal stability.







Abstract
Efficient design of functional proteins with higher thermal stability remains challenging especially for highly diverse sequence variants. Considering the evolutionary pressure on protein folds, sequence design optimizing evolutionary fitness could help designing folds with higher stability. Using a generative evolution fitness model trained to capture variation patterns in natural sequences, we designed artificial sequences of a proteinaceous inhibitor of pectin methylesterase enzymes. These inhibitors have considerable industrial interest to avoid phase separation in fruit juice manufacturing or reduce methanol in distillates, averting chromatographic passages triggering unwanted aroma loss. Six out of seven designs with up to 30&#8201;% divergence to other inhibitor sequences are functional and two have improved thermal stability. This method can improve protein stability expanding functional protein sequence space, with traits valuable for industrial applications and scientific research.

         <title>Orthogonally Integrating Programmable Structural Color and Photo&#8208;Rewritable Fluorescence in Hydrazone Photoswitch&#8208;bonded Cholesteric Liquid Crystalline Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work realized construction of distinct visible and fluorescent patterns in a single freestanding photonic film by integrating water&#8208;swellable helical polymer matrix and fluorescence switchable molecular switch. The orthogonally dual responsiveness of the novel optical materials enabled fabrication of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption devices with superior safety and capacity.







Abstract
Design and fabrication of advanced security label showing superior performance in data encryption has attracted tremendous scientific interests. Especially, multifunctional optical labels capable of storing distinct information in different modes are highly demanded. Here, a fluorescent cholesteric liquid crystalline network (CLCN) film with programmable visible patterns and photo&#8208;rewritable fluorescent patterns was designed and prepared. The visible patterns were fixed by helical network and the colors of visible patterns were tunable by changing relative humidity (RH). The fluorescent patterns originated from dynamic isomerization of fluorescent hydrazones, exhibiting highly thermal stability and switching&#8208;ability controlled by light. The orthogonal construction of visible and fluorescent pattern enabled the novel CLCN to encrypt distinct information in reflective mode and in emissive mode, indicating its potential in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryptions.

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics and Catalytic Mechanism of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatty acid photodecarboxylase converts a carboxylic acid into a hydrocarbon and a carbon dioxide molecule through decarboxylation. Two critical carbonyloxy and alkyl radical intermediates in the catalytic reactions were captured by deep UV detection, and their dynamics were determined with actual reaction timescales, revealing the molecular mechanism of the enzymatic reaction and mapping out the catalytic photocycle of this efficient photoenzyme.







Abstract
Fatty acid photodecarboxylase is a newly discovered flavin photoenzyme that converts a carboxylic acid into a hydrocarbon and a carbon dioxide molecule through decarboxylation. The enzymatic reactions are poorly understood. In this study, we carefully characterized its dynamic evolution with femtosecond spectroscopy. We observed initial electron transfer from the substrate to the flavin cofactor in 347&#8197;ps with a stretched dynamic behavior and subsequently captured the critical carbonyloxy radical. The dominant process following this step was decarboxylation in 5.8&#8197;ns to form an alkyl radical and a carbon dioxide molecule. We further identified the absorption bands of two carbonyloxy and alkyl radical intermediates. The overall enzymatic quantum efficiency determined by our obtained timescales is 0.81, consistent with the steady&#8208;state value. The results are essential to the elucidation of the enzyme mechanism and catalytic photocycle, providing a molecular basis for potential design of flavin&#8208;based artificial photoenzymes.

         <title>o&#8208;Quinodimethane Atropisomers: Enantioselective Synthesis and Stereospecific Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric o&#8208;quinodimethanes and their viability for highly stereoselective transformations are described. o&#8208;Quinodimethane precursors were readily accessible by an intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of triyne substrates and the in situ generated o&#8208;quinodimethane atropisomers were converted in highly stereospecific Diels&#8211;Alder reactions at elevated temperature with up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 e.r.







Abstract
o&#8208;Quinodimethanes have remarkable utility as reactive intermediates in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, enabling significantly accelerated routes to complex polycyclic compounds. The discovery of different discrete precursors to thermally generate o&#8208;quinodimethanes thereby greatly augmented their availability and versatility. However, due to the required high temperatures and the immense reactivity of o&#8208;quinodimethanes, stereoselectivity to afford isomerically defined products still constitutes a critical challenge. Herein, we describe the accessibility of atropisomeric o&#8208;quinodimethanes, the enantioselective synthesis of their precursors, their remarkable configurational stability and the stereospecific transformation by the benzannulation of dienophiles. A catalyst&#8208;stereocontrolled [2+2+2] cycloaddition, the generation of o&#8208;quinodimethane atropisomers and ensuing stereospecific Diels&#8211;Alder reactions enabled enantioselectivities through these transient intermediates with of up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 e.r.

Resembling the stacked orientation of nucleobases in DNA, arrays of aromatic carboxylates provide multiple &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in directing the formation of giant {Mo126W30} polyoxometalate cages. The interior aromatic units can be postsynthetically replaced by a selection of functionalized aliphatic dicarboxylates, offering options to fine&#8208;tune the microenvironment within the cage cavity.







Abstract
Here we report the formation of giant {Mo126W30} polyoxometalate cages templated by &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar ligands. Their inorganic shells incorporate arrays of 18 stacked aromatic carboxylates, such as 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate or 5&#8208;nitroisophthalate, and the assembly is stabilized by multiple &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. NMR data confirmed that the cages are stable in solution and the inner aromatic templates can be postsynthetically replaced by selected aliphatic dicarboxylates, paving the way for endo&#8208;functionalization and exploration of the reactivities within the cage cavities.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Redistribution between Hydrosilanes and Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed silane cross&#8208;redistribution reaction was developed for the synthesis of bis&#8208;silanes. The reaction is driven by enthalpy but not entropy, and the reaction is atom economical, without formation of gaseous silane side product. The reaction has broad substrate scope. This combined computational and experimental study shows that the reaction proceeds through a Ni0&#8208;NiII&#8208;NiIV catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Silanes are important in chemistry and material science. The self&#8208;redistribution of HSiCl3 is an industrial process to prepare SiH4, which is widely used in electronics and automobile industries. However, selective silane cross&#8208;redistribution to prepare advanced silanes is challenging. We now report an enthalpy&#8208;driven silane cross&#8208;redistribution to access bis&#8208;silanes that contain two different types of Si&#8722;H bonds in the same molecule. Compared with entropy&#8208;driven reactions, the enthalpy&#8208;driven reaction shows high regioselectivity, broad substrate scope (62 examples) and high atom economy. Our combined experimental and computational study indicates that the reaction proceeds through a Ni0&#8208;NiII&#8208;NiIV catalytic cycle.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Hofmeister Anion Selectivity via a Mechanical Bond Effect in Neutral Halogen&#8208;Bonding [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral XB [2]rotaxanes containing remarkably potent XB axle components including a novel 4,6&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;iodotriazole motif are constructed via a discrete chloride anion template directed synthesis. Quantitative 1H NMR halide anion titration studies in competitive aqueous&#8208;organic solvent mixtures reveal the XB [2]rotaxanes display pronounced anti&#8208;Hofmeister halide anion recognition selectivity for chloride over iodide.







Abstract
Exceptionally strong halogen bonding (XB) donor&#8208;chloride interactions are exploited for the chloride anion template synthesis of neutral XB [2]rotaxane host systems which contain perfluoroaryl&#8208;functionalised axle components, including a remarkably potent novel 4,6&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;iodotriazole motif. Halide anion recognition properties in aqueous&#8208;organic media, determined via extensive 1H NMR halide anion titration experiments, reveal the rotaxane host systems exhibit dramatically enhanced affinities for hydrophilic Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;, but conversely diminished affinities for hydrophobic I&#8722;, relative to their non&#8208;interlocked axle counterparts. Crucially, this mechanical bond effect induces a binding selectivity which directly opposes Hofmeister bias. Free&#8208;energy analysis of this mechanical bond enhancement demonstrates anion recognition by neutral XB interlocked host systems as a rare and general strategy to engineer anti&#8208;Hofmeister bias anion selectivity in synthetic receptor design.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Proton Rectifier Using a Heterogeneous Membrane Composed of Coordination Polymer and Layered Double Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;solid&#8208;state proton rectifier was fabricated using a heterogeneous membrane composed of proton&#8208;conducting coordination polymer, Cu2(CuTCPP), and hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide, Mg&#8208;Al&#8208;LDH(NO3). The device demonstrated a proton rectification ratio greater than 200, which is the highest among the reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state H+&#8722;OH&#8722; rectifiers.







Abstract
Rational control of unidirectional proton transport is highly challenging, primarily owing to the difficulty in introducing an asymmetric factor into proton conducting media. In this study, free&#8208;standing membranes of a proton&#8208;conducting two&#8208;dimensional porous coordination polymer, Cu2(CuTCPP) (H2TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) and a hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide, Mg&#8208;Al&#8208;LDH(NO3), were combined to generate a pH gradient in the conducting media. The current&#8211;voltage measurements revealed that the heterogeneous membrane exhibits a significant unidirectional proton transport with a proton rectification ratio exceeding 200 under 90&#8201;% relative humidity in the initial voltage scan. This value is the highest among the reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state proton rectifiers. The high designability of both components with well&#8208;defined structures, which is in contrast to the organic polymers used so far, provides a new avenue for developing and understanding the proton&#8208;rectifying behavior in the solid state.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational control of unidirectional proton transport is highly challenging, primarily owing to the difficulty in introducing an asymmetric factor into proton conducting media. In this study, free-standing membranes of a proton-conducting two-dimensional porous coordination polymer, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CuTCPP) (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TCPP: 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) and a hydroxide ion-conducting layered double hydroxide, Mg-Al-LDH(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), were combined to generate a pH gradient in the conducting media. The current&#8211;voltage measurements revealed that the heterogeneous membrane exhibits a significant unidirectional proton transport with a proton rectification ratio exceeding 200 under 90&#8201;% relative humidity in the initial voltage scan. This value is the highest among the reported all-solid-state proton rectifiers. The high designability of both components with well-defined structures, which is in contrast to the organic polymers used so far, provides a new avenue for developing and understanding the proton-rectifying behavior in the solid state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination Switch Drives Selective C&#8722;S Bond Formation by the Non&#8208;Heme Sulfoxide Synthases
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calculations suggest that a coordination switch of the sulfoxide intermediate is involved in the catalysis of ergothioneine synthase (EgtB). This coordination switch from S to O is driven by the S/&#960; nonbonding electrostatic interactions, which efficiently promotes the observed stereoselective C&#8722;S bond formation while bypassing cysteine dioxygenation.







Abstract
The non&#8208;heme iron ergothioneine synthase (EgtB) is a sulfoxide synthase that catalyzes oxidative C&#8722;S bond formation in the synthesis of ergothioneine, which plays roles against oxidative stress in cells. Despite extensive experimental and computational studies of the catalytic mechanisms of EgtB, the root causes for the selective C&#8722;S bond formation remain elusive. Using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, we show herein that a coordination switch of the sulfoxide intermediate is involved in the catalysis of the non&#8208;heme iron EgtB. This coordination switch from the S to the O atom is driven by the S/&#960; electrostatic interactions, which efficiently promotes the observed stereoselective C&#8722;S bond formation while bypassing cysteine dioxygenation. The present mechanism is in agreement with all available experimental data, including regioselectivity, stereoselectivity and KIE results. This match underscores the critical role of coordination switching in the catalysis of non&#8208;heme enzymes.

         <title>Bioactive Ion&#8208;Based Switchable Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the highly efficient information transmission of biologically active compounds in nerve systems, a well&#8208;controllable capture/release of biologically active ions is achieved by a switchable supercapacitor.







Abstract
Switchable supercapacitors (SCs) enable a reversible electrically&#8208;driven uptake/release of bioactive ions by polarizing porous carbon electrodes. Herein we demonstrate the first example of a bioactive ion&#8208;based switchable supercapacitor. Based on choline chloride and porous carbons we unravel the mechanism of physisorption vs. electrosorption by nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman, and impedance spectroscopy. Weak physisorption facilitates electrically&#8208;driven electrolyte depletion enabling the controllable uptake/release of electrolyte ions. A new 4&#8208;terminal device is proposed, with a main capacitor and a detective capacitor for monitoring bioactive ion adsorption in situ. Ion&#8208;concentration control in printed choline&#8208;based switchable SCs realizes switching down to 8.3&#8201;% residual capacitance. The exploration of adsorption mechanisms in printable microdevices will open an avenue of manipulating bioactive ions for the application of drug delivery, neuromodulation, or neuromorphic devices.

         <title>(Salen)Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogen Atom Transfer for Epoxides Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic and asymmetric hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction is achieved through a sequential (salen)TiIII&#8208;initiated radical generation and (salen)TiIV&#8208;induced enantioselective HAT process. It enables an enantioconvergent approach from readily accessible racemic glycidic esters and amides to synthetically valuable enantioenriched formal formaldehyde aldol products with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) represents arguably one of the most straightforward access to the significant chiral tertiary carbon centers, however, remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, the first example of catalytic coordination&#8208;induced asymmetric HAT reaction has been developed relying on a sequential (salen)TiIII&#8208;initiated radical generation and (salen)TiIV&#8208;controlled enantioselective HAT process. The reaction transforms easily accessible glycidic esters, thioesters and amides to synthetically valuable formal formaldehyde aldol adducts in an enantioconvergent manner, along with broad scope and highly regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Cu Single Atom Nanozyme Based High&#8208;Efficiency Mild Photothermal Therapy through Cellular Metabolic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu single atom nanozyme achieves mild photothermal cancer therapy by a two&#8208;pronged strategy, where the delivered clinical medicine licogliflozin closes a sodium&#8208;dependent glucose transporter valve for blocking the energy required for the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs). Meanwhile, the nanozyme forms a reactive oxygen species storm to damage existing HSPs.







Abstract
Upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) drastically compromises the treatment effect of mild photothermal therapy (PTT). Herein, we designed a polyporous Cu single atom nanozyme (Cu SAzyme) loaded with licogliflozin (LIK066) for HSP&#8208;silencing induced mild PTT. On one hand, LIK066 inhibits glucose uptake by shutting sodium&#8208;dependent glucose transporter (SGLT) &#8220;valve&#8221;, effectively blocking the energy source for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. Without sufficient energy, cancer cells cannot synthesize HSPs. On the other hand, Cu SAzyme presents extraordinary multienzyme activities to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm formation, which can damage the existing HSPs in cancer cells. Through a two&#8208;pronged strategy of SGLT inhibitor and ROS storm, LIK066&#8208;loaded Cu SAzyme shows high efficiency for comprehensive removal of HSPs to realize mild PTT.

Without sufficient energy, cancer cells cannot synthesize HSPs. On the other hand, Cu SAzyme presents extraordinary multienzyme activities to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm formation, which can damage the existing HSPs in cancer cells. Through a two-pronged strategy of SGLT inhibitor and ROS storm, LIK066-loaded Cu SAzyme shows high efficiency for comprehensive removal of HSPs to realize mild PTT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advancing Critical Chemical Processes for a Sustainable Future: Challenges for Industry and the Max Planck&#8211;Cardiff Centre on the Fundamentals of Heterogeneous Catalysis (FUNCAT)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Viewpoint Article presents some of the research activities and visions of the newly established Max Planck&#8211;Cardiff Centre on the Fundamentals of Heterogeneous Catalysis (FUNCAT). Heterogeneous catalysis faces a number of challenges before a sustainable future may be achieved. Key concerns of FUNCAT are industrially relevant processes, such as green hydrogen production, ammonia synthesis, hydrogenation of carbon dioxide, and acetylene chemistry.







Abstract
Catalysis is involved in around 85&#8201;% of manufacturing industry and contributes an estimated 25&#8201;% to the global domestic product, with the majority of the processes relying on heterogeneous catalysis. Despite the importance in different global segments, the fundamental understanding of heterogeneously catalysed processes lags substantially behind that achieved in other fields. The newly established Max Planck&#8211;Cardiff Centre on the Fundamentals of Heterogeneous Catalysis (FUNCAT) targets innovative concepts that could contribute to the scientific developments needed in the research field to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the chemical industries. This Viewpoint Article presents some of our research activities and visions on the current and future challenges of heterogeneous catalysis regarding green industry and the circular economy by focusing explicitly on critical processes. Namely, hydrogen production, ammonia synthesis, and carbon dioxide reduction, along with new aspects of acetylene chemistry.

A bimodal imaging probe FCy7&#8208;NO2 was applied to image nitroreductase overexpressed by lung cancer in&#8197;vivo, as reported by Xin Zhou and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202213495). Integrating two complementary imaging technologies into FCy7&#8208;NO2 enables sensitive detection of nitroreductase over a broad concentration range without tissue&#8208;depth limit.

Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy was used by Boris&#8197;J. Nachtsheim, Christian Merten et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202204624) to verify DFT&#8208;calculated chiral iodane structures. Based on a chiral triazole&#8208;substituted iodoarene catalyst, a yet undescribed cationic chiral iodane was elucidated as the most populated intermediate under oxidative conditions with a significant intermolecular N&#8211;I interaction.

         <title>Activatable Multimodal Probes for In Vivo Imaging and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activatable probes capable of generating switchable multimodal imaging signals upon interaction with a molecular target of interest have attracted much attention in the past few years. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in the development of activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and theranostics, with a focus on their design, signal activation mechanism and biological applications.







Abstract
Multimodal imaging, which harnesses two or more imaging modalities to produce complementary anatomical and molecular information of a living subject, has become as a powerful tool in both basic biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. The progresses in multimodal imaging are paralleled by the advances in multimodal probes, particularly activatable multimodal imaging probes that can generate concurrent switches in different imaging modality signals upon interaction with a molecular target. These probes are extremely promising for in vivo imaging. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in activatable multimodal probes for in vivo imaging and cancer theranostics, focusing on their design principle, signal activation mechanism and biomedical applications. The current challenges and perspectives for future developments of activatable multimodal probes are also briefly discussed. We hope that this Minireview will provide inspiration for the design of other activatable multimodal probes for improving in vivo imaging and theranostics.

         <title>Sustainable Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wacker&#8208;type oxidations afford highly value&#8208;added carbonyl compounds starting from readily available olefins and using scarce and expensive palladium catalysts at high dioxygen pressures and elevated temperatures. The last few years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the development of procedures that operate under mild conditions, as discussed in this Minireview. These procedures are based on more abundant and affordable, first&#8208;row transition metals, including metal&#8208;free processes.







Abstract
The Wacker reaction is the oxidation of olefins to ketones and typically requires expensive and scarce palladium catalysts in the presence of an additional copper co&#8208;catalyst under harsh conditions (acidic media, high pressure of air/dioxygen, elevated temperatures). Such a transformation is relevant for industry, as shown by the synthesis of acetaldehyde from ethylene as well as for fine&#8208;chemicals, because of the versatility of a carbonyl group placed at specific positions. In this regard, many contributions have focused on controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of the olefin oxidation by means of well&#8208;defined palladium catalysts under different sets of reaction conditions. However, the development of Wacker&#8208;type processes that avoid the use of palladium catalysts has just emerged in the last few years, thereby paving the way for the generation of more sustainable procedures, including milder reaction conditions and green chemistry technologies. In this Minireview, we discuss the development of new catalytic processes that utilize more benign catalysts and sustainable reaction conditions.

         <title>Development of Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Based Electrochemical Biosensors for Clinical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>

This Minireview discusses the role of nucleic acids as biorecognition and/or reporter probes in electrochemical biosensors. It highlights specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based electrochemical sensors that have been evaluated with clinical or clinically relevant samples for the management of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are remarkable molecules. In addition to Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing, the different structural motifs of these molecules can bind non&#8208;nucleic acid targets or catalyze chemical reactions. Additionally, nucleic acids are easily modified with different molecules or functional groups. These properties make nucleic acids, particularly DNA, ideally suited for use in electrochemical biosensors, both as biorecognition elements and redox reporter probes. In this Minireview, we will review the historical evolution of nucleic acids as probes in electrochemical biosensors. We will then review the specific examples of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based biosensors that have been evaluated for clinical use in the areas of infectious disease, cancer, or cardiovascular health.

         <title>Dynamic Bonds: Adaptable Timescales for Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For dynamic polymer materials to respond to their environment and be tailored towards an application, the timescale of bond exchange must be tuned. Both chemical structural modifications and external factors such as temperature, catalyst, and matrix can be used to fine&#8208;tune the timescales of exchange. This Review focuses on the tools available to modulate the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymeric materials.







Abstract
Dynamic bonds introduce unique properties such as self&#8208;healing, recyclability, shape memory, and malleability to polymers. Significant efforts have been made to synthesize a variety of dynamic linkers, creating a diverse library of materials. In addition to the development of new dynamic chemistries, fine&#8208;tuning of dynamic bonds has emerged as a technique to modulate dynamic properties. This Review highlights approaches for controlling the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymers. Particularly, eight dynamic bonds are considered, including urea/urethanes, boronic esters, Thiol&#8211;Michael exchange, Diels&#8211;Alder adducts, transesterification, imine bonds, coordination bonds, and hydrogen bonding. This Review emphasizes how structural modifications and external factors have been used as tools to tune the dynamic character of materials. Finally, this Review proposes strategies for tailoring the timescales of dynamic bonds in polymer materials through both kinetic effects and modulating bond thermodynamics.

         <title>What X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy Can Tell Us About the Active State of Earth&#8208;Abundant Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction

Electrochemical methods and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy are powerful tools to understand electrocatalysis on an atomistic level, yet the combination of these methods still holds untapped potential.







Abstract
Implementation of chemical energy storage for a sustainable energy supply requires the rational improvement of electrocatalyst materials, for which their nature under reaction conditions needs to be revealed. For a better understanding of earth&#8208;abundant metal oxides as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the combination of electrochemical (EC) methods and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is very insightful, yet still holds untapped potential. Herein, we concisely introduce EC and XAS, providing the necessary framework to discuss changes that electrocatalytic materials undergo during preparation and storage, during immersion in an electrolyte, as well as during application of potentials, showing Mn oxides as examples. We conclude with a summary of how EC and XAS are currently combined to elucidate active states, as well as an outlook on opportunities to understand the mechanisms of electrocatalysis using combined operando EC&#8211;XAS experiments.

         <title>Overcoming Electrostatic Interaction via Strong Complexation for Highly Selective Reduction of CN&#8722; into N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interaction could severely inhibit the selective conversion of ions. This work proposes a strategy to overcome electrostatic interaction via strong complexation, realizing the preferential hydrogenation of cyanide at the cathode, and then oxidizing the reduction products into nitrogen at the anode. The controlled mass transfer of ions provides more possibilities for their selective conversion in the electrocatalytic system.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Electrostatic interaction could severely inhibit the selective conversion of ions. This work proposes a strategy to overcome electrostatic interaction via strong complexation, realizing the preferential hydrogenation of cyanide at the cathode, and then oxidizing the reduction products into nitrogen at the anode. The controlled mass transfer of ions provides more possibilities for their selective conversion in the electrocatalytic system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited by the electrostatic interaction, the oxidation reaction of cations at the anode and the reduction reaction of anions at the cathode in the electrocatalytic system nearly cannot be achieved.

         <title>Unveiling the &#8220;Proton Lubricant&#8221; Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;MoS2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MoS2/PEDOT hybrid featuring enlarged interlayers (from 0.62 to 1.29&#8197;nm), good hydrophilicity and high electronic conductivity was prepared, demonstrating highly reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction behaviors in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The co&#8208;inserted protons induced by PEDOT effectively shield the electrostatic interactions between MoS2/PEDOT and Zn2+, providing a new concept of &#8220;proton lubricant&#8221; to facilitate the Zn2+ diffusion.







Abstract
Proton insertion chemistry in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is becoming a research hotspot owing to its fast kinetics and additional capacities. However, H+ storage mechanism has not been deciphered in the popular MoS2&#8208;based AZIBs. Herein, we innovatively prepared a MoS2/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (MoS2/PEDOT) hybrid, where the intercalated PEDOT not only increases the interlayer spacing (from 0.62 to 1.29&#8197;nm) and electronic conductivity of MoS2, but also activates the proton insertion chemistry. Thus, highly efficient and reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction behaviors are demonstrated for the first time in aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries. More intriguingly, the co&#8208;inserted protons can act as lubricants to effectively shield the electrostatic interactions between MoS2/PEDOT host and divalent Zn2+, enabling the accelerated ion&#8208;diffusion kinetics and exceptional rate performance. This work proposes a new concept of &#8220;proton lubricant&#8221; driving Zn2+ transport and broadens the horizons of Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries.

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of the Homoleptic Nickel(I) and Nickel(II) Bis&#8208;benzene Sandwich Cations</title>

The metalloradical [Ni(C6H6)2]+, hitherto unknown in the condensed phase, was synthesized from [Ni(CO)4]+[WCA]&#8722; and benzene ([WCA]&#8722;=[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). The [Ni(C6H6)2]+ cation exhibits an asymmetric slipped sandwich structure. Its magnetic properties were determined in solution and in the gas phase. Further oxidation with the Ag+/0.5&#8197;l2 system led to the salt [Ni(C6H6)2]2+([WCA]&#8722;)2.







Abstract
A stable salt of the metalloradical [Ni(C6H6)2]+ hitherto unknown in the condensed phase was synthesized from [Ni(CO)4]+[WCA]&#8722; and benzene ([WCA]&#8722;=[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). Single crystal XRD reveals a remarkable asymmetrically &#951;3,&#951;6&#8208;slipped sandwich structure. The magnetic properties of the [Ni(C6H6)2]+ cation were determined in solution and in the gas phase. Oxidation with the synergistic Ag+/0.5&#8197;l2 system led to the salt [Ni(C6H6)2]2+([WCA]&#8722;)2. All products were fully characterized by means of IR, Raman, NMR/EPR, single crystal and powder XRD.

Reversing the intrinsic cyclization mode. Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;alkylallyloxy)phenyl boronic acid derivatives in the presence of Selectfluor 2 provides chromanes 3 with concurrent generation of a tertiary alkyl fluoride function. A 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation affords PdII intermediate A whose oxidation to PdIV followed by 1,2&#8208;aryl/PdIV dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8722;F bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination affords chromane 3.







Abstract
Alkene difunctionalization featuring an intramolecular carbometallation step has been developed into a powerful transformation in organic synthesis. The 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbometallation is in general highly favored over the alternative 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. We report herein a formal 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig carbofluorination protocol by combining the conventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation with a chemoselective 1,2&#8208;aryl/Pd dyotropic rearrangement. Treatment of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;alkylallyloxy)phenyl boronic acid derivatives in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(dba)2, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and Selectfluor affords chromanes with concurrent generation of a tertiary alkyl fluoride function. A &#963;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;PdII species resulting from the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig carbopalladation process is isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Its oxidation to PdIV complex triggers the chemoselective dyotropic rearrangement leading to the ring expansion product.

         <title>Photoinduced Promiscuity of Cyclohexanone Monooxygenase for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Fluoroketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced reductive dehalogenation promiscuity of cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) with a novel mechanism of ET/PT distinct from the photoinduced promiscuity of natural reductases is reported. Various highly enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones were synthesized by photoinduced reductive dehalogenation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;halofluoroketones in a process catalyzed by the rationally designed CHMO mutants.







Abstract
The development of mild, efficient, and enantioselective methods for preparing chiral fluorinated compounds has been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a promiscuous cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) for the photoinduced synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones via enantioselective reductive dehalogenation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;halofluoroketones. Wild&#8208;type CHMO from Acinetobacter sp. possesses this promiscuous ability innately; however, the yield and stereoselectivity are low. A structure&#8208;guided rational design of CHMO improved the yield and stereoselectivity remarkably. Mechanistic studies and molecular simulations demonstrated that this photoinduced CHMO catalyzes the reductive dehalogenation via a novel electron transfer (ET)/proton transfer (PT) mechanism, distinct from that of previously reported reductases with similar promiscuity. This methodology was expanded to various substrates, and desirable chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroketones were obtained in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and e.r. values (up to 99:1).

         <title>Synthesis of Subporphyrin Free Bases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subporphyrin free bases, with bowl&#8208;like bent structures and distinct 14&#960;&#8208;aromaticity, have been synthesized by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic studies have revealed that the excited&#8208;state behaviors of the subporphyrin free bases are comparable to those of the corresponding BIII subporphyrins.







Abstract
BIII subporphyrins are the legitimate ring&#8208;contracted porphyrins consisting of three pyrroles and three meso&#8208;carbons and their chemistry has been extensively developed since the first synthesis in 2006. However, subporphyrin free bases have never been synthesized, despite tremendous attempts to remove the BIII ion. Here we report that Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling between &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diborylated tripyrrane 1 and tetrabromide 5 gave subporphyrin free bases 6, 6&#8201;A, and free base dimer 7 in 6&#8201;%, 4&#8201;%, and 2&#8201;% yields as the first examples. Subporphyrin free bases exhibit curved bowl&#8208;like structures and distinct 14&#960;&#8208;aromaticity. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy revealed that the excited&#8208;state behaviors of the subporphyrin free bases are comparable with those of the corresponding BIII subporphyrins. Rotational relaxation processes in the excited states have been revealed, which enhance the electronic interactions with the meso&#8208;aryl substituents and between the two subporphyrins.

         <title>Evaluation of the Specific Activity of M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs and the Intrinsic Activity of Tetrapyrrolic FeN4 Sites for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein used the equivalence of an active site extraction to the poisoning of active sites to develop a new method for the determination of site density, utilization factor and TOF. The method is reminiscent of stripping techniques but since there are no probe molecules involved it can be applied to different classes of M&#8722;N&#8722;C directly at the relevant pH.







Abstract
M&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalysts are considered pivotal to replace expensive precious group metal&#8208;based materials in electrocatalytic conversions. However, their development is hampered by the limited availability of methods for the evaluation of the intrinsic activity of different active sites, like pyrrolic FeN4 sites within Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs. Currently, new synthetic procedures based on active&#8208;site imprinting followed by an ion exchange reaction, e.g. Zn&#8208;to&#8208;Fe, are producing single&#8208;site M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs with outstanding activity. Based on the same replacement principle, we employed a conservative iron extraction to partially remove the Fe ions from the N4 cavities in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs. Having catalysts with the same morphological properties and Fe ligation that differ solely in Fe content allows for the facile determination of the decrease in density of active sites and their turn&#8208;over frequency. In this way, insight into the specific activity of M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs is obtained and for single&#8208;site catalysts the intrinsic activity of the site is accessible. This new approach surpasses limitations of methods that rely on probe molecules and, together with those techniques, offers a novel tool to unfold the complexity of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst and M&#8722;N&#8722;Cs in general.

         <title>Accelerated and Concerted Aza&#8208;Michael Addition and SuFEx Reaction in Microdroplets in Unitary and High&#8208;Throughput Formats</title>

Accelerated, catalyst&#8208;free, coupled Aza&#8208;Michael addition and SuFEx reactions between amines and ethenesulfonyl fluoride under ambient conditions in microdroplets are analyzed by electrosonic spray mass spectrometry (ESSI&#8208;MS) while high&#8208;throughput desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI&#8208;MS) is used to follow reaction scope.







Abstract
The sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction is significant in drug discovery, materials science, and chemical biology. Conventionally, it involves installation of SO2F followed by fluoride exchange by a catalyst. We report catalyst&#8208;free Aza&#8208;Michael addition to install SO2F and then SuFEx reaction with amines, both occurring in concert, in microdroplets under ambient conditions. The microdroplet reaction is accelerated by a factor of &#8764;104 relative to the corresponding bulk reaction. We suggest that the superacidic microdroplet surface assists SuFEx reaction by protonating fluorine to create a good leaving group. The reaction scope was established by performing individual reactions in microdroplets of 18 amines in four solvents and confirmed using high&#8208;throughput desorption electrospray ionization experiments. The study demonstrates the value of microdroplet&#8208;assisted accelerated reactions in combination with high&#8208;throughput experimentation for characterization of reaction scope.

         <title>Intrinsic Phase Stability and Inherent Bandgap of Formamidinium Lead Triiodide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The residual &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (GBL) solvent molecules inside the void of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 single crystals promote the phase transition kinetics (2). By adopting the 2&#8208;methoxyethanol (2&#8208;ME) as solvent, highly stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystals could be acquired due to slow solid to solid phase transition (1). &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with crystal size above 100&#8197;&#956;m has an inherent 1.41&#8197;eV band gap.







Abstract
Understanding the intrinsic phase stability and inherent band gap of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskites is crucial to further improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we explored the &#945;&#8208; to &#948;&#8208;phase transition and band gap of FAPbI3 single crystals grown by an inverse temperature solubility method. We found that the residual &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone solvents in the inner empty space of the FAPbI3 single crystal accelerate the phase transition at kinetics. By adopting 2&#8208;methoxyethanol as the solvent, over 2000&#8197;h of stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystals could be acquired. This proves that although FAPbI3 is regarded as unstable at thermodynamics, it could own excellent kinetic stability without any doping or additives because of the slow solid to solid phase transition instead of the fast phase transition assisted by the solvents. Furthermore, we revealed that the bulk FAPbI3 single crystal with a size above 100&#8197;&#956;m can have an inherent band gap of 1.41&#8197;eV. Thus, our work provides key scientific guidance for high&#8208;performance FAPbI3&#8208;based PSCs.

By adopting the 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME) as solvent, highly stable &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals could be acquired due to slow solid to solid phase transition (1). &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with crystal size above 100&#8197;&#956;m has an inherent 1.41&#8197;eV band gap.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the intrinsic phase stability and inherent band gap of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskites is crucial to further improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we explored the &#945;- to &#948;-phase transition and band gap of FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals grown by an inverse temperature solubility method. We found that the residual &#947;-butyrolactone solvents in the inner empty space of the FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystal accelerate the phase transition at kinetics. By adopting 2-methoxyethanol as the solvent, over 2000&#8197;h of stable &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals could be acquired. This proves that although FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is regarded as unstable at thermodynamics, it could own excellent kinetic stability without any doping or additives because of the slow solid to solid phase transition instead of the fast phase transition assisted by the solvents. Furthermore, we revealed that the bulk FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystal with a size above 100&#8197;&#956;m can have an inherent band gap of 1.41&#8197;eV. Thus, our work provides key scientific guidance for high-performance FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Function of Two Radical&#8208;SAM Enzymes, HcgA and HcgG, in the Biosynthesis of the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FeGP cofactor is the prosthetic group of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, which catalyzes reversible hydride transfer from H2 to an organic substrate. HcgA and HcgG are involved in the biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor. In vitro biosynthesis experiments indicated the functions of these two radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes. HcgA biosynthesizes the initial pyridinol precursor, and HcgG contributes to the formation of the CO and acyl ligands.







Abstract
In the biosynthesis of the iron&#8208;guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor, 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol (1) is 3&#8208;methylated to form 2, then 4&#8208;guanylylated to form 3, and converted into the full cofactor. HcgA&#8208;G proteins catalyze the biosynthetic reactions. Herein, we report the function of two radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes, HcgA and HcgG, as uncovered by in vitro complementation experiments and the use of purified enzymes. In vitro biosynthesis using the cell extract from the Methanococcus maripaludis &#916;hcgA strain was complemented with HcgA or precursors 1, 2 or 3. The results suggested that HcgA catalyzes the biosynthetic reaction that forms 1. We demonstrated the formation of 1 by HcgA using the 3&#8197;kDa cell extract filtrate as the substrate. Biosynthesis in the &#916;hcgG system was recovered by HcgG but not by 3, which indicated that HcgG catalyzes the reactions after the biosynthesis of 3. The data indicated that HcgG contributes to the formation of CO and completes biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor.

         <title>Modified Intramolecular&#8208;Lock Strategy Enables Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Non&#8208;Doped OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;medium ring&#8221;&#8208;lock strategy is presented for the construction of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, high photoluminescence quantum yield and large horizontal orientation factor, which enables to assemble non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with high external quantum efficiency of 26.2&#8201;% and power efficiency of 76.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of intramolecular&#8208;lock strategy is an appealing task for designing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, but only limited examples have been reported so far. Herein we present a &#8220;medium ring&#8221;&#8208;lock strategy to develop TADF emitters for improving the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The installation of an electron&#8208;deficient heptagonal diimide lock onto a highly rotatable biphenyl&#8208;based emitter not only enhances electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of acceptor that decreases singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), but also endows the skeleton with modest rigidity and flexibility that increases photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in neat film. In particular, the integration of the diimide lock also leads to an increase in horizontal orientation factor (&#920;//) from 69&#8201;% to 83&#8201;%. Consequently, this modified intramolecular&#8208;lock strategy enables an efficient TADF emitter to assemble high&#8208;performance non&#8208;doped OLEDs with a high external quantum efficiency of 26.2&#8201;% and a power efficiency of 76.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1.

         <title>Catalytic Reversible (De)hydrogenation To Rotate a Chemically Fueled Molecular Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most chemically fueled molecular switches suffer from the problem of waste accumulation inhibiting the system. Herein, we present a 180&#176; rotating molecular switch based on reversible (de)hydrogenation avoiding waste accumulation. Catalyzed by an iridium complex, switching from a pressure of argon to a pressure of hydrogen triggers a reversible change in the system from alcohol to ketone, promoting the rotation around an alkyne axis.







Abstract
We report here the development of a rotating molecular switch based on metal&#8208;catalyzed reversible (de)&#8208;hydrogenation. Under an argon atmosphere, acceptorless dehydrogenation induces a switch from an alcohol to a ketone, while reversing to a hydrogen pressure switches back the system to the alcohol. Based on a tolane scaffold, such reversible (de)&#8208;hydrogenation enables 180&#176; rotation. The absence of waste accumulation in a switch relying on chemical stimuli is of great significance and could potentially be applied to the design of efficient complex molecular machines.

         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective intermolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation has been developed. This protocol is characterized by its mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity, thus unlocking a complementary technique to conventional C(sp3)&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions for accessing amine architectures from simple building blocks.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective intermolecular amidation of saturated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is reported. This mild protocol exhibits a predictable reactivity pattern to incorporate amide functions at C(sp3)&#8722;H sites adjacent to nitrogen and oxygen atoms in either cyclic or acyclic frameworks, thus offering a complementary reactivity profile to existing oxidative&#8208;type processes or metal&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions operating via two&#8208;electron manifolds.

         <title>Helical Molecular Springs with Varying Spring Constants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minature versions of Hookean springs can be built from single&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers. The spring constants of these molecular springs vary with the helix diameter analogous to classical springs. These new molecular springs provide an alternative mechanism of expansion/contraction controlled by the intrinsic helical geometries of the ladder polymers, which do not unfold under tension unlike more common flexible polymers.







Abstract
We report a general synthetic route toward helical ladder polymers with varying spring constants, built with chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis (CAS). Under tension and compression, these shape&#8208;persistent structures do not unfold, but rather stretch and compress akin classical Hookean springs. Our synthesis is adaptable to helices with different pitch and diameter, which allowed us to investigate how molecular flexibility in solution depends on the exact geometry of the ladder polymers. Specifically, we showed with molecular dynamic simulations and by measuring the longitudinal 1H NMR relaxation times (T1) for our polymers at different Larmor frequencies, that increasing the helix diameter leads to increased flexibility. Our results present initial design rules for tuning the mechanical properties of intrinsically helical ladder polymers in solution, which will help inspire a new class of robust, spring&#8208;like molecular materials with varying mechanical properties.

         <title>Unexpected Formation and Potent Antioxidant Activity of Macrocyclic Dimers Containing Disulfide and Selenide Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation and hydrolysis of selenides containing alkyl or benzylic bis(thioacetoxy) groups resulted in the unexpected formation of macrocyclic dimers, each containing two selenide and two disulfide bonds. These compounds exhibited potent catalytic antioxidant activity. Kinetic experiments indicated an autocatalytic mechanism involving the corresponding selenoxide and hydroxy perhydroxy selenurane intermediates.







Abstract
During attempts to prepare spirodithiaselenuranes as GPx mimetics, a series of unexpected dimeric macrocycles was obtained, each containing two selenide and two disulfide moieties in rings ranging from 18&#8208; to 26&#8208;membered. The products showed potent GPx&#8208;like activity in an NMR assay based on their ability to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with benzyl thiol. The high catalytic activity was attributed to transannular effects during selenide to selenoxide oxidation. This redox process was also characterized by an induction period that indicated autocatalysis in the formation of an intermediate selenoxide from the oxidation of the corresponding selenide.

         <title>Correlation between Electrolyte Chemistry and Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Reversible Ca Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We unravel the unique electrolyte chemistry in Ca metal anodes to tailor the solid electrolyte interphase characteristics, leading to the design of several promising electrolyte formulations for reversible Ca deposition/stripping with a commercially available calcium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt. In particular, 1&#8208;methylimidazole (MeIm)&#8208; and dimethylacetamide (DMAc)&#8208; based electrolytes allow stable cycling with low overpotentials.







Abstract
The development of rechargeable Ca metal batteries (RCMBs) is hindered by the Ca2+ passivating solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). The cation solvation structure dictated by electrolyte chemistry plays a critical role in the SEIs properties. While a relatively weak cation&#8208;solvent binding is preferred in Li metal anodes to promote anion&#8208;derived SEIs, we demonstrate an enhanced Ca deposition/stripping reversibility under a strong cation&#8208;solvent interaction, which is materialized in strongly&#8208;solvating solvent and highly&#8208;dissociated salt combinations. Such electrolyte formulations benefit the formation of solvent&#8208;occupied solvation structure and minimize the anion reduction, resulting in organic&#8208;rich/CaF2&#8208;poor SEIs for reversible Ca metal anodes. Furthermore, RCMBs paired with an organic cathode using the optimized electrolytes are demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. Our work reveals the paradigm shift in SEIs design for Ca metal anodes, opening up new opportunities for emerging RCMBs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tight Host&#8208;Guest Binding with Exceptionally Strong Positive Cooperativity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complexation of DABCO&#8208;based cationic guests with a rigid aromatic oligoamide macrocycle exhibits remarkably high binding affinities with positive cooperativity that is among the strongest for synthetic host&#8211;guest systems. The ultra&#8208;tight binding and extraordinary positive cooperativity are driven by size/shape host&#8211;guest matching, guest&#8208;activated stacking of macrocycles, and multiple charge&#8208;dipole and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions.







Abstract
Cooperativity plays a critical role in self&#8208;assembly and molecular recognition. A rigid aromatic oligoamide macrocycle with a cyclodirectional backbone binds with DABCO&#8208;based cationic guests in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio in high affinities (Ktotal &#8776;1013&#8197;M&#8722;2) in the highly polar DMF. The host&#8211;guest binding also exhibits exceptionally strong positive cooperativity quantified by interaction factors &#945; that are among the largest for synthetic host&#8211;guest systems. The unusually strong positive cooperativity, revealed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and fully corroborated by mass spectrometry, NMR and computational studies, is driven by guest&#8208;induced stacking of the macrocycles and stabilization from the alkyl end chains of the guests, interactions that appear upon binding the second macrocycle. With its tight binding driven by extraordinary positive cooperativity, this host&#8211;guest system provides a tunable platform for studying molecular interactions and for constructing stable supramolecular assemblies.

Linking Kolbe electrolysis that converts biobased acids with microbial fermentation of gaseous electrolysis products in a paired electrolyser creates a highly efficient production route for fuel additives and solvents.







Abstract
The chemical industry is transitioning to more sustainable and biobased processes. One key element of this transition is coupling energy fluxes and feedstock utilization for optimizing processes, routes and efficiencies. Here, we show for the first time the coupling of the Kolbe electrolysis at the anode with a subsequent microbial conversion of the cathodically produced co&#8208;product hydrogen. Kolbe electrolysis of valeric acid yields the liquid drop&#8208;in fuel additive n&#8208;octane. Subsequently, the solvent isopropanol is produced by resting Cupriavidus necator cells using gaseous electrolysis products (esp. CO2 and H2). The resting microbial cells show carbon efficiencies of up to 41&#8201;% and Coulombic/Faradaic efficiencies of 60&#8201;% and 80&#8201;% for anodic and cathodic reactions, respectively. The implementation of a paired electrolyser resulted in superior process performances with overall efficiencies of up to 64.4&#8201;%.

The control over the non&#8208;linear optical property of nanoclusters as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence has been accomplished by exploiting the solvent effect.







Abstract
It remains challenging to control the single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence of metal nanoclusters. In this work, the control over the non&#8208;linear optics of metal nanoclusters as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence has been accomplished via exploiting the solvent effect. An emissive nanocluster, Au9Ag6(SPhtOMe)4(DPPOE)3Cl3, was synthesized and structurally determined. The solvent effect can not only control the fluorescence of this nanocluster, but more significantly, it can also regulate the photoluminescence nature of the cluster as single&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;photon excited fluorescence. We concluded that the increased solution polarity, improved dipole moment, enlarged HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, and reduced solution viscosity of the cluster in solutions endow them with excellent high&#8208;order multiphoton excited fluorescence. The results provide an intriguing cluster template that enables us to manipulate the linear and nonlinear optics at the atomic level.

         <title>Structure Elucidation of In Situ Generated Chiral Hypervalent Iodine Complexes via Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 50, December 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their instability and reactivity, the structure of in situ generated iodane(III) species is challenging to characterize. VCD spectroscopy reveals a cationic species as the most important intermediate of a chiral triazole&#8208;containing aryl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodane catalyst under oxidative conditions.







Abstract
The structure of in situ generated chiral aryl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes obtained under oxidative reaction conditions was not yet observable with experimental techniques and their proposed structures are purely based on DFT calculations. Herein, we establish vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy as an experimental technique to verify DFT&#8208;calculated chiral iodane structures. Based on a chiral triazole&#8208;substituted iodoarene catalyst, we were able to elucidate a yet undescribed cationic chiral iodane as the most populated intermediate under oxidative conditions with a significant intramolecular N&#8722;I&#8208;interaction and no significant interactions with tosylate or m&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid as potential anionic ligands. Instead, aggregation of these substrates was found, which resulted in the formation of a non&#8208;coordinating anionic hydrogen bonded complex. The importance of VCD as a crucial experimental observable is further highlighted by the fact that our initial structural proposal, that was purely based on DFT calculations, could be falsified.

         <title>Boosting Charge Transport in a 2D/3D Perovskite Heterostructure by Selecting an Ordered 2D Perovskite as the Passivator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that an ordered 2D perovskite can significantly boost the photoelectric performance of 2D/3D perovskite&#160;heterostructures. Using selective fluorination of phenyl&#8208;ethyl ammonium (PEA) lead iodide to passivate 3D FA0.8Cs0.2PbI3, we find that the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures passivated by a higher ordered 2D perovskite have lower Urbach energy, yielding a remarkable increase in photoluminescence (PL) intensity, PL lifetime, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities (&#966;&#181;), and carrier diffusion length (LD) for a certain 2D perovskite content. High performance with an ultralong PL lifetime of ~1.3 &#181;s, high &#966;&#181; of ~18.56 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1, and long LD of ~7.85 &#181;m is achieved in the 2D/3D films when passivated by 16.67% para&#8208;fluoro&#8208;PEA2PbI4. This carrier diffusion length is comparable to that of some perovskite single crystals (&gt;5 &#181;m). These findings provide key missing information on how the organic cations of 2D perovskites influence the performance of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Shortwave infrared fluorofluorophores for multicolor in vivo imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing chemical tools to detect and influence biological processes is a cornerstone of chemical biology. Here we combine two tools which rely on orthogonality&#8211; perfluorocarbons and multiplexed shortwave infrared fluorescence imaging&#8211; to track the biodistribution of nanoemulsions in real time in living mice. Drawing inspiration from fluorous and shortwave infrared (SWIR) fluorophore development, we prepared two SWIR&#8208;emissive, fluorous&#8208;soluble chromenylium polymethine dyes. These are the most red&#8208;shifted fluorous fluorophores&#8211; &#8220;fluorofluorophores&#8221;&#8211; to date. After characterizing the dyes, their utility was demonstrated by tracking perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion biodistribution in vivo. Using an excitation&#8208;multiplexed approach to visualize two variables simultaneously, we gained insight into the importance of size and surfactant identity on biodistribution.</dc:description>

         <title>A disordered Rubik&#8217;s cube&#8208;inspired framework for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with ultralong cycle lifespan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with fast&#8208;charge capability and long lifespan could be applied in various sustainable energy storage systems, from personal devices to grid storage. Multi&#8208;metallic hexacyanoferrate (HCF) nanoclusters offer tailorable and unique chemistries and crystal structures that hold great potential in a virtually unlimited compositional space, leading to unexpected properties and interesting novelty in a wide variety of applications such as cathode materials for SIBs. Inspired by the disordered Rubik&#8217;s cube, here, we report that the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept can lead to a very substantial improvement in the sodium storage properties of HCF.

Remarkable air stability and all&#8208;climate performance are observed. Its quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain reaction mechanism and high sodium diffusion coefficient have been measured and analyzed by multiple in&#8208;situ techniques and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Electrosynthetic C&#8722;O Bond Activation in Alcohols and Alcohol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deoxygenative transformations of alcohols and their derivatives are often challenging due to the thermodynamic penalty associated with the cleavage of the C&#8722;O bond. This Review includes preparative protocols and their mechanistic aspects for the activation and functionalization of C&#8722;O bonds, detailing direct and indirect electrosynthetic methods, as well as photoelectrochemical strategies.







Abstract
Alcohols and their derivatives are ubiquitous and versatile motifs in organic synthesis. Deoxygenative transformations of these compounds are often challenging due to the thermodynamic penalty associated with the cleavage of the C&#8722;O bond. However, electrochemically driven redox events have been shown to facilitate the C&#8722;O bond cleavage in alcohols and their derivatives either through direct electron transfer or through the use of electron transfer mediators and electroactive catalysts. Herein, a comprehensive overview of preparative electrochemically mediated protocols for C&#8722;O bond activation and functionalization is detailed, including direct and indirect electrosynthetic methods, as well as photoelectrochemical strategies.

         <title>Suprasomes Based on Host&#8211;Guest Molecular Recognition: An Excellent Alternative to Liposomes in Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suprasomes, considered the third generation of vesicular drug delivery systems, are constructed based on host&#8211;guest recognition. Cisplatin&#8208;loaded suprasomes are promising for photothermal therapy (PTT) and laser&#8208;triggered spatiotemporally controllable drug release. Compared to liposomal nanomedicines, CDDP@Suprasomes realize complete tumor ablation without metastasis as a result of the synergy between PTT and chemotherapy, showing great potential in cancer theranostics.







Abstract
Liposomes and polymersomes, typical vesicular drug delivery systems (DDSs), have faced some limitations in cancer theranostics. Suprasomes, supramolecular vesicles assembled from amphiphiles linked by noncovalent interactions, show potential as new generation of vesicular DDSs. We construct suprasomes based on host&#8211;guest recognition, by which the desired functions can be integrated into carriers without tedious synthesis. Photothermally active host&#8211;guest complex is formed between a functional guest and pillar[5]arene, which further self&#8208;assembles into hollow suprasomes. A supramolecular nanomedicine is developed by encapsulating cisplatin in the suprasomes. The obtained cisplatin@Suprasomes achieve excellent anticancer efficacy and anti&#8208;metastasis combining chemotherapy and photothermal therapy, which ablate the tumors without relapse and metastasis. This work demonstrates the facile functionalization of suprasomes, holding promise as alternatives to liposomes and polymersomes.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroamination of Arylalkenes with Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An excellent enantioselective hydroamination of arylalkenes with Lewis basic secondary amines was developed, via an elegant cobalt&#8208;hydride mediated oxidative hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) process, leading to the synthesis of a series of valuable &#945;&#8208;chiral tertiary amines in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric hydroamination of alkenes with Lewis basic amines is of great interest but remains a challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we developed a Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of arylalkenes directly using commercially accessible secondary amines. This process enables the efficient access to valuable &#945;&#8208;chiral tertiary amines in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction includes a CoH&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) with arylalkenes, followed by a pivotal catalyst controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated electrophilic cationic alkylcobalt(IV) species and free amines. This radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy not only provides a straightforward and alternative approach for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, but also underpins the substantial opportunities in developing asymmetric radical functionalization of alkenes with various free nucleophiles in oxidative MHAT catalysis.

         <title>Single&#8208;entity Electrochemistry Unveils Dynamic Transformation during Tandem Catalysis of Cu2O and Co3O4 for Converting NO3&#8722; to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemically converting nitrate to ammonia is an essential and sustainable approach to restoring the globally perturbed nitrogen cycle. The rational design of catalysts for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) based on a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is of high significance. We report a Cu2O+Co3O4 tandem catalyst which enhances the NH3 production rate by ~2.7&#8208;fold com&#173;pared to Co3O4 and ~7.5&#8208;fold compared with Cu2O, respectively. Most importantly, we precisely place single Cu2O and Co3O4 cube&#8208;shaped nanoparticles individually and together on carbon nano&#173;electrodes provide insight into the mechanism of the tandem catalysis. The structural and phase evolution of the individual Cu2O+Co3O4 nanocubes during NO3RR is unveiled using identical location trans&#173;mission electron microscopy. Combining single&#8208;entity electrochemis&#173;try with precise nano&#8208;placement sheds light on the dynamic transfor&#173;mation of single catalyst particles during tandem catalysis in a direct way.</dc:description>

         <title>Caught in Action: Visualizing Dynamic Nanostructures Within Supramolecular Systems Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular systems chemistry has been an area of active research to develop nanomaterials with life&#8208;like functions. Progress in systems chemistry relies on our ability to probe the nanostructure formation in solution. Often visualizing the dynamics of nanostructures which transform over time is a formidable challenge. This necessitates a paradigm shift from dry sample imaging towards solution&#8208;based techniques. &#160;We review the application of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques for real&#8208;time,&#160;  in situ  &#160;visualization of dynamic self&#8208;assembly processes. We present how solution&#8208;based techniques namely optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy, solution&#8208;state atomic force microscopy, liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and other emerging techniques are revolutionizing our understanding of active and adaptive nanomaterials with life&#8208;like functions. This review provides the visualization toolbox and futuristic vision to tap the potential of dynamic nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Li&#8208;ion Storage and Dynamics in TiO2 Nanoparticle Clusters Probed by Smart Scanning Electrochemical Cell Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anatase TiO2 is a promising material for Li&#8208;ion (Li+) batteries with fast charging capability. However, Li+ (de)intercalation dynamics in TiO2 remain elusive and reported diffusivities span many orders of magnitude. Here, we develop a smart protocol for scanning electroche&#173;mical cell microscopy (SECCM) with in situ optical microscopy (OM) to enable the high&#8208;throughput charge/discharge analysis of single TiO2 nanoparticle clusters. Directly probing active nanoparticles revealed that TiO2 with a size of ~50 nm can store over 30% of the theoretical capacity at an extremely fast charge/discharge rate of ~100 C. This finding of fast Li+ storage in TiO2 particles strengthens its potential for fast&#8208;charging batteries. More generally, smart SECCM&#8208;OM should find wide applications for high&#8208;throughput electrochemical screening of nanostructured materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Benchmark Dynamics of Dipolar Molecular Rotors in Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), comprising a wheel&#8208;shaped ligand with geminal rotating fluorine atoms, produced benchmark mobility of correlated dipolar rotors at 2 K, with practically null activation energy (Ea = 17 cal/mol). 1H T1 NMR revealed multiple relaxation phenomena due to the exchange among correlated dipole&#8208;rotor configurations. Synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction at 4 K, Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics and phonon calculations showed the fluid landscape and pointed out a cascade mechanism converting dipole configurations into each other. &#160;Gas accessibility, shown by hyperpolarized&#8208;Xe NMR, allowed for chemical stimuli intervention: CO2 triggered dipole reorientation, reducing their collective dynamics and stimulating a dipole configuration change in the crystal. Dynamic materials under limited thermal noise and high responsiveness enable the fabrication of molecular machines with low energy dissipation and controllable dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron Nanoparticles Protected by Chainmail&#8208;structured Graphene for Durable Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is an appealing technology for regulating the nitrogen cycle. Metallic iron is one of the well&#8208;known electrocatalysts for NO3RR, but it suffers from poor durability due to leaching and oxidation of iron during the electrocatalytic process. In this work, a graphene&#8208;nanochainmail&#8208;protected iron nanoparticle (Fe@Gnc) electrocatalyst is reported. It displays superior nitrate removal efficiency and high nitrogen selectivity. Notably, the catalyst delivers exceptional stability and durability, with the nitrate removal rate and nitrogen selectivity remained ~96% of that of the first time after up to 40 cycles (24 h for one cycle). As expected, the conductive graphene nanochainmail provides robust protection for the internal iron active sites, allowing Fe@Gnc to maintain its long&#8208;lasting electrochemical nitrate catalytic activity. This research proposes a workable solution for the scientific challenge of poor lasting ability of iron&#8208;based electrocatalysts in large&#8208;scale industrialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Durable Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia over Defective Pseudobrookite Fe2TiO5 Nanofibers with Abundant&#160;Oxygen Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We propose the pseudobrookite Fe2TiO5 nanofiber with abundant oxygen vacancies as a new electrocatalyst to ambiently reduce nitrate to ammonia. Such catalyst achieves a large NH3 yield of 0.73 mmol h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1cat. and a high Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of 87.6% in phosphate buffer saline solution with 0.1M NaNO3, which is lifted to 1.36 mmol h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1cat. and 96.06% at &#8208;0.9 V vs. RHE for nitrite conversion to ammonia in 0.1M NaNO2. It also shows excellent electrochemical durability and structural stability. Theoretical calculation reveals the enhanced conductivity of this catalyst and an extremely low free energy of &#8208;0.28 eV for nitrate adsorption at the presence of vacant oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks as electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal complexes are well&#8208;known homogeneous electrocatalysts. In this regard, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) can be considered as an ensemble of transition metal complexes ordered in a periodic arrangement. In addition, MOFs have several additional positive structural features that makes them suitable for electrocatalysis, including large surface area, high porosity, and high content of accessible transition metal with exchangeable coordination positions. The present review describes the current state in the use of MOFs as electrocatalysts, both as host of electroactive guests and their direct electrocatalytic activity, particularly in the case of bimetallic MOFs. The field of MOF&#8208;derived materials is purposely not covered, focusing on the direct use of MOFs or its composites as electrocatalysts. Special attention has been paid to present strategies to overcome their poor electrical conductivity and limited stability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction with Fischer metal carbene intermediates bearing an electron&#8208;rich alkoxyl or siloxyl group remains a big challenge due to the lack of readily available corresponding carbene precursors. Herein, we report the coupling of alkynes with the Fischer&#8208;type copper carbene species bearing a &#945;&#8208;siloxyl group, which could be in&#8208;situ generated from acylsilanes catalytically under photoirradiation and redox&#8208;neutral conditions. The side&#8208;arm modified bisoxazoline (SaBox) ligands prove to be crucial for this coupling reaction, which provides the corresponding alkynyl alcohol in high yields with remarkable heterocycle tolerance and broad substrate scope.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Kinetics Support a Second Coordination Sphere Mechanism in Metal&#8208;Based Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based formate dehydrogenases are molybdenum or tungsten&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze the interconversion between formate and CO  2  . According to the current consensus, the metal ion of the catalytic center in its active form is coordinated by 6 S (or 5 S and 1 Se) atoms, leaving no free coordination site to which formate could bind to the metal. Some authors have proposed that one of the active site ligands decoordinates during turnover to allow formate binding. Another proposal is that the oxidation of formate takes place in the second coordination sphere of the metal. Here, we have used electrochemical steady&#8208;state kinetics to elucidate the order of the steps in the catalytic cycle of two formate dehydrogenases. Our results strongly support the &#8220;second coordination sphere&#8221; hypothesis.</dc:description>

         <title>MOFs with Open Metal(III) Sites for the Environmental Capture of Polar Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOF) with open metal sites (OMS) interact strongly with a range of polar gases/vapors. However, under ambient conditions, their selective adsorption is generally impaired due to a high OMS affinity to water. This led previously to the privilege selection of hydrophobic MOFs for the selective capture/detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Herein, we show that this paradigm is challenged by metal(III) polycarboxylates MOFs, bearing a high concentration of OMS, as MIL&#8208;100(Fe), enabling the selective capture of polar VOCs even in the presence of water. With experimental and computational tools, including single&#8208;component gravimetric and dynamic mixture adsorption measurements, in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory calculations we reveal that this adsorption mechanism involves a direct coordination of the VOC on the OMS, associated with an interaction energy that exceeds that of water. Hence, MOFs with OMS are demonstrated to be of interest for air purification purposes</dc:description>

         <title>Aerobic C&#8211;N Bond Formation through Enzymatic Nitroso&#8208;Ene&#8208;Type Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biocatalytic oxidation of acylated hydroxylamines enables the direct and selective introduction of nitrogen functionalities via activation of allylic C&#8208;H bonds. Utilizing either laccases or an oxidase/peroxidase couple for the formal dehydrogenation of N&#8208;hydroxycarbamates and hydroxamic acids with air as terminal oxidant, acylnitroso species are generated under particularly mild aqueous conditions. The reactive intermediates undergo C&#8208;N bond formation through an ene&#8208;type mechanism and provide high yields both in intramolecular and intermolecular enzymatic aminations. Investigations on different pathways of the two biocatalytic systems and labelling studies provide more insights into this unprecedented promiscuity of classical oxidoreductases as catalysts for nitroso&#8208;based transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Spin Polarization of a Narrow Linewidth Electron Spin Qubit in a Chromophore/Stable&#8208;Radical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoexcited organic chromophores appended to stable radicals can serve as qubit and/or qudit candidates for quantum information applications. 1,6,7,12&#8208;Tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxy)&#8208;perylene&#8208;3,4:9,10&#8208;bis(dicarboximide) (tpPDI) linked to a partially deuterated &#945;,&#947;&#8208;bisdiphenylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylallyl radical (BDPA&#8208;d16) was synthesized and characterized by time&#8208;resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Photoexcitation of tpPDI&#8208;BDPA&#8208;d16 results in ultrafast radical&#8208;enhanced intersystem crossing to produce&#160;a quartet state (Q) followed by formation of a spin&#8208;polarized doublet ground state (D0). Pulse&#8208;EPR experiments confirmed the spin multiplicity of Q and yielded coherence times of Tm = 2.1 &#177; 0.1 &#956;s and 2.8 &#177; 0.2 &#956;s for Q and D0, respectively. BDPA&#8208;d16 eliminates the dominant 1H hyperfine couplings, resulting in a single narrow line for both the Q and D0 states, which enhances the spectral resolution needed for good qubit addressability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Synthesis and reactivity of transition metal compounds bearing &#8220;naked&#8221; pnictogen atoms is an active research area with remarkable bonding patterns observed in the formed compounds. Within this field, intense investigations on the coordination behavior of complexes possessing Pn and Asn (2 &#8804; n &#8804; 5) moieties have been conducted. However, studies on heavier analogues have been ignored so far due to arduous challenges related to low yields and moderate air stability. Herein, we present the first in&#8208;depth study addressing the reactivity of organometallic complexes containing Sb&#8208;donor atoms with several Ag(I) salts. These reactions afforded twelve unprecedented aggregates as monomers, dimers as well as three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered chains of Ag(I) ions claimed in the literature to be inaccessible. Interatomic distances as well as computational evidence obtained with help of several different methods suggest the presence of Ag&#183;&#183;&#183;Ag interactions in all complexes containing more than one Ag(I) ion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Diesters are of fundamental importance in the chemical industry and are used for many applications, e.g. plasticizers, surfactants, emulsifiers, and lubricants. Herein, we present a straightforward and efficient method for the selective synthesis of diesters via palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct carbonylation of di&#8208; or polyols with readily available alkenes. Key&#8208;to&#8208;success is the use of a specific palladium catalyst with the &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8208;base&#8221; ligand L16 providing esterification of all alcohols and a high n/iso ratio. The synthesized diesters were evaluated as potential plasticizers in PVC films by measuring the glass transition temperature (Tg) via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).</dc:description>

         <title>An Organic Molecular Nanobarrel that Hosts and Solubilizes C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cages have gained increasing attention in recent years as molecular hosts and porous materials. Among these, barrel&#8208;shaped cages or molecular nanobarrels are promising systems to encapsulate large hosts as they possess windows of the same size as their internal cavity. However, these systems have received little attention and remain practically unexplored despite their potential. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a new trigonal prismatic organic nanobarrel with two large triangular windows with a diameter of 12.7 &#197; optimal for the encapsulation of C60. Remarkably, this organic nanobarrel shows a high affinity for C60 in solvents in which C60 is virtually insoluble, providing stable solutions of C60.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanide Binding to [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Stabilizes the Alternative Configuration of the Proton Transfer Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenases are H2 converting enzymes that harbor catalytic cofactors in which iron (Fe) ions are coordinated by biologically unusual carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide (CN&#8211;) ligands. Extrinsic CO and CN&#8211;, however, inhibit hydrogenases. The mechanism by which CN&#8211; binds to [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases is not known. Here, we obtained crystal structures of the CN&#8211;&#8208;treated [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase CpI from Clostridium pasteurianum. The high resolution of 1.39 &#197; allowed us to distinguish intrinsic CN&#8211; and CO ligands and to show that extrinsic CN&#8211; binds to the open coordination site of the cofactor where CO is known to bind. In contrast to other inhibitors, CN&#8211; treated crystals show conformational changes of conserved residues within the proton transfer pathway which could allow a direct proton transfer between E279 and S319. This configuration has been proposed to be vital for efficient proton transfer, but has never been observed structurally.</dc:description>

         <title>Ceria&#8208;supported Cobalt Catalyst for LowTemperature Methanation at Low Partial Pressures of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct catalytic conversion of atmospheric CO2 to valuable chemicals is a promising solution to avert negative consequences of a rising CO2 concentration. However, heterogeneous catalysts efficient at low partial pressures of CO2 still need to be developed. Here, we explore Co/CeO2 as a catalyst for methanation of diluted CO2 streams. This material displays an excellent performance at reaction temperatures as low as 175 &#176;C and CO2 partial pressures as low as 0.4 mbar (the atmospheric CO2 concentration). To gain mechanistic understanding of this unusual activity, we employed in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and operando infrared spectroscopy. The higher surface concentration and reactivity of formates and carbonyls &#8212; key reaction intermediates &#8212; explain the superior activity of Co/CeO2 compared to a conventional Co/SiO2 catalyst. This work emphasizes the catalytic role of the cobalt&#8211;ceria interface and will aid in developing more efficient CO2 hydrogenation catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Tunability of Charge Transport in 2D Inorganic Molecular Crystals by Pressure Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique intermolecular van der Waals force in emerging two&#8208;dimensional inorganic molecular crystals (2DIMCs) endows them with highly tunable structures and properties upon applying external stimuli. Using high pressure to modulate the intermolecular bonding, here we reveal the highly tunable charge transport behavior in 2DIMCs for the first time, from an insulator to a semiconductor. As pressure increases, 2D &#945;&#8208;Sb2O3 molecular crystal undergoes three isostructural transitions, and the intermolecular bonding enhances gradually, which results in a considerably decreased bandgap by 25% and a greatly enhanced charge transport. Impressively, the in&#8208;situ resistivity measurement of the &#945;&#8208;Sb2O3 flake shows a sharp drop by 5 orders of magnitude in 0 &#8211; 3.2 GPa. This work sheds new light on the manipulation of charge transport in 2DIMCs and is of great significance for promoting the fundamental understanding and potential applications of 2DIMCs in advanced modern technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination of Polyketide Release and Multiple Detoxification Pathways for Tolerable Production of Fungal Mycotoxins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient biosynthesis of microbial bioactive natural products (NPs) is beneficial for the survival of producers, while self&#8208;protection is necessary to avoid self&#8208;harm resulting from over&#8208;accumulation of NPs. The underlying mechanisms for the effective but tolerable production of bioactive NPs is not well understood. Here in the biosynthesis of two fungal polyketide mycotoxins aurovertin E (1) and asteltoxin (4), we show that the cyclases in the gene clusters promote the release of the polyketide backbone, and reveal that a signal peptide is crucial for their subcellular localization and full activity. Meanwhile, the fungus adopts enzymatic acetylation as the major detoxification pathway of 1. If intermediates are over&#8208;produced, the non&#8208;enzymatic shunt pathways work as salvage pathways to avoid excessive accumulation of the toxic metabolites for self&#8208;protection. These findings provided new insights into the interplay of efficient backbone release and multiple detoxification strategies for the production of fungal bioactive NPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanosheets@Crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanorods for High Current&#8208;density Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is vitally important to develop highly active, robust and low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in neutral solution especially at large current density. In this work, amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheets@crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorods (Am&#8208;Mo&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5) was synthesized using a facil one&#8208;step strategy. In phosphate buffer saline solution, the Am&#8208;Mo&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5 shows tiny overpotentials of 48 and 209 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 238 and 514 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 and 1,000 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, Am&#8208;Mo&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5delivers excellent stability for at least 300 h without obvious degradation. Theoretical calculations revealed that the Ni sites in the defect&#8208;rich amorphous structure of Am&#8208;Mo&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5 owns higher electron state density and strengthened the binding energy of H2O, which will optimize H adsorption/desorption energy barriers and reduce the adsorption energy of OER determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Tough and Conductive Nacre&#8208;inspired MXene/epoxy Layered Bulk Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A long&#8208;standing quest in materials science has been the development of tough epoxy resin nanocomposites used in numerous applications. Inspired by nacre, herein, we report tough and conductive MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites. The orientation of MXene lamellar scaffolds is enhanced by annealing treatment. The improved interfacial interactions between MXene lamellar scaffold and epoxy through surface chemical modification resulted in a synergistic effect. Tailoring the interlayer spacing of MXene nanosheets to a critical distance resulted in the fracture toughness about eight times higher than pure epoxy, surpassing other epoxy nanocomposites. Our nacre&#8208;inspired MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites also show high electrical conductivity that provides self&#8208;monitoring capability to the structure integrity and exhibits an excellent electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency. Our proposed strategy provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance epoxy nanocomposites.</dc:description>

         <title>Potent De Novo Macrocyclic Peptides that Inhibit O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase Through an Allosteric Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosyltransferases are a notoriously difficult to inhibit superfamily of enzymes. Here we apply an mRNA display technology integrated with genetic code reprogramming, referred to as the RaPID (random non&#8208;standard peptides integrated discovery) system, to identify macrocyclic peptides with high binding affinities for O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT). These macrocycles inhibit OGT activity through an allosteric mechanism that is driven by their binding to the tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT. Saturation mutagenesis in a maturation screen using 39 amino acids, including 22 non&#8208;canonical residues, led to an improved unnatural macrocycle that is ~40 times more potent than the parent compound (Kiapp = 1.5 nM). Subsequent derivatization delivered a biotinylated derivative that enabled one&#8208;step affinity purification of OGT from complex samples. The high potency and novel mechanism of action of these OGT ligands should enable new approaches to elucidate the specificity and regulation of OGT.</dc:description>

         <title>Actinorhodin Biosynthesis Terminates with an Unprecedented Biaryl Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A plethora of dimeric natural products exist with diverse chemical structures and biological activities. A major strategy for dimerization is aryl coupling reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 or laccase. Actinorhodin (ACT) from Streptomyces coelicolor has a dimeric pyranonaphthoquinone structure connected by a C&#8208;C bond. Here, we identified a NmrA&#8208;family dimerizing enzyme, ActVA&#8208;ORF4, and a cofactor independent oxidase, ActVA&#8208;ORF3, both involved in the last step of ACT biosynthesis. ActVA&#8208;ORF4 is a unique &#160;NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the inter&#8208;molecular C&#8208;C bond formation using 8&#8208;hydroxydihydrokalafungin (DHK&#8208;OH) as the sole substrate. On the other hand, ActVA&#8208;ORF3 was found to be a quinone&#8208;forming enzyme that produces the coupling substrate, DHK&#8208;OH, and the final product, ACT. Consequently, the functional assignment of all essential enzymes in ACT biosynthesis was completed, which would be a landmark in our understanding of the entire biosynthetic pathway for one of the best&#8208;known model natural products, ACT.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Immune checkpoint blockade has become a paradigm&#8208;shifting treatment modality to combat cancer, while conventional administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1), often shows unsatisfactory immune responses and lead to severe immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs). Herein, we develop a PD&#8208;L1 aptamer (aptPD&#8208;L1) based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), which consists of an oxaliplatin (OXA) encapsulated metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticle core and a dense shell of aptPD&#8208;L1 (denoted as M@O&#8208;A). Upon light irradiation, such nanosystem enables concurrent photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy and enhanced immunotherapy on one shot to inhibit both primary colorectal tumors and untreated distant tumors in mice. Notably, M@O&#8208;A shows scarcely any systemic immunotoxicity in a clinical irAEs&#8208;mimic transgenic mouse model. Collectively, this study presents a novel strategy for priming robust photo&#8208;immunotherapy against cancer with enhanced safety.</dc:description>

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Catalyzes Benzene Ring Formation in the Biosynthesis of Trialkyl&#8208;Substituted Aromatic Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lorneic acid and related natural products are featured by a trialkyl&#8208;substituted benzene rings. The formation of the aromatic core in the middle of polyketide chain is unusual. We characterized a cytochrome P450 enzyme that can catalyze the hallmark benzene ring formation from an acyclic polyene substrate through genetic and biochemical analysis. Using this P450 as a beacon for genome mining, we obtained 12 homologous type I PKS gene clusters, among which two gene clusters are activated and are able to produce trialkyl substituted aromatic polyketides. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the plausible mechanism for P450&#8208;catalyzed benzene ring formation. Our work reveals a new strategy in nature to construct the benzene ring.</dc:description>

Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the plausible mechanism for P450-catalyzed benzene ring formation. Our work reveals a new strategy in nature to construct the benzene ring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Giant Water Uptake Enabled Ultrahigh Proton Conductivity of Graphdiyne Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton conductors have attracted great attention in various fields, especially in energy production. Here, we find that graphdiyne oxide (GDYO), derived from graphdiyne (GDY), features the highest proton conductivity of 0.54 S cm&#8722;1 (100% RH, 348 K) among the oxidized carbon allotropes reported so far. The sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;co&#8208;hybridized carbon skeleton of GDY enables GDYO with the giant water uptake, which is 2.4 times larger than that of graphene oxide (GO), resulting in ultrahigh proton conductivity by increasing the proton concentration and proton conduction pathways. This ultrahigh proton conductivity of GDYO is further proved in a methanol fuel cell by using GDYO membrane as proton exchange membrane. The GDYO membrane enables the cell with higher open circuit potential, larger power density and lower methanol permeability, compared with commercial Nafion 117. Moreover, the GDYO membrane bears high ion exchange capacity, good acidic stability and low swelling ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Defined Water&#8208;Soluble Metallofullerene Derivatives towards Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular metallobuckytrio (MBT) platform provides a family of structurally defined, water&#8208;soluble metallofullerene derivatives that can safely carry rare&#8208;earth elements in tailorable molecules, showing promise in biomedicines including MRI contrast agents and photosensitizers.







Abstract
Endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) are excellent carriers of rare&#8208;earth element (REE) ions in biomedical applications because they preclude the release of toxic metal ions. However, existing approaches to synthesize water&#8208;soluble EMF derivatives yield mixtures that inhibit precise drug design. Here we report the synthesis of metallobuckytrio (MBT), a three&#8208;buckyball system, as a modular platform to develop structurally defined water&#8208;soluble EMF derivatives with ligands by choice. Demonstrated with PEG ligands, the resulting water&#8208;soluble MBTs show superb biocompatibility. The Gd MBTs exhibit superior T1 relaxivity than typical Gd complexes, potentially superseding current clinical MRI contrast agents in both safety and efficiency. The Lu MBTs generated reactive oxygen species upon light irradiation, showing promise as photosensitizers. With their modular nature to incorporate other ligands, we anticipate the MBT platform to open new paths towards bio&#8208;specific REE drugs.

         <title>Single Crystalline, Non&#8208;stoichiometric Cocrystals of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept non&#8208;stoichiometric cocrystalline frameworks are formed using hexahydropyrene and pyrene derivatives with hydrogen&#8208;bonding modules, CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py. The structures and composition ratio were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Microscopic Raman spectroscopy on a single crystal showed that components are distributed gradationally and/or not homogeneously in the crystal.







Abstract
Porous frameworks composed of non&#8208;stoichiometrically mixed multicomponent molecules attract much attention from a functional viewpoint. However, their designed preparation and precise structural characterization remain challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that cocrystallization of tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)hexahydropyrene and pyrene derivatives (CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py, respectively) yields non&#8208;stoichiometric mixed frameworks through networking via hydrogen bonding. The composition ratio of CP&#8208;Hp and CP&#8208;Py in the framework was determined by single crystalline X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, indicating that the mixed frameworks were formed over a wide range of composition ratios. Furthermore, microscopic Raman spectroscopy on the single crystal indicates that the components are not uniformly distributed such as ideal solid solution, but are done gradationally or inhomogeneously.

         <title>Anion Storage Chemistry of Organic Cathodes for High&#8208;Energy and High&#8208;Power Density Divalent Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) composite cathode is employed for high&#8208;voltage (&gt;3&#8197;V) rechargeable Mg and Ca batteries based on the tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy) borate [B(hfip)4] anion storage chemistry. Mechanistic studies elucidate the unique redox mechanism of the amine moieties in the active cathode material. The dual&#8208;ion batteries exhibit both high energy and high power&#8208;density and long cycle&#8208;life.







Abstract
Multivalent batteries show promising prospects for next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage applications. Herein, we report a polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) composite cathode capable of highly reversible storage of tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy) borate [B(hfip)4] anions in both Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) battery systems. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal the redox reaction mechanism of the PTPAn cathode material. The Mg and Ca cells exhibit a cell voltage &gt;3&#8197;V, a high&#8208;power density of &#8764;&#8764;3000&#8197;W kg&#8722;1 and a high&#8208;energy density of &#8764;&#8764;300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, the combination of the PTPAn cathode with a calcium&#8208;tin (Ca&#8722;Sn) alloy anode could enable a long battery&#8208;life of 3000&#8197;cycles with a capacity retention of 60&#8201;%. The anion storage chemistry associated with dual&#8208;ion electrochemical concept demonstrates a new feasible pathway towards high&#8208;performance divalent ion batteries.

         <title>Interparticle Charge&#8208;Transport&#8208;Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence of Quantum&#8208;Dot Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term ambiguity in mechanistic understanding of charge&#8208;transfer routes toward electrochemiluminescence generation has been deciphered in this study by designing highly tunable quantum dot aerogels as novel luminophores. The interparticle charge&#8208;transfer route has been explicitly demonstrated and selectively enhanced based on the strong electronic coupling of quantum dot aerogels.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) represents a widely explored technique to generate light, in which the emission intensity relies critically on the charge&#8208;transfer reactions between electrogenerated radicals. Two types of charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms have been postulated for ECL generation, but the manipulation and effective probing of these routes remain a fundamental challenge. Here, we demonstrate the design of quantum dot (QD) aerogels as novel ECL luminophores via a versatile water&#8208;induced gelation strategy. The strong electronic coupling between adjacent QDs enables efficient charge transport within the aerogel network, leading to the generation of highly efficient ECL based on the selectively improved interparticle charge&#8208;transfer route. This mechanism is further verified by designing CdSe&#8208;CdTe mixed QD aerogels, where the two mechanistic routes are clearly decoupled for ECL generation. We anticipate our work will advance the fundamental understanding of ECL and prove useful for designing next&#8208;generation QD&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Characterization of a Ferryl Flip in Electronically Tuned Nonheme Complexes. Consequences in Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isomerization of pairs of electronically tunned oxoiron(IV) geometrical isomers is described, as a model for the &#8220;ferryl flip&#8221; observed in non&#8208;heme enzymes. The position of the oxo ligand in the coordination sphere of the iron center has a strong impact on the hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) activity of the oxoiron(IV) compounds, while electronic effects do not play a significant role in HAT reactions.







Abstract
Two oxoiron(IV) isomers (R2a and R2b) of general formula [FeIV(O)(RPyNMe3)(CH3CN)]2+ are obtained by reaction of their iron(II) precursor with NBu4IO4. The two isomers differ in the position of the oxo ligand, cis and trans to the pyridine donor. The mechanism of isomerization between R2a and R2b has been determined by kinetic and computational analyses uncovering an unprecedented path for interconversion of geometrical oxoiron(IV) isomers. The activity of the two oxoiron(IV) isomers in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions shows that R2a reacts one order of magnitude faster than R2b, which is explained by a repulsive noncovalent interaction between the ligand and the substrate in R2b. Interestingly, the electronic properties of the R substituent in the ligand pyridine ring do not have a significant effect on reaction rates. Overall, the intrinsic structural aspects of each isomer define their relative HAT reactivity, overcoming changes in electronic properties of the ligand.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Mechanochemistry Unlocks the Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;Type Coupling of Aryl Sulfamates at Different Scales</title>

         <dc:description>
A recent report from Leitch, Browne and co&#8208;workers demonstrated how a programmable jar heater delivers an efficient methodology for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type cross coupling reaction of aryl sulfamates and aryl boronic acid species. This methodology can be readily upscaled 200&#8208;fold using twin&#8208;screw extrusion methodologies, demonstrating scalability of mechanochemical catalytic processes.







Abstract
Several mechanochemically heated processes have been published in recent years. However, precise control over the mechanochemical catalysed coupling reactions remained elusive. A recent report from Leitch, Browne and co&#8208;workers demonstrated how a programmable jar heater manifold delivers an efficient methodology for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type cross coupling reaction of aryl sulfamates and aryl boronic acid species. This methodology can be readily upscaled 200&#8208;fold using twin&#8208;screw extrusion methodologies.

         <title>Controlling Selectivity in Shuttle Hetero&#8208;difunctionalization Reactions: Electrochemical Transfer Halo&#8208;thiolation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
e&#8208;Shuttle catalysis is a promising tool to transfer functional groups between molecules forth and back via a consecutive paired electrolysis mechanism. A rare example of shuttle hetero&#8208;difunctionalization to transfer two distinct functional groups between &#946;&#8208;halosulfides and unsaturated hydrocarbons is shown by Siegfried&#8197;R. Waldvogel, Bill Morandi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202213630). The preferential anodic oxidation of one anion over the other is a key technique to ensure high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity in this process.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nickel&#8208;iron oxyhydroxide catalysts suffer from loss of iron under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202214541), Jaeyoung Lee and co&#8208;workers report a stable OER electrocatalyst by adding tetraphenylporphyrin protective layers. They accelerate the redeposition of eluted iron onto the electrocatalyst by forming a nonpolar&#8211;polar interface. This not only prolongs the iron population but also the lifetime of the electrocatalyst.

         <title>Sonochemically&#8208;Induced Reduction of Alkenes to Alkanes with Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8722;H bond of NH3 can be cleaved within cavitation bubbles, generated by ultrasonic irradiation at a high frequency, leading to the in situ formation of a diimide, which then induces the hydrogenation of alkenes, as reported by Fran&#231;ois J&#233;r&#244;me et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202212719). Advantageously, this technique does not involve any transition metal and releases N2 as a sole coproduct.

&lt;p&gt;The N&#8722;H bond of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be cleaved within cavitation bubbles, generated by ultrasonic irradiation at a high frequency, leading to the in situ formation of a diimide, which then induces the hydrogenation of alkenes, as reported by Fran&#231;ois J&#233;r&#244;me et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202212719"&gt;10.1002/anie.202212719&lt;/a&gt;). Advantageously, this technique does not involve any transition metal and releases N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a sole coproduct.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Photophysics in Hydrazone&#8208;Based Hierarchical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As hibiscus flowers bloom in the morning and close at night, hydrazone derivatives exhibit photoresponsive behavior as a function of an excitation wavelength. While hydrazone &#8220;flowers&#8221; wilt in the wrong environment, they blossom in a MOF &#8220;vase&#8221;. Thus, integration of hydrazone&#8208;photoswitches in proper 3D environments cultivates solution&#8208;like photophysical properties in solid&#8208;state materials and allows for modulation of energy transfer processes.







Abstract
Confinement&#8208;imposed photophysics was probed for novel stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrazone&#8208;based compounds demonstrating a conceptual difference in their behavior within 2D versus 3D porous matrices for the first time. The challenges associated with photoswitch isomerization arising from host interactions with photochromic compounds in 2D scaffolds could be overcome in 3D materials. Solution&#8208;like photoisomerization rate constants were realized for sterically demanding hydrazone derivatives in the solid state through their coordinative immobilization in 3D scaffolds. According to steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photophysical measurements and theoretical modeling, this approach provides access to hydrazone&#8208;based materials with fast photoisomerization kinetics in the solid state. Fast isomerization of integrated hydrazone derivatives allows for probing and tailoring resonance energy transfer (ET) processes as a function of excitation wavelength, providing a novel pathway for ET modulation.

         <title>Empowering Zn Electrode Current Capability Along Interfacial Stability by Optimizing Intrinsic Safe Organic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical performances of Zn metal anodes are adjusted using functionalized ionic liquid and phosphate&#8208;based safe organic solvents, resulting in high Columbic efficiency (CE) of over 99&#8201;%, long cycle life up to 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and large areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The interface derived from ionic liquid effectively accelerates the Zn nucleation, ensures smooth deposit, and reduces side reactions.







Abstract
Metallic Zn is one of the most promising anodes, but its practical application has been hindered by dendritic growth and serious interfacial reactions in conventional electrolytes. Herein, ionic liquids are adopted to prepare intrinsically safe electrolytes via combining with TEP or TMP solvents. With this synergy effect, the blends of TEP/TMP with an IL fraction of &#8776;25&#8197;wt% are found to be promising electrolytes, with ionic conductivities comparable to those of standard phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes while electrochemical stabilities are considerably improved; over 1000&#8197;h at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and &#8776;350&#8197;h at 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a large areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The use of functionalized IL turns out to be a key factor in enhancing the Zn2+ transport due to the interaction of Zn2+ ions with IL&#8208;zincophilic sites resulting in reduced interfacial resistance between the electrodes and electrolyte upon cycling leading to spongy&#8208;like highly porous, homogeneous, and dendrite&#8208;free zinc as an anode material.

         <title>Retarding the Shuttling Ions in the Electrochromic TiO2 with Extensive Crystallographic Imperfections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct sites for ion accommodation are found in an electrochromic transition&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide (ETMO) nanowire film by the galvanostatic transmittance evolution: the normal site and the abnormal site. Ions at the abnormal sites contribute little to coloration but retard the shuttling rate. These findings give a clear picture of the ion shuttling process, allowing the electrochromic performance to be enhanced for the design of efficient smart windows.







Abstract
To understand the role of structure imperfections on the performance of electrochromic transition metal oxide (ETMO) is challenging for the design of efficient smart windows. Herein, we investigate the performance evolution with tunable crystallographic imperfections for rutile TiO2 nanowire film (TNF). Structure imperfections, originating mainly from the copious oxygen deficiency, are apt to cumulatively retard the shuttling ions, resulting in the response rate for raw TNF being less than the half that of TNF annealed at 500&#8201;&#176;C. We describe ion accommodation sites as a convolution of normal site and abnormal site, in which the normal site performs reversible coloration but the abnormal site contributes only to charge storage, which gives a rationale for the non&#8208;linear coloration and rate capability loss. These findings give a clear picture of the ion shuttling process, which is insightful for enhancing the electrochromic performance via structure reprogramming.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens for In Vivo Theranostics of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) probe, DNTPH, was designed by balancing hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties. DNTPH displays excellent blood&#8211;brain barrier permeability and binds to &#946;&#8208;amyloid A&#946;42 fibrils selectively. Remarkably, DNTPH exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on A&#946; fibrosis, thus attenuating A&#946;&#8208;induced neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. DNTPH serves as the first AIE in vivo theranostic agent for near&#8208;infrared imaging of A&#946;42 plaques and AD therapy.







Abstract
Optimized theranostic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain almost absent from bench to clinic. Current probes and drugs attempting to prevent &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) fibrosis encounter failures due to the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetration challenge and blind intervention time window. Herein, we design a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) probe, DNTPH, via balanced hydrophobicity&#8208;hydrophilicity strategy. DNTPH binds selectively to A&#946; fibrils with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. In vivo imaging revealed its excellent BBB permeability and long&#8208;term tracking ability with high&#8208;performance AD diagnosis. Remarkably, DNTPH exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on A&#946; fibrosis and promotes fibril disassembly, thereby attenuating A&#946;&#8208;induced neurotoxicity. DNTPH treatment significantly reduced A&#946; plaques and rescued learning deficits in AD mice. Thus, DNTPH serves as the first AIE in vivo theranostic agent for real&#8208;time NIR imaging of A&#946; plaques and AD therapy simultaneously.

Thus, DNTPH serves as the first AIE in vivo theranostic agent for real-time NIR imaging of A&#946; plaques and AD therapy simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Properties of High Nitrogen Content Carbonaceous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon materials are attractive alternatives to metal catalysts in terms of price and reduced environmental impact. However, the influence of structural modifications on the catalytic activity of carbon materials is poorly understood. General trends in the catalytic activity of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons are identified using a holistic approach to carbocatalysis.







Abstract
The influence of structural modifications on the catalytic activity of carbon materials is poorly understood. A collection of carbonaceous materials with different pore networks and high nitrogen content was characterized and used to catalyze four reactions to deduce structure&#8211;activity relationships. The CO2 cycloaddition and Knoevenagel reaction depend on Lewis basic sites (electron&#8208;rich nitrogen species). The absence of large conjugated carbon domains resulting from the introduction of large amounts of nitrogen in the carbon network is responsible for poor redox activity, as observed through the catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene with hydrazine and the catalytic oxidation of 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine using hydroperoxide. The material with the highest activity towards Lewis acid catalysis (in the hydrolysis of (dimethoxymethyl)benzene to benzaldehyde) is the most effective for small molecule activation and presents the highest concentration of electron&#8208;poor nitrogen species.

Copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl bromides with organoboronate esters is developed to access synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams. The success of this work relies on the utilization of chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligands to forge the sterically congested C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams with organoboronate esters could provide the synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#946;&#8208;lactams. The challenge arises mainly from the construction of sterically congested quaternary stereocenters between the tertiary alkyl radicals and chiral copper(II) species. Herein, we describe our success in achieving such transformations through the utilization of a copper/hemilabile N,N,N&#8208;ligand catalyst to forge the sterically congested chiral C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond via a single&#8208;electron reduction/transmetalation/bond formation catalytic cycle. The synthetic potential of this approach is shown in the straightforward conversion of the corresponding products into many valuable building blocks. We hope that the developed catalytic cycle would open up new vistas for more enantioconvergent cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Chiral Open [60]Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimethylaminocarbene&#8208;mediated orifice expansion gave the first near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing chiral open [60]fullerenes. The introduced aminomethylidene moiety is well&#8208;conjugated with the fullerene cage, thus considerably elevating the HOMO level as supported by the electrochemical analysis. The optical resolution revealed a large dissymmetry factor of gabs=&#177;0.12 at 820&#8197;nm in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene.







Abstract
Though [60]fullerene is an achiral molecular nanocarbon with Ih symmetry, it could attain an inherent chirality depending upon a functionalization pattern. The conventional chiral induction of C60 relies mainly upon a multiple addition affording a mixture of achiral and chiral isomers while their chiral function would be largely offset by the existence of pseudo&#8208;mirror plane(s). These are major obstacles to proceed further study on fullerene chirality and yet leave its understanding elusive. Herein, we showcase a carbene&#8208;mediated synthesis of C1&#8208;symmetric chiral open [60]fullerenes showing an intense far&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared absorption. The large dissymmetry factor of |gabs|=0.12 was achieved at &#955;=820&#8197;nm for circular dichroism in benzonitrile. This is, in general, unachievable by other small chiral organic molecules, demonstrating the potential usage of open [60]fullerenes as novel types of chiral chromophores.

         <title>Conformational Control of Organocatalyst in Strongly Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acidic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enantioselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reticulation of chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenol&#8208;based imidodiphosphoric acid (IDP) into two Dy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) allows controlling the organocatalyst conformations and local chiral microenvironments. The MOF containing the 4&#8208;connected IDPs has a relatively less compact shape and can be an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid catalys for the challenging asymmetric O,O&#8208;acetalization of diol and aldehyde with up to 96&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Chiral imidodiphosphates (IDPs) have emerged as strong Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts for many enantioselective processes. However, the dynamic transformation between O,O&#8208;syn and O,O&#8208;anti conformers typically results in low enantioselectivity. Here we demonstrate that topologies of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be exploited to control IDP conformations and local chiral microenvironments for enantioselective catalysis. Two porous Dy&#8208;MOFs with different topologies are obtained from an enantiopure 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenol IDP&#8208;based tetracarboxylate ligand. While the ligand adopts a 4&#8208; or 3&#8208;connected (c) binding mode, all IDPs are rigidified to get only a single O,O&#8208;syn conformation and display greatly enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity relative to the free IDP. The MOF with the 4&#8208;c IDP that has a relatively less compact shape than the 3&#8208;c IDP can be an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid catalysing the challenging asymmetric O,O&#8208;acetalization reaction with up to 96&#8201;% enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Hierarchical Integration of Organic Core/Shell Microwires for Advanced Photonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a series of organic charge transfer cocrystals with structural similarity and physicochemical tunability, we demonstrate the precise construction of various types of hierarchical organic microwires. Branch microwires with multichannel waveguide and core/shell microwires with multicolor waveguide performance can be integrated into branch core/shell microwires for realizing optical logic gates with multi&#8208;encoding functions.







Abstract
The combination of multiple components or structures into integrated micro/nanostructures for practical application has been pursued for many years. Herein, a series of hierarchical organic microwires with branch, core/shell (C/S), and branch C/S structures are successfully constructed based on organic charge transfer (CT) cocrystals with structural similarity and physicochemical tunability. By regulating the intermolecular CT interaction, single microwires and branch microstructures can be integrated into the C/S and branch C/S structures, respectively. Significantly, the integrated branch C/S microwires, with multicolor waveguide behavior and branch structure multichannel waveguide output characteristics, can function as an optical logic gate with multiple encoding features. This work provides useful insights for creating completely new types of organic microstructures for integrated optoelectronics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of multiple components or structures into integrated micro/nanostructures for practical application has been pursued for many years. Herein, a series of hierarchical organic microwires with branch, core/shell (C/S), and branch C/S structures are successfully constructed based on organic charge transfer (CT) cocrystals with structural similarity and physicochemical tunability. By regulating the intermolecular CT interaction, single microwires and branch microstructures can be integrated into the C/S and branch C/S structures, respectively. Significantly, the integrated branch C/S microwires, with multicolor waveguide behavior and branch structure multichannel waveguide output characteristics, can function as an optical logic gate with multiple encoding features. This work provides useful insights for creating completely new types of organic microstructures for integrated optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intertwining Olefin Thianthrenation with Kornblum/Ganem Oxidations: Ene&#8208;type Oxidation to Furnish &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free double oxidation of unactivated alkenes has been developed to deliver unsaturated conjugated carbonyls. This practical procedure allows valorization of the olefinic feedstock with high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity as demonstrated by the syntheses of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access building blocks and industrially relevant pheromones and kairomones.







Abstract
A widely applicable, practical, and scalable synthetic method for efficient ene&#8208;type double oxidation of alkenes is reported via a two&#8208;step alkenyl thianthrenium umpolung/Kornblum&#8208;Ganem oxidation strategy. This chemo&#8208; and stereoselective procedure allows easy access to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls that may be otherwise difficult or cumbersome to synthesize by conventional methods. For &#945;&#8208;olefins, this metal&#8208;free transformation can be tuned according to synthetic needs to produce either the elusive (Z)&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes or their (E) counterparts. Moreover, this strategy has enabled streamlined synthesis of distinct butadienyl pheromones and kairomones.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Probes Excited&#8208;State Delocalization in Rectangular Ladder&#8208;type Pentaphenyl Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rectangular &#960;&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers of one particular handedness provide a square answer to the question of delocalization of their lowest&#8208;energy photoexcitation: the coupling to vibrations makes the excitation shaky. Exciton localization is a dynamic process and the excitation &#8220;breathes&#8221; in concert with the zero&#8208;point vibrational motion.







Abstract
Ladder&#8208;type pentaphenyl chromophores have a rigid, planar &#960;&#8208;system and show bright fluorescence featuring pronounced vibrational structure. Such moieties are ideal for studying interchromophoric interactions and delocalization of electronic excitations. We report the synthesis of helical polymers with a rigid square structure based on spiro&#8208;linked ladder&#8208;type pentaphenyl units. The variation of circular dichroism with increasing chain length provides direct evidence for delocalization of electronic excitations over at least 10 monomeric units. The change in the degree of circular polarization of the fluorescence across the vibronic side bands shows that vibrational motion can localize the excitation dynamically to almost one single unit through breakdown of the Born&#8208;Oppenheimer approximation. The dynamic conversion between delocalized and localized excited states provides a new paradigm for interpreting circular dichroism in helical polymers such as proteins and polynucleic acids.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Presodiation with Sodium Diphenyl Ketone towards Ultra&#8208;stable Hard Carbon Anodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium diphenyl ketone is applied as a reducing reagent to compensate irreversible Na uptake at oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups and react with defective carbon for quasi&#8208;metallic Na to initiate robust SEI. It leads to ICE of 99.2&#8201;% and capacity retention of &#8776;100&#8201;% for 700&#8197;cycles in the full cells of presodiated hard carbon//Na3V2(PO4)3.







Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, yet still suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, sodium diphenyl ketone (Na&#8208;DK) is applied to realize dual&#8208;function presodiation for HC anodes. It compensates the irreversible Na uptake at the oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups and reacts with carbon defects of five/seven&#8208;membered rings for quasi&#8208;metallic sodium in HC. The as&#8208;formed sodium induces robust NaF&#8208;rich SEI on HC in 1.0&#8197;M NaPF6 in diglyme, favoring the interfacial reaction kinetics and stable Na+ insertion and extraction. This renders the presodiated HC (pHC) with high ICE of &#8776;100&#8201;% and capacity retention of 82.4&#8201;% after 6800&#8197;cycles. It is demonstrated to couple with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes in full cells to show high capacity retention of &#8776;100&#8201;% after 700&#8197;cycles. This work provides in&#8208;depth understanding of chemical presodiation and a new strategy for highly stable sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>An Amorphous n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymer with an Ultra&#8208;Rigid Planar Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous conjugated polymers represent another kind of polymer semiconductors with different charge transporting mechanism. An n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with rigid, straight and planar backbone has now been designed and synthesized. It is amorphous in a thin film but exhibits an electron mobility of 0.34&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
High charge carrier mobility polymer semiconductors are always semi&#8208;crystalline. Amorphous conjugated polymers represent another kind of polymer semiconductors with different charge transporting mechanism. Here we report the first near&#8208;amorphous n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with decent electron mobility, which features a remarkably rigid, straight and planar polymer backbone. The molecular design strategy is to copolymerize two fused&#8208;ring building blocks which are both electron&#8208;accepting, centrosymmetrical and planar. The polymer is the alternating copolymer of double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit and benzobisthiazole (BBTz) unit. It shows a decent electron mobility of 0.34&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. The excellent electron transporting property of the polymer is possibly due to the ultrahigh backbone stiffness, small &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance, and high molecular weight.

         <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;specific miRNA imaging is achieved through the integration of enzyme&#8208;triggered catalytic hairpin assembly with lipid nanoparticles&#8208;based delivery. The approach enables controlled activation of signal amplification in cancer cells with improved imaging contrast, as reported by Lele Li, Mengyuan Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202214230).

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence at the Single&#8208;Nanoparticle Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An array of well&#8208;controlled Au single particle or oligomers was printed on the electrode surface, and used as high&#8208;throughput platform to investigate the plasmon enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) at the single&#8208;nanoparticle level. This ECL microscopy can visualize and quantify the electrochemical reactions of multiple individual NPs from wide&#8208;field imaging simultaneously.







Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) at the single&#8208;nanoparticle (NP) level was investigated by ECL microscopy. The Au NPs were assembled into an ordered array, providing a high&#8208;throughput platform that can easily locate each NP in sequential characterizations. A strong dependence of ECL intensity on Au NP configurations was observed. We demonstrate for the first time that at the single&#8208;particle level, the ECL of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;TPrA was majorly quenched by small Au NPs (&lt;40&#8197;nm), while enhanced by large Au ones (&gt;80&#8197;nm) due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Notably, the ECL intensity was further increased by the coupling effect of neighboring Au NPs. Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations conformed well with the experimental results. This plasmon enhanced ECL microscopy for arrayed single NPs provides a reliable tool for screening electrocatalytic activity at a single particle.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries: Towards Harnessing their Full Power with Darwinian Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technologies are transforming the drug discovery process, enabling the identification of ligands at unprecedented speed and scale. DEL makes use of libraries that are orders of magnitude larger than traditional high throughput screens. While a DNA tag alludes to a genotype&#8208;phenotype connection that is exploitable for evolutionary cycles, most of the work in the field is performed with libraries where the tag serves as an amplifiable bar code but does not allow &#8216;translation&#8217; into the synthetic product it is linked to. In this review, we cover technologies that enable the &#8216;translation&#8217; of the genetic tag into synthetic molecules, both biochemically and chemically, and explore how it can be used to harness Darwinian evolutionary pressure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up preparation of two&#8208;dimensional material micro&#8208;nano structures at scale facilitates the realisation of integrated applications in optoelectronic devices. Fibrous Phosphorus (FP), an allotrope of black phosphorus (BP), is one of the most promising candidate materials in the field of optoelectronics with its unique crystal structure and properties.&#160;However, to date, there are no bottom&#8208;up micro&#8208;nano structure preparation methods for crystalline phosphorus allotropes.&#160;Herein, we present the bottom&#8208;up preparation of fibrous phosphorus micropillar (FP&#8208;MP) arrays via a low&#8208;pressure gas&#8208;phase transport (LP&#8208;CVT) method that controls the directional phase transition from amorphous red phosphorus (ARP) to FP. In addition, self&#8208;powered photodetectors (PD) of FP&#8208;MP arrays with pyro&#8208;phototronic effects achieved detection beyond the bandgap limit. Our results provide a new approach for bottom&#8208;up preparation of other crystalline allotropes of phosphorus.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular detection via nanopore, achieved by monitoring changes in ionic current arising from analyte interaction with the sensor pore, is a promising technology for multiplex sensing development. Outer Membrane Protein G (OmpG), a monomeric porin possessing seven functionalizable loops, has been reported as an effective sensing platform for selective protein detection. Using flow&#8208;cytometry to screen unfavorable constructs, we identified two OmpG nanopores with unique peptide motifs displayed in either loop 3 or 6, which also exhibited distinct analyte signals in single&#8208;channel current recordings. We exploited these loops concurrently to facilitate single&#8208;molecule multiplex protein detection in a mixture. We additionally report a strategy to increase sensor sensitivity via avidity motif display. These sensing schemes may be expanded to more sophisticated designs utilizing additional loops for increasing multiplicity and sensitivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Up/Down Tuning of Poly(ionic liquid)s in Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally induced reversible up/down migration of poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) in aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPSs) was achieved for the first time in this study. Novel ATPSs were fabricated using azobenzene (Azo)&#8208; and benzyl (Bn)&#8208;modified PILs, and their upper and lower phases could be easily tuned using the grafting degree (GD) of the Azo and Bn groups. Bn&#8208;PIL with higher GDBn could go up into the upper phase and Azo&#8208;PIL come down to the lower phase when the temperature increased (&gt;65 &#176;C); this behavior was reversed at lower temperatures. Moreover, a reversible two&#8208;phase/single&#8208;phase transition was realized under UV irradiation. Experimental and simulation results revealed that the difference in the hydration capacity between Bn&#8208;PIL and Azo&#8208;PIL accounted for their unique phase&#8208;separation behavior. A versatile platform for fabricating ATPSs with tunable stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior can be realized based on our findings, which can broaden their applications in the fields of smart separation systems and functional material development.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Zwitterionic Streptococcus pneumoniae Type 1 Oligosaccharides Carrying Labile O&#8208;Acetyl Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly convergent and stereoselective total synthesis of zwitterionic Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1 (Sp1) oligosaccharides, carrying labile O&#8208;acetyl esters, is described. Structural studies show the nonasaccharide to adopt a right&#8208;handed helical structure in which the acetyl groups decorating the periphery stabilize the structure.







Abstract
We herein report the first total synthesis of the Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1 (Sp1) oligosaccharide, a unique zwitterionic capsular polysaccharide carrying labile O&#8208;acetyl esters. The target oligosaccharides, featuring rare &#945;&#8208;2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trideoxy galactose (AAT) and &#945;&#8208;galacturonic acids, were assembled up to the 9&#8208;mer level, in a highly stereoselective manner using trisaccharide building blocks. The lability of the O&#8208;acetyl esters imposed a careful deprotection scheme to prevent migration and hydrolysis. The migration was investigated in detail at various pD values using NMR spectroscopy, to show that migration and hydrolysis of the C&#8208;3&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl esters readily takes place under neutral conditions. Structural investigation showed the oligomers to adopt a right&#8208;handed helical structure with the acetyl esters exposed on the periphery of the helix in close proximity of the neighboring AAT residues, thereby imposing conformational restrictions on the AAT&#945;1&#8208;4GalA(3OAc) glycosidic linkages, supporting the helical shape of the polysaccharide, that has been proposed to be critical for its unique biological activity.

         <title>Synthesis of a Systematic 64&#8208;Membered Heparan Sulfate Tetrasaccharide Library</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 64 heparan sulfate tetrasaccharides containing all possible arrangements of 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 6&#8208;O&#8208; and N&#8208;sulfation with the glucosamine&#8208;glucuronic acid&#8208;glucosamine&#8208;iduronic acid backbone was successfully produced from a single strategically protected tetrasaccharide intermediate. This library enabled the determination of heparan sulfate structures for strong binding with fibroblast growth factor&#8208;2 but weak binding to platelet factor&#8208;4.







Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) has multifaceted biological activities. To date, no libraries of HS oligosaccharides bearing systematically varied sulfation structures are available owing to the challenges in synthesizing a large number of HS oligosaccharides. To overcome the obstacles and expedite the synthesis, a divergent approach was designed, where 64 HS tetrasaccharides covering all possible structures of 2&#8208;O&#8208;, 6&#8208;O&#8208; and N&#8208;sulfation with the glucosamine&#8208;glucuronic acid&#8208;glucosamine&#8208;iduronic acid backbone were successfully produced from a single strategically protected tetrasaccharide intermediate. This extensive library helped identify the structural requirements for HS sequences to have strong fibroblast growth factor&#8208;2 binding but a weak affinity for platelet factor&#8208;4. Such a strategy to separate out these two interactions could lead to new HS&#8208;based potential therapeutics without the dangerous adverse effect of heparin&#8208;induced thrombocytopenia.

         <title>Tailored Tolane&#8208;Perfluorotolane Assembly as Supramolecular Base Pair Replacement in DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar &#960;&#8208;interactions and preferential stacking were observed by attaching tolane and perfluorotolanes as nucleobase surrogates to acyclic backbone replacements in an otherwise unmodified DNA duplex. The butyl nucleic acid (BuNA) was identified as privileged scaffold for exploiting the supramolecular arene&#8208;fluoroarene recognition in DNA.







Abstract
Arene&#8208;fluoroarene interactions offer outstanding possibilities for engineering of supramolecular systems, including nucleic acids. Here, we implement the tolane&#8208;perfluorotolane interaction as base pair replacement in DNA. Tolane (THH) and perfluorotolane (TFF) moieties were connected to acyclic backbone units, comprising glycol nucleic acid (GNA) or butyl nucleic acid (BuNA) building blocks, that were incorporated via phosphoramidite chemistry at opposite positions in a DNA duplex. Thermodynamic analyses by UV thermal melting revealed a compelling stabilization by THH/TFF heteropairs only when connected to the BuNA backbone, but not with the shorter GNA linker. Detailed NMR studies confirmed the preference of the BuNA backbone for enhanced polar &#960;&#8208;stacking. This work defines how orthogonal supramolecular interactions can be tailored by small constitutional changes in the DNA backbone, and it inspires future studies of arene&#8208;fluoroarene&#8208;programmed assembly of DNA.

         <title>Phosphoric Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Anthrone&#8208;based Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By a simple stereoselective condensation with remote chirality control, axial chirality could be introduced to the symmetric anthrone backbones that comprise mostly sp2&#8208;hybridized carbons. The generated oxime ether functionality enables their transformation with axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality conversion via Beckmann rearrangement into enantioenriched dibenzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
Anthrones and analogues are structural cores shared by diverse pharmacologically active natural and synthetic compounds. The sp2&#8208;rich nature imposes inherent obstruction to introduce stereogenic element onto the tricyclic aromatic backbone. In our pursuit to expand the chemical space of axial chirality, a novel type of axially chiral anthrone&#8208;derived skeleton was discovered. This work establishes oxime ether as suitable functionality to furnish axial chirality on symmetric anthrone skeletons through stereoselective condensation of the carbonyl entity with long&#8208;range chirality control. The enantioenriched anthrones could be elaborated into dibenzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles containing well&#8208;defined stereogenic center via Beckmann rearrangement with axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality conversion.

         <title>In Situ Observation of C&#8722;C Coupling and Step Poisoning During the Growth of Hydrocarbon Chains on Ni(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomistic mechanisms driving hydrocarbon chain growth on a nickel model catalyst were elucidated with a combination of surface&#8208;sensitive X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ scanning tunneling microscopy. While the step edges of the catalyst are commonly assumed to be the active sites for C&#8722;C coupling, this research demonstrates that polymerization occurs on the flat terrace sites.







Abstract
The synthesis of high&#8208;value fuels and plastics starting from small hydrocarbon molecules plays a central role in the current transition towards renewable energy. However, the detailed mechanisms driving the growth of hydrocarbon chains remain to a large extent unknown. Here we investigated the formation of hydrocarbon chains resulting from acetylene polymerization on a Ni(111) model catalyst surface. Exploiting X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy up to near&#8208;ambient pressures, the intermediate species and reaction products have been identified. Complementary in situ scanning tunneling microscopy observations shed light onto the C&#8722;C coupling mechanism. While the step edges of the metal catalyst are commonly assumed to be the active sites for the C&#8722;C coupling, we showed that the polymerization occurs instead on the flat terraces of the metallic surface.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Reservoir Hydrogel Electrolyte for Long&#8208;Term Cycling Zn/PANI Batteries in Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Zn/PANI battery performance in wide temperature range is boosted by a polymeric acid hydrogel electrolyte with 3&#8197;M Zn(ClO4)2. The &#8722;SO3&#8722;H+ groups on the polymeric acid can not only act as the proton reservoir to inhibit PANI deprotonation and promote dual&#8208;ion storage, but also guide the Zn2+ deposition for dendrite suppression, thus resulting in excellent rate performance and ultra&#8208;high cycling stability in different temperatures.







Abstract
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising for next generation flexible devices owing to the high safety, yet still requiring better cycling stability and high capacities in wide temperature range. Herein, a polymeric acid hydrogel electrolyte (PAGE) with 3&#8197;M Zn(ClO4)2 was fabricated for high performance Zn/polyaniline (PANI) batteries. With PAGE, even at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C the Zn/Zn symmetrical battery can keep stable for more than 1&#8201;500&#8197;h under 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Zn/PANI battery can provide ultra&#8208;high stable specific capacity of 79.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 for more than 70&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This can be mainly ascribed to the &#8722;SO3&#8722;H+ function group in PAGE. It can generate constant protons and guide the (002) plane formation to accelerate the PANI redox reaction kinetics, increase the specific capacity, and suppress the side reaction and dendrites. This proton&#8208;supplying strategy by polymeric acid hydrogel may further propel the development of high performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters: Development and Application to the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Alstratine A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of tryptamine with &#945;&#8208;ketoesters in the presence of a catalytic amount of a chiral alanine&#8208;derived squaramide and 4&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid afforded the corresponding 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;methoxycarbonyl tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines (THBCs) in high yields and ee values. A concise seven&#8208;step asymmetric total synthesis of alstratine A, a cagelike hexacyclic indole alkaloid, was developed featuring this enantioselective Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction as a key step.







Abstract
We report herein an asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters. In the presence of a catalytic amount of simple alanine&#8208;derived squaramide and p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, reaction of tryptamines with methyl 2&#8208;oxoalkanoates afforded the corresponding 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;methoxycarbonyl tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines (THBCs) in high yields and ee values. A primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE=4.5) using C2&#8208;deteurium&#8208;labelled tryptamine indicates that rearomatization through deprotonation of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion could be the rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step. A concise enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alstratine A, a hexacyclic cagelike monoterpene indole alkaloid, featuring this reaction as a key step, was subsequently accomplished. Remeasurement of the [a]D value of the natural product indicates that natural alstratine A is dextrorotatory rather than levorotatory as it was initially reported in the isolation paper.

         <title>Origin and Acceleration of Insoluble Li2S2&#8722;Li2S Reduction Catalysis in Ferromagnetic Atoms&#8208;based Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental origin and acceleration of insoluble Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis in ferromagnetic elements&#8208;based lithium&#8208;sulfur battery cathodes have been disclosed in this study. We show that the increase of spin polarization degree of metal&#8208;N4 sites enhances the metal&#8208;S interaction and accelerates the Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis at cathode interface, which provides practical opportunities towards high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life batteries.







Abstract
Accelerating insoluble Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis to mitigate the shuttle effect has emerged as an innovative paradigm for high&#8208;efficient lithium&#8208;sulfur battery cathodes, such as single&#8208;atom catalysts by offering high&#8208;density active sites to realize in situ reaction with solid Li2S2. However, the profound origin of diverse single&#8208;atom species on solid&#8208;solid sulfur reduction catalysis and modulation principles remains ambiguous. Here we disclose the fundamental origin of Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis in ferromagnetic elements&#8208;based single&#8208;atom materials to be from their spin density and magnetic moments. The experimental and theoretical studies disclose that the Fe&#8722;N4&#8208;based cathodes exhibit the fastest deposition kinetics of Li2S (226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and the lowest thermodynamic energy barriers (0.56&#8197;eV). We believe that the accelerated Li2S2&#8722;Li2S reduction catalysis enabled via spin polarization of ferromagnetic atoms provides practical opportunities towards long&#8208;life batteries.

         <title>Effect of Proton Transfer on Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation by Manganese Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between proton transfer and water oxidation performance has been established by constructing isomorphous manganese(II) phosphates. This proton hopping pathway in NH4MnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O showed a much lower energy barrier than the direct diffusion pathway in KMnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. The OER reaction mechanisms are proposed and proton transfer&#8208;affected electrocatalytic water oxidation has been straightforwardly observed and understood.







Abstract
The effect of proton transfer on water oxidation has hardly been measurably established in heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Herein, two isomorphous manganese phosphates (NH4MnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and KMnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O) were designed to form an ideal platform to study the effect of proton transfer on water oxidation. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding network in NH4MnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O has been proven to be solely responsible for its better activity. The differences of the proton transfer kinetics in the two materials indicate a fast proton hopping transfer process with a low activation energy in NH4MnPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O. In addition, the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network can effectively promote the proton transfer between adjacent Mn sites and further stabilize the MnIII&#8722;OH intermediates. The faster proton transfer results in a higher proportion of zeroth&#8208;order in [H+] for OER. Thus, proton transfer&#8208;affected electrocatalytic water oxidation has been measurably observed to bring detailed insights into the mechanism of water oxidation.

This method delivered various functionalized chiral hexahydroindoles in good yields with up to 98&#8201;% ee. The application of this reaction to the concise synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Lycorane was demonstrated.







Abstract
Chiral perhydroindoles are found in a number of natural products and biologically active compounds. Therefore, the development of new asymmetric methodology for rapid access to this core is of high importance. Herein, we reported a highly regio&#8208; and diastereo&#8208;selective palladium/PC&#8208;Phos&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost reactions of readily available amino tethered 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes with aryl and alkenyl halides, delivering various functionalized chiral hexahydroindoles in good yields with high enantioselectivity. The application of this reaction to the concise synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Lycorane was demonstrated. DFT computation results indicate that the difference in &#916;Edis of two migration insertion transition states determines the enantioselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Catalytic, Regioselective 1,4&#8208;Fluorodifunctionalization of Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalysis&#8208;based regioselective 1,4&#8208;fluorofunctionalization of trifluoromethyl substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes has been developed to access compact, highly functionalized products. The platform has been extended to enable 1,4&#8208;hetero&#8208;difunctionalization, which allows &#948;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;alcohol and amine derivatives to be forged in a single operation.







Abstract
A catalysis&#8208;based regioselective 1,4&#8208;fluorofunctionalization of trifluoromethyl substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes has been developed to access compact, highly functionalized products. The process allows E,Z&#8208;mixed dienes to be processed to a single E&#8208;alkene isomer, and leverages an inexpensive and operationally convenient I(I)/I(III) catalysis platform. The first example of catalytic 1,4&#8208;difluorination is disclosed and subsequently evolved to enable 1,4&#8208;hetero&#8208;difunctionalization, which allows &#948;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;alcohol and amine derivatives to be forged in a single operation. The protocol is compatible with a variety of nucleophiles including fluoride, nitriles, carboxylic acids, alcohols and even water thereby allowing highly functionalized products, with a stereocenter bearing both C(sp3)&#8722;F and C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 groups, to be generated rapidly. Scalability (up to 3&#8197;mmol), and facile post&#8208;reaction modifications are demonstrated to underscore the utility of the method in expanding organofluorine chemical space.

         <title>Durable High&#8208;Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells Enabled by the Working&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Matching Palladium&#8208;Hydrogen Buffer Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) with a Pd/C anode have excellent performance comparable to Pt/C. Pd acting as hydrogen buffer and oxygen absorbent provides additional in situ hydrogen and absorbs infiltrated oxygen during fuel starvation to suppress reverse&#8208;current degradation. Compared with Pt/C, the Pd/C anode greatly improves the durability of HT&#8208;PEMFCs during start&#8208;up/shut&#8208;down and current mutation.







Abstract
The durability degradation during stack&#8208;operating conditions seriously deteriorates the lifetime and performance of the fuel cell. To alleviate the rapid potential rise and performance degradation, an anode design is proposed to match the working temperature of high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) with the release temperature of hydrogen from palladium. The result is significantly enhanced hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity of Pd and superior performance of the Pd anode. Furthermore, Pd as hydrogen buffer and oxygen absorbent layer in the anode can provide additional in situ hydrogen and absorb infiltrated oxygen during local fuel starvation to maintain HOR and suppress reverse&#8208;current degradation. Compared with the traditional Pt/C anode, the Pd/C also greatly improved HT&#8208;PEMFCs durability during start&#8208;up/shut&#8208;down and current mutation. The storage/release of hydrogen provides innovative guidance for improving the durability of PEMFCs.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) show potential for a wide range of applications based on their unique characteristics, such as interpenetrated channels, low densities, high surface areas, and high chemical stabilities. In this Minireview, we summarize the strategies for the preparation of functional 3D COFs, including crystallization methods and functionalization pathways, and provide an overview of their potential applications.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with spatially periodic networks demonstrate significant advantages over their 2D counterparts, including enhanced specific surface areas, interconnected channels, and more sufficiently exposed active sites. Nevertheless, research on these materials has met an impasse due to serious problems in crystallization and stability, which must be solved for practical applications. In this Minireview, we first summarize some strategies for preparing functional 3D COFs, including crystallization techniques and functionalization methods. Hereafter, applications of these functional materials are presented, covering adsorption, separation, catalysis, fluorescence, sensing, and batteries. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives for the development of 3D COFs are discussed.

         <title>Boosting Reactive Oxygen Species Generation Using Inter&#8208;Facet Edge Rich WO3 Arrays for Photoelectrochemical Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct 1&#8201;e&#8722; electron and indirect 2&#8201;e&#8722; electron transfer pathways for photoelectrochemical water oxidation are achieved using inter&#8208;facet edge (IEF) rich WO3 photoanode in the presence of CO32&#8722;, the total Faraday efficiencies of H2O2 and OH&#8901; productis exceed 90&#8201;%. Then, selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol by in situ using the formed OH&#8901; delivers a benzaldehyde production rate of &#8776;768&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100&#8201;% selectivity.







Abstract
Water oxidation reaction leaves room to be improved in the development of various solar fuel productions, because of the kinetically sluggish 4&#8208;electron transfer process of oxygen evolution reaction. In this work, we realize reactive oxygen species (ROS), H2O2 and OH&#8901;, formations by water oxidation with total Faraday efficiencies of more than 90&#8201;% by using inter&#8208;facet edge (IFE) rich WO3 arrays in an electrolyte containing CO32&#8722;. Our results demonstrate that the IFE favors the adsorption of CO32&#8722; while reducing the adsorption energy of OH&#8901;, as well as suppresses surface hole accumulation by direct 1&#8208;electron and indirect 2&#8208;electron transfer pathways. Finally, we present selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol by in situ using the formed OH&#8901;, which delivers a benzaldehyde production rate of &#8776;768&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with near 100&#8201;% selectivity. This work offers a promising approach to tune or control the oxidation reaction in an aqueous solar fuel system towards high efficiency and value&#8208;added product.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Polycyclic Molecules via Ring Fusion for n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Conjugation extension using ring fusion, intramolecular conformational lock, and deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level endow the resulting 10&#8208;ring&#8208;fused polycyclic molecules with a record&#8208;high &#956;C* of 10.3&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and a high electron mobility of 0.043&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule organic electrochemical transistors.







Abstract
The primary challenge for n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is to improve their electron mobilities and thus the key figure of merit &#956;C*. Nevertheless, few reports in OECTs have specially proposed to address this issue. Herein, we report a 10&#8208;ring&#8208;fused polycyclic &#960;&#8208;system consisting of the core of naphthalene bis&#8208;isatin dimer and the terminal moieties of rhodanine, which features intramolecular noncovalent interactions, high &#960;&#8208;delocalization and strong electron&#8208;deficient characteristics. We find that this extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using the ring fusion strategy displays improved electron mobilities up to 0.043&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 compared to our previously reported small molecule gNR, and thereby leads to a remarkable &#956;C* of 10.3&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type OECTs, which is the highest value reported to date for small&#8208;molecule OECTs. This work highlights the importance of &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension in polycyclic&#8208;fused molecules for enhancing the performance of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule OECTs.

         <title>Antiaromatic Sapphyrin Isomer: Transformation into Contracted Porphyrinoids with Variable Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antiaromatic sapphyrin isomer was successfully synthesized based on the unique cyclization at a terminal N&#8208;confused pyrrole unit of pentapyrrane. The specific reactivity associated with the antiaromaticity and confused pyrrole provides chances for constructing novel porphyrinoids with tunable aromaticity.







Abstract
Sapphyrin is a pentapyrrolic expanded porphyrin with a 22&#960; aromatic character. Herein, we report the synthesis of a 20&#960; antiaromatic sapphyrin isomer 1 by oxidative cyclization of a pentapyrrane precursor P5 with a terminal &#946;&#8208;linked pyrrole. The resulting isomer 1, containing a mis&#8208;linked bipyrrole unit in the skeleton, exhibits a reactivity for further oxidation due to the distinct antiaromatic electronic structure, affording a fused macrocycle 2, possessing a spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing [5.6.5.6]&#8208;tetracyclic structure. Subsequent treatment with an acid afforded a weakly aromatic pyrrolone&#8208;appended N&#8208;confused corrole 3, and thermal fusion gave a [5.6.5.7]&#8208;tetracyclic&#8208;ring&#8208;embedded 14&#960; aromatic triphyrin(2.1.1) analog 4. The cyclization at the mis&#8208;linked pyrrole moiety of P5 played a crucial role in synthesizing the antiaromatic porphyrinoid susceptible to facile transformation to novel porphyrinoids with variable aromaticity.

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation and Engineering of Sesterviolene Synthase from Streptomyces violens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sesterviolene synthase from Streptomyces violarus is the second bacterial sesterterpene synthase to be described. The enzyme generates one main and several side products whose mechanisms of formation were studied in isotopic labelling experiments and through DFT calculations. Enzyme engineering allowed isolation and structural characterisation of the side products and gave access to the main product in sufficient quantity to study its chemistry.







Abstract
The sesterviolene synthase from Streptomyces violens was identified and represents the second known sesterterpene synthase from bacteria. Isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations were performed that provided detailed insight into its complex cyclisation mechanism. Enzyme engineering through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis gave access to a high&#8208;yielding enzyme variant that provided six additional minor products and the main product in sufficient quantities to study its chemistry.

         <title>Controlled Diels&#8211;Alder &#8220;Click&#8221; Strategy to Access Mechanically Aligned Main&#8208;Chain Liquid Crystal Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled two&#8208;stage polymerization of mechanically aligned liquid crystal networks (LCNs) has been developed that relies on a fast cyclopentadiene maleimide step&#8208;growth polymerization with a latent maleimide being generated in situ upon heating. This approach allows the introduction of nucleophile&#8208; or radical&#8208;sensitive molecules into light&#8208;actuated LCNs, and the potential for larger sampler geometries.







Abstract
Aligned liquid crystal polymers are materials of interest for electronic, optic, biological and soft robotic applications. The manufacturing and processing of these materials have been widely explored with mechanical alignment establishing itself as a preferred method due to its ease of use and widespread applicability. However, the fundamental chemistry behind the required two&#8208;step polymerization for mechanical alignment has limitations in both fabrication and substrate compatibility. In this work we introduce a new protection&#8208;deprotection approach utilizing a two&#8208;stage Diels&#8211;Alder cyclopentadiene&#8208;maleimide step&#8208;growth polymerization to enable mild yet efficient, fast, controlled, reproducible and user&#8208;friendly polymerizations, broadening the scope of liquid crystal systems. Thorough characterization of the films by DSC, DMA, POM and WAXD show the successful synthesis of a uniaxially aligned liquid crystal network with thermomechanical actuation abilities.

         <title>Efficient Multiple Domain Ligation for Proteins Using Asparaginyl Endopeptidase by Selection of Appropriate Ligation Sites Based on Steric Hindrance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was experimentally verified in an enzymatic domain&#8208;ligation that ligation efficiency depends on ligation sites. Subsequently, a site&#8208;dependent ligation&#8208;potential index was computationally developed, considering the steric hindrance of ligation site. Referring to this index, the three&#8208;domains ligation of ER&#8208;60 was succeeded. This index is applicable to identify feasible ligation sites.







Abstract
Three domain fragments of a multi&#8208;domain protein, ER&#8208;60, were ligated in two short linker regions using asparaginyl endopeptidase not involving denaturation. To identify appropriate ligation sites, by selecting several potential ligation sites with fewer mutations around two short linker regions, their ligation efficiencies and the functions of the ligated ER&#8208;60s were examined experimentally. To evaluate the dependence of ligation efficiencies on the ligation sites computationally, steric hinderances around the sites for the ligation were calculated through molecular dynamics simulations. Utilizing the steric hindrance, a site&#8208;dependent ligation potential index was introduced as reproducing the experimental ligation efficiency. Referring to this index, the reconstruction of ER&#8208;60 was succeeded by the ligation of the three domains for the first time. In addition, the new ligation potential index well&#8208;worked for application to other domain ligations. Therefore, the index may serve as a more time&#8208;effective tool for multi&#8208;site ligations.

         <title>CO2 Induces Symmetry Breaking in Layered Dipeptide Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking manner of monomolecular layers in dipeptide crystals has been manipulated by utilizing CO2 to cover the interlayer interaction sites and force the dipeptides to adsorb at asymmetric positions. As a result, the dipeptide crystal symmetry was broken and the piezoelectricity greatly improved.







Abstract
Control of symmetry breaking of materials provides large opportunities to regulate their properties and functions. Herein, we report breaking the symmetry of layered dipeptide crystals by utilizing CO2 to induce the adjacent monomolecular layers to stack from the opposite to the same direction. The role of CO2 is to cover the interlayer interaction sites and force the dipeptides to adsorb at asymmetric positions. Further, the dipeptide crystals exhibit far superior piezoelectricity after symmetry breaking and the piezoelectric voltage generated from the dipeptide&#8208;based generators becomes more than 500&#8201;% higher than before. This work reveals a potential route to engineer structures and properties of layered materials and provides a deep insight into the control of non&#8208;covalent interactions.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Iron(II) Oxide Sites Directly Responsible for Preferential Carbon Monoxide Oxidation at Ambient Temperature: An Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy Study
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed a linear correlation between the amount of oxidic Fe2+ and ambient temperature activity of Pt&#8722;FeOx preferential carbon monoxide oxidation catalysts. Hydrogen prereduction temperature and pressure determines the amount of active Fe2+ sites for alumina&#8208; and silica&#8208;supported Pt&#8722;Fe catalysts. Catalyst deactivation is linked with the oxidation of these sites.







Abstract
Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy identified that the concentration of Fe2+ species in the working state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8722;FeOx catalysts quantitatively correlates to their preferential carbon monoxide oxidation steady&#8208;state reaction rate at ambient temperature. Deactivation of such catalysts with time on stream originates from irreversible oxidation of active Fe2+ sites. The active Fe2+ species are presumably Fe+2O&#8722;2 clusters in contact with platinum nanoparticles; they coexist with spectator trivalent oxidic iron (Fe3+) and metallic iron (Fe0) partially alloyed with platinum. The concentration of active sites and, therefore, the catalyst activity strongly depends on the pretreatment conditions. Fe2+ is the resting state of the active sites in the preferential carbon monoxide oxidation cycle.

         <title>Dearomatization of Biaryls through Polarity Mismatched Radical Spirocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomatization reactions involving radical cyclizations can facilitate the synthesis of complex polycyclic systems that find applications in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis. Here we employ redox&#8208;neutral photocatalysis to affect a radical spirocyclization that transforms biaryls into spirocyclic cyclohexadienones under mild reaction conditions. In a departure from previously reported methods, our work demonstrates the polarity mismatched addition of a nucleophilic radical to an electron rich arene, and allows the regioselective synthesis of 2,4&#8208; or 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienone isomers with broad functional group tolerance. By transforming biaryls into spirocycles, our methodology accesses underexplored three&#8208;dimensional chemical space, and provides an efficient means of creating quaternary spirocenters that we apply to the first synthesis of the cytotoxic plant metabolite denobilone A.</dc:description>

         <title>Nine&#8208;Electron Transfer of Binder Synergistic &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Coordination Polymers as High&#8208;Performance Lithium Storage Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To solve the problems such as the dissolution and the poor conductivity of organic small molecule electrode materials, we construct &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymer Ni&#8208;DHBQ with multiple redox&#8208;active centers as lithium storage materials. It exhibits an ultra&#8208;high capacity of 9&#8208;electron transfers, while the &#960;&#8208;d conjugation and the laminar structure inside the crystal ensure fast electron transport and lithium ion diffusion, resulting in excellent rate performance (505.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles). The interaction of Ni&#8208;DHBQ with the binder CMC synergistically inhibits its dissolution and anchors the Ni atoms, thus exhibiting excellent cycling stability (650.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles). This work provides insight into the mechanism of lithium storage in &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymers and the synergistic effect of CMC, which will contribute to the molecular design and commercial application of organic electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Conformational Restriction Strategy for the Control of CRISPR/Cas Gene Editing with Photoactivatable Guide RNAs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CRISPR/Cas system is one of the most powerful tools for gene editing. However, approaches for precise control of genome editing and regulatory events are still desirable. Here, we report a spatiotemporal and efficient control of CRISPR/Cas9&#8208; and Cas12a&#8208;mediated editing with conformational restricted gRNAs. This approach relied on only two or three pre&#8208;installed photo&#8208;labile substituents followed by an intramolecular cyclization, representing a robust synthetic method in comparison to the heavily modified linear gRNAs which often required extensive screening and time&#8208;consuming optimization. The tactic could direct precise cleavage of GFP and VEGFA within a predefined cutting region without notable editing leakage in live cells. We also achieved light&#8208;mediated MSTN gene editing in embryos, wherein a new bow&#8208;knot&#8208;type gRNA was constructed with excellent OFF/ON switch efficiency. Overall, our work provides a significantly new strategy in CRISPR/Cas editing with modified circular guide RNAs to precisely manipulate where and when genes are edited.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparative&#8208;Scale Biocatalytic Oxygenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles with a Lyophilized Peroxygenase Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A lyophilized preparation of an unspecific peroxygenase variant from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO&#8208;PaDa&#8208;I&#8208;H) is a highly effective catalyst for the oxygenation of a diverse range of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. Scalable biocatalytic oxygenations (27 preparative examples, &#8776;100 mgs scale) have been developed across a wide range of substrates, including alkyl pyridines, bicyclic N&#8208;heterocycles and indoles. H2O2 is the only stoichiometric oxidant needed, without auxiliary electron transport proteins, which is key to the practicality of the method. Reaction outcomes can be altered depending on whether hydrogen peroxide was delivered by syringe pump or through in situ generation using an alcohol oxidase from Pichia pastoris (PpAOX) and methanol as a co&#8208;substrate. Good synthetic yields (up to 84%), regioselectivity and enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee) were observed in some cases, highlighting the promise of UPOs as practical, versatile and scalable oxygenation biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable latency of hydrosilylation catalyst by ligand density on nanoparticle supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tethering of inorganic particle surfaces with organic ligands serves as a common technique for heterogenizing organometallic catalysts. We describe how the coordination of molecular platinum to high density norbornene&#8208;functionalized silica nanoparticles results in an unexpected latency of the catalytic activity (2% conversion after 60 min) in hydrosilylation reactions when compared to an identical reaction in which the norbornene is not tethered (97% conversion after 60 min). Performing the hydrosilylation at elevated temperature (70 &#176;C) suppresses this activity delay, suggesting the usefulness of this technique towards temperature&#8208;triggered catalysis. We demonstrate that this latency is related to the density of the ligand on the inorganic particle surface, the chemical structure of the norbornene, and the topology of the silica nanoparticles. We also establish the benefit of this latency effect for the triggered curing of silicone elastomers.

We describe how the coordination of molecular platinum to high density norbornene-functionalized silica nanoparticles results in an unexpected latency of the catalytic activity (2% conversion after 60 min) in hydrosilylation reactions when compared to an identical reaction in which the norbornene is not tethered (97% conversion after 60 min). Performing the hydrosilylation at elevated temperature (70 &#176;C) suppresses this activity delay, suggesting the usefulness of this technique towards temperature-triggered catalysis. We demonstrate that this latency is related to the density of the ligand on the inorganic particle surface, the chemical structure of the norbornene, and the topology of the silica nanoparticles. We also establish the benefit of this latency effect for the triggered curing of silicone elastomers. Overall, our work establishes the non-innocent role of inorganic supports when functionalized with organometallic complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;fueled transformations of a dynamic cage&#8208;based molecular system</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a chemical equilibrium, the formation of high&#8208;energy species &#8211; in a closed system &#8211; is inefficient due to microscopic reversibility. Here, we demonstrate how this restriction can be circumvented by coupling a dynamic equilibrium to a light&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization of an azobenzene imine cage. The stable E&#8208;cage resists intermolecular imine exchange reactions that would &#8220;open&#8221; it. Upon switching, the strained Z&#8208;cage isomers undergo imine exchange spontaneously, thus opening the cage. Subsequent isomerization of the Z&#8208;open compounds yields a high&#8208;energy, kinetically trapped E&#8208;open species, which cannot be efficiently obtained from the initial E&#8208;cage, thus shifting an imine equilibrium energetically uphill in a closed system. Upon heating, the nucleophile is displaced back into solution and an opening/closing cycle is completed by regenerating the stable all&#8208;E&#8208;cage. Using this principle, a light&#8208;induced cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation is performed by the addition of a ditopic aldehyde.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Cobalt&#8208;free Li&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathodes through&#160;Oxygen Lattice Regulation by&#160;Two&#8208;phase Ru Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides is hindered by their dramatic capacity and voltage decay on cycling. This work comprehensively studies the mechanistic behaviour of cobalt&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 and demonstrates the positive impact of two&#8208;phase Ru doping. A mechanistic transition from the monoclinic to the hexagonal behaviour is found for the structural evolution of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, and the improvement mechanism of Ru doping is understood using the combination of in operando and post&#8208;mortem synchrotron analyses. The two&#8208;phase Ru doping improves the structural reversibility in the first cycle and restrains structural degradation during cycling by stabilizing oxygen (O2&#8208;) redox and reducing Mn reduction, thus enabling high structural stability, an extraordinarily stable voltage (decay rate &lt; 0.45 mV per cycle), and a high capacity&#8208;retention rate during long&#8208;term cycling. The understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationship of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 sheds light on the selective doping strategy and rational materials design for better&#8208;performance Li&#8208;rich layered oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomeric Oligo(Phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Different Orientation of Imine Bonds and Distinct Photocatalytic Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively studied in photocatalysis because of their easy synthesis and excellent crystallinity. The effect of imine bond orientation on the photocatalytic properties of COFs, however, is still rarely studied. In this work, we reported two novel COFs with different orientations of imine bonds using oligo(phenylenevinylene) moieties. The COFs showed similar structures but great differences in photoelectric properties. COF&#8208;932 demonstrated superior hydrogen evolution performance than COF&#8208;923 when triethanolamine was used as the sacrificial agent. Interestingly, the use of ascorbic acid led to the protonation of COFs, further altering the direction of electron transfer. The photocatalytic performances were increased to 23.4 and 0.73 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for protonated COF&#8208;923 and COF&#8208;932, respectively. This work provides a clear strategy for the design of imine&#8208;linked COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts and advances the development of COFs.</dc:description>

We concluded that formation of uranyl species could be a driving force for solid&#8208;state metathesis.

         <title>A Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Molecular Cage with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission for Enzymatic Photocyclization of Alkynylaniline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocyclization of alkynylanilines catalyzed by an aggregated PtII&#8208;based octahedral cage has been shown to mimic bio&#8208;enzyme catalysis by aggregated biological macromolecules. The aggregated supramolecular species exhibits a higher photocatalytic efficiency than dispersed metal&#8208;organic cages without aggregation.







Abstract
Enzymes facilitate chemical conversions through the collective activity of aggregated components, but the marriage of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) with molecular containers to emulate enzymatic conversion remains challenging. Herein, we report a new approach to construct a PtII&#8208;based octahedral cage with AIE characteristics for the photocyclization of alkynylaniline by restricting the rotation of the pendant phenyl rings peripheral to the PtII corner. With the presence of water, the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions involving the triphenylphosphine fragments resulted in aggregation of the molecular cages into spherical particles and significantly enhanced the PtII&#8208;based luminescence. The kinetically inert Pt&#8208;NP chelator, with highly differentiated redox potentials in the ground and excited states, and the efficient coordination activation of the platinum corner facilitated excellent catalysis of the photocyclization of alkynylaniline. The enzymatic kinetics and the advantages of binding and activating substrates in an aqueous medium provide a new avenue to develop mimics for efficient photosynthesis.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Synuclein as a Target for Metallo&#8208;Anti&#8208;Neurodegenerative Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuIII complex NAMI&#8208;A is activated by hydrolysis and then reacts with specific amino acids in the abundant brain protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein, preventing and disassembling &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, abolishing toxicity toward neuronal cells, and mitigating neurodegeneration and motor impairments in a model of Parkinson's. Since NAMI&#8208;A has a pharmaceutically&#8208;acceptable profile, it has potential for use in treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.







Abstract
The unique thermodynamic and kinetic coordination chemistry of ruthenium allows it to modulate key adverse aggregation and membrane interactions of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) associated with Parkinson's disease. We show that the low&#8208;toxic RuIII complex trans&#8208;[ImH][RuCl4(Me2SO)(Im)] (NAMI&#8208;A) has dual inhibitory effects on both aggregation and membrane interactions of &#945;&#8208;syn with submicromolar affinity, and disassembles pre&#8208;formed fibrils. NAMI&#8208;A abolishes the cytotoxicity of &#945;&#8208;syn towards neuronal cells and mitigates neurodegeneration and motor impairments in a rat model of Parkinson's. Multinuclear NMR and MS analyses show that NAMI&#8208;A binds to residues involved in protein aggregation and membrane binding. NMR studies reveal the key steps in pro&#8208;drug activation and the effect of activated NAMI&#8208;A species on protein folding. Our findings provide a new basis for designing ruthenium complexes which could mitigate &#945;&#8208;syn&#8208;induced Parkinson's pathology differently from organic agents.

     alt="&#945;-Synuclein as a Target for Metallo-Anti-Neurodegenerative Agents"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ru&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex NAMI-A is activated by hydrolysis and then reacts with specific amino acids in the abundant brain protein &#945;-synuclein, preventing and disassembling &#945;-synuclein fibrils, abolishing toxicity toward neuronal cells, and mitigating neurodegeneration and motor impairments in a model of Parkinson's. Since NAMI-A has a pharmaceutically-acceptable profile, it has potential for use in treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique thermodynamic and kinetic coordination chemistry of ruthenium allows it to modulate key adverse aggregation and membrane interactions of &#945;-synuclein (&#945;-syn) associated with Parkinson's disease. We show that the low-toxic Ru&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-[ImH][RuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO)(Im)] (NAMI-A) has dual inhibitory effects on both aggregation and membrane interactions of &#945;-syn with submicromolar affinity, and disassembles pre-formed fibrils. NAMI-A abolishes the cytotoxicity of &#945;-syn towards neuronal cells and mitigates neurodegeneration and motor impairments in a rat model of Parkinson's. Multinuclear NMR and MS analyses show that NAMI-A binds to residues involved in protein aggregation and membrane binding. NMR studies reveal the key steps in pro-drug activation and the effect of activated NAMI-A species on protein folding. Our findings provide a new basis for designing ruthenium complexes which could mitigate &#945;-syn-induced Parkinson's pathology differently from organic agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Switching CuII/CuI Single Sites Catalyze High&#8208;rate and Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, reversible redox&#8208;switching CuII/CuI single sites confined in Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets were used in the CO2 photoreduction to CO.







Abstract
Herein, we first design a model of reversible redox&#8208;switching metal&#8211;organic framework single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets, where the abundant metal single sites benefit for highly selective CO2 reduction, while the reversible redox&#8208;switching metal sites can effectively activate CO2 molecules. Taking the synthetic Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets as an example, synchrotron&#8208;radiation quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra unravel the reversible switching CuII/CuI single sites initially accept photoexcited electrons and then donate them to CO2 molecules, which favors the rate&#8208;liming activation into CO2&#948;&#8722;, verified by in situ FTIR spectra and Gibbs free energy calculations. As an outcome, Cu&#8208;MOF single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell sheets achieve near 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction to CO with a high rate of 860&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 without any sacrifice reagent or photosensitizer, where both the activity and selectivity outperform previously reported photocatalysts evaluated under similar conditions.

         <title>In Vivo Biocatalytic Cascades Featuring an Artificial&#8208;Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed New&#8208;to&#8208;Nature Reaction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report in vivo biocatalytic cascade reactions comprising a combination of canonical enzyme&#8208;catalysed reactions with an artificial&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalysed new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction. The artificial enzyme contains a genetically encoded unnatural catalytic residue, which catalyses the formation of a hydrazone product from biosynthetically produced benzaldehydes in E. coli.







Abstract
Artificial enzymes utilizing the genetically encoded non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid p&#8208;aminophenylalanine (pAF) as a catalytic residue are able to react with carbonyl compounds through an iminium ion mechanism to promote reactions that have no equivalent in nature. Herein, we report an in vivo biocatalytic cascade that is augmented with such an artificial enzyme&#8208;catalysed new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reaction. The artificial enzyme in this study is a pAF&#8208;containing evolved variant of the lactococcal multidrug&#8208;resistance regulator, designated LmrR_V15pAF_RMH, which efficiently converts benzaldehyde derivatives produced in vivo into the corresponding hydrazone products inside E. coli cells. These in vivo biocatalytic cascades comprising an artificial&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalysed reaction are an important step towards achieving a hybrid metabolism.

         <title>The Effect of Molecular Conformations and Simulated &#8220;Self&#8208;Doping&#8221; in Phenothiazine Derivatives on Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The research of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials has drawn great attention for their wide potential applications. Besides single&#8208;component and host&#8208;guest doping systems, the self&#8208;doping with same molecule but different conformations in one state is also a possible way to construct RTP materials, regardless of its rare investigation. In this work, twenty&#8208;four phenothiazine derivatives with two distinct molecular conformations were designed and their RTP behaviors in different states were systematically studied, with the aim to deeply understand the self&#8208;doping effect on the corresponding RTP property. While the phenothiazine derivatives with quasi&#8208;axial (ax) conformation presented better RTP performance in aggregated state, the quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) ones were better in isolated state. Accordingly, the much promoted RTP performance was achieved in the stimulated self&#8208;doping state with ax&#8208;conformer as host and eq&#8208;one as guest, demonstrating the significant influence of self&#8208;doping on RTP effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;La&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for Binary Organic Solar Cells with 18.82% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a widely used hole transporting layer (HTL) in organic solar cells (OSCs), but its acidity severely reduces the stability of devices. Until now, very few HTLs were developed to replace PEDOT:PSS toward stable and high&#8208;performance OSCs. Herein, a new cobalt&#8208;lanthanum (Co&#8208;La) inorganic system was reported as HTL to show a high conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 18.82%, which is among the top PCEs in binary OSCs. Since electron&#8208;rich outer shell of La atom can interact with Co atom to form charge transfer complex, the work function and conductivity of the Co&#8208;La system could be simultaneously enhanced compared to Co or La&#8208;based HTLs. This Co&#8208;La system could also be applied into other OSCs to show high performance . All these results demonstrate that binary Co&#8208;La systems as HTL can efficiently tackle the issue in hole transporting and show powerful application in OSCs to replace PEDOT:PSS.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Anchoring of Hydrogels through Superwetting&#8208;Assisted High&#8208;Density Interfacial Grafting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong adhesion of hydrogels on solids plays an important role in stable working for various practical applications. However, current hydrogel adhesion suffers from poor interfacial bonding with solid surfaces. Here, we propose a general superwetting&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization (SAIP) strategy to robustly anchor hydrogels onto solids by forming high&#8208;density interfacial covalent bonds. The key of our strategy is to make the initiator fully contact solid surfaces via a superwetting way for enhancing the interfacial grafting efficiency. The designed anchored hydrogels show strong bulk failure with a high breaking strength of ~ 1.37 MPa, different from weak interfacial failure that occurs in traditional strategies. The strong interfacial adhesion greatly enhances the stability of hydrogels against swelling destruction. This work opens up new inspirations for designing strongly anchored hydrogels from an interfacial chemistry perspective.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Can commodity polymers are made to be healable just by blending with self&#8208;healable polymers? Here we report the first study on the fundamental aspect of this practically challenging issue. Poly(ether thiourea) (PTUEG3; Tg = 27 &#176;C) reported in 2018 is extraordinary in that it is mechanically robust but can self&#8208;heal even at 12 &#176;C. In contrast, poly(octamethylene thiourea) (PTUC8; Tg = 50 &#176;C), an analogue of PTUEG3, cannot heal below 92 &#176;C. We found that their polymer blend self&#8208;healed in a temperature range above 32 &#176;C even when its PTUEG3 content was only 20 mol %. Unlike PTUEG3 alone, this polymer blend, upon exposure to high humidity, barely plasticized, keeping its excellent mechanical properties due to the non&#8208;hygroscopic nature of the PTUC8 component. CP/MAS 13C NMR analysis revealed that the polymer blend was nanophase&#8208;separated, which possibly accounts for why such a small amount of PTUEG3 provided the polymer blend with humidity&#8208;tolerant self&#8208;healable properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom or Dual&#8208;Atom in TiO2 Nanosheet: Which is the Better Choice for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As rising star materials, single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts have been widely reported in the electro&#8208;catalysis area. To answer the key question: single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts, which is better for electrocatalytic urea synthesis? we design two types of catalysts via a vacancy&#8208;anchorage strategy: single&#8208;atom Pd1&#8208;TiO2 and dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1&#8208;TiO2 nanosheets. An ultrahigh urea activity of 166.67 molurea molPd&#8208;1 h1 with the corresponding 22.54 % Faradaic efficiency at &#8208;0.5 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is achieved over Pd1Cu1&#8208;TiO2, which is much higher than that of Pd1&#8208;TiO2. Various characterization including an in&#8208;situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and theoretical calculations demonstrate that dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1 site in Pd1Cu1&#8208;TiO2 is more favorable for producing urea, which experiences a C&#8208;N coupling pathway with a lower energy barrier compared with Pd1 in Pd1&#8208;TiO2.</dc:description>

         <title>The Eschenmoser&#8217;s Salt as a Formylation Agent for the Synthesis of Indolizinecarbaldehydes and Their Use for Colorimetric Nitrite Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;H bond formylation is the most immediate way to incorporate the versatile formyl group into (hetero)aromatics. However, the type of reagents and severe conditions involved in the classical formylation methods often curtail their application, especially in the presence of other functional groups. Herein, we present the Eschenmoser&#8217;s salt, a commercially available (dimethylamino)methylating chemical, as a useful reagent for the C&#8208;H formylation of indolizines and other compounds. The method is straightforward and mild, furnishing indolizinecarbaldehydes in modest&#8208;to&#8208;good yields with exclusive and remote regioselectivity. Furthermore, these compounds can be easily transformed into push&#8208;pull dyes and are highly selective in the colorimetric detection of nitrite, a substance extensively employed as preservative in the food industry, the concentration of which is crucial to control to prevent harmful effects in living organisms. The assay is simple, allowing the naked&#8208;eye detection of nitrite in solution or on a cotton swab for a wide range of concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Helicene&#8208;Based Ytterbium&#160;Coordination Polymer Displaying Circularly Polarized Luminescence, Slow Magnetic Relaxation and Room Temperature Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of physical properties sensitive to molecular chirality in a single system allows the observation of fascinating phenomena such as Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism (MChD) and Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) having potential applications for optical data readout and display technology. Homochiral monodimensional coordination polymers of YbIII were designed from a 2,15&#8208;bis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;hexahelicenic scaffold decorated with two terminal 4&#8208;pyridyl units. Thanks to the coordination of the chiral organic chromophore to Yb(hfac)3 units, efficient NIR&#8208;CPL activity is observed. Moreover, the specific crystal field around the YbIII induces a strong magnetic anisotropy which leads to a slow magnetic relaxation (SMM) and a remarkable room temperature MChD. The MChD&#8208;structural correlation is supported by computational investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Switched 2nd Order Non&#8208;Linear Optical Response in an Arylimido&#8208;Polyoxometalate with High Contrast and Cyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemically switched 2nd order non&#8208;linear optical responses have been demonstrated for the first time in polyoxometalates (POMs), with an arylimido&#8208;derivative showing a leading combination of high on/off contrast (94%), high visible transparency, and cyclability. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical and TD&#8208;DFT studies indicate that the switch&#8208;off results from weakened charge transfer (CT) character of the electronic transitions in the reduced state. This represents the first study of an imido&#8208;POM reduced state, and demonstrates the potential of POM hybrids as electrochemically activated molecular switches.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic Shielding Boosts Electrochemical Performance of Alloy&#8208;Type Anode Materials of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The applications of alloy&#8208;type anode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries are always obstructed by enormous volume variation upon cycles. Here, K+ ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to improve the electrochemical performance via electrostatic shielding, using Sn microparticles (&#956;&#8208;Sn) as a model. Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that K+ ions are not incorporated in the electrode, but accumulate on some sites. This accumulation slows down the local sodiation at the &#8220;hot spots&#8221;, promotes the uniform sodiation and enhances the electrode stability. Therefore, the electrode maintains a high specific capacity of 565 mAh g&#8208;1 after 3000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1, much better than the case without K+. The electrode also remains an areal capacity of ~3.5 mAh cm&#8208;2 after 100 cycles. This method does not involve time&#8208;consuming preparation, sophisticated instruments and expensive reagents, exhibiting the promising potential for other anode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmonic Silver&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Catalysed Hydrogen Abstraction from the C(sp3)&#8208;H Bond of the Benzylic C&#945; atom for Cleavage of Alkyl Aryl Ether Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective activation of the C(sp3)&#8208;H bond is an important process in organic synthesis, where efficiently activating a specific C(sp3)&#8208;H bond without causing side reactions remains one of chemistry&#8217;s great challenges. Here we report that illuminated plasmonic silver metal nanoparticles (NPs) can abstract hydrogen from the C(sp3)&#8208;H bond of the C&#945; atom of an alkyl aryl ether &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage. The intense electromagnetic near&#8208;field generated at the illuminated plasmonic NPs promotes chemisorption of the &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 compound and the transfer of photo&#8208;generated hot electrons from the NPs to the adsorbed molecules leads to hydrogen abstraction and direct cleavage of the unreactive ether C&#946;&#8208;O bond under moderate reaction conditions (~90&#176;C). The plasmon&#8208;driven process has certain exceptional features: enabling hydrogen abstraction from a specific C(sp3)&#8208;H bond, along with precise scission of the targeted C&#8208;O bond to form aromatic compounds containing unsaturated, substituted groups in excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of a&#160;Fully Non&#8208;Fused Bulk Heterojunction toward Efficient and Low&#8208;Cost Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To modulate the miscibility between donor and acceptor materials both possessing fully non&#8208;fused ring structures, a series of electron acceptors (A4T&#8208;16, A4T&#8208;31 and A4T&#8208;32) with different polar functional substituents were synthesized and investigated. The three acceptors show good planarity, high conformational stability, complementary absorption and energy levels with the non&#8208;fused polymer donor (PTVT&#8208;BT). Among them, A4T&#8208;32 possesses the strongest polar functional group and shows the highest surface energy, which facilitates morphological modulation in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend. Benefiting from the proper morphology control method, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.0% and a superior fill factor over 0.796 are achieved in the PTVT&#8208;BT:A4T&#8208;32&#8208;based organic photovoltaic cells with superior photoactive materials price advantage, which represent the highest value for the cells based on the non&#8208;fused blend films. Notably, this cell maintains ~84% of its initial PCE after nearly 2000 h under the continuous simulated 1&#8208;sun&#8208;illumination. In addition, the flexible PTVT&#8208;BT:A4T&#8208;32&#8208;based cells were fabricated and delivered a decent PCE of 14.6%. This work provides an effective molecular design strategy for the non&#8208;fused NFAs from the aspect of bulk morphology control in fully non&#8208;fused BHJ layers, which is crucial for their practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Synthesis of Alstonlarsine A via Alstolucines B and F Demonstrates the Chemical Feasibility of a Proposed Biogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We offer a new biogenetic proposal for the origin of the complex alkaloid alstonlarsine A, via rearrangement of the&#160;Strychnos&#160;alkaloids alstolucines B and F. Further, we provide evidence of the chemical feasibility of this proposal via the facile conversion of synthetic alstolucines into alstonlarsine A via a short, efficient sequence of&#160;N&#8208;methylation,&#160;&#223;&#8208;elimination, and a cascade 1,7&#8208;hydride shift/Mannich cyclization. We believe that this is the first biogenetic proposal involving the &#8220;tert&#8208;amino effect&#8221;, a hydride&#8208;shift&#8208;based internal redox trigger of a Mannich cyclization. A further interesting feature of the cascade is that its stereochemical outcome likely originates in conformational preferences during the hydride shift.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Nickel Anchored on a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon/TiO2&#160;Composite for Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CH4 Oxidation to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct photocatalytic oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenated products is a sustainable strategy for methane valorization at room temperature. However, in this reaction, noble metals are generally needed to function as cocatalysts for obtaining adequate activity and selectivity. Here, we report atomically dispersed nickel anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon/TiO2 composite (Ni&#8208;NC/TiO2) as a highly active and selective catalyst for photooxidation of CH4 to C1 oxygenates with O2 as the only oxidant. Ni&#8208;NC/TiO2 exhibits a yield of C1 oxygenates of 198 &#956;mol for 4 h with a selectivity of 93%, exceeding that of most reported high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that the single&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;NC sites not only enhance the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO2 to isolated Ni atoms but also dominantly facilitate the activation of O2 to form the key intermediate &#8226;OOH radicals, which synergistically lead to a substantial enhancement in both activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Grain Boundary Electronic Insulation for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivities are one of the most highly sought for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, the non&#8208;negligible electronic conductivities of sulfide electrolytes (~10&#8208;8 S cm&#8208;1) lead to electron smooth transport through the sulfide electrolyte pellets, resulting in Li dendrite directly depositing at the grain boundaries (GBs) and serious discharge self&#8208;discharge. Here, a grain&#8208;boundary electronic insulation (GBEI) strategy is proposed to block electron transport across the GBs, enabling Li&#8208;Li symmetric cells with 30 times longer cycling life and Li&#8208;LiCoO2 full cells with three times lower self&#8208;discharging rate than pristine sulfide electrolytes. The Li&#8208;LiCoO2 ASSLBs deliver high capacity retention of 80% at 650 cycles and stable cycling performance for over 2600 cycles at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2. The innovation of the GBEI strategy provides a new direction to pursue high&#8208;performance ASSLBs depending on electronic conductivity toleration.</dc:description>

         <title>Zincophilic Electrode Interphase  with Appended Proton Reservoir Ability Stabilizes Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rampant dendrites and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) resulting from the turbulent interfacial evolution at the anode/electrolyte are the main culprits of short lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency of Zn metal batteries. In this work, a versatile protective coating with excellent zincophilic and amphoteric features is constructed on the surface of Zn metal (ZP@Zn) as dendrite&#8208;free anodes. This kind of protective coating possesses the advantages of reversible proton storage and rapid desolvation kinetics, thereby mitigating the HER and facilitating homogeneous nucleation concomitantly. Furthermore, the space charge polarization effect promotes charge redistribution to achieve uniform Zn deposition. Accordingly, the ZP@Zn symmetric cell manifests excellent reversibility at an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 4750 mA h cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling at 65% depth of discharge (DOD). The ZP@Zn//V6O13 pouch cell also reveals superior cycling stability with a high capacity of 326.6 mA h g&#8722;1.</dc:description>
