         <title>An Efficient Opal&#8208;Suppressor Tryptophanyl Pair Creates New Routes for Simultaneously Incorporating up to Three Distinct Noncanonical Amino Acids into Proteins in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific incorporation of multiple distinct noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in mammalian cells is a promising technology, where each ncAA must be assigned to a different orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pair that read a distinct nonsense codon. Available pairs suppress TGA or TAA codons at a considerably lower efficiency than TAG, limiting the scope of this technology. Here we show that the E. coli tryptophanyl (EcTrp) pair is an excellent TGA&#8208;suppressor in mammalian cells, which can be combined with the three other established pairs to develop three new routes for dual&#8208;ncAA incorporation. Using these platforms, we site&#8208;specifically incorporated two different bioconjugation handles into an antibody with excellent efficiency, and subsequently labeled it with two distinct cytotoxic payloads. Additionally, we combined the EcTrp pair with other pairs to site&#8208;specifically incorporate three distinct ncAAs into a reporter protein in mammalian cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Gd(III)&#8208;19F Distance Measurements of Proteins in Cells by Electron&#8208;Nuclear Double Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studies of protein structure and dynamics are usually carried out in dilute buffer solutions, conditions that differ significantly from the crowded environment in the cell. The double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) technique can track proteins&#8217; conformations in the cell by providing distance distributions between two attached spin labels. This technique, however, cannot access distances below 1.8 nm. Here we show that Gd(III)&#8208;19F Mims electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) measurements can cover part of this short range. Low temperature solution and in&#8208;cell ENDOR measurements, complemented with room temperature solution and in&#8208;cell Gd(III)&#8208;19F PRE (paramagnetic relaxation enhancement) NMR measurements were performed on fluorinated GB1 and ubiquitin (Ub), spin&#8208;labeled with rigid Gd(III) tags. The proteins were delivered into human cells via electroporation. The solution and in&#8208;cell derived Gd(III)&#8208;19F distances were essentially identical and lie in the 1&#8208;1.5 nm range revealing that both, GB1 and Ub, retained their overall structure in the cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical&#8208;Mediated Regenerable Fe(II) Active Sites for Efficient Uranium Extraction at Ultra&#8208;Low Cell Voltage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient extraction of uranium from seawater or wastewater has attracted great attention due to the increasing demand for nuclear energy. Nano&#8208;reduced iron (NRI) is a promising uranium adsorbent due to its strong reducibility and good selectivity but it still faces the challenges of slow kinetics, limited and non&#8208;renewable active sites. In this work, we realized high efficiency uranium extraction under ultra&#8208;low cell voltage (&#8208;0.1 V) in seawater with 20 ppm UO2(NO3)2&#160;solution by coupling electrochemical mediated Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox and uranium extraction.&#160;The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency of NRI after electrochemical uranium extraction (EUE) could reach 456.37 mg/g and ~100 %, respectively. The excellent EUE property was attributed to the rich chloride ions in seawater promoting the formation of chlorine intermediate species which boosted the formation of iron oxides (Fe2O3&#160;and FeOOH), thus accelerating the reduction of U(VI), release of adsorption sites (M&#8208;OH groups) and regeneration of Fe(II) active sites. Combined with quasi&#8208;operando/operando characterization technologies, we clarified the mechanism&#160;of EUE and revealed that continuously regenerating Fe(II) active sites by electroreduction could significantly enhance the property of EUE. This work here provides a new electrochemical mediated and low energy consumption uranium extraction strategy which also provides a reference for other metal resource recovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting the Dark Lipid Kinase PIP4K2C with a&#160;Potent and Selective Binder and Degrader</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphatidylinositol 5&#8208;phosphate 4&#8208;kinase, type II, gamma (PIP4K2C) remains a poorly understood lipid kinase with minimal enzymatic activity but potential scaffolding roles in immune modulation and autophagy&#8208;dependent catabolism. Achieving potent and selective agents for PIP4K2C while sparing other lipid and non&#8208;lipid kinases has been challenging. Here, we report the discovery of the highly potent PIP4K2C binder TMX&#8208;4102, which shows exclusive binding selectivity for PIP4K2C. Furthermore, we elaborated this molecule into TMX&#8208;4153, a bivalent degrader capable of rapidly and selectively degrading endogenous PIP4K2C. Collectively, our work demonstrates that PIP4K2C is a tractable and a degradable target, and that TMX&#8208;4102 and TMX&#8208;4153 are useful leads to further interrogate the biological roles and therapeutic potential of PIP4K2C</dc:description>

         <title>Precisely Slight Regulation of Emission Maxima and Construction of Highly Efficient Electroluminescent Materials with High Color Purity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced multiple resonance induced thermally activated delayed &#64258;uorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have emerged as a privileged motif for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), because they furnish highly tunable bandgap with emission ranges spanning the visible light region, and have the intrinsic properties of outstanding TADF characteristics and high color purity emission. One of the typical construction paradigms of MR&#8208;TADF molecule is based on polycyclization of MR parent core and a representative target model molecule BN&#8208;TP has been prepared. Herein, based on the unique nitrogen&#8208;atom embedding molecular engineering (NEME) strategy, a series of congeners of BN&#8208;TP, namely BN&#8208;TP&#8208;Nx (x = 1, 2, 3, 4), have been customized. The nitrogen&#8208;atom anchored at different position of triphenylene hexagonal lattice entails varying degrees of perturbation to the electronic structure. The newly&#8208;constructed emitters have demonstrated the precisely slight regulation of emission maxima of MR&#8208;TADF emitters to meet the actual industrial demand, and further enormously enriched the MR&#8208;TADF molecular reservoir. The BN&#8208;TP&#8208;N3&#8208;based OLED exhibits ultrapure green emission, with peak of 524 nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 33 nm, Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.23, 0.71), and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3%.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Isodesmic C&#8211;H Iodination of Phenylacetic Weinreb Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isodesmic reactions represent mild alternatives to other chemical transformations that require harsh oxidizing agents or highly reactive intermediates. However, enantioselective isodesmic C&#8211;H functionalization is unknown and enantioselective direct iodination of inert C&#8211;H bond is very rare. Rapid synthesis of chiral aromatic iodides is of significant importance for synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report an unprecedented highly enantioselective isodesmic C&#8211;H functionalization to access chiral iodinated phenylacetic Weinreb amides via desymmetrization and kinetic resolution with PdII catalysis. Importantly, further transformations of the enantioenriched products are readily available at the iodinated or the Weinreb amide position, paving the way of related studies for synthetic and medicinal chemists.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four highly porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) containing pyrene units were prepared and explored for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The experimental studies are complemented by density functional theory calculations, proving that the pyrene unit is more active for H2O2 production than the bipyridine and (diarylamino)benzene units reported previously. H2O2 decomposition experiments verified that the distribution of pyrene units over a large surface area of COFs plays an important role in catalytic performance. The Py&#8208;Py&#8208;COF, though contains more pyrene units than other COFs, induces a high H2O2 decomposition due to a dense concentration of pyrene in small proximity over a limited surface area. Therefore, a two&#8208;phase reaction system (water&#8208;benzyl alcohol) was employed to&#160;inhibit H2O2 decomposition. This is the first report on applying pyrene&#8208;based COFs in a two&#8208;phase system for photocatalytic H2O2 generation.</dc:description>

         <title>From Dinitrogen to N&#8208;Containing Organic Compounds: Using Li2CN2 as a Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By synergizing the heterogeneous synthetic approach with the homogeneous synthetic methodology, N&#8208;containing organic compounds can be synthesized via activated N&#8208;containing species prepared from N2 gas and suitable carbon sources. From N2, carbon, and LiH, we have previously succeeded in the high&#8208;yield preparation of Li2CN2 as the activated N&#8208;containing species. In this work, we applied Li2CN2 as a novel synthetic synthon for constructing N&#8208;containing organic compounds. A series of reaction models, including substitution reaction, cycloaddition reaction, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction, were successfully performed using Li2CN2 under mild conditions. Various valuable cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives were readily synthesized in moderate to excellent yields. With this method, the 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives with anti&#8208;cancer activity, could also be facilely prepared from 15N2 gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Photosystem II Inspired NiFe&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Efficient Water Oxidation&#160;via Second Coordination Sphere Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mismatched fast&#8208;electron&#8208;slow&#8208;proton process in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely restricts the catalytic efficiency. To overcome these issues, accelerating the proton transfer and elucidating the kinetic mechanism are highly sought after. Herein, inspired by photosystem II, we develop a family of OER electrocatalysts with FeO6/NiO6 units and carboxylate anions (TA2&#8208;) in the first and second coordination sphere, respectively. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the metal units and TA2&#8208;, the optimized catalyst delivers superior activity with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 200 mA cm&#8208;2 and excellent cycling stability over 300 h. A proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;promotion mechanism is proposed by in&#8208;situ Raman, catalytic tests, and theoretical calculations. The TA2&#8208; (proton acceptor) can mediate proton transfer pathways by preferentially accepting protons, which optimizes the O&#8208;H adsorption/activation process and reduces the kinetic barrier for O&#8208;O bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation of Aryl Bromides Enabled by Potassium Metabisulfite as a Uniquely Effective SO2 Surrogate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development and mechanistic investigation of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides is disclosed. The reaction proceeds in good yields for a variety of substrates and utilizes an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. The active oxidative addition complex was synthesized, isolated, and fully characterized by a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis. The use of the isolated oxidative addition complex in both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2, likely released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5. Key to the success of the reaction is the role of K2S2O5 as a reservoir of SO2 that is slowly released, thus preventing catalyst poisoning.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Synthesis of Benzotriazulene with Three Embedded Azulene Units and Large Stokes Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the one&#8208;pot synthesis of benzo[1,2&#8208;a:3,4&#8208;a':5,6&#8208;a'']triazulene (BTA), wherein three azulene units are embedded through a tandem reaction comprising of two steps involving Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation between a readily available triborylated truxene precursor and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. Its nitration leads to a regioselective trinitrated product, namely, BTA&#8208;NO2. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that the superstructure of BTA consists of a dimer stacked by two enantiomeric helicene conformers, while that of BTA&#8208;NO2 consists of an unprecedented p&#8208;tetramer stacked from two enantiomeric dimers, that is, four distinct helicene conformers. Both compounds show excellent stability and fluorescence with large Stokes shifts of up to 174 nm. In addition, BTA&#8208;NO2 exhibits unique solvatochromic effect in different solvents and hydrogen bonding&#8208;induced emission transfer in different ratios of THF/H2O solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Radical Carbocyanation of 2&#8208;Azadienes for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Amino nitriles are versatile structural motifs in a variety of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals, and they serve as valuable building blocks in synthesis. Their preparation from readily available structural scaffolds, however, remains challenging. Herein is reported a novel dual catalytic photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and regioselective radical carbocyanation of 2&#8208;azadienes to access functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles by using redox&#8208;active esters (RAEs) and trimethylsilyl cyanide.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&#945;-Amino nitriles are versatile structural motifs in a variety of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals, and they serve as valuable building blocks in synthesis. Their preparation from readily available structural scaffolds, however, remains challenging. Herein is reported a novel dual catalytic photoredox/copper-catalyzed chemo- and regioselective radical carbocyanation of 2-azadienes to access functionalized &#945;-amino nitriles by using redox-active esters (RAEs) and trimethylsilyl cyanide. This cascade process employs a broad scope of RAEs and provides the corresponding &#945;-amino nitrile building blocks in 50&#8211;95% yields (49 examples, regioselectivity &amp;gt;95:5). The products were transformed into prized &#945;-amino nitriles and &#945;-amino acids. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical cascade coupling process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unsupervised Learning&#8208;Guided Accelerated Discovery of Alkaline Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Without insight into the correlation between the structure and properties, anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for fuel cells are developed usually using the empirical trial and error method or simulation methods. Here, a virtual module compound enumeration screening (V&#8208;MCES) approach, which does not require the establishment of expensive training databases and can search the chemical space containing more than 4.2&#215;105 candidates was proposed. The accuracy of the V&#8208;MCES model was considerably improved when the model was combined with supervised learning for the feature selection of molecular descriptors. Techniques from V&#8208;MCES, correlating the molecular structures of the AEMs with the predicted chemical stability, generated a ranking list of potential high stability AEMs. Under the guidance of V&#8208;MCES, highly stable AEMs were synthesized. With understanding of AEM structure and performance by machine learning, AEM science may enter a new era of unprecedented levels of architectural design.</dc:description>

         <title>Cd/Pt Precursor Solution for Solar H2 Production and in situ Photochemical Synthesis of Pt Single&#8208;atom Decorated CdS Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the use of Cd/Pt precursor solutions for substantially higher photocatalytic H2 production (154.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), thereby eliminating the need for pre&#8208;synthesized photocatalysts for H2 production. Furthermore, in parallel to H2 production, a simplified solar light&#8208;assisted in situ synthesis of Pt single&#8208;atom anchored CdS nanoparticles (PtSA&#8208;CdSIS) has also been demonstrated.







Abstract
Despite extensive efforts to develop high&#8208;performance H2 evolution catalysts, this remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate the use of Cd/Pt precursor solutions for significant photocatalytic H2 production (154.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), removing the need for a pre&#8208;synthesized photocatalyst. In addition, we also report simultaneous in situ synthesis of Pt single&#8208;atoms anchored CdS nanoparticles (PtSA&#8208;CdSIS) during photoirradiation. The highly dispersed in situ incorporation of extensive Pt single atoms on CdSIS enables the enhancement of active sites and suppresses charge recombination, which results in exceptionally high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of &#8776;1&#8201;% and an apparent quantum yield of over 91&#8201;% (365&#8197;nm) for H2 production. Our work not only provides a promising strategy for maximising H2 production efficiency but also provides a green process for H2 production and the synthesis of highly photoactive PtSA&#8208;CdSIS nanoparticles.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Application of a Water&#8208;soluble Photocage for Aqueous Cyclopentadiene&#8208;based Diels&#8208;Alder Photoclick Chemistry in Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble cyclopentadienone&#8208;norbornadiene adduct is disclosed as a photocage for cyclopentadiene&#8208;based Diels&#8208;Alder photoclick chemistry. We show that this scalable CPD&#8211;NBD derivative can be incorporated into hydrogel formulations and commercial 3D printing resins, providing biocompatible hydrogels that can be patterned with maleimide bearing species upon 365&#8197;nm uncaging of cyclopentadiene.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally functionalized hydrogels have exciting applications in tissue engineering, but their preparation often relies on radical&#8208;based strategies that can be deleterious in biological settings. Herein, the computationally guided design, synthesis, and application of a water&#8208;soluble cyclopentadienone&#8208;norbornadiene (CPD&#8208;NBD) adduct is disclosed as a diene photocage for radical&#8208;free Diels&#8208;Alder photopatterning. We show that this scalable CPD&#8208;NBD derivative is readily incorporated into hydrogel formulations, providing gels that can be patterned with dienophiles upon 365&#8197;nm uncaging of cyclopentadiene. Patterning is first visualized through conjugation of cyanine dyes, then biological utility is highlighted by patterning peptides to direct cellular adhesion. Finally, the ease of use and versatility of this CPD&#8208;NBD derivative is demonstrated by direct incorporation into a commercial 3D printing resin to enable the photopatterning of structurally complex, printed hydrogels.

         <title>Suppressive Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Ruthenium/TiO2 Promote Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Reduction with Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) of has gained great attention in the heterogeneous catalysis, but its negative role in regulating light&#8208;induced electrons transfer is rarely explored. Herein,&#160;SMSI significantly restrains the activity of Ru/TiO2 in light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by CH4 due to the photo&#8208;induced electrons transfer from TiO2 to Ru. In contrast, benefiting from the suppressive SMSI, Ru/TiO2&#8208;H2 achieves a 46&#8208;fold CO2 conversion rate than Ru/TiO2. For Ru/TiO2&#8208;H2, considerable photo&#8208;excited hot electrons from Ru nanoparticles (NPs) migrate to oxygen vacancies (OVs) and facilitate the CO2 activation under illumination, simultaneously leaving an electron&#8208;deficient status of Ru&#948;+ to accelerate CH4 decomposition. Consequently, the photothermal catalysis over Ru/TiO2&#8208;H2 lowers the activation energy and overcomes limitations of a purely thermal system. This work offers a novel strategy for designing efficient photothermal catalysts via regulating two&#8208;phase interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Late&#8208;Stage Modifications Enable Downstream Click&#8208;Mediated Fluorescent Tagging of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The promiscuity of N1&#8208;tryptophan prenyltransferase AcyF was screened with 22 unnatural pyrophosphates, which exhibited reactive groups suitable for copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition, metathesis, and inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reactions. A 10&#8208;mer tryptophan&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide was tailored by AcyF, and the resulting modified peptide was successfully labelled with a tetrazine&#8211;fluorescein conjugate by IEDDA.







Abstract
Aromatic prenyltransferases from cyanobactin biosynthetic pathways catalyse the chemoselective and regioselective intramolecular transfer of prenyl/geranyl groups from isoprene donors to an electron&#8208;rich position in these macrocyclic and linear peptides. These enzymes often demonstrate relaxed substrate specificity and are considered useful biocatalysts for structural diversification of peptides. Herein, we assess the isoprene donor specificity of the N1&#8208;tryptophan prenyltransferase AcyF from the anacyclamide A8P pathway using a library of 22 synthetic alkyl pyrophosphate analogues, of which many display reactive groups that are amenable to additional functionalization. We further used AcyF to introduce a reactive moiety into a tryptophan&#8208;containing cyclic peptide and subsequently used click chemistry to fluorescently label the enzymatically modified peptide. This chemoenzymatic strategy allows late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and is useful for many applications.

         <title>Designing an Apparently Orbital&#8208;Symmetry&#8208;Forbidden [3s,5s]&#8208;Sigmatropic Shift through Transition&#8208;State Complexation and Stereoelectronic Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [3s,5s]&#8208;sigmatropic shift is a pericyclic reaction that is forbidden according to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. Density functional theory calculations are used to show that systems utilizing transition&#8208;state complexation to a metal catalyst and strategically placed substituents engaging in key stereoelectronic effects can select for the [3s,5s] process and outcompete both allowed [3s,3s]&#8208; and [3s,5a]&#8208;shifts.







Abstract
The [3s,5s]&#8208;sigmatropic shift is an example of an orbital&#8208;symmetry forbidden pericyclic reaction that is outcompeted by the allowed [3s,3s]&#8208;sigmatropic shift. Density functional theory calculations are used to show that PdII&#8208;complexed systems with strategically placed substituents engaging in key stereoelectronic effects can select for the [3s,5s] process, thereby outcompeting both orbital&#8208;symmetry&#8208;allowed [3s,3s]&#8208; and [3s,5a]&#8208;shifts.

         <title>When It's Heavier: Interfacial and Solvation Chemistry of Isotopes in Aqueous Electrolytes for Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical effect of isotope of water is introduced into a Zn&#8208;ion battery electrolyte to control severe side reactions and massive gas production. Due to the low diffusion and strong coordination of ions in D2O, the possibility of side reaction is decreased, resulting in a broader electrochemically stable potential window, less pH change, less zinc hydroxide sulfate (ZHS) generation and pure phase ZHS precipitation during cycling.







Abstract
The electrochemical effect of isotope (EEI) of water is introduced in the Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) electrolyte to deal with the challenge of severe side reactions and massive gas production. Due to the low diffusion and strong coordination of ions in D2O, the possibility of side reactions is decreased, resulting in a broader electrochemically stable potential window, less pH change, and less zinc hydroxide sulfate (ZHS) generation during cycling. Moreover, we demonstrate that D2O eliminates the different ZHS phases generated by the change of bound water during cycling because of the consistently low local ion and molecule concentration, resulting in a stable interface between the electrode and electrolyte. The full cells with D2O&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrated more stable cycling performance which displayed &#8764;100&#8201;% reversible efficiencies after 1,000 cycles with a wide voltage window of 0.8&#8211;2.0&#8197;V and 3,000 cycles with a normal voltage window of 0.8&#8211;1.9&#8197;V at a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Alternating Metal&#8208;Ligand Coordination Improves Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by a Mononuclear Ru Catalyst
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;overpotential mechanistic route is proposed for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. One metal center acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid at different stages of the catalytic cycle. This ambivalent behavior of the metal along with the flexibility of the ligands allows for the formation of a 5&#8208;membered metallacyclic intermediate by intramolecular cyclization.







Abstract
Molecular electrocatalysts for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion often operate at large overpotentials, due to the large barrier for C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Illustrated with ruthenium polypyridyl catalysts, we herein propose a mechanistic route that involves one metal center that acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid at different stages of the catalytic cycle, by density functional theory in corroboration with experimental FTIR. The nucleophilic character of the Ru center manifests itself in the initial attack on CO2 to form [Ru&#8208;CO2]0, while its electrophilic character allows for the formation of a 5&#8208;membered metallacyclic intermediate, [Ru&#8208;CO2CO2]0,c, by addition of a second CO2 molecule and intramolecular cyclization. The calculated activation barrier for C&#8722;O bond cleavage via the metallacycle is decreased by 34.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 as compared to the non&#8208;cyclic adduct in the two electron reduced state of complex 1. Such metallacyclic intermediates in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction offer a new design feature that can be implemented consciously in future catalyst designs.

         <title>Direct N&#8722;H Activation to Generate Nitrogen Radical for Arylamine Synthesis via Quantum Dots Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct activation of amine N&#8722;H bonds is realized to provide N&#8208;radicals in a redox&#8208;neutral and site&#8208;selective manner. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation of quantum dots, the N&#8208;radicals are successfully applied to the synthesis of aromatic amines. The high efficiency and broad functional&#8208;group tolerance demonstrate the potential of photocatalytic N&#8208;radicals in the construction of valuable arylamines.







Abstract
Represented herein is the first example of N&#8208;radical generation direct from N&#8722;H bond activation under mild and redox&#8208;neutral conditions. The in situ generated N&#8208;radical intercepts a reduced heteroarylnitrile/aryl halide for C&#8722;N bond formation under visible&#8208;light irradiation of quantum dots (QDs). A series of aryl and alkylamines with heteroarylnitriles/aryl halides exhibit high efficiency, site&#8208;selectivity and good functional&#8208;group tolerance. Moreover, consecutive C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formation using benzylamines as substrates is also achieved, producing N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines with H2 evolution. The redox&#8208;neutral conditions, broad substrate scope, and efficiency of N&#8208;radical formation are advantageous for organic synthesis.

         <title>Alkyne Insertion Enabled Vinyl to Acyl 1,5&#8208;Palladium Migration: Rapid Access to Substituted 5&#8208;Membered&#8208;Dihydrobenzofurans and Indolines</title>

         <dc:description>
We herein report a novel 1,5&#8208;palladium/hydrogen shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group, which provides a divergent access to substituted 5&#8208;membered&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans and indolines. Further studies unveiled a novel relayed decarbonylative Catellani&#8208;type reaction. Mechanistic investigations including DFT calculations have shed light on the reaction pathway.







Abstract
&#8220;Through space&#8221; palladium/hydrogen shift is an efficient strategy to achieve selective functionalization of a specific remote C&#8722;H bond. Compared with relatively extensive exploited 1,4&#8208;palladium migration process, the relevant 1,5&#8208;Pd/H shift was far less investigated. We herein report a novel 1,5&#8208;Pd/H shift pattern between a vinyl and an acyl group. Through the pattern, rapid access to 5&#8208;membered&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran and indoline derivatives has been achieved. Further studies have unveiled an unprecedented trifunctionalization (vinylation, alkynylation and amination) of a phenyl ring through 1,5&#8208;palladium migration relayed decarbonylative Catellani type reaction. A series of mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway. Notably, it was unveiled that the 1,5&#8208;palladium migration in our case prefers a stepwise mechanism involving a PdIV intermediate.

         <title>Chemoselective 1,2&#8208;Reduction and Regiodivergent Deuteration of Chromium&#8208;Bound Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient protocol for chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;reduction of arenes via &#951;6&#8208;coordination to chromium has been reported for the first time. The versatility of this strategy further leads to a regiodivergent reductive deuteration that enables precise control of the deuteration sites as well as the degrees of deuterium incorporation.







Abstract
Herein, a general strategy for chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;reduction of chromium&#8208;bound arenes was developed, thus providing rapid access to 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes. Selective arene activation via &#960;&#8208;complexation along with the use of mild hydride Ph3SiH can overcome the inherently low reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;bonds while tolerating various reduction&#8208;sensitive functional groups. Its versatility further enables a regiodivergent deuteration. Using different sequences of (non)deuterated hydride and acid reagents, the deuterated positions as well as the degrees of deuterium incorporation can be controlled precisely, which leads to a large and previously inaccessible chemical space for 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene isotopologues. A reasonable mechanism was proposed based on intermediate capture and control experiments. The synthetic value of this selective 1,2&#8208;reduction was demonstrated in the formal total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;galanthamine and (&#177;)&#8208;lycoramine.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Nanobeacons Redirect Innate Immune Killing towards Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly imprinted nanobeacons (MINBs) were developed for redirecting innate immune killing towards cancer. The MINBs target the cancer cells and provide navigation for recruiting hapten&#8208;specific antibodies. The recruited antibodies further gather natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, triggering specific antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody&#8208;dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) to kill the tagged cancer cells.







Abstract
Harnessing innate immunity is an appealing strategy for cancer treatment. Herein, we report a new strategy called molecularly imprinted nanobeacons (MINBs) for redirecting innate immune killing towards triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). The MINBs were molecularly imprinted nanoparticles with the N&#8208;epitope of glycoprotein nonmetastatic B (GPNMB) as the template and grafted with plentiful fluorescein moieties as the hapten. The MINBs could tag the TNBC cells via binding with GPNMB and thereby provide navigation for recruiting hapten&#8208;specific antibodies. The gathered antibodies could further trigger effective Fc&#8208;domain&#8208;mediated immune killing towards the tagged cancer cells. In vivo experiments showed that the TNBC growth was significantly inhibited after MINBs treatment by intravenous injection as compared with control groups. This study not only opens a new access for redirecting innate immunity towards TNBC but also paves the way for innate immunity&#8208;based therapy of other diseases.

         <title>Isolated Tin(IV) Active Sites for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 in Neutral Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;based catalysts are known for their high yield of formate or CO in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, but here we report for the first time that a new Sn&#8208;based catalyst can achieve exceptional partial current density for the CH4 product.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts with non&#8208;copper metal sites for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) to hydrocarbons and oxygenates is highly desirable, but still a great challenge. Herein, a stable metal&#8211;organic framework (DMA)4[Sn2(THO)2] (Sn&#8208;THO, THO6&#8722; = triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexakis(olate), DMA = dimethylammonium) with isolated and distorted octahedral SnO62&#8722; active sites is reported as an electrocatalyst for eCO2RR, showing an exceptional performance for eCO2RR to the CH4 product rather than the common products formate and CO for reported Sn&#8208;based catalysts. The partial current density of CH4 reaches a high value of 34.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most reported copper&#8208;based and all non&#8208;Cu metal&#8208;based catalysts. Our experimental and theoretical results revealed that the isolated SnO62&#8722; active site favors the formation of key *OCOH species to produce CH4 and can greatly inhibit the formation of *OCHO and *COOH species to produce *HCOOH and *CO, respectively.

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Amorphization in 2D Materials: Mechanism and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent achievements in the fabrication of amorphous nanomaterials with the assistance of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2) and discusses the underlying amorphization mechanism. The application of amorphous nanomaterials in different fields is summarized, thus demonstrating the prospects of SC CO2.







Abstract
Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2)&#8208;assisted chemical and material processing has shown great success in the fabrication of 2D amorphous materials, while the amorphization mechanism in SC CO2 is quite complicated to be understand. In this review, we introduce different kinds of 2D amorphous materials prepared with SC CO2 and discuss the possible amorphization mechanism and how they affect the structures and properties of 2D materials. Their applications are further presented and discussed. In addition, the prospective of future development of SC CO2&#8208;assisted fabrication of 2D amorphous materials is also involved. The investigation of SC CO2 induced amorphization not only provides theoretic understanding of amorphization process, but also directs to the preparation and application of 2D amorphous materials with specific structure and property, suggesting the promising future of SC CO2&#8208;assisted process in material design and engineering.

         <title>Reversible Live&#8208;Cell Labeling with Retro&#8208;engineered HaloTags Enables Long&#8208;Term High&#8208; and Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Retro&#8208;engineered HaloTag (reHaloTags) show substrate exchange in the seconds&#8208;to&#8208;minutes regime due to their restored dehalogenase activity. Using fluorogenic substrates, reHaloTags outperform the standard HaloTag7 in bleaching resistance and control of labeling density. Single molecule tracking and localization microscopy particularly benefits from these new tags, opening exciting possibilities for untangling protein dynamics over extended time.







Abstract
Self&#8208;labeling enzymes (SLE) such as the HaloTag have emerged as powerful tools in high and super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy. Newly developed fluorogenic SLE substrates enable imaging in the presence of excess dye. To exploit this feature for reversible labeling, we engineered two variants of HaloTag7 with restored dehalogenase activity. Kinetic studies in vitro showed different turnover kinetics for reHaloTagS (&#8776;0.006&#8197;s&#8722;1) and reHaloTagF (&#8776;0.055&#8197;s&#8722;1). Imaging by confocal and stimulated emission depletion microscopy yielded 3&#8208;5&#8208;time enhanced photostability of reHaloTag labeling. Prominently, single molecule imaging with reHaloTags enabled controlled and stable labeling density over extended time periods. By combination with structured illumination, simultaneous visualization of single molecule diffusion and organellar dynamics was achieved.

     alt="Reversible Live-Cell Labeling with Retro-engineered HaloTags Enables Long-Term High- and Super-Resolution Imaging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retro-engineered HaloTag (reHaloTags) show substrate exchange in the seconds-to-minutes regime due to their restored dehalogenase activity. Using fluorogenic substrates, reHaloTags outperform the standard HaloTag7 in bleaching resistance and control of labeling density. Single molecule tracking and localization microscopy particularly benefits from these new tags, opening exciting possibilities for untangling protein dynamics over extended time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-labeling enzymes (SLE) such as the HaloTag have emerged as powerful tools in high and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Newly developed fluorogenic SLE substrates enable imaging in the presence of excess dye. To exploit this feature for reversible labeling, we engineered two variants of HaloTag7 with restored dehalogenase activity. Kinetic studies in vitro showed different turnover kinetics for reHaloTagS (&#8776;0.006&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and reHaloTagF (&#8776;0.055&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Imaging by confocal and stimulated emission depletion microscopy yielded 3-5-time enhanced photostability of reHaloTag labeling. Prominently, single molecule imaging with reHaloTags enabled controlled and stable labeling density over extended time periods. By combination with structured illumination, simultaneous visualization of single molecule diffusion and organellar dynamics was achieved. These applications highlight the potential of reHaloTag labeling for pushing the limits of advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Square&#8208;Planar Anionic Pt0 Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a diphosphine&#8208;borane ligand DPB enables straightforward access to anionic Pt0 complexes. [(DPB)PtX]&#8722; complexes were isolated and fully characterized. They represent unique examples of square&#8208;planar Pt0 complexes, as substantiated by X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and DFT calculations.







Abstract
A T&#8208;shaped Pt0 complex with a diphosphine&#8208;borane (DPB) ligand was prepared. The Pt&#8594;B interaction enhances the electrophilicity of the metal and triggers the addition of Lewis bases to give the corresponding tetracoordinate complexes. For the first time, anionic Pt0 complexes are isolated and structurally authenticated. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses show the anionic complexes [(DPB)PtX]&#8722; (X=CN, Cl, Br, I) to be square&#8208;planar. The d10 configuration and Pt0 oxidation state of the metal were unambiguously established by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The coordination of Lewis acids as Z&#8208;type ligands is a powerful mean to stabilize elusive electron&#8208;rich metal complexes and achieve uncommon geometry.

         <title>Sn Anodes Protected by Intermetallic FeSn2 Layers for Long&#8208;lifespan Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries with High Initial Coulombic Efficiency of 93.8 %</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intermetallic FeSn2 layer alleviates the huge volume change and prevents the coarsening of Sn anodes to provide a high ICE of 93.8&#8201;% and long life for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
With a theoretical capacity of 847&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, Sn has emerged as promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, enormous volume expansion and agglomeration of nano Sn lead to low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycling stability. Herein, an intermetallic FeSn2 layer is designed via thermal reduction of polymer&#8208;Fe2O3 coated hollow SnO2 spheres to construct a yolk&#8208;shell structured Sn/FeSn2@C. The FeSn2 layer can relieve internal stress, avoid the agglomeration of Sn to accelerate the Na+ transport, and enable fast electronic conduction, which endows quick electrochemical dynamics and long&#8208;term stability. As a result, the Sn/FeSn2@C anode exhibits high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE=93.8&#8201;%) and a high reversible capacity of 409&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1500&#8197;cycles, corresponding to an 80&#8201;% capacity retention. In addition, NVP//Sn/FeSn2@C sodium&#8208;ion full cell shows outstanding cycle stability (capacity retaining rate of 89.7&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C).

         <title>Switching Quantum Interference in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions by Mechanical Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The charge transport through single&#8208;molecule electronic devices can be controlled mechanically by changing the molecular geometrical configuration in situ, but the tunable conductance range is typically less than two orders of magnitude. Herein, we proposed a new mechanical tuning strategy to control the charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions via switching quantum interference patterns. By designing molecules with multiple anchoring groups, we switched the electron transport between the constructive quantum interference (CQI) pathway and the destructive quantum interference (DQI) pathway, and more than four orders of magnitude conductance variation can be achieved by shifting the electrodes in a range of about 0.6 nm, which is the highest conductance range ever achieved using mechanical tuning.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbon to CaC2 route is promising to provide a sustainable elementary unit, C2H2, for the organic synthesis industry, but the traditional thermal reaction process suffers from low carbon efficiency, harmful gas contamination, high temperature operation, and risky CO management. We herein report a high carbon efficiency (ca. 100%) conversion of biochar to C2H2 through an electrolytic synthesis of solid CaC2 in molten CaCl2/KCl/CaO at 973 K. The main reactions are carbon reduction to CaC2 at the solid carbon cathode and oxygen evolution at an inert anode. Meanwhile, the electrolysis removes S and P from the solid cathode, avoiding the formation of CaS and Ca3P2 in CaC2 and consequently eliminating H2S and PH3 contamination in the finally produced C2H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Li Plating on Graphite Anodes through Electrolyte Engineering for Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difficulties to identify the rate&#8208;limiting step cause the lithium (Li) plating hard to be completely avoided on graphite anodes during fast charging. Therefore, Li plating regulation and morphology control are proposed to address this issue. Specifically, a Li plating&#8208;reversible graphite anode is achieved via a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to successfully regulate the Li plating with high reversibility over high&#8208;rate cycling. The evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) before and after Li plating is deeply investigated to explore the interaction between the lithiation behavior and electrochemical interface polarization. Under the fact that Li plating contributes 40% of total lithiation capacity, the stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI renders the anode a higher average Coulombic efficiency (99.9%) throughout 240 cycles and a 99.95% reversibility of Li plating. Consequently, a self&#8208;made 1.2&#8208;Ah LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite pouch cell delivers a competitive retention of 84.4% even at 7.2 A (6 C) after 150 cycles. This work creates an ingenious bridge between the graphite anode and Li plating, for realizing the high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Protein Desulfurization Method Reminiscent of Aquatic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One pillar of protein chemical synthesis based on the application of ligation chemistries to cysteine is the group of reactions enabling the selective desulfurization of cysteine residues into alanines. Modern desulfurization reactions use a phosphine as a sink for sulfur under activation conditions involving the generation of sulfur&#8208;centered radicals. Here we show that cysteine desulfurization by a phosphine can be effected efficiently by micromolar concentrations of iron under aerobic conditions in hydrogen carbonate buffer, that is using conditions that are reminiscent of iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation phenomena occurring in natural waters. Therefore, our work shows that chemical processes taking place in aquatic systems can be adapted to a chemical reactor for triggering a complex chemoselective transformation at the protein level, while minimizing the resort to harmful chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Confined Single&#8208;Atomic Pt Nanozymes for Enzymatic Theranostics of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional nanozymes often possess low active site density. Pursuing effective strategies for constructing highly active single&#8208;atomic nanosystems with maximum atom utilization efficiency is exceptionally attractive. Herein, we develop a facile &#8220;missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination&#8221; strategy to fabricate two self&#8208;assembled nanozymes, i.e., conventional nanozyme (NE) and single&#8208;atomic nanozyme (SAE), which respectively consist of Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms as active catalytic sites anchored in metal&#8208;organic frameworks with encapsulated photosensitizers for catalase&#8208;mimicking enhanced photodynamic therapy. Compared to Pt nanoparticle&#8208;based conventional nanozyme, Pt single&#8208;atomic nanozyme shows enhanced catalase&#8208;mimicking activity in generating oxygen for overcoming tumor hypoxia, thus presenting more efficient reactive oxygen species generation and high tumor inhibition rate.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carboamination reaction is one of the most significant transformations in organic chemistry. Herein, we report the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alleneamination of &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones with propargylic acetates. This protocol enables the efficient installation of various multisubstituted allene groups onto enantioenriched dihydropyrazoles in good yields (up to 96%) with up to 96% ee. The chiral sulfinamide phosphine ligand Xu&#8208;5 is responsible for high effciency and good enantioselectivity. The salient features of this reaction include the readily available starting materials, a broad substrate scope, an easy scale&#8208;up, mild reaction conditions and versatile transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Determining the Role of Ion Transport Throughput in Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices. However, there still lacks an evaluation criterion to estimate real research status and compare overall performance&#160;of the developed SSLMBs. Herein, we propose a comprehensive descriptor, Li+ transport throughput (&#934;Li+), to estimate actual conditions and output performances of the SSLMBs. The &#934;Li+ is defined as molar number of Li+ passing through unit area of electrode/electrolyte interface in an hour (mol m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1), which is a quantizable value after taking complex aspects including cycle rate, electrode areal capacity and polarization into account. On this basis, we evaluate the &#934;Li+ of liquid, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state and solid&#8208;state batteries, and highlight three key aspects to achieve high value of &#934;Li+ via building highly efficient cross&#8208;phase, cross&#8208;gap and cross&#8208;interface ion transport in the solid&#8208;state battery systems. We believe the new concept of&#160;&#934;Li+&#160;provides milestone guidelines towards large&#8208;scale commercialization of SSLMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Conjugation with Triazolinediones as a Route to Degradable Poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;Lipids for mRNA Lipid Nanoparticle Formulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is considered as the gold standard for colloidal stabilization of nanomedicines and prolonging the half&#8208;life of proteins. However, PEG is non&#8208;degradable and lacks functionality in the backbone, thereby limiting the scope of its potential. Herein, we introduced concomitantly functionality and degradability onto the PEG backbone by reacting PEG with 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones (TADs) derivatives under visible light irradiation. The TAD&#8208;PEG conjugates were degradable in aqueous medium under physiological conditions, with the rate of hydrolysis depending on the pH and temperature of the medium. Next, a PEG&#8208;lipid was modified with TAD&#8208;derivatives. The obtained TAD&#8208;PEG&#8208;lipids could be successfully used for mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery and increased mRNA transfection efficiency on multiple cell cultures in vitro, without increasing cellular uptake of LNPs. In vivo, in mice, mRNA LNP formulation exhibited a similar tissue distribution as common LNPs, with a slight decrease in transfection efficiency. Our findings pave the road towards the design of degradable, backbone&#8208;functionalized PEG for applications in nanomedicine and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Redox in Polyimide:&#8201; Witness by In Situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials are promising candidates for future rechargeable batteries, owing to their high natural abundance and rapidly redox reaction. Elaborating the charge/discharge process of organic electrode is critical to unveil the fundamental redox mechanism of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but monitoring of this process is still challenging. Here, we report a nondestructive electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique to real&#8208;time detect the electron migration step within polyimide cathode. From in situ EPR tests, we vividly observe a classical redox reaction along with two&#8208;electron transfer which only shows one pair of peaks in the cyclic voltammetry curve. The radical anion and dianion intermediates are detailed delineation at redox sites in EPR spectra, which can be further confirmed through density functional theory calculations. This approach is especially crucial to elaborate the correlation behind electrochemical and molecular structure for multistep organic&#8208;based LIBs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Machine learning (ML) algorithms are currently emerging as powerful tools in all areas of science. Conventionally, ML is understood as a fundamentally data&#8208;driven endeavour. Unfortunately, large well&#8208;curated databases are sparse in chemistry. In this contribution, I therefore review science&#8208;driven ML approaches which do not rely on ``big data'', focusing on the atomistic modelling of materials and molecules. In this context, the term science&#8208;driven refers to approaches that begin with a scientific question and then ask what training data and model design choices are appropriate. As key features of science&#8208;driven ML, the automated and purpose&#8208;driven collection of data and the use of chemical and physical priors to achieve high data&#8208;efficiency are discussed. Furthermore, the importance of appropriate model evaluation and error estimation is emphasized.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Supported Copper Photoredox Catalysts for Iminyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light copper photocatalysis has recently emerged as a viable technology for building sustainable synthetic processes. To broaden the applications of phosphine&#8208;ligated copper(I) complexes, we describe herein an effective metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported copper(I) photocatalyst for multiple iminyl radical&#8208;mediated reactions. Due to site isolation, the heterogenized copper photosensitizer has a significantly higher catalytic activity than its homogeneous counterpart. Using a hydroxamic acid linker to immobilize copper species on MOF supports affords the heterogeneous catalysts with high recyclability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification sequence on MOF surfaces allows for the preparation of previously unavailable monomeric copper species. Our findings highlight the potential of using MOF&#8208;based heterogeneous catalytic systems to address fundamental challenges in the development of synthetic methodologies and mechanistic investigations of transition&#8208;metal photoredox catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Deformation of Soft Nanogel Particles Generates Artificial Biominerals with Ordered Internal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biominerals can exhibit exceptional mechanical properties owing to their hierarchically&#8208;ordered organic/inorganic nanocomposite structure. However, synthetic routes to oriented artificial biominerals of comparable complexity remain a formidable technical challenge. Herein we design a series of soft, deformable nanogels that are employed as particulate additives to prepare nanogel@calcite nanocomposite crystals. Remarkably, such nanogels undergo a significant morphological change&#8212;from spherical to pseudo&#8208;hemispherical&#8212;depending on their degree of cross&#8208;linking. Such deformation occurs normal to the direction of growth of the (104) face of the calcite and the underlying occlusion mechanism is revealed by in situ atomic force microscopy studies. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and offers new avenues for the design of synthetic nanocomposites comprising aligned anisotropic nanoparticles.</dc:description>

In these&#160;intramolecular&#160;reactions, the two&#8208;bond formation is realized by exploiting benzyne precursors that&#160;contain a chlorosilyl group as a&#160;linking functionality.

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Multiblock Copolymerization Accompanying Chirality Transfer in Heterostructures via Living Chain Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the unique synthesis of chiral supramolecular tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;BCPs with controllable chirality using kinetically adjusted seeded supramolecular copolymerization in THF and DMSO (99:1, v/v). Tetraphenylethylene (D&#8208; and L&#8208;TPE) derivatives bearing D&#8208; and L&#8208;alanine side chains formed thermodynamically favored chiral products via a kinetically trapped in monomeric state with a long lag phase. In contrast, achiral TPE&#8208;G containing glycine moieties did not form a supramolecular polymer owing to the energy barrier in its kinetically trapped state. We show that the copolymerization of the metastable states of TPE&#8208;G not only enables the generation of supramolecular BCPs by the seeded living growth method, but also transfers chirality at the seed ends. This research demonstrates the generation of chiral supramolecular tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;BCPs with B&#8208;A&#8208;B, A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A, and C&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;C block patterns accompanying chirality transfer via seeded living polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Methane photooxidation with nearly 100% selectivity towards oxygenates: proton rebound ensures the regeneration of methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Restrained by uncontrollable dehydrogenation process, the target products of methane direct conversion would suffer from an inevitable overoxidation, which is deemed as one of the most challenging issues in catalysis. Herein, based on the concept of hydrogen bonding trap, we proposed a novel concept to modulate methane conversion pathway to hinder the overoxidation of target products. Taking boron nitride as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept model, for the first time, it is found that the designed N&#8208;H bonds can work as hydrogen bonding trap to attract electrons. Benefitting from it, the N&#8208;H bonds on the BN surface rather than C&#8208;H bonds in formaldehyde prefer to cleavage, greatly suppressing the continuous dehydrogenation process. More importantly, formaldehyde will combine with the released protons, which leads to a proton rebound process to regenerate methanol. As a result, BN shows a high methane conversion rate (8.5%) and nearly 100% product selectivity to oxygenates under atmospheric pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Chemistry&#8208;Enabled Sonodynamic Activity of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Nanodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizers with intrinsic sonodynamic effects is highly desirable. However, such COFs are generally constructed using small&#8208;molecule photosensitizers. Herein, we report that the reticular chemistry&#8208;based synthesis of COFs from two inert monomers yields a COF&#8208;based sonosensitizer (TPE&#8208;NN) with inherent sonodynamic activity. Subsequently, a nanoscale COF TPE&#8208;NN is fabricated and embedded with copper (Cu)&#8208;coordinated sites to obtain TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu. Results show that Cu coordination can enhance the sonodynamic effect of TPE&#8208;NN, whereas ultrasound (US) irradiation for sonodynamic therapy can augment the chemodynamic efficacy of TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu. Consequently, TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu upon US irradiation shows high&#8208;performance anticancer effects based on mutually reinforced sono&#8208;/chemo&#8208;nanodynamic therapy. This study reveals the backbone&#8208;originated sonodynamic activity of COFs and proposes a paradigm of intrinsic COF sonosensitizers for nanodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Pauson&#8208;Khand Reactions of 1,6&#8208;Chloroenynes with 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction (PKR) using 1,6&#8208;chloroenynes that contain challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins is described. In contrast to the previous studies with these types of substrates, which is only suitable for a single type of tether and alkyne substituent, the new approach results in a more expansive substrate scope, including carbon and heteroatom tethers with polar and non&#8208;polar substituents on the alkene. DFT calculations provide critical insight into the role of the halide, which pre&#8208;polarizes the alkyne to lower the barrier for the metallacycle formation and provides the proper steric profile to promote a favorable enantiodetermining interaction between substrate and chiral diphosphine ligand. Hence, the chloroalkyne enables the efficient and enantioselective PKR with 1,6&#8208;enynes that contain challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins, which represents a new paradigm for enantioselective reactions involving 1,6&#8208;enynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymerized thermally activated delayed fluorescence small molecules: long&#8208;axis polymerization leads to a nearly concentration&#8208;independent luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nowadays numerous thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers have been developed for PLEDs to realize high device performance and tunable emission colors. However, they often possess a strong concentration dependence on their luminescence including aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Herein, we first report a nearly concentration&#8208;independent TADF polymer based on the strategy of polymerized TADF small molecules. It is found that when a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) type TADF small molecule is polymerized through its long&#8208;axis direction, the triplet state is distributed along the polymeric backbone to effectively suppress the unwanted concentration quenching. Unlike the short&#8208;axis one with an ACQ effect, the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of the resultant long&#8208;axis polymer remains almost unchanged with the increasing doping concentration. Accordingly, a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 20% is successfully achieved in a whole doping control window of 5&#8208;100 wt.%.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of an A6L6 Anion Trigonal Antiprism and Binding of Glucopyranosides and Polyethylene Glycols (PEGs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) has proven to be a very effective strategy in the construction of polyhedral structures. Here we demonstrate that variation of the &#8220;angle&#8221; of the backbone of C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands, from triphenylamine to triphenylphosphine oxide, results in the change of the final construct from A4L4 tetrahedron to a higher&#8208;nuclearity, A6L6 trigonal antiprism (A = anion, herein PO43&#8211;; L = ligand). Most interestingly, this assembly features a huge hollow internal space that is divided into three compartments, one central cavity and two large outer pockets. This multi&#8208;cavity character enables the binding of different guests, i.e. monosaccharides or polyethylene glycol molecules (PEG600, PEG1000 and PEG2000), respectively. The results prove that anion coordination by multiple hydrogen bonds may provide both sufficient strength and flexibility, thus making possible the formation of complicated structures with adaptive guest binding ability.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance and Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detectors Made of Smooth Perovskite Microcrystalline Films with 100&#8208;&#956;m Grains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite single crystals and polycrystalline films have complementary merits and deficiencies in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Herein, we report preparation of dense and smooth perovskite microcrystalline films with both merits of single crystals and polycrystalline films through polycrystal&#8208;induced growth and hot&#8208;pressing treatment (HPT). Utilizing polycrystalline films as seeds, multi&#8208;inch&#8208;sized microcrystalline films can be in&#8208;situ grown on diverse substrates with maximum grain size reaching 100 &#956;m, which endows the microcrystalline films with comparable carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime (&#956;&#964;) product as single crystals. As a result, self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detectors with impressive sensitivity of 6.1 &#215; 104 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and low detection limit of 1.5 nGyair s&#8722;1 are achieved, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67 nGyair s&#8722;1. Combining with the fast response speed (186 &#956;s), this work may contribute to the development of perovskite&#8208;based low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Selective Oxidation of Ethylene to Ethylene Glycol Assisted by In&#8208;situ Generated H2O2 from O2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene glycol is a useful organic compound and chemical intermediate for manufacturing various commodity chemicals of industrial importance. Nevertheless, the production of ethylene glycol in a green and safe manner is still a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we established an integrated, efficient pathway for oxidizing ethylene into ethylene glycol. Mesoporous carbon catalyst produces H2O2, and titanium silicalite&#8208;1&#160;catalyst would subsequently oxidize ethylene into ethylene glycol with the in&#8208;situ generated H2O2. This tandem route presents a remarkable activity, i.e., 86% H2O2&#160;conversion with 99% ethylene glycol selectivity and 51.48 mmol gecat&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1&#160;production rate at 0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Apart from generated H2O2&#160;as an oxidant, there exists &#8226;OOH intermediate which could omit the step of absorbing and dissociating H2O2&#160;over titanium silicalite&#8208;1, showing faster reaction kinetics compared to the ex&#8208;situ one. This work not only provides a new idea for yielding ethylene glycol but also demonstrates the superior of in&#8208;situ generated H2O2&#160;in tandem route.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reactions Accelerated by Interpretable Intrinsic Descriptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous activity descriptors have been developed to rationally design single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), such as energy&#8208;based or electronic descriptors. However, their computationally costly and experimentally unobtainable properties limit the understanding of the structure&#8208;activity relationship to a case&#8208;by&#8208;case basis. This paper describes a simple and interpretable descriptor directly related to activity, which can be not only easily obtained from the atomic databases, but also experimentally verified by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The defined descriptor proves to accelerate high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 700 graphene&#8208;based SAC models without computations, universal for 3&#8208;5d transition metals and C/N/P/B/O&#8208;based coordination environments. Meanwhile, the analytical formula of this descriptor reveals the intrinsic relations of various crucial features in the complicated metal&#8208;ligand interaction, thus the structure&#8208;activity relationship is clarified at the molecular orbital level. Using electrochemical nitrogen reduction as an example, this descriptor&#8217;s guidance role has been experimentally validated by 13 previous reports as well as our synthesized 4 SACs. Several other new advanced catalysts are also identified. Orderly combining machine learning with physical insights, this work provides a new generalized strategy for crossing the chasm between low&#8208;cost high&#8208;throughput screening and a comprehensive understanding of the structure&#8208;mechanism&#8208;activity relationship.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;Bound or O&#8208;Bound Surface: Which One Boosts Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate under ambient conditions is kind of sustainable and promising alternative method for urea synthesis. To date, the influence of catalyst surface properties on molecular adsorption configuration and electrocatalytic urea synthesis activity is unclear. In this work, we proposed&#160;that the urea synthesis activity is closely linked&#160;with the localized surface charge on bimetallic electrocatalysts, it is found that a negatively charged surface induces C&#8208;bound path and boosts urea synthesis. The urea yield rate can reach 13.1 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 on negatively charged Cu97In3&#8208;C, which is about 13 times that of positively charged Cu30In70&#8208;C counterpart with O&#8208;bound surface. This conclusion&#160;also applies&#160;to Cu&#8208;Bi and Cu&#8208;Sn systems. The molecular modification shifts the surface of Cu97In3&#8208;C to positively charged state, which leads to a sharp decline in urea synthesis performance. We demonstrated that the C&#8208;bound surface is more favorable than O&#8208;bound one to boost electrocatalytic urea synthesis.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic C-N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate under ambient conditions is kind of sustainable and promising alternative method for urea synthesis. To date, the influence of catalyst surface properties on molecular adsorption configuration and electrocatalytic urea synthesis activity is unclear. In this work, we proposed&#160;that the urea synthesis activity is closely linked&#160;with the localized surface charge on bimetallic electrocatalysts, it is found that a negatively charged surface induces C-bound path and boosts urea synthesis. The urea yield rate can reach 13.1 mmol g-1 h-1 on negatively charged Cu97In3-C, which is about 13 times that of positively charged Cu30In70-C counterpart with O-bound surface. This conclusion&#160;also applies&#160;to Cu-Bi and Cu-Sn systems. The molecular modification shifts the surface of Cu97In3-C to positively charged state, which leads to a sharp decline in urea synthesis performance. We demonstrated that the C-bound surface is more favorable than O-bound one to boost electrocatalytic urea synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Turning the Inert Element Zinc into an Active Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amongst various Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the zinc (Zn)&#8208;related SACs have been barely reported due to the fully occupied 3d10 configuration of Zn2+ being inactive for the Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Herein, the inert element Zn is turned into an active single&#8208;atom catalyst (SA&#8208;Zn&#8208;NC) for the Fenton&#8208;like chemistry by forming the atomic Zn&#8210;N4 coordination structure. The SA&#8208;Zn&#8208;NC shows admirable Fenton&#8208;like activity in organic pollutant remediation including self&#8208;oxidation and catalytic degradation by superoxide radical (O2&#9679;&#8210;) and singlet oxygen (1O2). Experimental and theoretical results unveiled that the single&#8208;atomic Zn&#8210;N4 site with electron acquisition can transfer electrons donating from electron&#8208;rich pollutants and low&#8208;concentration PMS toward dissolved oxygen (DO) to actuate DO reduction into O2&#9679;&#8210; and successive conversion into 1O2. This work inspires an exploration of efficient and stable Fenton&#8208;like SACs for sustainable and resource&#8208;saving environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptionally Stable Dimers and Trimers of Au25 Clusters Linked with a Bidentate Dithiol: Synthesis, Structure and Chirality Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chiral dithiol is used to bridge Au25 nanoclusters together. Due to its bidentate nature, the dimers and trimers can be isolated before further reaction occurs. The structure of the oligomers is analysed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The changes in optical properties are followed by UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism.







Abstract
A bidentate chiral dithiol (diBINAS) is utilised to bridge Au25 nanoclusters to form oligomers. Separation by size allows the isolation of fractions that are stable thanks to the bidentate nature of the linker. The structure of the products is elucidated by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and calculated using density functional theory. Additional structural details are studied by diffusion&#8208;ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Significant changes in the optical properties are analysed by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies, with the latter demonstrating a strong emission enhancement. Furthermore, the emergent chiral characteristics are studied by circular dichroism. Due to the geometry constraints of the nanocluster assemblies, diBINAS can be regarded as a templating molecule, taking a step towards the directed self&#8208;assembly of metal clusters.

         <title>Regulating the Synergistic Effect in Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysts by Adjusting the Coupling Strength Between Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bimetallic Co&#8722;Ni two&#8208;dimensional polymer model oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst with well&#8208;defined architecture, monolayer characteristic, different metal center spacing or different conjugation degree of bridge skeleton were designed and synthesized to explore the influence of the coupling strength between metal centers for OER.







Abstract
Bimetallic electrocatalysts with its superior performance has a broad application prospect in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the fundamental understanding of the mechanism of synergistic effect is still limited since there lacks a practical way to decouple the influence factors on the intrinsic activity of active sites from others. Herein, a series of bimetallic Co&#8722;Ni two&#8208;dimensional polymer (2DP) model OER catalysts with well&#8208;defined architecture, monolayer characteristic, were designed and synthesized to explore the influence of the coupling strength between metal centers on OER performance. The coupling strength was regulated by adjusting the spacing between metal centers or the conjugation degree of bridge skeleton. Among the examined 2DPs, CoTAPP&#8208;Ni&#8208;MF&#8208;2DP, which has the strongest coupling strength between metal centers exhibited the best OER performance. These model systems can help to explore the precise structure&#8208;performance relationships, which is important for the rational catalyst design at the atomic/molecular levels.

         <title>Double Deprotonation of CH3CN by an Iron&#8208;Aluminium Complex
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double deprotonation of CH3CN was achieved using an iron&#8208;aluminium complex, yielding products containing a simple yet rare [HC=C=N]2&#8722; dianion, characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography. DFT calculations suggest that the mechanism proceeds via a stepwise double deprotonation of the substrate by two equivalents of the bimetallic complex, with the intermediacy of a [NCCH2]&#8722; anion, which was observed spectroscopically in situ.







Abstract
Herein we present the first double deprotonation of acetonitrile (CH3CN) using two equivalents of a bimetallic iron&#8208;aluminium complex. The products of this reaction contain an exceeding simple yet rare [CHCN]2&#8722; dianion moiety that bridges two metal fragments. DFT calculations suggest that the bonding to the metal centres occurs through heavily polarised covalent interactions. Mechanistic studies reveal the intermediacy of a monomeric [CH2CN]&#8722; complex, which has been characterised in situ. Our findings provide an important example in which a bimetallic metal complex achieves a new type of reactivity not previously encountered with monometallic counterparts.[1,&#8201;2] The isolation of a [CHCN]2&#8722; dianion through simple deprotonation of CH3CN also offers the possibility of establishing a broader chemistry of this motif.

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Embedded Heterocyclic Narrowband Emitters with Strengthened Molecular Rigidity and Suppressed High&#8208;Frequency Vibronic Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined restricted excited state relaxation by strengthening molecular rigidity with suppressed high&#8208;frequency vibration by introducing bending vibration of sulfone group in low&#8208;frequency region, extremely narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum of 25 and 28&#8197;nm were realized for 2tCPD and tPD, respectively.







Abstract
Sulfone&#8208;embedded heterocyclics are of great interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), however, exploring highly efficient narrowband emitters based on sulfone&#8208;embedded heterocyclics remains challenging. Herein, five emitters with different sulfur valence state and molecular rigidity, namely tP, tCPD, 2tCPD, tPD and tPT, are thoroughly analysed. With restricted twisting of flexible peripheral phenyl by strengthening molecular rigidity, molecular emission spectra can be enormously narrowed. Further, introducing the sulfone group with bending vibration in low&#8208;frequency region that suppresses high&#8208;frequency vibration, sharp narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum of 28 and 25&#8197;nm are achieved for 2tCPD and tPD, respectively. Maximum external quantum efficiencies of 22.0&#8201;% and 27.1&#8201;% are successfully realized for 2tCPD&#8208; and tPD&#8208;based OLED devices. These results offer a novel design strategy for constructing narrowband emitters by introducing sulfone group into a rigid molecular framework.

         <title>Liquid Precursor&#8208;Guided Phase Engineering of Single&#8208;Crystal VO2 Beams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates the implications of liquid V2O5 precursor on the liquid&#8208;assisted growth of VO2 and further phase engineering of single&#8208;crystal VO2 beams between the M1&#8208;, M2&#8208;, and T&#8208;phases by manipulation of oxygen stoichiometry, enabling various multiphase structures in single VO2 beams and enriching the deformation modes for their actuation applications.







Abstract
The study of VO2 flourishes due to its rich competing phases induced by slight stoichiometry variations. However, the vague mechanism of stoichiometry manipulation makes the precise phase engineering of VO2 still challenging. Here, stoichiometry manipulation of single&#8208;crystal VO2 beams in liquid&#8208;assisted growth is systematically studied. Contrary to previous experience, oxygen&#8208;rich VO2 phases are abnormally synthesized under a reduced oxygen concentration, revealing the important function of liquid V2O5 precursor: It submerges VO2 crystals and stabilizes their stoichiometric phase (M1) by isolating them from the reactive atmosphere, while the uncovered crystals are oxidized by the growth atmosphere. By varying the thickness of liquid V2O5 precursor and thus the exposure time of VO2 to the atmosphere, various VO2 phases (M1, T, and M2) can be selectively stabilized. Furthermore, this liquid precursor&#8208;guided growth can be used to spatially manages multiphase structures in single VO2 beams, enriching their deformation modes for actuation applications.

         <title>Pore &#8220;Softening&#8221; and Emergence of Breathability Effects of New Keplerate Nano&#8208;Containers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering of porosity for the controlled interaction with their external chemical environment of new members of Keplerate type molecular nano&#8208;containers is investigated. Their crystal structure has been determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions while the balancing act of kinetic and thermodynamic factors in conjunction with the emergence of amplified pore breathability that govern the functionality of the nano&#8208;containers is discussed.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of porous molecular nanocapsules offer unique opportunities to investigate a range of interesting phenomena and applications. However, to design nanocapsules with pre&#8208;defined properties, thorough understanding of their structure&#8208;property relation is required. Here, we report the self&#8208;assembly of two elusive members of the Keplerate family, [Mo132Se60O312(H2O)72(AcO)30]42&#8722; {Mo132Se60} 1 and [W72Mo60Se60O312(H2O)72(AcO)30]42&#8722; {W72Mo60Se60} 2, that have been synthesised using pentagonal and dimeric ([Mo2O2Se2]2+) building blocks and their structures have been confirmed via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions. Our comparative study involving the uptake of organic ions and the related ligand exchange of various ligand sizes by the {Mo132Se60} and previously reported Keplerates {Mo132O60}, {Mo132S60} based on the ligand exchange rates, revealed the emergence of increased &#8220;breathability&#8221; that dominates over the pore size as we transition from the {Mo132S60} to the &#8220;softer&#8221; {Mo132Se60} molecular nano&#8208;container.

         <title>Multiplex Identification of Post&#8208;Translational Modifications at Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care by Deep Learning&#8208;Assisted Hydrogel Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep learning&#8208;assisted multiplex detection method based on photonic crystal hydrogels for both peptides, cellular proteins and upregulation of phosphorylation in live mammalian cells, is reported. It is the first intelligent naked&#8208;eye strategy for multiplex identification of common PTMs, with high selectivity and sensitivity.







Abstract
Multiplex detection of protein post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), especially at point&#8208;of&#8208;care, is of great significance in cancer diagnosis. Herein, we report a machine learning&#8208;assisted photonic crystal hydrogel (PCH) sensor for multiplex detection of PTMs. With closely&#8208;related PCH sensors microfabricated on a single chip, our design achieved not only rapid screening of PTMs at specific protein sites by using only naked eyes/cellphone, but also the feasibility of real&#8208;time monitoring of phosphorylation reactions. By taking advantage of multiplex sensor chips and a neural network algorithm, accurate prediction of PTMs by both their types and concentrations was enabled. This approach was ultimately used to detect and differentiate up/down regulation of different phosphorylation sites within the same protein in live mammalian cells. Our developed method thus holds potential for POC identification of various PTMs in early&#8208;stage diagnosis of protein&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Functional Ionic Liquid Polymer Stabilizer for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic&#8208;liquid polymer additive (poly[Se&#8208;MI][BF4]) is developed to stabilize perovskite precursor inks used to fabricate perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). A chemical homogeneity of the inks contributes to improving the quality of perovskite films by stabilizing the colloids and compositions for over two months. Moreover, polymers anchored at the grain boundaries can further suppress the migration of I&#8722; ions. Thus, the pero&#8208;SCs exhibit overall improved stability and efficiency.







Abstract
The stability&#8208;related issues arising from the perovskite precursor inks, films, device structures and interdependence remain severely under&#8208;explored to date. Herein, we designed an ionic&#8208;liquid polymer (poly[Se&#8208;MI][BF4]), containing functional moieties like carbonyl (C=O), selenium (Se+), and tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) ions, to stabilize the whole device fabrication process. The C=O and Se+ can coordinate with lead and iodine (I&#8722;) ions to stabilize lead polyhalide colloids and the compositions of the perovskite precursor inks for over two months. The Se+ anchored on grain boundaries and the defects passivated by BF4&#8722; efficiently suppress the dissociation and migration of I&#8722; in perovskite films. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of poly[Se&#8208;MI][BF4], high efficiencies of 25.10&#8201;% and 20.85&#8201;% were exhibited by a 0.062&#8208;cm2 device and 15.39&#8208;cm2 module, respectively. The devices retained over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency under operation for 2200&#8197;h.

         <title>A Fourfold Gold(I)&#8722;Aryl Macrocycle with Hyperbolic Geometry and its Reductive Elimination to a Carbon Nanoring Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conformational flexible [6]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene derivative that can adopt a &#8220;chair&#8221; or a &#8220;boat&#8221; conformation and a rigid dinuclear gold(I) complex have been shown to form a metallacycle with a square geometry. Reductive elimination results in an all&#8208;organic nanoring with a large inner cavity that is suitable for the supramolecular binding of several guests with convex &#960;&#8208;surfaces.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A conformational flexible [6]cyclo-&lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene derivative that can adopt a &#8220;chair&#8221; or a &#8220;boat&#8221; conformation and a rigid dinuclear gold(I) complex have been shown to form a metallacycle with a square geometry. Reductive elimination results in an all-organic nanoring with a large inner cavity that is suitable for the supramolecular binding of several guests with convex &#960;-surfaces.

         <title>A LDH Template Triggers the Formation of a Highly Compact MIL&#8208;53 Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane for Acid Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A LDH nanoflake template layer triggers conversion into a highly compact MIL&#8208;53 membrane. The template guides MIL&#8208;53 crystals to replicate its imprint out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and modulates the availability of Al from the alumina support for in&#8208;plane growth of MIL&#8208;53. The membrane can achieve complete dewatering from azeotropic formic acid and save 77&#8201;% of the energy consumption compared to distillation.







Abstract
Highly compact metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes offer hope for the ambition to cope with challenging separation scenarios with industrial implications. A continuous layer of layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoflakes on an alumina support as a template triggered a chemical self&#8208;conversion to a MIL&#8208;53 membrane, with approximately 8 hexagonal lattices (LDH) traded for 1 orthorhombic lattice (MIL&#8208;53). With the sacrifice of the template, the availability of Al nutrients from the alumina support was dynamically regulated, which resulted in synergy for producing membranes with highly compact architecture. The membrane can realize nearly complete dewatering from formic acid and acetic acid solutions, respectively, and maintain stability in a continuous pervaporation over 200&#8197;h. This is the first success in directly applying a pure MOF membrane to such a corrosive chemical environment (lowest pH value of 0.81). The energy consumption is saved by up to 77&#8201;% when compared with the traditional distillation.

         <title>Directing Group&#8208;Free Regioselective meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine is one of the most abundant motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, chemists were constrained in their ability to append substituents at the meta&#8208;position of pyridines. Two complementary one&#8208;pot approaches developed independently have helped to overcome this challenge. While one involves breaking the pyridine ring to form linear imines, the other relies on 1,4&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions to disrupt the aromaticity of pyridine.







Abstract
The pyridine core is among the most common motifs found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Consequently, the C&#8722;H functionalization of pyridine is a prized reaction, as it can help access a broad spectrum of valuable chemicals. However, the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines hinder their meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization, requiring drastic conditions affecting functional group compatibility. A synthetic manoeuvre to overcome this challenge involves the temporary conversion of pyridines into electron&#8208;rich intermediates and subsequent regioselective electrophilic functionalization. This was recently accomplished by a ring&#8208;opening ring&#8208;closing sequence via Zincke imine intermediates by McNally and co&#8208;workers, and a dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization sequence via oxazino&#8208;pyridine intermediates by the Studer group. The mildness and simplicity of these protocols enable them to work with complex molecular setups for synthesizing natural products and bioactive molecules.

         <title>Simple and Versatile Nitrooxylation: Noncyclic Hypervalent Iodine Nitrooxylating Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic nitrates are broadly applied as pharmaceuticals (acting as efficient nitric oxide donor), energetic materials, building blocks in organic synthesis, etc. However, practical and direct methods to access organic nitrates efficiently is still rare mainly due to the lack of powerful nitrooxylating reagents. Herein, we report a kind of bench&#8208;stable and highly reactive noncyclic hypervalent iodine nitrooxylating reagents, oxybis(aryl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanediyl) dinitrates (OAIDNs, 2), which are prepared just by using aryliodine diacetate and HNO3. The reagents are used to achieve a mild and operationally simple protocol to access diverse organic nitrates. By employing of 2, zinc&#8208;catalyzed regioselective nitrooxylation of cyclopropyl silyl ethers is realized efficiently to offer the corresponding &#946;&#8208;nitrooxy ketones with high functional group tolerance. Moreover, a series of direct and catalyst&#8208;free nitrooxylations of enolizable C&#8208;H bonds are carried out smoothly to afford the desired organic nitrates by just mixing the substrates with 2 in dichloromethane in minutes.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring Cardiac Biomarkers with Aptamer&#8208;Based Molecular Pendulum Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reagent&#8208;free electronic biosensors capable of analyzing disease markers directly in unprocessed body fluids will enable the development of simple &amp; affordable devices for personalized healthcare monitoring. Here we report a powerful and versatile nucleic acid&#8208;based reagent&#8208;free electronic sensing system. The signal transduction is based on the kinetics of an electrode&#8208;tethered molecular pendulum &#8211; a rigid double stranded DNA with one of the strands displaying an analyte&#8208;binding aptamer and the other featuring a redox probe &#8211; that exhibits field&#8208;induced transport modulated by receptor occupancy. Using chronoamperometry, which enables the sensor to circumvent the conventional Debye length limitation, the binding of an analyte can be monitored as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag. The sensing platform demonstrate a low femtomolar quantification limit and minimal cross&#8208;reactivity in analyzing cardiac biomarkers in whole blood collected from patients with chronic heart failure.</dc:description>

The signal transduction is based on the kinetics of an electrode-tethered molecular pendulum &#8211; a rigid double stranded DNA with one of the strands displaying an analyte-binding aptamer and the other featuring a redox probe &#8211; that exhibits field-induced transport modulated by receptor occupancy. Using chronoamperometry, which enables the sensor to circumvent the conventional Debye length limitation, the binding of an analyte can be monitored as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag. The sensing platform demonstrate a low femtomolar quantification limit and minimal cross-reactivity in analyzing cardiac biomarkers in whole blood collected from patients with chronic heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Lifetime Imaging of Biomolecules with Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are versatile near infrared (NIR) fluorescent building blocks for biosensors. Their surface is chemically tailored to respond to analytes by a change in fluorescence. However, intensity&#8208;based signals are easily affected by external factors such as sample movements. Here, we demonstrate fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of SWCNT&#8208;based sensors in the NIR. We tailor a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) for NIR signals (&gt;800 nm) and employ time correlated single photon counting of (GT)10&#8208;DNA functionalized SWCNTs. They act as sensors for the important neurotransmitter dopamine. Their fluorescence lifetime (&gt;900&#160;nm) decays biexponentially and the longer lifetime component (370 ps) increases by up to 25&#160;% with dopamine concentration. These sensors serve as paint to cover cells and report extracellular dopamine in 3D via FLIM. Therefore, we demonstrate the potential of fluorescence lifetime as a readout of SWCNT&#8208;based NIR sensors.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Klotho, an aging&#8208;related protein found in the kidney, parathyroid gland, and choroid plexus, acts as an essential co&#8208;receptor with the fibroblast growth factor 23 receptor complex to regulate serum phosphate and vitamin D levels. Decreased levels of &#945;&#8208;Klotho are a hallmark of age&#8208;associated diseases. Detecting or labeling &#945;&#8208;Klotho in biological milieu has long been a challenge, however, hampering the understanding of its role.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Distance and Reactivity of Coreactants Determine the Sensitivity of Bead&#8208;Based Immunoassays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) self&#8208;interference spectroscopy and microscopy imaging, the analytical sensitivity of bead&#8208;based ECL immunoassays was proposed to be determined by the light emission distance and reactivity of coreactant. Compared with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine, 2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotriethanol can balance the distance&#8208;reactivity trade&#8208;off and thus apparently promote the sensitivity of immunoassays.







Abstract
Herein we report the study of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) generation by tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium (Ru(bpy)32+) and five tertiary amine coreactants. The ECL distance and lifetime of coreactant radical cations were measured by ECL self&#8208;interference spectroscopy. And the reactivity of coreactants was quantitatively evaluated in terms of integrated ECL intensity. By statistical analysis of ECL images of single Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;labeled microbeads, we propose that ECL distance and reactivity of coreactant codetermine the emission intensity and thus the sensitivity of immunoassay. 2,2&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotriethanol (BIS&#8208;TRIS) can well balance ECL distance&#8208;reactivity trade&#8208;off and enhance the sensitivity by 236&#8201;% compared with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) in the bead&#8208;based immunoassay of carcinoembryonic antigen. The study brings an insightful understanding of ECL generation in bead&#8208;based immunoassay and a way of maximizing the analytical sensitivity from the aspect of coreactant.

         <title>Alternative Fast and Slow Primary Charge&#8208;Separation Pathways in Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two primary charge separation pathways are identified in the reaction center of Photosystem II, corresponding to different time scales and kinetic phases.







Abstract
Photosystem&#8208;II (PSII) is a multi&#8208;subunit protein complex that harvests sunlight to perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Initial light&#8208;activated charge separation takes place at a reaction centre consisting of four chlorophylls and two pheophytins. Understanding the processes following light excitation remains elusive due to spectral congestion, the ultrafast nature, and multi&#8208;component behaviour of the charge&#8208;separation process. Here, using advanced computational multiscale approaches which take into account the large&#8208;scale configurational flexibility of the system, we identify two possible primary pathways to radical&#8208;pair formation that differ by three orders of magnitude in their kinetics. The fast (short&#8208;range) pathway is dominant, but the existence of an alternative slow (long&#8208;range) charge&#8208;separation pathway hints at the evolution of redundancy that may serve other purposes, adaptive or protective, related to formation of the unique oxidative species that drives water oxidation in PSII.

         <title>Generation and Use of Glycosyl Radicals under Acidic Conditions: Glycosyl Sulfinates as Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosyl radicals were generated under acidic conditions for the first time by the use of glycosyl sulfinates as precursors. This development enables the installation of glycosyl units directly onto pharmaceutically relevant pyridine cores by the Minisci reaction.







Abstract
We herein report a method that enables the generation of glycosyl radicals under highly acidic conditions. Key to the success is the design and use of glycosyl sulfinates as radical precursors, which are bench&#8208;stable solids and can be readily prepared from commercial starting materials. This development allows the installation of glycosyl units onto pyridine rings directly by the Minisci reaction. We further demonstrate the utility of this method in the late&#8208;stage modification of complex drug molecules, including the anticancer agent camptothecin. Experimental studies provide insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Effector Regulated Catalytic Cyclization of Alkynoic Acids Using Pt2L4 Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt2L4 cages are found to catalyze the cyclization of alkynoic acids. The reaction rates are depending on effector guests bound in the cage, leading to an enhancement of the catalytic rate by up to 19&#8208;fold or a decrease by 5&#8208;fold. In contrast to this effector&#8208;controlled rate enhancement using the binding pocket of Pt2L4, the molecular analogue PtL4 displays no significant changes in catalytic rate. By effector induced rate changes of cage catalyzed reactions, unexpected new reactivity and complex autoregulation comes in sight.







Abstract
Metabolic pathways are highly regulated by effector molecules that influences the rate of enzymatic reactions. Inspired by the catalytic regulation found in living cells, we report a Pt2L4 cage of which the activity can be controlled by effectors that bind inside the cage. The cage shows catalytic activity in the lactonization of alkynoic acids, with the reaction rates dependent on the effector guest bound in the cage. Some effector guests enhance the rate of the lactonization by up to 19&#8208;fold, whereas one decreases it by 5&#8208;fold. When mixtures of specific substrates are used, both starting materials and products act as guests for the Pt2L4 cage, enhancing its catalytic activity for one substrate while reducing its activity for the other. The reported regulatory behavior obtained by the addition of effector molecules paves the way to the development of more complex, metabolic&#8208;like catalyst systems.

The reaction rates are depending on effector guests bound in the cage, leading to an enhancement of the catalytic rate by up to 19-fold or a decrease by 5-fold. In contrast to this effector-controlled rate enhancement using the binding pocket of Pt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the molecular analogue PtL&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; displays no significant changes in catalytic rate. By effector induced rate changes of cage catalyzed reactions, unexpected new reactivity and complex autoregulation comes in sight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolic pathways are highly regulated by effector molecules that influences the rate of enzymatic reactions. Inspired by the catalytic regulation found in living cells, we report a Pt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cage of which the activity can be controlled by effectors that bind inside the cage. The cage shows catalytic activity in the lactonization of alkynoic acids, with the reaction rates dependent on the effector guest bound in the cage. Some effector guests enhance the rate of the lactonization by up to 19-fold, whereas one decreases it by 5-fold. When mixtures of specific substrates are used, both starting materials and products act as guests for the Pt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cage, enhancing its catalytic activity for one substrate while reducing its activity for the other. The reported regulatory behavior obtained by the addition of effector molecules paves the way to the development of more complex, metabolic-like catalyst systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Endogenous Enzyme&#8208;Operated Spherical Nucleic Acids for Cell&#8208;Selective Protein Capture and Localization Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the introduction of enzyme&#8208;responsive units in aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), enzyme&#8208;activatable SNAs can be constructed to mediate the connection between an enzyme biomarker and proteins of interest (POI) and enable cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective POI capture and translocation regulation. The enzyme&#8208;control strategy is expandable to regulate diverse POI with flexible aptamer design.







Abstract
Precise regulation of protein activity and localization in cancer cells is crucial to dissect the function of the protein&#8208;involved cellular network in tumorigenesis, but there is a lack of suitable methodology. Here we report the design of enzyme&#8208;operated spherical nucleic acids (E&#8208;SNAs) for manipulation of the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of proteins with cancer&#8208;cell selectivity. The E&#8208;SNAs are constructed by programmable engineering of aptamer&#8208;based modules bearing enzyme&#8208;responsive units in predesigned sites and further combination with SNA nanotechnology. We demonstrate that E&#8208;SNAs are able to regulate cytoplasmic&#8208;to&#8208;nuclear shuttling of RelA protein efficiently and specifically in tumor cells, while they remain inactive in normal cells due to insufficient enzyme expression. We further confirmed the generality of this strategy by investigating the enzyme&#8208;modulated inhibition/activation of thrombin activity by varying the aptamer&#8208;based design.

         <title>Enhanced Carbon Monoxide Electroreduction to &gt;1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 C2+ Products Using Copper Catalysts Dispersed on MgAl Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheet House&#8208;of&#8208;Cards Scaffolds</title>

&#8216;House&#8208;of&#8208;cards&#8217; structures composed by MgAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets help to disperse CuO&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu) catalysts. These porous structure enhanced CO gas infiltration through the catalyst layer. OD&#8208;Cu mixed with the LDH nanosheets catalysed CORR to C2+ products with a partial current density that is 14&#8208;fold higher than that exhibited by the unsupported OD&#8208;Cu.







Abstract
Cu catalysts are most apt for reducing CO(2) to multi&#8208;carbon products in aqueous electrolytes. To enhance the product yield, we can increase the overpotential and the catalyst mass loading. However, these approaches can cause inadequate mass transport of CO(2) to the catalytic sites, which will then lead to H2 evolution dominating the product selectivity. Herein, we use a MgAl LDH nanosheet &#8216;house&#8208;of&#8208;cards&#8217; scaffold to disperse CuO&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu). With this support&#8208;catalyst design, at &#8722;0.7&#8197;VRHE, CO could be reduced to C2+ products with a current density (jC2+) of &#8722;1251&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This is 14&#215; that of the jC2+ shown by unsupported OD&#8208;Cu. The current densities of C2+ alcohols and C2H4 were also high at &#8722;369 and &#8722;816&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 respectively. We propose that the porosity of the LDH nanosheet scaffold enhances CO diffusion through the Cu sites. The CO reduction rate can thus be increased, while minimizing H2 evolution, even when high catalyst loadings and large overpotentials are used.

         <title>Efficient Narrowband Circularly Polarized Light Emitters Based on 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded Rigid Donor&#8211;Acceptor Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addressing the issue of broad fluorescence and CPL from helicenes, we present a design strategy capitalizing on intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions between N and B atoms. A straightforward synthesis of 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded, configurationally stable single and double helicenes is described. The synthesized molecules exhibit unprecedentedly narrow&#8208;band emission (FWHM of 17&#8211;28&#8197;nm, 0.07&#8211;0.13&#8197;eV) and high quantum yields (72&#8201;%&#8211;85&#8201;%) for helicene&#8208;type compounds.







Abstract
Narrow&#8208;band emission is essential for applicable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active materials in ultrahigh&#8208;definition CP&#8208;OLEDs. One of the most promising classes of CPL active molecules, helicenes, however, typically exhibit broad emission with a large Stokes shift. We present, herein, a design strategy capitalizing on intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions between nitrogen and boron atoms to address this issue. 1,4&#8208;B,N&#8208;embedded configurationally stable single&#8208; and double helicenes were synthesized straightforwardly. Both helicenes show unprecedentedly narrow fluorescence and CPL bands (full width at half maximum between 17&#8211;28&#8197;nm, 0.07&#8211;0.13&#8197;eV) along with high fluorescence quantum yields (72&#8211;85&#8201;%). Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the relative localization of the natural transition orbitals, mainly on the rigid core of the molecule, and small values of root&#8208;mean&#8208;square displacements between S0 and S1 state geometries, contribute to the narrower emission.

         <title>Near&#8208;Quantitative Preparation of Short Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Circles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of splint strands allows for the near&#8208;quantitative monomeric cyclization of single DNA strands as short as 16 bases long by DNA T4 ligase. Circular DNA molecules have enhanced chemical stability in biological fluids, therefore, this work could facilitate a wide range of biomedical applications for single&#8208;stranded, short nucleic acids.







Abstract
Small, single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) circles have many applications, such as templating rolling circle amplification (RCA), capturing microRNAs, and scaffolding DNA nanostructures. However, it is challenging to prepare such ssDNA circles, particularly when the DNA size becomes very small (e.g. a 20 nucleotide (nt) long ssDNA circle). Often, such short ssDNA dominantly form concatemers (either linear or circular) due to intermolecular ligation, instead of forming monomeric ssDNA circles by intramolecular ligation. Herein, a simple method to overcome this problem by designing the complementary linker molecules is reported. It is demonstrated that ssDNA, as short as 16&#8197;nts, can be enzymatically ligated (by the commonly used T4 DNA ligase) into monomeric ssDNA circles at high concentration (100&#8197;&#956;M) with high yield (97&#8201;%). This method does not require any special sequence, thus, it is expected to be generally applicable. The experimental protocol is identical to regular DNA ligation, thus, is expected to be user friendly for general chemists and biologists.

Inside an artificial protein cage, a dual&#8208;metal&#8208;tagged guest protein catalyzed a linear, two&#8208;step sequential cascade reaction involving deprotection followed by hydroamination. This non&#8208;orthogonal tandem catalysis in an encapsulin nanocompartment opens an exciting toolbox for the development of compartmentalized prodrug activation reactions in biological systems.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the creation of an artificial protein cage housing a dual&#8208;metal&#8208;tagged guest protein that catalyzes a linear, two&#8208;step sequential cascade reaction. The guest protein consists of a fusion protein of HaloTag and monomeric rhizavidin. Inside the protein capsid, we established a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed allylcarbamate deprotection reaction followed by a gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing hydroamination reaction that led to indoles and phenanthridines with an overall yield of up to 66&#8201;% in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, we show that the encapsulation stabilizes the metal catalysts against deactivation by air, proteins and cell lysate.

         <title>A Zeolite&#8208;Like Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Based Membrane for Reverse Selective Hydrogen Separation and Butane Isomer Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework (ZMOF) with an underlying ana topology is reported for the first time as a thin&#8208;film membrane. The ana&#8208;ZMOF membrane possesses high CO2 and butane permeabilities with high sorption CO2/H2 and diffusion C4/i&#8208;C4 selectivities. This new membrane is a promising candidate for application in the areas of high purity H2 production and butane isomer separation.







Abstract
Here, the fabrication of a defect&#8208;free membrane that is based on a zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework (ZMOF) with the underlying ana topology is reported. The unique ana&#8208;ZMOF structure provides high degree of pore connectivity, which is reflected by the fast transport of gases. Prominently, it offers an optimum pore&#8208;aperture size, affording notable sieving selectivity for butane/isobutane, and optimal pore energetics for reverse CO2/H2 separation. This emphasize the potential for the application of pure MOF membranes, paving the way to more sustainability of energy resources.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Cyclooctatetraene&#8208;Like Polyphosphorus Ligand Complex [Cyclo&#8208;P8]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cothermolysis of Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta(CO)4 with white phosphorus (P4) results in the formation of [{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P8)], whose cyclooctatetraene&#8208;like (COT) cyclo&#8208;P8 ligand is the largest monocyclic polyphosphorus species observed to date. The reactivity and electrochemical properties of this exotic species are explored, furnishing unique polyphosphorus species of unprecedented size.







Abstract
The thermolysis of Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta(CO)4 with white phosphorus (P4) gives access to [{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P8)] (A), representing the first complex containing a cyclooctatetraene&#8208;like (COT) cyclo&#8208;P8 ligand. While ring sizes of n &gt;6 have remained elusive for cyclo&#8208;Pn structural motifs, the choice of the transition metal, co&#8208;ligand and reaction conditions allowed the isolation of A. Reactivity investigations reveal its versatile coordination behaviour as well as its redox properties. Oxidation leads to dimerization to afford [{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}4(&#956;4,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P16)][TEF]2 (4, TEF=[Al(OC{CF3}3)4]&#8722;). Reduction, however, leads to the fission of one P&#8722;P bond in A followed by rapid dimerization to form [K@[2.2.2]cryptand]2[{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}4(&#956;4,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;P16)] (5), which features an unprecedented chain&#8208;type P16 ligand. Lastly, A serves as a P2 synthon, via ring contraction to the triple&#8208;decker complex [{Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ta}2(&#956;,&#951;6&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8208;P6)] (B).

         <title>Mesogenic Groups Control the Emitter Orientation in Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Films
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work shows how the distinct self&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystalline MR&#8208;TADF emitter can be exploited for generating (partially) aligned via solution&#8208;processed thin films &#8211; an advance towards high performance solution&#8208;processable organic semiconductors.







Abstract
The use of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters and emitters that show preferential horizontal orientation of their transition dipole moment (TDM) are two emerging strategies to enhance the efficiency of OLEDs. We present the first example of a liquid crystalline multi&#8208;resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter, DiKTa&#8208;LC. The compound possesses a nematic liquid crystalline phase between 80&#8201;&#176;C and 110&#8201;&#176;C. Importantly, the TDM of the spin&#8208;coated film shows preferential horizontal orientation, with an anisotropy factor, a, of 0.28, which is preserved in doped poly(vinylcarbazole) films. Green&#8208;emitting (&#955;EL=492&#8197;nm) solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on DiKTa&#8208;LC showed an EQEmax of 13.6&#8201;%. We thus demonstrate for the first time how self&#8208;assembly of a liquid crystalline TADF emitter can lead to the so&#8208;far elusive control of the orientation of the transition dipole in solution&#8208;processed films, which will be of relevance for high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed OLEDs.

         <dc:description>
The sugar alcohol meglumine can solubilize organic compounds in water to synthetically useful levels, allowing the formation of enforced electron donor acceptor (EDA) complexes in water. These EDA complexes offer a new activation for light driven C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling chemistry without sensitizers.







Abstract
The amino alcohol meglumine solubilizes organic compounds in water and enforces the formation of electron donor acceptor (EDA) complexes of haloarenes with indoles, anilines, anisoles or thiols, which are not observed in organic solvents. UV&#8208;A photoinduced electron transfer within the EDA complexes induces the mesolytic cleavage of the halide ion and radical recombination of the arenes leading, after rearomatization and proton loss to C&#8722;C or C&#8722;S coupling products. Depending on the substitution pattern selective and unique cross&#8208;couplings are observed. UV and NMR measurements reveal the importance of the assembly for the photoinduced reaction. Enforced EDA aggregate formation in water allows new activation modes for organic photochemical synthesis.

         <title>Dynamic Activation of Ga Sites by Pt Dopant in Low&#8208;Temperature Liquid&#8208;Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent geometric features are identified within low&#8208;temperature liquid&#8208;metal catalysts that may provide active sites for the reaction catalysis. Furthermore, Ga atoms can play a key role in the catalysis mechanism due to an altered electronic structure resulting from the dopant atom and the stochastic nature of the liquid.







Abstract
Liquid GaPt catalysts with Pt concentrations as low as 1&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;atomic&#8201;% have recently been identified as highly active for the oxidation of methanol and pyrogallol under mild reaction conditions. However, almost nothing is known about how liquid state catalysts support these significant improvements in activity. Here, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are employed to examine GaPt catalysts in isolation and interacting with adsorbates. We find that persistent geometric features can exist in the liquid state, given the correct environment. We postulate that the Pt dopant may not be limited to direct involvement in catalysis of reactions, but rather that its presence can also enable Ga atoms to become catalytically active.

         <title>Enantioselective Radical&#8208;Type 1,2&#8208;Alkoxy&#8208;Phosphinoylation to Styrenes Catalyzed by Chiral Vanadyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;alkoxyphosphinoylation of styrenes with a broad substitution scope was realized for the first time by the use of a vanadyl complex bearing 3&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;Br&#8208;substituted N&#8208;salicylidene&#8208;t&#8208;leucinate. The unprecedented catalytic reactions proceeded smoothly at 0&#8201;&#176;C with HP(O)Ph2 and t&#8208;BuOOH leading to products in up to 96&#8201;% ee. The remarkable asymmetric radical reactions involved highly enantioselective internal delivery of vanadyl&#8208;bound alkoxide to the benzylic center with the coordinated phosphinoyl group in a radical homolytic substitution manner.







Abstract
A series of vanadyl complexes bearing 3&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo, 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;bromo, 3,5&#8208;dihalo&#8208;, and benzo&#8208;fused N&#8208;salicylidene&#8208;tert&#8208;leucinates was examined as catalysts for 1,2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;phosphinoylation of 4&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 3,4&#8208;, and 3,5&#8208;substituted styrene derivatives (including Me/t&#8208;Bu, Ph, OR, Cl/Br, OAc, NO2, C(O)Me, CO2Me, CN, and benzo&#8208;fused) with HP(O)Ph2 in the presence of t&#8208;BuOOH (TBHP) in a given alcohol or cosolvent with MeOH. The best scenario involved the use of 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% 3&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl)&#8208;5&#8208;Br (i.e., 3&#8208;DMP&#8208;5&#8208;Br) catalyst at 0&#8201;&#176;C in MeOH. The desired catalytic cross coupling reactions proceeded smoothly with enantioselectivities of up to 95&#8201;% ee of (R)&#8208;configuration as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of several recrystallized products. The origin of enantiocontrol and homolytic substitution of the benzylic intermediates by vanadyl&#8208;bound methoxide and radical type catalytic mechanism were proposed.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Sulfimides through the O&#8208;Alkylation of Enantioenriched Sulfinamides and Addition of Carbon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral sulfimides were synthesized by an unusual oxygen&#8208;selective alkylation of readily available enantioenriched sulfinamides and the subsequent nucleophilic addition of Grignard reagents. This transformation enables access to the various enantioenriched chiral sulfimides including diaryl or dialkyl sulfimides bearing two similar carbon substituents.







Abstract
Chiral sulfimides, the aza&#8208;analogues of sulfoxides, are valuable compounds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient method for preparing chiral sulfimides from easily available enantioenriched sulfinamides. The key step of this method is a stereospecific oxygen&#8208;selective alkylation of enantioenriched sulfinamides, which is accomplished by using isopropyl iodide, K2CO3, and DMPU. The resulting chiral sulfinimidate esters are transformed to chiral sulfimides by the nucleophilic addition of the Grignard reagents under simple conditions. This transformation enables access to the enantioenriched diaryl or dialkyl sulfimides bearing two similar carbon substituents, which are difficult to synthesize by previous methods.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenolysis of Aryl Triflates for Construction of Axially Chiral Biaryls</title>

We have developed the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenolysis of aryl triflates through desymmetrization and kinetic resolution that allows the facile construction of axially chiral biaryl scaffolds with excellent results. These chiral compounds could be further converted into chiral monophosphine ligands, which were then used in asymmetric allylic alkylation to produce the desired product with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Expanding the Promiscuity of a Copper&#8208;Dependent Oxidase for Enantioselective Cross&#8208;Coupling of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic promiscuity of a copper oxidase was expanded to accommodate new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 3&#8208;hydroxyindole esters with various nucleophiles. The resulting functionalized 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones showed excellent optical purity as well as anticancer activity.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the highly enantioselective oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 3&#8208;hydroxyindole esters with various nucleophilic partners as catalyzed by copper efflux oxidase. The biocatalytic transformation delivers functionalized 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones with excellent optical purity (90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee), which exhibited anticancer activity against MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cell lines, as shown by preliminary biological evaluation. Mechanistic studies and molecular docking results suggest the formation of a phenoxyl radical and enantiocontrol facilitated by a suited enzyme chiral pocket. This study is significant with regard to expanding the catalytic repertoire of natural multicopper oxidases as well as enlarging the synthetic toolbox for sustainable asymmetric oxidative coupling.

     alt="Expanding the Promiscuity of a Copper-Dependent Oxidase for Enantioselective Cross-Coupling of Indoles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalytic promiscuity of a copper oxidase was expanded to accommodate new-to-nature enantioselective oxidative cross-coupling of 3-hydroxyindole esters with various nucleophiles. The resulting functionalized 2,2-disubstituted indolin-3-ones showed excellent optical purity as well as anticancer activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we disclose the highly enantioselective oxidative cross-coupling of 3-hydroxyindole esters with various nucleophilic partners as catalyzed by copper efflux oxidase. The biocatalytic transformation delivers functionalized 2,2-disubstituted indolin-3-ones with excellent optical purity (90&#8211;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;), which exhibited anticancer activity against MCF-7&#8197;cell lines, as shown by preliminary biological evaluation. Mechanistic studies and molecular docking results suggest the formation of a phenoxyl radical and enantiocontrol facilitated by a suited enzyme chiral pocket. This study is significant with regard to expanding the catalytic repertoire of natural multicopper oxidases as well as enlarging the synthetic toolbox for sustainable asymmetric oxidative coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper(I) Photocatalyzed Bromonitroalkylation of Olefins: Evidence for Highly Efficient Inner&#8208;Sphere Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic bromonitroalkylations of activated and unactivated olefins with broad scope become possible in the presence of CuI&#8208;photocatalysts. The key to success for this transformation is the highly efficient interaction of CuII with radical intermediates, which can even outperform a highly favorable cyclization of a transient to a persistent radical.







Abstract
We report the visible light&#8208;mediated copper&#8208;catalyzed vicinal difunctionalization of olefins utilizing bromonitroalkanes as ATRA reagents. This protocol is characterized by high yields and fast reaction times under environmentally benign reaction conditions with exceptional scope, allowing the rapid functionalization of both activated and unactivated olefins. Moreover, late&#8208;stage functionnalization of biologically active molecules and upscaling to gram quantities is demonstrated, which offers manifold possibilities for further transformations, e.g. access to nitro&#8208; and aminocyclopropanes. Besides the synthetic utility of the title transformation, this study undergirds the exclusive role of copper in photoredox catalysis showing its ability to stabilize and interact with radical intermediates in its coordination sphere. EPR studies suggest that such interactions can even outperform a highly favorable cyclization of transient to persistent radicals contrasting iridium&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>An Electrochemical Nanosensor for Monitoring the Dynamics of Intracellular H2O2 Upon NADH Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A H2O2&#8208;selective nanoelectrode is reported to monitor the dynamics of H2O2 produced by NADH treatment, indicating the potential tumor suppressor role of NADH. This work not only provides a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer therapy, but also offers a powerful technique to screen the cancer treatment.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;based therapeutic strategies play an important role in cancer treatment. However, in situ, real&#8208;time and quantitative analysis of intracellular ROS in cancer treatment for drug screening is still a challenge. Herein we report one selective hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrochemical nanosensor, which is prepared by electrodeposition of Prussian blue (PB) and polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) onto carbon fiber nanoelectrode. With the nanosensor, we find that the level of intracellular H2O2 increases with NADH treatment and that increase is dose&#8208;dependent to the concentration of NADH. High&#8208;dose of NADH (above 10&#8197;mM) can induce cell death and intratumoral injection of NADH is validated for inhibiting tumor growth in mice. This study highlights the potential of electrochemical nanosensor for tracking and understanding the role of H2O2 in screening new anticancer drug.

         <title>Lithium Salt Dissociation Promoted by 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 Ether Additive toward Dilute Electrolytes for High Performance Lithium Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether additive regulates the solvation structure of electrolyte, avoids nucleophilic attack of reactive oxygen species on the solvent, and reduces harmful gases release. The solution&#8208;mediated mechanism is triggered to enhance the discharge capacity, and the anion&#8208;derived SEI protects Li anode to improve the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) are well known for their high energy density. However, their reversibility and rate performance are challenged due to the sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) kinetics, serious side reactions and uncontrollable Li dendrite growth. The electrolyte plays a key role in transport of Li+ and reactive oxygen species in LOBs. Here, we tailored a dilute electrolyte by screening suitable crown ether additives to promote lithium salt dissociation and Li+ solvation through electrostatic interaction. The electrolyte containing 100&#8197;mM 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether (100&#8208;18C6) exhibits enhanced electrochemical stability and triggers a solution&#8208;mediated Li2O2 growth pathway in LOBs, showing high discharge capacity of 10&#8201;828.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;gcarbon&#8722;1. Moreover, optimized electrode/electrolyte interfaces promote ORR/OER kinetics on cathode and achieve dendrite&#8208;free Li anode, which enhances the cycle life. This work casts new lights on the design of low&#8208;cost dilute electrolytes for high performance LOBs.

         <title>Immunogenic Cell Death Inducing Metal Complexes for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastases and tumor relapse are the leading causes of cancer&#8208;associated deaths. Among other approaches, much research interest has been devoted to immunogenic cell death inducing agents that are able to trigger localized cell death of the cancer cells as well as induce an immune response inside the whole organism. Herein, the application of metal complexes as immunogenic cell death triggering compounds is systematically reviewed.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Recent statistics have shown that metastases and tumor relapse are the leading causes of cancer&#8208;associated deaths. While traditional treatments are able to efficiently remove the primary tumor, secondary tumors remain poorly accessible. Capitalizing on this there is an urgent need for novel treatment modalities. Among the most promising approaches, increasing research interest has been devoted to immunogenic cell death inducing agents that are able to trigger localized cell death of the cancer cells as well as induce an immune response inside the whole organism. Preliminary studies have shown that immunogenic cell death inducing compounds could be able to overcome metastatic and relapsing tumors. Herein, the application of metal complexes as immunogenic cell death inducing compounds is systematically reviewed.

This strategy creates a near&#8208;neutral pH and enriches K+ near catalyst surfaces during CO2R in strong acids. A stratified SiC&#8208;NafionTM/SnBi/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) electrode consistently produces formic acid with a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of &gt;75&#8201;% and Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, lasting over 125&#8197;h at pH&#8197;1.@MiaoZhong&#8194;Group







Abstract
Acidic CO2 reduction (CO2R) holds promise for the synthesis of low&#8208;carbon&#8208;footprint chemicals using renewable electricity. However, the corrosion of catalysts in strong acids causes severe hydrogen evolution and rapid deterioration of CO2R performance. Here, by coating catalysts with an electrically nonconductive nanoporous SiC&#8208;NafionTM layer, a near&#8208;neutral pH was stabilized on catalyst surfaces, thereby protecting the catalysts against corrosion for durable CO2R in strong acids. Electrode microstructures played a critical role in regulating ion diffusion and stabilizing electrohydrodynamic flows near catalyst surfaces. This surface&#8208;coating strategy was applied to three catalysts, SnBi, Ag, and Cu, and they exhibited high activity over extended CO2R operation in strong acids. Using a stratified SiC&#8208;NafionTM/SnBi/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) electrode, constant production of formic acid was achieved with a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of &gt;75&#8201;% and Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 125&#8197;h at pH&#8197;1.

In the last decade, single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) with nearly 100% atomic utilization and unique electronic structure have been widely investigated for MOA. However, the single active site makes the activation effect unsatisfactory and difficult to deal with complex catalytic reactions. Recently, dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) have provided a new idea for the effective activation of molecular O2 due to more diverse active sites and synergetic interactions among adjacent atoms. In this review, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of DASCs for MOA in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Finally, we look forward to the challenges and application prospects in the construction of DASCs for MOA.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activated Ruthenium Complex&#8208;based Photocage for Cancer Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional photocages only respond to short wavelength light, which is a significant obstacle to developing efficient phototherapy in vivo. The development of photocages activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light at wavelengths from 700 to 950 nm is important for in vivo studies but remains challenging. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a photocage based on a ruthenium (Ru) complex with NIR light&#8208;triggered photocleavage reaction. The commercial anticancer drug, tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), was coordinated to the Ru(II) center to create the Ru&#8208;based photocage that is readily responsive to NIR light at 760 nm. The photocage inherited the anticancer properties of THC. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we further engineered a self&#8208;assembled photocage&#8208;based nanoparticle system with amphiphilic block copolymers. Upon exposure to NIR light at 760 nm, the Ru complex&#8208;based photocages were released from the polymeric nanoparticles and efficiently inhibited tumor proliferation in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Activation for Boosting Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In conventional luminol electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems, hydrogen peroxide and dissolved oxygen are employed as typical co&#8208;reactants to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for efficient ECL emission. However, the self&#8208;decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and limited solubility of oxygen in water inevitably restrict the detection accuracy and luminous efficiency of luminol ECL system. Inspired by ROS&#8208;mediated ECL mechanism, for the first time, we used cobalt&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide as co&#8208;reaction accelerator to efficiently activate water to generate ROS for enhancing luminol emission. Experimental investigations verify the formation of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals in the process of electrochemical water oxidation, which subsequently react with luminol anion radicals to trigger strong ECL signals. Finally, the detection of alkaline phosphatase has been successfully achieved with impressive sensitivity and reproducibility for practical sample analysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract: &#160;Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries are considered as the next generation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, their solid electrolytes suffer from low ionic conductivity, poor interface performance, and high production costs, restricting&#160;their commercial application. Herein, a low&#8208;cost cellulose acetate&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte (C&#8208;CLA QPE) was developed with a high Li + &#160;transference number (tLi+) of 0.85 and excellent interface stability. The prepared LiFePO 4 &#160;(LFP)|C&#8208;CLA QPE|Li batteries exhibited excellent cycle performance with a capacity retention of 97.7% after 1200 cycles at 1 C and 25&#8451;. The experimental results and Density Function Theory (DFT) simulation revealed that the partially esterified side groups in the CLA matrix contribute to the migration of Li + &#160;and enhance electrochemical stability. This work provides a promising strategy for fabricating cost&#8208;effective, stable polymer electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Polarization&#8208;dependent sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy for in situ tracking of nanoparticle morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface structure of oxide supported metal nanoparticles can be determined via characteristic vibrations of adsorbed probe molecules such as CO. Usually, spectroscopic studies focus on peak position and intensity, which are related to binding geometries and number of adsorption sites, respectively. Employing two differently prepared model catalysts it is demonstrated that polarization&#8208;dependent sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy reveals the average surface structure and shape of the nanoparticles. SFG results for different particle sizes and morphologies are compared to direct (real&#8208;space) structure analysis by TEM and STM. The described feature of SFG could be used to monitor particle restructuring in situ and may be a valuable tool for operando catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activated Circularly Polarized Luminescence Film Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Copper(I) Cluster&#8208;Assembled Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a pair of chiral copper(I) cluster&#8208;assembled materials (R/S&#8208;2) was prepared, exhibiting unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with a concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation property in DMSO solution. By the combination of R/S&#8208;2 with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix, the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was developed, the CPL signal (glum = 9&#215;10&#8208;3) of which could be induced by UV light irradiation. Moreover, the film exhibited a reversible photo&#8208;response and extremely good fatigue resistance. Mechanism study revealed that the photo&#8208;response properties of the R/S&#8208;2 solution and film are attributed to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics of R/S&#8208;2 and a photo&#8208;induced deoxygenation process. This study enriches the types of luminescent cluster&#8208;assembled molecules and provides a new strategy for the construction of metal cluster&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive composite materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonium Ion Batteries: Material, Electrochemistry and Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) have recently attracted increasingattention in the field of aqueous batteries owing to their high safety and fast diffusion kinetics. The NH4+ storage mechanism is quite different from that of spherical metal ions (e.g.Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between NH4+ and host materials. Although many materials have been proposed as electrode materials for AIBs, their performances hardly meet the requirement of future electrochemical energystorage devices. It is thus urgent to design and exploit advancedmaterials for AIBs. Thisreviewhighlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art researches on AIBs. The insights into the basic configuration, operating mechanism andrecent progress of electrode materials and corresponding electrolytes for AIBs have been comprehensively outlined. The electrode materials are classified and compared according to different NH4+ storage behaviour in the structure. Thechallenges, design strategiesand perspectives are also discussed for the futuredevelopment of AIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Self&#8208;Association of the KRAS4b Protein is Altered by Lipid&#8208;Bilayer Composition and Electrostatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>KRAS is a peripheral membrane protein that regulates multiple signaling pathways, and is mutated in ~30% of cancers. Transient self&#8208;association of KRAS is essential for activation of the downstream effector RAF and oncogenicity. The presence of anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids in the membrane was shown to promote KRAS self&#8208;assembly, however, the structural mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we employed nanodisc bilayers of defined lipid compositions, and probed the impact of PS concentration on KRAS self&#8208;association. Paramagnetic NMR experiments demonstrated the existence of two transient dimer conformations involving alternate electrostatic contacts between R135 and either D153 or E168 on the '&#945;4/5&#8208;&#945;4/5' interface, and revealed that lipid composition and salt modulate their dynamic equilibrium. These dimer interfaces were validated by charge&#8208;reversal mutants. This plasticity demonstrates how the dynamic KRAS dimerization interface responds to the environment, and likely extends to the assembly of other signaling complexes on the membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Local Electric Field Induced Interface Water Reorientation for&#160;Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The slow water dissociation process in alkaline electrolyte severely limits the kinetics of HER. The orientation of H2O is well known to affect the dissociation process, but H2O orientation is hard to control because of its random distribution. Herein, an atomically asymmetric local electric field was designed by IrRu dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to tune the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation, thus optimizing its dissociation process. The electric field intensity of IrRu DSACs is over 4.00 &#215;1010 N/C. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy analysis on the adsorption behavior of H2O show that the M&#8208;H bond length (M = active site) is shortened at the interface due to the strong local electric field gradient and the optimized water orientation promotes the dissociation process of interfacial water. This work provides a new way to explore the role of single atomic sites in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Closing the Cycle as It Begins: Synthesis of ortho&#8208;Iodobiaryls via Catellani Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the advances in the field of carbon&#8208;halogen bond formation, the straightforward catalytic access to selectively functionalized iodoaryls remains a challenge. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of ortho&#8208;iodobiaryls from aryl iodides and bromides by palladium/norbornene catalysis. This new example of Catellani reaction features the initial cleavage of a C(sp2)&#8208;I bond, followed by the key formation of a palladacycle through ortho C&#8208;H activation, the oxidative addition of an aryl bromide and the ultimate restoration of the C(sp2)&#8208;I bond. A large variety of valuable o&#8208;iodobiaryls has been synthesized in satisfactory to good yields and their derivatization have been described too. Beyond the synthetic utility of this transformation, a DFT study provides insights on the mechanism of the key reductive elimination step, which is driven by an original transmetallation between palladium(II)&#8208;halides complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Conversion of CO2 and Cellulose to Formate Using a Floating TiO2&#8208;Enzyme Photoreforming Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formate production via both CO2 reduction and cellulose oxidation in a solar&#8208;driven process is achieved by a semiartificial biohybrid photocatalyst consisting of immobilized formate dehydrogenase on titanium dioxide (TiO2|FDH) producing up to 1.16&#177;0.04 mmolformate gTiO2&#8211;1 in 24 hours. Isotopic labelling experiments with 13C&#8208;labelled substrates support the mechanism of stoichiometric formate formation through both redox half&#8208;reactions. TiO2|FDH was further immobilized on hollow glass microspheres to perform more practical floating photoreforming allowing vertical solar light illumination with optimal light exposure of the photocatalyst to real sunlight. Enzymatic cellulose depolymerization coupled to the floating photoreforming catalyst generates 0.36&#177;0.04 mmolformate mirr&#8211;2 after 24 h. This work thus presents simultaneous solar&#8208;driven valorization of waste streams, demonstrates the advantages of biohybrid photocatalysts in photoreforming for the first time and will provide inspiration for the development of future semi&#8208;artificial waste&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Chirality Induction in the Assembly of a Single Layer 2&#8208;D Network with Switchable Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although two dimensional (2&#8208;D) chiral sheet structures are attractive because of unique chemical and physical properties, single layer 2&#8208;D chiral network structures with switchable pore interior remain elusive. Here we report spontaneous chirality induction in a single layer 2&#8208;D network structure formed from the self&#8208;assembly of tetrapod azobenzene molecules. The chirality induction arises from multiple sublayers slipped in a preferred direction in which the sublayer consists of unidentical molecular arrangements in in&#8208;plane a and b directions, breaking both plane of symmetry and inversion symmetry. The protruded azobenzene units in the pore interior can be selectively isomerized upon UV irradiation, resulting in a reversible deformation of the chiral pores while maintaining 2&#8208;D frameworks. The chiral network can thus selectively entrap one enantiomer from a racemic solution with near perfect enantioselectivity, and then release upon UV irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Target Recycling Amplification Process for the Digital Detection of Exosomal MicroRNAs through Photonic Resonator Absorption Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target recycling amplification process (TRAP) detection method was developed using photonic resonator absorption microscopy, which shows exciting potential for monitoring exosomal miRNAs with ultra&#8208;sensitivity and single&#8208;base mismatch selectivity. The approach is a single&#8208;step, wash&#8208;free, enzyme&#8208;free, isothermal, 20&#8208;minute, room temperature process that can be readily adapted toward any miRNA target through different DNA probe designs.







Abstract
Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) have considerable potential as pivotal biomarkers to monitor cancer development, dis&#8208;ease progression, treatment effects and prognosis. Here, we report an efficient target recycling amplification process (TRAP) for the digital detection of miRNAs using photonic resonator absorption microscopy. We achieve multiplex digital detection with sub&#8208;attomolar sensitivity in 20&#8197;minutes, robust selectivity for single nucleotide variants, and a broad dynamic range from 1&#8197;aM to 1&#8197;pM. Compared with traditional qRT&#8208;PCR, TRAP showed similar accuracy in profiling exosomal miRNAs derived from cancer cells, but also exhibited at least 31&#8208;fold and 61&#8208;fold enhancement in the limits of miRNA&#8208;375 and miRNA&#8208;21 detection, respectively. The TRAP approach is ideal for exosomal or circulating miRNA biomarker quantification, where the miRNAs are present in low concentrations or sample volume, with potentials for frequent, low&#8208;cost, and minimally invasive point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing.

         <title>A Metabolic&#8208;Tag&#8208;Based Method for Assessing the Permeation of Small Molecules Across the Mycomembrane in Live Mycobacteria
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a method to systematically address the structural determinants of permeability in Mtb. This workflow, Peptidoglycan Accessibility Click&#8208;Mediated AssessmeNt (PAC&#8208;MAN), provides a screening platform to measure the permeation of any molecule that is modified with a small azide handle. When molecules reach the peptidoglycan layer, they react with DBCO (site selectively anchored by metabolic labeling), thus imprinting their permeation.







Abstract
The general lack of permeability of small molecules observed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is most ascribed to its unique cell envelope. More specifically, the outer mycomembrane is hypothesized to be the principal determinant for access of antibiotics to their molecular targets. We describe a novel assay that combines metabolic tagging of the peptidoglycan, which sits directly beneath the mycomembrane, click chemistry of test molecules, and a fluorescent labeling chase step, to measure the permeation of small molecules. We showed that the assay workflow was robust and compatible with high&#8208;throughput analysis in mycobacteria by testing a small panel of azide&#8208;tagged molecules. The general trend is similar across the two types of mycobacteria with some notable exceptions. We anticipate that this assay platform will lay the foundation for medicinal chemistry efforts to understand and improve uptake of both existing drugs and newly&#8208;discovered compounds into mycobacteria.

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly as a Tool To Preserve the Electronic Purity of Perylene Diimide Chromophores
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analysis of the photophysics of a supramolecular pseudo&#8208;cube formed from perylene diimide (PDI) chromophores shows that, in contrast to the rapid excited&#8208;state quenching observed upon uncontrolled aggregation of chromophores, the shape&#8208;persistent cage retains the electronic purity of the PDIs. This allows delayed fluorescence arising from an excited multimer to be observed and showcases molecular self&#8208;assembly as a powerful tool in organic electronics.







Abstract
Organic semiconductors are promising for efficient, printable optoelectronics. However, strong excited&#8208;state quenching due to uncontrolled aggregation limits their use in devices. We report on the self&#8208;assembly of a supramolecular pseudo&#8208;cube formed from six perylene diimides (PDIs). The rigid, shape&#8208;persistent cage sets the distance and orientation of the PDIs and suppresses intramolecular rotations and vibrations, leading to non&#8208;aggregated, monomer&#8208;like properties in solution and the solid state, in contrast to the fast fluorescence quenching in the free ligand. The stabilized excited state and electronic purity in the cage enables the observation of delayed fluorescence due to a bright excited multimer, acting as excited&#8208;state reservoir in a rare case of benign inter&#8208;chromophore interactions in the cage. We show that self&#8208;assembly provides a powerful tool for retaining and controlling the electronic properties of chromophores, and to bring molecular electronics devices within reach.

         <title>Open&#8208;Cage Fullerene as a Selective Molecular Trap for LiF/[BeF]+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative (trap) was prepared with a hydroxy group (bait/hook) pointing towards the center of the cavity and a diphenyl pocket above the 21&#8208;membered orifice. The hydroxy group could coordinate lithium and beryllium cations, which led to the encapsulation of LiF and [BeF]+ in the fullerene. The hydroxy group was also shown to form hydrogen bonds with molecules such as water, methanol, and ethanol in the diphenyl pocket.







Abstract
The insertion of ionic compounds into open&#8208;cage fullerenes is a challenging task due to the electropositive nature of the cavity. The present work reports the preparation of an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative with a hydroxy group pointing towards the centre of the cavity, which can coordinate to a metal cation, thus acting as a bait/hook to trap the metal cation such as the lithium cation in neutral LiF and the beryllium cation in the cationic [BeF]+ species. Other metal salts could not be inserted under similar conditions. The structure of MF in the cage was unambiguously determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Owing to its tendency to undergo polycoordination, Li+ monomer salts have not been isolated before, despite extensive research on Li bonds. The present results provide a unique example of a Li bond.

         <title>Controlling the Fluorescence Performance of AIE Polymers by Controlling the Polymer Microstructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling fluorescence efficiency is achieved without changing emission wavelength/color by controlling the (co)polymer chemical structures/physical properties, including molecular weight, crystallinity, monomer composition, glass transition temperature, side length, and flexibility/rigidity of the chain.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) polymers with expected emission wavelength/color and fluorescence efficiency are valuable in applications. However, most AIE polymers exhibit irregular emission wavelength/color changes compared to the original AIE monomers. Here, we report the synthesis of AIE polymers with unchanged emission wavelength by ring&#8208;opening (co)polymerizations of 4&#8208;(triphenylethenyl)phenoxymethyloxirane (TPEO) and other epoxides or phthalic anhydride. The chemical structures/physical properties of all (co)polymers were characterized by NMR, SEC, MALDI&#8208;TOF, and DSC. The co&#8208;polyether microstructures were revealed by calculating the reactivity ratios and visualized by Monte Carlo simulation. The photoluminescence quantum yields of all the (co)polymers were determined in the solid state. We systematically correlated the fluorescence performance with molecular weights, crystallinity, monomer compositions, glass transition temperatures, side lengths, and flexibility/rigidity.

&lt;p&gt;Controlling fluorescence efficiency is achieved without changing emission wavelength/color by controlling the (co)polymer chemical structures/physical properties, including molecular weight, crystallinity, monomer composition, glass transition temperature, side length, and flexibility/rigidity of the chain.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) polymers with expected emission wavelength/color and fluorescence efficiency are valuable in applications. However, most AIE polymers exhibit irregular emission wavelength/color changes compared to the original AIE monomers. Here, we report the synthesis of AIE polymers with unchanged emission wavelength by ring-opening (co)polymerizations of 4-(triphenylethenyl)phenoxymethyloxirane (TPEO) and other epoxides or phthalic anhydride. The chemical structures/physical properties of all (co)polymers were characterized by NMR, SEC, MALDI-TOF, and DSC. The co-polyether microstructures were revealed by calculating the reactivity ratios and visualized by Monte Carlo simulation. The photoluminescence quantum yields of all the (co)polymers were determined in the solid state. We systematically correlated the fluorescence performance with molecular weights, crystallinity, monomer compositions, glass transition temperatures, side lengths, and flexibility/rigidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous and Water Stable 2D Hybrid Metal Halide with Broad Light Emission and Selective H2O Vapor Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous and water&#8208;stable hybrid semiconductors pose as multifunctional materials combining traits that are essential for demanding commercial applications. A strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide semiconductors by using molecular cages as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations is reported. This strategy gave rise to a direct band gap semiconductor, with record water stability and selective vapor&#8208;sorption.







Abstract
In this work we report a strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide materials using molecular cages that serve as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations. Reaction of the [2.2.2] cryptand (DHS) linker with PbII in acidic media gave rise to the first porous and water&#8208;stable 2D metal halide semiconductor (DHS)2Pb5Br14. The corresponding material is stable in water for a year, while gas and vapor&#8208;sorption studies revealed that it can selectively and reversibly adsorb H2O and D2O at room temperature (RT). Solid&#8208;state NMR measurements and DFT calculations verified the incorporation of H2O and D2O in the organic linker cavities and shed light on their molecular configuration. In addition to porosity, the material exhibits broad light emission centered at 617&#8197;nm with a full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 284&#8197;nm (0.96&#8197;eV). The recorded water stability is unparalleled for hybrid metal halide and perovskite materials, while the generation of porosity opens new pathways towards unexplored applications (e.g. solid&#8208;state batteries) for this class of hybrid semiconductors.

We report activation of aryl halides at gold(I) enabled by NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligands through the design of a new class of L&#8208;shaped heterobidentate ImPy (ImPy=imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene) N,C ligands that feature hemilabile character of the amino group in a locked conformation. Experimental and DFT studies demonstrate pivotal stabilization of AuIII species by the hemilabile nitrogen for successful AuI/AuIII catalysis.







Abstract
In the last decade, major advances have been made in homogeneous gold catalysis. However, AuI/AuIII catalytic cycle remains much less explored due to the reluctance of AuI to undergo oxidative addition and the stability of the AuIII intermediate. Herein, we report activation of aryl halides at gold(I) enabled by NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligands through the development of a new class of L&#8208;shaped heterobidentate ImPy (ImPy=imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene) N,C ligands that feature hemilabile character of the amino group in combination with strong &#963;&#8208;donation of the carbene center in a rigid conformation, imposed by the ligand architecture. Detailed characterization and control studies reveal key ligand features for AuI/AuIII redox cycle, wherein the hemilabile nitrogen is placed at the coordinating position of a rigid framework. Given the tremendous significance of homogeneous gold catalysis, we anticipate that this ligand platform will find widespread application.

         <title>Perfluoroalkyl Selenoxides, Selenones and Selenoximines: General Preparation and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides, selenones and selenoximines was possible through a selective oxidation of perfluoroalkyl selenoethers. Synthesis of perfluoroalkyl selenoxides was also described via a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reaction from selenocyanates. The perfluoroalkyl selenoximine family was synthesized. The Hansch&#8208;Leo parameters of the compounds were determined and some aryl perfluoroalkyl selenoxides were separated by chiral HPLC.







Abstract
A selective access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides, via Oxone&#174; as oxidant or to selenones by using a Polyoxometalate&#8208;based Ionic Liquid (POM&#8208;IL) as a catalyst for the oxidation step is described. The reaction works with various perfluoralkyl chains and substituents with satisfactory to excellent yields. A two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reaction from selenocyanates was performed to gain access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides. The previously unknown perfluoroalkyl selenoximines family was also prepared with good yields. Having unlocked two strategies for the synthesis of fluoroalkylated SeIV and SeVI compounds, we then evaluated the Hansch&#8208;Leo lipophilicity parameters of these groups. Finally, asymmetric aryl perfluoroalkyl selenoximines were resolved to determine their absolute configurations.

         <title>A Polymeric Extracellular Matrix Nanoremodeler for Activatable Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer&#8208;based extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeler (SPNcb) with photodynamic antitumor activity and inhibition of collagen&#8208;crosslinking enzymes is developed for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. SPNcb&#8208;mediated ECM&#8208;remodeling therapy synergizes with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to reinvigorate cytotoxic T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.







Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has shown tremendous potential to train the intrinsic immune system against malignancy in the clinic. However, the extracellular matrix (ECM) in tumor microenvironment is a formidable barrier that not only restricts the penetration of therapeutic drugs but also prevents the infiltration of antitumor immune cells. We herein report a semiconducting polymer&#8208;based ECM nanoremodeler (SPNcb) to combine photodynamic antitumor activity with cancer&#8208;specific inhibition of collagen&#8208;crosslinking enzymes (lysyl oxidase (LOX) family) for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. SPNcb is self&#8208;assembled from an amphiphilic semiconducting polymer conjugated with a LOX inhibitor (&#946;&#8208;aminopropionitrile, BAPN) via a cancer biomarker (cathepsin B, CatB)&#8208;cleavable segment. BAPN can be exclusively activated to inhibit LOX activity in the presence of the tumor&#8208;overexpressed CatB, thus blocking collagen crosslinking and decreasing ECM stiffness. Such an ECM nanoremodeler synergizes immunogenic phototherapy and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to improve the tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.

         <title>Benzotrithiophene&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts with Controlled Conjugation of Building Blocks for Charge Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzotrithiophene (BTT) based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were prepared with different electron accepting units, which could be attributable to the photocatalytic reduction reaction. Based on both experimental results and theoretical calculations, the photocatalytic performance of BTT&#8208;COFs closely depended on the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks have recently shown high potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, their structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship has not been sufficiently explored to identify a research direction for structural design. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of four benzotrithiophene (BTT)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different conjugations of building units, and their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. All four BTT&#8208;COFs had slipped parallel stacking patterns with high crystallinity and specific surface areas. The change in the degree of conjugation was found to rationally tune the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Based on the experimental and calculation results, the tunable photocatalytic performance could be mainly attributed to the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units. This study provides important insights for designing covalent organic frameworks for efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>A Double Atomic&#8208;Tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG Nanostructure with Optimum Charge Redistribution for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double atomic&#8208;tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG nanostructure was prepared by one&#8208;step pyrolysis method. The electron density on surface of Ru nanoparticle can be synergistically modulated by alloyed Bi single atom and adjacent Bi&#8722;O single site leading to optimum charge redistribution. Thus, the resulting RuBi SAA/Bi@OG exhibits superior alkaline HER activity.







Abstract
Charge redistribution on surface of Ru nanoparticle can significantly affect electrocatalytic HER activity. Herein, a double atomic&#8208;tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG nanostructure that features RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticle supported by Bi&#8722;O single&#8208;site&#8208;doped graphene was successfully developed by one&#8208;step pyrolysis method. The alloyed Bi single atom and adjacent Bi&#8722;O single site in RuBi SAA/Bi@OG can synergistically manipulate electron transfer on Ru surface leading to optimum charge redistribution. Thus, the resulting RuBi SAA/Bi@OG exhibits superior alkaline HER activity. Its mass activity is up to 65000&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 150&#8197;mV, which is 72.2&#8197;times as much as that of commercial Pt/C. DFT calculations reveal that the RuBi SAA/Bi@OG possesses the optimum charge redistribution, which is most beneficial to strengthen adsorption of water and weaken hydrogen&#8208;adsorption free energy in HER process. This double atomic&#8208;tuned strategy on surface charge redistribution of Ru nanoparticle opens a new way to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <dc:description>
The in situ polymerization of solid&#8208;state dioxolane electrolytes on interconnected CNTs and active materials is the key to realize excellent interfacial contact. Electrons/ions enable full access to active materials in the whole electrode. Therefore, the integrated batteries demonstrated high energy density, amazing charge/discharge rate and long cycle life.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are promising and safe energy storage devices for mobile electronics and electric vehicles. In this work, we report a facile in situ polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane electrolytes to fabricate integrated solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The in situ polymerization and formation of solid&#8208;state dioxolane electrolytes on interconnected carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and active materials is the key to realizing a high&#8208;performance battery with excellent interfacial contact among CNTs, active materials and electrolytes. Therefore, the electrodes could be tightly integrated into batteries through the CNTs and electrolyte. Electrons/ions enable full access to active materials in the whole electrode. Electrodes with a low resistance of 4.5&#8197;&#937;&#8201;&#9633;&#8722;1 and high lithium&#8208;ion diffusion efficiency of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;11&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 can significantly improve the electrochemical kinetics. Subsequently, the batteries demonstrated high energy density, amazing charge/discharge rate and long cycle life.

         <title>Metalla&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement in Gold&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Reaction: A New Elementary Reaction Suggested for Future Reaction Design</title>

We report the first computational evidence for the involvement of metalla&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement (MCR) in the gold&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] reaction of yne&#8208;dienes, together with detailed analysis of different pathways and their competition. Such a MCR does not take place when the reaction is run under rhodium catalysis. The reasons behind this are given.







Abstract
We report here computational evidence for a metalla&#8208;Claisen rearrangement (MCR) in the case of gold&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of yne&#8208;dienes. The [4+2] reaction starts from exo cyclopropanation, followed by MCR and reductive elimination. The cyclopropane moiety formed in the first step is crucial for a low barrier of the MCR step. In addition, the importance of an appropriate combination of the tether group and the terminal substituent on alkyne in the yne&#8208;diene substrates was studied. The mechanism of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] reaction of yne&#8208;dienes was also investigated to see whether an MCR mechanism is involved or not. The findings and new understanding hereby reported represent an important advance in the catalysis field.

         <title>Stereospecific Oxycyanation of Alkenes with Sulfonyl Cyanide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular oxycyanation of alkenes using p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl cyanide (TsCN) in the presence of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as a catalyst was shown to be feasible. The developed method offers a simple, scalable, and straightforward approach to access synthetically useful &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile derivatives.







Abstract
Oxycyanation of alkenes would allow the direct construction of useful &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile scaffolds. However, only limited examples of such reactions have been reported, and some problems including limited substrate scope and the lack of diastereocontrol in the case of the oxycyanation of internal alkenes have arisen. We herein report on the intermolecular oxycyanation of alkenes using p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl cyanide (TsCN) in the presence of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as a catalyst, affording products that contain a sulfinyloxy group and a cyano group at the vicinal position. The reaction features a stereospecific syn&#8208;addition. The reaction also shows a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations by experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the reaction proceeds via an unprecedented stereospecific mechanism through the electrophilic cyanation of alkenes, in which B(C6F5)3 efficiently activates TsCN through the coordination of the cyano group to the boron center.

We herein report on the intermolecular oxycyanation of alkenes using &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-toluenesulfonyl cyanide (TsCN) in the presence of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as a catalyst, affording products that contain a sulfinyloxy group and a cyano group at the vicinal position. The reaction features a stereospecific &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-addition. The reaction also shows a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations by experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the reaction proceeds via an unprecedented stereospecific mechanism through the electrophilic cyanation of alkenes, in which B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; efficiently activates TsCN through the coordination of the cyano group to the boron center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bandgap&#8208;Engineered Germanene Nanosheets as an Efficient Photodynamic Agent for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;terminated germanene nanosheets with a biomedically favorable direct band gap were synthesized by a simple surface chemical modulation and can be applied to cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). The surface chemical modulation strategy addresses the major medical application challenges of Xenes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) science.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monoelemental materials (Xenes) show considerable potential in bioapplications owing to their unique 2D physicochemical features and the favored biosafety resulting from their monoelemental composition. However, the narrow band gaps of Xenes prevent their broad applications in biosensors, bioimaging and phototherapeutics. In this study, it is demonstrated that 2D germanene terminated with &#8722;H via surface chemical engineering, shows a much broadened direct band gap of 1.65&#8197;eV, which enables the material to be used as a novel inorganic photosensitizer for the photodynamic therapy of singlet oxygen. Through theoretical analysis and in vitro studies, H&#8208;germanene nanosheets demonstrate a substantially enlarged band gap and favorable biodegradability, demonstrating a substantial cancer treatment capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of constructing novel therapeutic photodynamic agents by surface covalent engineering for catalytic tumor therapy.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Multiple Charge Separation by Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple charge separation with a long lifetime has been realized in an organic cocrystal by a proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer reaction under irradiation with light. The enhanced absorption toward longer wavelengths can be applied for near&#8208;infrared imaging and bacterial inhibition.







Abstract
Multiple charge separation has been successfully realized by a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction in an organic cocrystal. Benefiting from the adjustable electronic energy level of the electron donor and acceptor through thermal&#8208;induced proton migration, distinct optical absorption behaviors combined with color changes to blue or green are observed in these charge&#8208;separated states. It is of interest to note that such charge&#8208;separated states exhibit a longer lifetime of over a month as a result of the excellent coplanarity and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction of the electron acceptors. Moreover, the enhanced absorption toward longer wavelengths endows the charge&#8208;separated state with near&#8208;infrared (808&#8197;nm) photothermal conversion for imaging and bacterial inhibition, whereby the conversion performance can be controlled by the degree of proton migration.

         <title>A Symmetry&#8208;Broken Charge&#8208;Separated State in the Marcus Inverted Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the Marcus&#8208;inverted&#8208;region&#8208;assisted evolution of a long&#8208;lived symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state in a near&#8208;orthogonal bichromophoric system consisting of perylenediimide dimers.







Abstract
We report a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state in a chromophoric pair (DC&#8208;PDI2) that uniquely integrates the advantages of fundamental processes of photosynthetic reaction centers: i) Symmetry&#8208;breaking charge&#8208;separation (SB&#8208;CS) and ii) Marcus&#8208;inverted&#8208;region dependence. The near&#8208;orthogonal bichromophoric DC&#8208;PDI2 manifests an ultrafast evolution of the SB&#8208;CS state with a time constant of 
=0.35&#177;0.02&#8197;ps and a slow charge recombination (CR) kinetics with 
=4.09&#177;0.01&#8197;ns in ACN. The rate constant of CR of DC&#8208;PDI2 is 11&#8201;686 times slower than SB&#8208;CS in ACN, as the CR of the PDI radical ion&#8208;pair occurs in the deep inverted region of the Marcus parabola (
&gt;&#955;). In contrast, an analogous benzyloxy (BnO)&#8208;substituted DC&#8208;BPDI2 showcases a &#8776;10&#8208;fold accelerated CR kinetics with 
 lowering to &#8776;1536 in ACN, by virtue of a decreased CR driving force. The present investigation demonstrates a control of molecular engineering to tune the energetics and kinetics of the SB&#8208;CS material, which is essential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Bridged Heterometallic Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets Incorporating Four Lanthanoceniums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;bridged organometallic heterometallic single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) were isolated for the first time, representing a new class of organometallic lanthanide (Ln) SMMs. The novel strategy effectively overcomes the limited number of metal centers in radical&#8208;bridged Ln&#8208;SMMs, opening up new ways to construct larger strongly coupled Ln&#8208;SMMs.







Abstract
The syntheses and magnetic properties of organometallic heterometallic compounds [K(THF)6]{CoI[(&#956;3&#8208;HAN)RE2Cp*4]2} (1&#8208;RE) and [K(Crypt)]2{CoI[(&#956;3&#8208;HAN)RE2Cp*4]2} (2&#8208;RE) containing hexaazatrinaphthylene radicals (HAN&#8901;3&#8722;) and four rare earth (RE) ions are reported. 1&#8208;RE shows isolable species with ligand&#8208;based mixed valency as revealed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) thus leading to the isolation of 2&#8208;RE via one&#8208;electron chemical reduction. Strong electronic communication in mixed&#8208;valency supports stronger overall ferromagnetic behaviors in 2&#8208;RE than 1&#8208;RE containing Gd and Dy ions. Ac magnetic susceptibility data reveal 1&#8208;Dy and 2&#8208;Dy both exhibit slow magnetic relaxation. Importantly, larger coercive field was observed in the hysteresis of 2&#8208;Dy at 2.0&#8197;K, indicating the enhanced SMM behavior compared with 1&#8208;Dy. Ligand&#8208;based mixed&#8208;valency strategy has been used for the first time to improve the magnetic coupling in lanthanide (Ln) SMMs, thus opening up new ways to construct strongly coupled Ln&#8208;SMMs.

         <title>Electrothermal Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction at Room Temperature with a Silicomolybdate&#8208;Based Palladium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrothermal water&#8208;gas shift reaction was achieved with a system comprised of a Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst and redox mediator, simplifying the separation of products and avoiding the use of alkaline electrolyte. The reduction degree of the redox mediator was a key effect in modifying the reaction kinetics and performance of both thermal&#8208; and electrocatalytic reaction steps.







Abstract
The water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction is often conducted at elevated temperature and requires energy&#8208;intensive separation of hydrogen (H2) from methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and residual carbon monoxide (CO). Designing processes to decouple CO oxidation and H2 production provides an alternative strategy to obtain high&#8208;purity H2 streams. We report an electrothermal WGS process combining thermal oxidation of CO on a silicomolybdic acid (SMA)&#8208;supported Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pd1/CsSMA) and electrocatalytic H2 evolution. The two half&#8208;reactions are coupled through phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) as a redox mediator at a moderate anodic potential of 0.6&#8197;V (versus Ag/AgCl). Under optimized conditions, our catalyst exhibited a TOF of 1.2&#8197;s&#8722;1 with turnover numbers above 40&#8201;000&#8197;mol
&#8201;molPd&#8722;1 achieving stable H2 production with a purity consistently exceeding 99.99&#8201;%.

DNA&#8208;based particles with various morphologies and functions are fabricated via the supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and DNA. The engineered particles enable in vivo co&#8208;delivery of adjuvant/antigen to boost cytokine and antibody production.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based materials have attracted interest due to the tunable structure and encoded biological functionality of nucleic acids. A simple and general approach to synthesize DNA&#8208;based materials with fine control over morphology and bioactivity is important to expand their applications. Here, we report the synthesis of DNA&#8208;based particles via the supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and DNA. Uniform particles with different morphologies are obtained using a variety of DNA building blocks. The particles enable the co&#8208;delivery of cytosine&#8208;guanine adjuvant sequences and the antigen ovalbumin in model cells. Intramuscular injection of the particles in mice induces antigen&#8208;specific antibody production and T cell responses with no apparent toxicity. Protein expression in cells is shown using capsules assembled from TA and plasmid DNA. This work highlights the potential of TA as a universal material for directing the supramolecular assembly of DNA into gene and vaccine delivery platforms.

         <title>Differentiating between Acidic and Basic Surface Hydroxyls on Metal Oxides by Fluoride Substitution: A Case Study on Blue TiO2 from Laser Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probing surface OH with F&#8722; ions: Surface OH of TiO2 were substituted by F&#8722; ions, which were then quantified by XPS and ion chromatography. The acidic (bridging) and basic (terminal) surface OH can be distinguished at different pH. Using this fluoride substitution, it was demonstrated that laser defect engineering selectively created more acidic OH but not basic OH on TiO2.







Abstract
Both oxygen vacancies and surface hydroxyls play a crucial role in catalysis. Yet, their relationship is not often explored. Herein, we prepare two series of TiO2 (rutile and P25) with increasing oxygen deficiency and Ti3+ concentration by pulsed laser defect engineering in liquid (PUDEL), and selectively quantify the acidic and basic surface OH by fluoride substitution. As indicated by EPR spectroscopy, the laser&#8208;generated Ti3+ exist near the surface of rutile, but appear to be deeper in the bulk for P25. Fluoride substitution shows that extra acidic bridging OH are selectively created on rutile, while the surface OH density remains constant for P25. These observations suggest near&#8208;surface Ti3+ are highly related to surface bridging OH, presumably the former increasing the electron density of the bridging oxygen to form more of the latter. We anticipate that fluoride substitution will enable better characterization of surface OH and its correlation with defects in metal oxides.

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Guided Construction of Nanozymes for Determining H2O2 Produced by Sonication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by the nanoconfinement effect, cytochrome&#8197;c (Cyt&#8201;c) has been successfully confined within a hierarchical MOF scaffold, PCN&#8208;222, leading to a 3&#8211;4&#8208;fold improvement in its peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. The fabricated Cyt&#8201;c@PCN&#8208;222 nanoparticles were further employed to sensitively monitor sonication&#8208;induced H2O2.







Abstract
Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities, termed as nanozymes, have found wide applications in various fields. It has been a long&#8208;term aim to rationally design and synthesize highly active nanozymes and thus to further improve their application performance. Guided by the nanoconfinement effect, we confine cytochrome c (Cyt&#8201;c) within a mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), PCN&#8208;222 nanoparticle (NP), forming a protein/MOF hybrid nanozyme, termed as Cyt&#8201;c@PCN&#8208;222 NP. The confined Cyt&#8201;c exhibits around 3&#8211;4&#8208;fold higher peroxidase&#8208;like activity than free Cyt&#8201;c. Due to the increase in the activity of Cyt&#8201;c, the Cyt&#8201;c@PCN&#8208;222 NPs exhibit a quite low limit of detection (&#8776;0.13&#8197;&#956;M) towards H2O2. Sonication&#8208;induced H2O2 formation in water by using a lab&#8208;quipped ultrasonic cleaner can be sensitively probed, which suggests that H2O2&#8208;sensitive materials should be carefully handled during the utilization of ultrasonic equipment. We speculate that this nanoconfinement strategy can broaden our synthetic methodology for the rational design of nanozymes.

         <title>A Substituted&#8208;Rhodamine&#8208;Based Reversible Fluorescent Probe for In Vivo Quantification of Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms by bioimaging is achieved by using ZpSiP, a substituted&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based ratiometric probe with reliable reactivity with GSH. The probe succeeded in monitoring the dynamics of GSH in the organisms bearing tumor tissues, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis, and thus unveiling the related pathological processes and mechanisms.







Abstract
Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of oxidative stress in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the quantification by fluorescence bioimaging in living tissues has much stricter requirements than the &#8220;Petri dish&#8221;&#8208;cultured cells in flat plates. Based on the evaluation of the electronic structure and steric hindrance&#8208;tuned reactivity of phospha&#8208;substituted rhodamine with GSH, a reversible F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe ZpSiP with a distinct performance (Kd=4.9&#8197;mM, t1/2=0.57&#8197;s, k=81&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) is developed for real time quantifying GSH in living cells. Furthermore, the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) probe succeeded in sensitively tracking the dynamics of GSH in the real organisms bearing tumors, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis for unveiling the related pathological processes. We believe that the advance in chemistry with quantitative analysis methods will initiate more promising progress and broad applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of oxidative stress in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the quantification by fluorescence bioimaging in living tissues has much stricter requirements than the &#8220;Petri dish&#8221;-cultured cells in flat plates. Based on the evaluation of the electronic structure and steric hindrance-tuned reactivity of phospha-substituted rhodamine with GSH, a reversible F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe &lt;i&gt;Zp&lt;/i&gt;SiP with a distinct performance (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;=4.9&#8197;mM, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.57&#8197;s, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;=81&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is developed for real time quantifying GSH in living cells. Furthermore, the near-infrared (NIR) probe succeeded in sensitively tracking the dynamics of GSH in the real organisms bearing tumors, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis for unveiling the related pathological processes. We believe that the advance in chemistry with quantitative analysis methods will initiate more promising progress and broad applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Colloidal Quantum Wells for Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A creatively water&#8208;driven strategy is devised to obtain size&#8208;homogenized and strongly confined deep&#8208;blue perovskite quantum wells (QWs) with remarkable stability and high photoluminescence quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. The electroluminescent devices based on the QWs show high luminance of 2946&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, demonstrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art brightness for perovskite QWs based devices.







Abstract
Perovskite colloidal quantum wells (QWs) are promising to realize narrow deep&#8208;blue emission, but the poor optical performance and stability suppress their practical application. Here, we creatively propose a water&#8208;driven synthesis strategy to obtain size&#8208;homogenized and strongly confined deep&#8208;blue CsPbBr3 QWs, corresponding to three monolayers, which emit at the deep&#8208;blue wavelength of 456&#8197;nm. The water controls the orientation and distribution of the ligands on the surface of the nanocrystals, thus inducing orientated growth through the Ostwald ripening process by phagocytizing unstable nanocrystals to form well&#8208;crystallized QWs. These QWs present remarkable stability and high photoluminescence quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. Furthermore, we have prepared light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the QWs via the all&#8208;solution fabrication strategy, achieving an external quantum efficiency of 1&#8201;% and luminance of 2946&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, demonstrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art brightness for perovskite QW&#8208;based LEDs.

         <title>Deciphering Siloxane Bond Exchanges: From a Molecular Study to Vitrimerization and Recycling of Silicone Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic exchanges in polymer networks are only desirable during reprocessing or recycling. We exploit thermal degradation of active exchangeable species to stop dynamic exchanges in siloxane networks and yield permanent networks. A rheological model for stress relaxation accounts for deactivation of exchanges and extracts the key kinetics parameters from simple experiments to predict the evolution of processability of the material.







Abstract
The activity of various additives promoting siloxane equilibration reactions is examined and quantified on model compounds. We found in particular that the &#8220;superbase&#8221; phosphazene derivative P4&#8208;tBu can promote very fast exchanges (a few seconds at 90&#8201;&#176;C) even at low concentration (&lt;0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%). We demonstrate that permanent silicone networks can be transformed into reprocessable and recyclable dynamic networks by mere introduction of such additives. Annealing at high temperature degrades the additives and deactivates the dynamic features of the silicone networks, reverting them back into permanent networks. A simple rheological experiment and the corresponding model allow to extract the critical kinetic parameters to predict and control such deactivations.

         <title>Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Chiral Bimetallic Ag22Cu7 Superatom with Multiple Chirality Origins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkynyl&#8208;protected chiral bimetallic AgCu superatomic nanocluster [Ag22Cu7(C&#8801;CR)16(PPh3)5Cl6]&#8722; with a high free valence electron count is reported. This cluster exhibits multiple chirality origins, including the metal core, metal&#8208;ligand interface and ligand layer.







Abstract
Understanding the origin of chirality in the nanostructured materials is essential for chiroptical and catalytic applications. Here we report a chiral AgCu superatomic cluster, [Ag22Cu7(C&#8801;CR)16(PPh3)5Cl6](PPh4), Ag22Cu7, protected by an achiral alkynyl ligand (HC&#8801;CR: 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetylene). Its crystal structure comprises a rare interpenetrating biicosahedral Ag17Cu2 core, which is stabilized by four different types of motifs: one Cu(C&#8801;CR)2, four &#8722;C&#8801;CR, two chlorides and one helical Ag5Cu4(C&#8801;CR)10(PPh3)5Cl4. Structural analysis reveals that Ag22Cu7 exhibits multiple chirality origins, including the metal core, the metal&#8208;ligand interface and the ligand layer. Furthermore, the circular dichroism spectra of R/S&#8208;Ag22Cu7 are obtained by employing appropriate chiral molecules as optical enrichment agents. DFT calculations show that Ag22Cu7 is an eight&#8208;electron superatom, confirm that the cluster is chirally active, and help to analyze the origins of the circular dichroism.

         <title>Synthesis, Biochemical Characterization, and Genetic Encoding of a 1,2,4&#8208;Triazole Amino Acid as an Acetyllysine Mimic for Bromodomains of the BET Family</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triazole&#8208;containing amino acid (ApmTri) was established as a mimic of acetyllysine for bromodomains of the BET family. Biochemical and structural investigations showed that ApmTri binds with similar affinity to bromodomains as acetyllysine and reflects the binding mode of the native modification at the atomic level. Genetic encoding enables ApmTri incorporation into proteins allowing investigations of bromodomain binding properties and inhibition.







Abstract
Lysine acetylation is a charge&#8208;neutralizing post&#8208;translational modification of proteins bound by bromodomains (Brds). A 1,2,4&#8208;triazole amino acid (ApmTri) was established as acetyllysine (Kac) mimic recruiting Brds of the BET family in contrast to glutamine commonly used for simulating this modification. Optimization of triazole substituents and side chain spacing allowed BET Brd recruitment to ApmTri&#8208;containing peptides with affinities similar to native substrates. Crystal structures of ApmTri&#8208;containing peptides in complex with two BET Brds revealed the binding mode which mirrored that of Kac ligands. ApmTri was genetically encoded and recombinant ApmTri&#8208;containing proteins co&#8208;enriched BRD3(2) from cellular lysates. This interaction was blocked by BET inhibitor JQ1. With genetically encoded ApmTri, biochemistry is now provided with a stable Kac mimic reflecting charge neutralization and Brd recruitment, allowing new investigations into BET proteins in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Semiconductor SERS on Colourful Substrates with Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>

Colourful SERS substrates can be achieved by involving Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot cavities with semiconductor materials. These are capable of enhancing the sensitivity by manipulating light into resonant absorption.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metallic materials have emerged as a new family of active substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), with unique advantages over their metal counterparts. However, owing to their inefficient interaction with the incident wavelength, the Raman enhancement achieved with non&#8208;metallic materials is considerably lower with respect to the metallic ones. Herein, we propose colourful semiconductor&#8208;based SERS substrates for the first time by utilizing a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot cavity, which realize a large freedom in manipulating light. Owing to the delicate adjustment of the absorption in terms of both frequency and intensity, resonant absorption can be achieved with a variety of non&#8208;metal SERS substrates, with the sensitivity further enhanced by &#8776;100&#8197;times. As a typical example, by introducing a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot&#8208;type substrate fabricated with SiO2/Si, a rather low detection limit of 10&#8722;16&#8197;M for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2S protein is achieved on SnS2. This study provides a realistic strategy for increasing SERS sensitivity when semiconductors are employed as SERS substrates.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Metal Electrocatalyst Powders and Electrodes and their Application for Oxygen Evolution and Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer/metal precursor spraying synthesis technique was developed as a straightforward and scalable method to produce multi&#8208;metal catalyst powders and Ni&#8208;foam based electrodes. 11 different multi&#8208;metal catalyst powders were characterized and investigated towards the oxygen evolution reaction. CoNiFeMoCr&#8208;modified Ni&#8208;foam electrodes were investigated for water splitting in MEA&#8208;type model electrolyzers up to current densities of 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;metal electrocatalysts provide nearly unlimited catalytic possibilities arising from synergistic element interactions. We propose a polymer/metal precursor spraying technique that can easily be adapted to produce a large variety of compositional different multi&#8208;metal catalyst materials. To demonstrate this, 11 catalysts were synthesized, characterized, and investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Further investigation of the most active OER catalyst, namely CoNiFeMoCr, revealed a polycrystalline structure, and operando Raman measurements indicate that multiple active sites are participating in the reaction. Moreover, Ni foam&#8208;supported CoNiFeMoCr electrodes were developed and applied for water splitting in flow&#8208;through electrolysis cells with electrolyte gaps and in zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configurations. The proposed alkaline MEA&#8208;type electrolyzers reached up to 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and 24&#8197;h measurements demonstrated no loss of current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Amplification of Lipid Peroxidation by Regulating Cell Membrane Unsaturation To Enhance Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reinforcing chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent was prepared by loading oleanolic acid (OA) into hollow carbon&#8208;supported iron single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SAC) prior to coating with erythrocyte membrane (EM). Fe&#8208;SAC&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation from H2O2, in addition to initiating CDT, triggers EM destruction to release OA, which can amplify lipid peroxidation by enriching cell membranes with polyunsaturated fatty acids, enabling enhanced CDT efficacy.







Abstract
Lipid peroxidation (LPO) is one of the most damaging processes in chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Although it is well known that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are much more susceptible than saturated or monounsaturated ones to LPO, there is no study exploring the effect of cell membrane unsaturation degree on CDT. Here, we report a self&#8208;reinforcing CDT agent (denoted as OA@Fe&#8208;SAC@EM NPs), consisting of oleanolic acid (OA)&#8208;loaded iron single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe&#8208;SAC)&#8208;embedded hollow carbon nanospheres encapsulated by an erythrocyte membrane (EM), which promotes LPO to improve chemodynamic efficacy via modulating the degree of membrane unsaturation. Upon uptake of OA@Fe&#8208;SAC@EM NPs by cancer cells, Fe&#8208;SAC&#8208;catalyzed conversion of endogenous hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals, in addition to initiating the chemodynamic therapeutic process, causes the dissociation of the EM shell and the ensuing release of OA that can enrich cellular membranes with PUFAs, enabling LPO amplification&#8208;enhanced CDT.

A regio&#8208; and stereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of internal alkynes is reported. A library of methyl containing tetra&#8208;substituted olefins was successfully built using readily available and bench&#8208;stable coupling partners, iodo&#8208;arenes, and methyl boronic acid.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of internal alkynes (ynamides/yne&#8208;acetates/alkynes) is described. The readily available and bench stable coupling partners iodo&#8208;arenes, and methyl boronic acid are successfully used in this coupling strategy to access the methyl&#8208;containing tetra&#8208;substituted olefins; the scope is broad showing excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. Notably, the transformation is regio&#8208; as well as stereoselective. The biologically relevant motifs (BRM) bearing iodo&#8208;arenes and ynamides are also used for the late&#8208;stage syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of alkynes. Aryl&#8208;alkylation, aryl&#8208;trideuteriomethylation, alkynyl&#8208;methylation, and alkenyl&#8208;methylation of ynamides are also presented. The Me&#8208;substituted alkenes are further transformed into synthetically important &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;indenones and &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;methyl ketones.

         <title>Prebiotic Synthesis and Isomerization in Interstellar Analog Ice: Glycinal, Acetamide, and Their Enol Tautomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out of the cold: Ammonia (NH3) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) are exposed to galactic cosmic ray proxies while frozen at 5&#8197;K to simulate the environment of an interstellar molecular cloud. Reactants undergo dissociation and radical recombination to produce glycinal (NH2CH2CHO) and acetamide (CH3CONH2) prior to tautomerization to 2&#8208;aminoethenol (HOCHCHNH2) and 1&#8208;aminoethenol (H2CC(OH)NH2), respectively.







Abstract
Glycinal (HCOCH2NH2) and acetamide (CH3CONH2) are simple molecular building blocks of biomolecules in prebiotic chemistry, though their origin on early Earth and formation in interstellar media remain a mystery. These molecules are formed with their tautomers in low temperature interstellar model ices upon interaction with simulated galactic cosmic rays. Glycinal and acetamide are accessed via barrierless radical&#8208;radical reactions of vinoxy (&#8901;CH2CHO) and acetyl (&#8901;C(O)CH3), and then undergo keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Exploiting tunable photoionization reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy and photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves, these results demonstrate fundamental reaction pathways for the formation of complex organics through non&#8208;equilibrium ice reactions in cold molecular cloud environments. These molecules demonstrate an unconventional starting point for abiotic synthesis of organics relevant to contemporary biomolecules like polypeptides and cell membranes in deep space.

&lt;p&gt;Out of the cold: Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and acetaldehyde (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHO) are exposed to galactic cosmic ray proxies while frozen at 5&#8197;K to simulate the environment of an interstellar molecular cloud. Reactants undergo dissociation and radical recombination to produce glycinal (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHO) and acetamide (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) prior to tautomerization to 2-aminoethenol (HOCHCHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 1-aminoethenol (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CC(OH)NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycinal (HCOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and acetamide (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are simple molecular building blocks of biomolecules in prebiotic chemistry, though their origin on early Earth and formation in interstellar media remain a mystery. These molecules are formed with their tautomers in low temperature interstellar model ices upon interaction with simulated galactic cosmic rays. Glycinal and acetamide are accessed via barrierless radical-radical reactions of vinoxy (&#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHO) and acetyl (&#8901;C(O)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and then undergo keto-enol tautomerization. Exploiting tunable photoionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves, these results demonstrate fundamental reaction pathways for the formation of complex organics through non-equilibrium ice reactions in cold molecular cloud environments. These molecules demonstrate an unconventional starting point for abiotic synthesis of organics relevant to contemporary biomolecules like polypeptides and cell membranes in deep space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Cationic Disordering Induces two Distinct Degradation Pathways in Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Ni&#8208;rich Li1&#8722;m(Ni0.94Al0.06)1+mO2 (NA) oxides are synthesized through tailoring the heating temperature. The NA oxides with high cation disorder experience a comparably homogeneous fatigue process upon extended cycling, while a disordered surface with lattice mismatch is gradually formed in the NA with low cation disorder (i.e. heterogeneous degradation) which results in a rapid capacity decay during the fast charge&#8211;discharge cycling.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are one of the most attractive cathode materials in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries, their degradation mechanisms are still not completely elucidated. Herein, we report a strong dependence of degradation pathways on the long&#8208;range cationic disordering of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich Li1&#8722;m(Ni0.94Al0.06)1+mO2 (NA). Interestingly, a disordered layered phase with lattice mismatch can be easily formed in the near&#8208;surface region of NA particles with very low cation disorder (NA&#8208;LCD, m&#8804;0.06) over electrochemical cycling, while the layered structure is basically maintained in the core of particles forming a &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; structure. Such surface reconstruction triggers a rapid capacity decay during the first 100&#8197;cycles between 2.7 and 4.3&#8197;V at 1&#8197;C or 3&#8197;C. On the contrary, the local lattice distortions are gradually accumulated throughout the whole NA particles with higher degrees of cation disorder (NA&#8208;HCD, 0.06&#8804;m&#8804;0.15) that lead to a slow capacity decay upon cycling.

         <title>Organic Additive&#8208;derived Films on Cu Electrodes Promote Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products Under Strongly Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modified copper electrodes with N&#8208;tolyl pyridinium additive&#8208;derived films show boosted selectivity of the CO2 reduction to C2+ products (&gt;70&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency) and great suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction in strongly acidic electrolytes with low alkali cation concentrations.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) at low pH is desired for high CO2 utilization; the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a challenge. High alkali cation concentration at a high operating current density has recently been used to promote electrochemical CO2R at low pH. Herein we report an alternative approach to selective CO2R (&gt;70&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for C2+ products, FEC2+) at low pH (pH&#8197;2; H3PO4/KH2PO4) and low potassium concentration ([K+]=0.1&#8197;M) using organic film&#8208;modified polycrystalline copper (Modified&#8208;Cu). Such an electrode effectively mitigates HER due to attenuated proton transport. Modified&#8208;Cu still achieves high FEC2+ (45&#8201;% with Cu foil /55&#8201;% with Cu GDE) under 1.0&#8197;M H3PO4 (pH&#8776;1) at low [K+] (0.1&#8197;M), even at low operating current, conditions where HER can otherwise dominate.

         <title>A New Thiolate&#8208;Bound Dimanganese Cluster as a Structural and Functional Model for Class Ib Ribonucleotide Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aim to mimic the reactivity of class&#8197;Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs), a new thiolate&#8208;bound MnII2 compound was studied. Upon superoxide activation it forms a reactive intermediate that exhibits a 16&#8208;line St=1/2 EPR signal at g=2 and oxidizes substituted phenols, thereby resembling the enzymatic behavior and, thus, providing new mechanistic insight into class&#8197;Ib RNR reactivity.







Abstract
In class&#8197;Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) a dimanganese(II) cluster activates superoxide (O2&#8901;&#8722;) rather than dioxygen (O2), to access a high valent MnIII&#8722;O2&#8722;MnIV species, responsible for the oxidation of tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. In a biomimetic approach, we report the synthesis of a thiolate&#8208;bound dimanganese complex [MnII2(BPMT)(OAc)2](ClO)4 (BPMT=(2,6&#8208;bis{[bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl}&#8208;4&#8208;methylthiophenolate) (1) and its reaction with O2&#8901;&#8722; to form a [(BPMT)MnO2Mn]2+ complex 2. Resonance Raman investigation revealed the presence of an O&#8722;O bond in 2, while EPR analysis displayed a 16&#8208;line St=1/2 signal at g=2 typically associated with a MnIIIMnIV core, as detected in class&#8197;Ib RNRs. Unlike all other previously reported Mn&#8722;O2&#8722;Mn complexes, generated by O2&#8901;&#8722; activation at Mn2 centers, 2 proved to be a capable electrophilic oxidant in aldehyde deformylation and phenol oxidation reactions, rendering it one of the best structural and functional models for class&#8197;Ib RNRs.

A novel Al&#8208;based MOF is described with uniform micropore size of 8.37&#177;0.73&#8197;&#197; and excellent chemical&#8208;thermal stability for trace BTEX, e.g., benzene adsorption of 3.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at relative pressure (P/P0)=0.01 and 298&#8197;K, which is the largest value reported.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential porous adsorbents for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX). A novel MOF, using low toxic aluminum (Al) as the metal, named as ZJU&#8208;620(Al), with uniform micropore size of 8.37&#177;0.73&#8197;&#197; and specific surface area of 1347&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, was synthesized. It is constructed by one&#8208;dimensional rod&#8208;shaped AlO6 clusters, formate ligands and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl) tribenzoic ligands. ZJU&#8208;620(Al) exhibits excellent chemical&#8208;thermal stability and adsorption for trace BTEX, e.g., benzene adsorption of 3.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at P/P0=0.01 and 298&#8197;K, which is the largest one reported. Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations and Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, it was observed that the excellent adsorption could be attributed to the high affinity of BTEX molecules in ZJU&#8208;620(Al) micropores because the kinetic diameters of BTEX are close up to the pore size of ZJU&#8208;620(Al).

         <title>Elucidating Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Kinetics via Intermediates by Time&#8208;Dependent Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond electron transfer number and rate constant for oxygen reduction reaction, the potential&#8208;dependent time and spatial distribution of reactive oxygen species in the diffusion layer was successfully revealed from time&#8208;dependent electrochemiluminescence decay curves. Such uncovered information would guide electrocatalysts for fuel cells and H2O2 production with maximized activity and durability.







Abstract
Facile evaluation of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics for electrocatalysts is critical for sustainable fuel&#8208;cell development and industrial H2O2 production. Despite great success in ORR studies using mainstream strategies, such as the membrane electrode assembly, rotation electrodes, and advanced surface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopy, the time and spatial distribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) intermediates in the diffusion layer remain unknown. Using time&#8208;dependent electrochemiluminescence (Td&#8208;ECL), we report an intermediate&#8208;oriented method for ORR kinetics analysis. Owing to multiple ultrasensitive stoichiometric reactions between ROS and the ECL emitter, except for electron transfer numbers and rate constants, the potential&#8208;dependent time and spatial distribution of ROS were successfully obtained for the first time. Such exclusively uncovered information would guide the development of electrocatalysts for fuel cells and H2O2 production with maximized activity and durability.

         <title>In situ Observation of Porosity Formation in Porous Single&#8208;crystalline TiO2 Monolith for Enhanced and Stable Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrate the comprehensive growth methodology of porous single crystals at the macroscale by using in situ transmission electron microscopy.







Abstract
Introducing pores in single crystals creates a new type of porous materials that incorporate porosity and structural coherence. Herein, we use in situ transmission electron microscopy to disclose the porosity formation by converting KTiOPO4 (KTP) single crystals into porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) TiO2 monoliths in a solid&#8208;solid transformation. The isolated crystalline nuclei of TiO2 clusters with identical lattice orientation on KTP surface moves TiO2/KTP interface toward mother phase for growing PSC TiO2 monoliths. The relative density in PSC TiO2 monoliths dominates porosity while the macroscopic dimensions remain unchanged in the transformation. The single&#8208;crystalline nature of porous architecture stabilizes oxygen vacancy to activate lattice oxygen while the three&#8208;dimensional percolation enhances species diffusion. PSC TiO2 monoliths with deposited Pt clusters show enhanced and stable catalytic CO oxidation in air at &#8764;75&#8201;&#176;C for 200&#8197;hours of operation.

         <title>Discovery of a Unique Flavonoid Biosynthesis Mechanism in Fungi by Genome Mining</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plant flavonoids are synthesized by type&#8197;III PKS followed by chalcone isomerase (CHI) and flavone synthase (FNS). Now a unique flavonoid biosynthesis mechanism has been identified in fungi by genome mining. The chalcone skeleton is assembled by an NRPS&#8208;PKS hybrid enzyme, and subsequent conversion into a flavone is catalyzed by new types of CHI and FNS. This finding provides new insight into the microbial production of valuable plant flavonoids.







Abstract
Flavonoids are important plant natural products with variable structures and bioactivities. All known plant flavonoids are generated under the catalysis of a type&#8197;III polyketide synthase (PKS) followed by a chalcone isomerase (CHI) and a flavone synthase (FNS). In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster of chlorflavonin, a fungal flavonoid with acetolactate synthase inhibitory activity, was discovered using a self&#8208;resistance&#8208;gene&#8208;directed strategy. A novel flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in fungi was revealed. A core nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase (NRPS&#8208;PKS) is responsible for the generation of the key precursor chalcone. Then, a new type of CHI catalyzes the conversion of a chalcone into a flavanone by a histidine&#8208;mediated oxa&#8208;Michael addition mechanism. Finally, the desaturation of flavanone to flavone is catalyzed by a new type of FNS, a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase.

         <title>Evolving Robust and Interpretable Enzymes for the Bioethanol Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes are at the core of biotransformation in first&#8208; and second&#8208;generation bioethanol production processes. By integrating the transferable protein evolution strategy InSiReP 2.0 (In Silico guided Recombination Process), the model cellulase PvCel5A was evolved to overcome the remaining challenge of low ethanol tolerance and thermal stability, which hindered the further improvement of biomass transformation and bioethanol yield prior to this study.







Abstract
Obtaining a robust and applicable enzyme for bioethanol production is a dream for biorefinery engineers. Herein, we describe a general method to evolve an all&#8208;round and interpretable enzyme that can be directly employed in the bioethanol industry. By integrating the transferable protein evolution strategy InSiReP 2.0 (In Silico guided Recombination Process), enzymatic characterization for actual production, and computational molecular understanding, the model cellulase PvCel5A (endoglucanase II Cel5A from Penicillium verruculosum) was successfully evolved to overcome the remaining challenges of low ethanol and temperature tolerance, which primarily limited biomass transformation and bioethanol yield. Remarkably, application of the PvCel5A variants in both first&#8208; and second&#8208;generation bioethanol production processes (i. Conventional corn ethanol fermentation combined with the in situ pretreatment process; ii. cellulosic ethanol fermentation process) resulted in a 5.7&#8211;10.1&#8201;% increase in the ethanol yield, which was unlikely to be achieved by other optimization techniques.

         <title>Organic Photovoltaic Catalyst with &#963;&#8208;&#960; Anchor for High&#8208;Performance Solar Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic photovoltaic catalyst (Y6CO) with a central steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;free carbonyl group, achieves efficient Pt0 in situ deposition through &#963;&#8208;&#960; anchoring, leading to significantly enhanced utilization of the Pt cocatalyst and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of Y6CO/Pt based nanoparticles under simulated solar light illumination.







Abstract
Efficient in situ deposition of metallic cocatalyst, like zero&#8208;valent platinum (Pt), on organic photovoltaic catalysts (OPCs) is the prerequisite for their high catalytic activities. Here we develop the OPC (Y6CO), by introducing carbonyl in the core, which is available to &#963;&#8208;&#960; coordinate with transition metals, due to the high&#8208;energy empty &#960;* orbital of carbonyl. Y6CO exhibits a stronger capability to anchor Pt species and reduce them to metallic state, resulting in more Pt0 deposition, relative to the control OPC without the central &#963;&#8208;&#960; anchor. Single&#8208;component and heterojunction nanoparticles (NPs) employing Y6CO show enhanced average hydrogen evolution rates of 230.98 and 323.22&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g[OPC]&#8722;1, respectively, under AM 1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 10&#8197;h, and heterojunction NPs yield the external quantum efficiencies of ca. 10&#8201;% in 500&#8211;800&#8197;nm. This work demonstrates that &#963;&#8208;&#960; anchoring is one efficient strategy for integrating metallic cocatalyst and OPC for high&#8208;performance photocatalysis.

         <title>Solid&#8208;state Fluorescence from Carbon Dots Widely Tunable from Blue to Deep Red through Surface Ligand Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state fluorescent (SSF) carbon dots (CDs) with an emission&#8208;color span of almost 300&#8197;nm (from blue to deep red) were obtained through surface ligand modulation. The emission wavelengths can be switched smoothly by deliberately altering the conjugation ability between substituent ligands and carbon core. The developed SSF CDs showed great potential for widespread use in three&#8208;dimensional printing and various types of optical displays.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) find widespread attention due to their remarkable fluorescent and electronic properties. However, aggregation&#8208;caused quenching currently limits the application of CDs in colored displays. The construction of CDs with color&#8208;tunable solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSF) is rarely reported, since the preparation of SSF CDs is technically challenging. Herein, through surface ligand modulation, SSF CDs with an emission&#8208;color span of almost 300&#8197;nm (from blue to deep red) were obtained. In&#8208;depth structure&#8208;property studies reveal that intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding inside SSF CDs provokes the emission properties in the aggregated state. Photodynamic characterizations demonstrate emission wavelengths can be switched smoothly by deliberately altering conjugation ability between substituent ligands and CDs core. Three&#8208;dimensional printing patterning is used to create a range of emissive objects, demonstrating the commercial potential for use in optical lamps.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Porphyrin Coordination Supramolecular Network Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via charge&#8208;transfer interaction between porphyrin nitrogen and I3&#8722;, Zn&#8208;TCPP achieves an effective anchoring of I3&#8722;. Besides, the open channels constructed by 2D layered network are beneficial to the penetration of I3&#8722; and the accessibility of the porphyrin nitrogen active sites, which brings an excellent electrochemical performance to the Zn&#8208;TCPP cathode.







Abstract
Iodine has great potential in the energy storage, but high solubility of I3&#8722; has seriously delayed its promotion. Benefited from abundant active sites and the open channel, two&#8208;dimensional coordination supramolecular networks (2D CSNs) is considered to be a candidate for the energy storage. Herein, a 2D porphyrin&#8208;CSN cathode named Zn&#8208;TCPP for aqueous iodine dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) shows an excellent specific capacity of 278&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high energy density of 340&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, as well as a durable cycle performance of 5000 cycles and a high Coulombic efficiency of 98&#8201;%. Molecular orbital theory, UV/VIS, Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal charge&#8208;transfer interaction between the donor of porphyrin nitrogen and the acceptor of I3&#8722;, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations demonstrate the contribution of 2D layered network structure of Zn&#8208;TCPP to the penetration of I3&#8722;.

         <title>Evaluation and Improvement of the Stability of Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based Solid&#8208;state Batteries with High&#8208;Voltage Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The failure of cells in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries at high voltages, indicated by &#8220;voltage noise&#8221; and attributed to the formation of lithium dendrites, was effectively overcome by using higher molecular weight PEO. In addition, the PEO/NCM interface was investigated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirming oxidative degradation of PEO.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) with high&#8208;voltage cathode active materials (CAMs) such as LiNi1&#8722;x&#8722;yCoxMnyO2 (NCM) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) suffer from &#8220;noisy voltage&#8221; related cell failure. Moreover, reports on their long&#8208;term cycling performance with high&#8208;voltage CAMs are not consistent. In this work, we verified that the penetration of lithium dendrites through the solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) indeed causes such &#8220;noisy voltage cell failure&#8221;. This problem can be overcome by a simple modification of the SPE using higher molecular weight PEO, resulting in an improved cycling stability compared to lower molecular weight PEO. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirms the formation of oxidative degradation products after cycling with NCM, for what Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is not suitable as an analytical technique due to its limited surface sensitivity. Overall, our results help to critically evaluate and improve the stability of PEO&#8208;based SSBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional roles of polymers, other than &#8220;inert&#8221; protecting media, were introduced and highlighted in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. Three exemplary roles include modulations of intersystem crossing, air sensitivity and biological activity, respectively, which greatly expand the application horizons for sophisticated polymeric RTP materials in the future.







Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials routinely incorporate polymeric components, which usually act as non&#8208;functional or &#8220;inert&#8221; media to protect excited&#8208;state phosphors from thermal and collisional quenching, but are lesser explored for other influences. Here, we report some exemplary &#8220;active roles&#8221; of polymer matrices played in organic RTP materials, including: 1)&#8197;color modulation of total delayed emissions via balancing the population ratio between thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and RTP due to dielectric&#8208;dependent intersystem crossing; 2)&#8197;altered air sensitivity of RTP materials by generating various surface morphologies such as nano&#8208;sized granules; 3)&#8197;enhanced bacterial elimination for enhanced electrostatic interactions with negatively charged bio&#8208;membranes. These active roles demonstrated that the vast library of polymeric structures and functionalities can be married to organic phosphors to broaden new application horizons for RTP materials.

         <title>Isoindolium&#8208;Based Allenes: Reactivity Studies and Applications in Fluorescence Temperature Sensing and Cysteine Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a series of electron&#8208;deficient isoindolium&#8208;based allenes 1 with sulfhydryl compounds has been studied. The vinyl sulfides 2 generated were converted into indanones 3 and amines 4 in good yields upon heating at 30&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C. Applications of the vinyl sulfides 2 include the design and synthesis of a novel FRET&#8208;based fluorescent temperature sensor and chemoselective cysteine bioconjugation to provide multifunctional peptide bioconjugates.







Abstract
The reaction of a series of electron&#8208;deficient isoindolium&#8208;based allenes with sulfhydryl compounds has been studied, leading to the formation of isoindolium&#8208;based vinyl sulfides. The vinyl sulfides generated could be readily converted into the corresponding indanones and amines upon heating at 30&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C with good yields up to 61&#8201;%. The thermal cleavage reaction of vinyl sulfides was further studied for developing temperature&#8208;sensitive systems. Notably, a novel FRET&#8208;based fluorescent temperature sensor was designed and synthesized for temperature sensing at 50&#8201;&#176;C, giving a 6.5&#8208;fold blue fluorescence enhancement. Moreover, chemoselective bioconjugation of cysteine&#8208;containing peptides with the isoindolium&#8208;based allenes for the construction of multifunctional peptide bioconjugates was investigated. Thermal cleavage of isoindoliums on the modified peptides at 35&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C gave indanone bioconjugates with up to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion. These results indicated the biocompatibility of this novel temperature&#8208;sensitive reaction.

         <title>Origin and Regulation of Interface Fusion during Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystal Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interface atom migration plays a key role in the formation of Ni&#8208;based layered oxide single&#8208;crystals, which is mainly controlled by the intermediate lithiation state. Strengthening the lithiation kinetics is helpful to promote the formation of intermediate states and further accelerate the formation of the single&#8208;crystal morphology.







Abstract
Interface fusion plays a key role in constructing Ni&#8208;based single&#8208;crystal cathodes, and is governed by the atomic migration related to kinetics. However, the interfacial atom migration path and its control factors are lack of clearly understanding. Herein, we systematically probe the solid&#8208;state synthesis mechanism of single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.92Co0.04Mn0.04O2, including the effects of precursor size, Li/transition metal (TM) ratio and sintering temperature on the structure. Multi&#8208;dimensional analysis unravels that thermodynamics drives interface atoms migration through intermediate state (i.e., cation mixing phase) to induce grain boundary fusion. Moreover, we demonstrate that smaller precursor size (&lt;6&#8197;&#956;m), lager Li/TM ratio (&gt;1.0) and higher temperature (&#8805;810&#8201;&#176;C) are conducive to promote the growth of the intermediate state due to reaction kinetics enhancement, and ultimately strengthen the atomic migration&#8208;induced interface fusion.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuned Multicolor Emission of 2D Lead Halide Perovskites with Ultrahigh Color Purity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;range and ultrapure emissions are achieved in 2D lead halide perovskites (LHPs) by combined chemical pressure from halogen doping/substitution and physical pressure from hydrostatic compression. This work demonstrates precise emission tuning and effective color regulation of 2D LHPs by pressure engineering, which would open a new pathway for developing ultrapure emitters and highly sensitive pressure sensors.







Abstract
The chemical diversity and structural flexibility of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) offer tremendous opportunities to tune their optical properties through internal molecular engineering and external stimuli. Herein, we report the wide&#8208;range and ultrapure photoluminescence emissions in a family of homologous 2D LHPs, [MeOPEA]2PbBr4&#8722;4xI4x (MeOPEA=4&#8208;methoxyphenethylammonium; x=0, 0.2, 0.425, 0.575, 1) enabled through internal chemical pressure and external hydrostatic pressure. The chemical pressure, induced by the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and halogen doping/substitution strengthens the structural rigidity to give sustained narrow emissions, and regulates the emission energy, respectively. Further manipulation of physical pressure leads to wide&#8208;range emission tuning from 412 to 647&#8197;nm in a continuous and reversible manner. This work could open up new pathways for developing 2D LHP emitters with ultra&#8208;wide color gamut and high color purity which are highly useful for pressure sensing.

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Transition&#8208;Metal Migration in Layered Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes: Random Na Extraction and Na&#8208;Free Layer Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of cation migration in layered sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode is first elucidated, which is attributed to the Na&#8208;free layer forming under high charge potential due to the random desodiation reaction. A 3d/4d metal co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to address the unfavourable cation migration by creating a selective desodiation reaction.







Abstract
Cation migration often occurs in layered oxide cathodes of lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the similar ion radius of Li and transition metals (TMs). Although Na and TM show a big difference of ion radius, TMs in layered cathodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) can still migrate to Na layer, leading to serious electrochemical degeneration. To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na&#8208;free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru&#8208;contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na&#8208;free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.

A Ru/Ti co-doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru-contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na-free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Green Synthesis of Robust Ultra&#8208;Microporous Hofmann Clathrate Material with Record C3H6 Storage Density for Efficient C3H6/C3H8 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy that incorporates high&#8208;density strong binding sites into ultra&#8208;microporous Hofmann clathrate material for dense packing of C3H6 molecules is reported. The use of this new porous material not only overcomes the trade&#8208;off between uptake capacity and selectivity but also combines excellent separation performance with high stability, economic feasibility and easy scalability of synthesis.







Abstract
Developing porous materials for C3H6/C3H8 separation faces the challenge of merging excellent separation performance with high stability and easy scalability of synthesis. Herein, we report a robust Hofmann clathrate material (ZJU&#8208;75a), featuring high&#8208;density strong binding sites to achieve all the above requirements. ZJU&#8208;75a adsorbs large amount of C3H6 with a record high storage density of 0.818&#8197;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, and concurrently shows high C3H6/C3H8 selectivity (54.2) at 296&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. Single&#8208;crystal structure analysis unveil that the high&#8208;density binding sites in ZJU&#8208;75a not only provide much stronger interactions with C3H6 but also enable the dense packing of C3H6. Breakthrough experiments on gas mixtures afford both high separation factor of 14.7 and large C3H6 uptake (2.79&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1). This material is highly stable and can be easily produced at kilogram&#8208;scale using a green synthesis method, making it as a benchmark material to address major challenges for industrial C3H6/C3H8 separation.

         <title>Photothermally Triggered Copper Payload Release for Cuproptosis&#8208;Promoted Cancer Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;nanorod&#8208;based, copper&#8208;doped, and disulfiram (DSF)&#8208;loaded multifunctional therapeutic nanoplatform (Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF) was fabricated to deliver DSF and Cu2+ into cancer cells efficiently. A photothermal effect triggered on&#8208;command payload release remotely to form cytotoxic bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)copper (CuET) and Cu+ in situ. This cuproptosis&#8208;based strategy offers synergistic therapeutic modalities.







Abstract
Cuproptosis is a new form of programmed cell death and exhibits enormous potential in cancer treatment. However, reducing the undesirable Cu ion release in normal tissue and maximizing the copper&#8208;induced therapeutic effect in cancer sites are two main challenges. In this study, we constructed a photothermally triggered nanoplatform (Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF) to realize on&#8208;demand delivery for synergistic therapy. The released disulfiram (DSF) chelated with Cu2+ in situ to generate highly cytotoxic bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)copper (CuET), causing cell apoptosis, and the formed Cu+ species promoted toxic mitochondrial protein aggregation, leading to cell cuproptosis. Synergistic with photothermal therapy, Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF could effectively kill tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth (inhibition rate up to 80.1&#8201;%). These results provide a promising perspective for potential cancer treatment based on cuproptosis, and may also inspire the design of advanced nano&#8208;therapeutic platforms.

         <title>Cover Picture: Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly as a Tool To Preserve the Electronic Purity of Perylene Diimide Chromophores (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 12/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular chromophore cube based on perylene diimides (PDIs) is reported by Sascha Feldmann and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202216729). The rigid and shape&#8208;persistent cage preserves the electronic purity of its PDI constituents and enables the observation of delayed fluorescence because of its bright excited multimer state, acting as an excitation reservoir. Self&#8208;assembly can thus serve as a powerful tool for controlling electronic properties in molecular electronics devices.

The photoreduction of monofluoroarenes is a challenge due to their high reduction potentials. In their Communication (e202218468), Zhi&#8208;Xiang Wang, Xiang&#8208;Yu Chen, and co&#8208;workers show that an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and tBuOK give a photoactive charge transfer complex that generates a highly reducing NHC radical anion, enabling the single&#8208;electron reduction of monofluoroarenes.

Porous and water&#8208;stable hybrid semiconductors as multifunctional materials display traits that are essential for demanding commercial applications. In their Research Article (e202218429), Ioannis Spanopoulos and co&#8208;workers report a strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide semiconductors by using molecular cages as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations. This strategy gave rise to a direct bandgap semiconductor with record water stability and selective vapor sorption.

         <title>A New PETase from the Human Saliva Metagenome and Its Functional Modification via Genetic Code Expansion in Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uttamapinant et&#8197;al. reported the discovery of new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degrading enzymes from aquatic and human saliva metagenomes. Their catalytic performance is up to 83 times higher than known PETases. Site&#8208;specific incorporation of an unnatural amino acid results in a stable acyl&#8208;enzyme intermediate and a PET&#8208;enzyme conjugate which can be imaged via confocal microscopy.







Abstract
The discovery and engineering of new plastic degrading enzymes is an important challenge in chemical biotechnology to enable transition to a more sustainable and circular plastics economy. This field has so far yielded a range of enzymes and microbial pathways for the recycling and valorization of plastic waste. New research from Uttamapinant et&#8197;al. reports the discovery of a novel polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase from the human saliva metagenome that displays improved properties and catalytic performance over previously characterized PET hydrolases (PETases). The authors also demonstrate the site&#8208;specific incorporation of a photocaged unnatural amino acid, 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid (DAP), which upon photodecaging enables covalent binding of DAP to the PET surface. Thus, this work highlights metagenomic datasets as an untapped source of new PET degrading enzymes and the chemical modification of PETases via genetic code expansion, enabling new biotechnologies for the circular plastics economy.

         <title>Gold Extracted from Wastewater as an Efficient MOF&#8208;Supported Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent work by Zhao and co&#8208;workers takes advantage of the versatility of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), to selectively recover gold from wastewater. More interestingly, the studied MOF serves as a stable platform to transform adsorbed gold into an efficient catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CO, reaching currents of more than 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The recovery of gold from wastewater is necessary from both environmental and economic standpoints. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can serve as high&#8208;capacity and selective adsorbents, as shown in a recent work by Zhao and co&#8208;workers. Their novel three&#8208;dimension cationic framework goes further than selectively adsorbing AuCl4&#8722;. It also serves as a stable platform to transform adsorbed gold into an efficient catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. This work highlights the versatility of MOFs, which can serve as selective adsorbents and as a support for nanoparticle catalysts.

         <title>Sustainable Design of Structural and Functional Polymers for a Circular Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and functional polymers provide functions, sustainability benefits, and CO2 savings during their use phase, but present challenges at end of life. Polymer science and adjacent disciplines can enable a circular economy of polymers via biodegradation or recycling through the application of strategies for molecular and system design that leverage the latest advances in the field.







Abstract
To achieve a sustainable circular economy, polymer production must start transitioning to recycled and biobased feedstock and accomplish CO2 emission neutrality. This is not only true for structural polymers, such as in packaging or engineering applications, but also for functional polymers in liquid formulations, such as adhesives, lubricants, thickeners or dispersants. At their end of life, polymers must be either collected and recycled via a technical pathway, or be biodegradable if they are not collectable. Advances in polymer chemistry and applications, aided by computational material science, open the way to addressing these issues comprehensively by designing for recyclability and biodegradability. This Review explores how scientific progress, together with emerging regulatory frameworks, societal expectations and economic boundary conditions, paint pathways for the transformation towards a circular economy of polymers.

         <title>Deciphering the Biological Activities of Antifungal Agents with Chemical Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rising percentage of fungal pathogens resistant to antifungal drugs and fungicides emphasizes the threat that they pose to animal and human health and global food security. This Minireview outlines the pivotal role of chemical biology in uncovering biological activities, detecting resistance, and in characterizing the interactions between antifungal agents and their targets.







Abstract
The growing number of fungal infections caused by pathogens resistant to one or more classes of antifungal drugs emphasizes the threat that these microorganisms pose to animal and human health and global food security. Open questions remain regarding the mechanisms of action of the limited repertoire of antifungal agents, making it challenging to rationally develop more efficacious therapeutics. In recent years, the use of chemical biology approaches has resolved some of these questions and has provided new promising concepts to guide the design of antifungal agents. By focusing on examples from studies carried out in recent years, this minireview describes the key roles that probes based on antifungal agents and their derivatives have played in uncovering details about their activities, in detecting resistance, and in characterizing the interactions between these agents and their targets.

         <title>Interfaces with Fluorinated Amphiphiles: Superstructures and Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated amphiphiles show interfacial properties distinctively different from ordinary nonfluorinated amphiphiles, such as unique and highly branched superstructures and better stabilization of microdroplets. Further fluorine&#8208;specific phenomena of fluorinated amphiphiles can be observed at solid/liquid interfaces, such as during their adsorption on fluorous adsorber materials or formation of amphiphobic surface coatings upon cross&#8208;linking.







Abstract
This Minireview discusses recent developments in research on the interfacial phenomena of fluorinated amphiphiles, with a focus on applications that exploit the unique and manifold interfacial properties associated with these amphiphiles. Most notably, fluorinated amphiphiles form stable aggregates with often distinctly different morphologies compared to their nonfluorinated counterparts. Consequently, fluorinated surfactants have found wide use in high&#8208;performance applications such as microfluidic&#8208;assisted screening. Additionally, their fluorine&#8208;specific behaviour at solid/liquid interfaces, such as the formation of superhydrophobic coatings after deposition on surfaces, will be discussed. As fluorinated surfactants and perfluorinated materials in general pose potential environmental threats, recent developments in their remediation based on their adsorption onto fluorinated surfaces will be evaluated.

         <title>Elastic Moduli: a Tool for Understanding Chemical Bonding and Thermal Transport in Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastic moduli are fundamentally connected to chemical bonding, making them a powerful tool for in&#8208;depth studies of trends in sound velocity and anharmonicity in thermoelectric materials.







Abstract
The elastic behavior of a material can be a powerful tool to decipher thermal transport. In thermoelectrics, measuring the elastic moduli&#8212;directly tied to sound velocity&#8212;is critical to understand trends in lattice thermal conductivity, as well as study bond anharmonicity and phase transitions, given the sensitivity of elastic moduli to the chemical bonding. In this review, we introduce the basics of elasticity and explain the origin of high&#8208;temperature lattice softening from a bonding perspective. We then review elasticity data throughout classes of thermoelectrics, and explore trends in sound velocity, anharmonicity, and thermal conductivity. We reveal how experimental sound velocities can improve the accuracy of common thermal conductivity models and present a critical discussion of Gr&#252;neisen parameter estimates from elastic moduli. Readers will be equipped with tools to leverage elasticity measurements or calculations to accurately interpret thermal transport trends.

         <title>Electronically Ambivalent Hydrodefluorination of Aryl&#8208;CF3 groups enabled by Electrochemical Deep&#8208;Reduction on a Ni Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general procedure for the direct mono&#8208; and di&#8208;hydrodefluorination of ArCF3 compounds. Exploiting the tunability of electrochemistry and the selectivity enabled by a Ni cathode, the deep reduction garners high selectivity with good to excellent yields up to gram scale. The late&#8208;stage peripheral editing of CF3 feedstocks to construct fluoromethyl moieties will aid the rapid diversification of lead&#8208;compounds and compound libraries.







Abstract
The Ar&#8208;CF2H moiety is featured in an increasing number of bioactive compounds due to its unique combination of properties. The hydrodefluorination of Ar&#8208;CF3 compounds is a direct and efficient route toward this motif. As reported methods for this transformation have focused on specific substrate families, herein we describe a general&#8212;electronically ambivalent&#8212;procedure for the single&#8208;step direct mono&#8208;hydrodefluorination of a variety of feedstock and functionalized Ar&#8208;CF3 compounds. Exploiting the inherent tunability of electrochemistry and the selectivity enabled by a Ni cathode, the deep reduction garners high selectivity for ArCF2H products, with good to excellent yields up to gram scale. The protocol has been extended to a single&#8208;step di&#8208;hydrodefluorination yielding benzyl fluorides. The late&#8208;stage peripheral editing of a single CF3 feedstock to construct fluoromethyl (CF2H, CFH2) moieties will aid the rapid diversification of lead&#8208;compounds and compound libraries.

         <title>Stereoselective Assembly of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Anionic Cages Dictated by Organophosphate&#8208;Based Chiral Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organophosphates are critically involved in biological signal transduction, and they can play a similar role in supramolecular systems. Organophosphates have now been utilized as chiral nodes to transfer asymmetry information to hydrogen&#8208;bonded anionic cages, with the supramolecular chirality readily modulated by encapsulated achiral guests, temperature, and protonation/deprotonation of the anions.







Abstract
Inspired by the signal transduction function of organophosphates in biological systems, bioactive organophosphates were utilized for the first time as chiral nodes to dictate the stereoselective assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded anionic cages. Phosphonomycin (antibiotics), tenofovir (antivirals), adenosine monophosphate (natural product, AMP) and clindamycin phosphate (antibiotics) were assembled with an achiral bis&#8208;monourea ligand, thereby leading to the stereoselective formation of quadruple or triple helicates. The extent of the stereoselectivity could be enhanced by either lowering the temperature or adding stronger&#8208;binding cations as templates. With the chiral anionic cages as the host, some enantioselectivity was achieved when binding chiral quaternary ammonium cations.

         <title>Easily Switchable 18&#960;&#8208;, 19&#960;&#8208;, and 20&#960;&#8208;Conjugation of Diazaporphyrin Double&#8208;Pincer Bispalladium Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
The reaction of NiII 3,7,13,17&#8208;tetrapyridyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrin with PdII ions has led to a highly twisted bispalladium complex, which shows an excellent ability to accept electrons and be readily reduced to a monocationic and a neutral species using weak reductants. A combination of spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations revealed that the palladium complexes exhibit aromaticity (dicationic state) and antiaromaticity (neutral state).







Abstract
NiII 3,7,13,17&#8208;tetrapyridyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrin serves as a double tridentate ligand to PdII ions to provide a pincer&#8208;type bispalladium complex. Electrochemical analysis revealed that the bispalladium complex shows excellent ability to accept electrons and reversible redox properties due to the coordination of the two cationic PdII centers to the meso&#8208;nitrogen atoms. We isolated and characterized one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction species of the bispalladium complex. The 20&#960; antiaromatic nature of the two&#8208;electron reduction species was confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis&#8208;near&#8208;IR (NIR) absorption spectra, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed highly twisted structures for the bispalladium complexes regardless of the oxidation state.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Single Electron Reduction of Mono&#8208;Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/tBuOK system was reported for the photoreduction of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes. Mechanistic studies suggest the generation of NHC radical anion as a potent reductant, and the Ar&#8722;F bond cleavage proceeds via a concerted mechanism, where single electron transfer, Ar&#8722;F bond cleavage and KF bond formation take place simultaneously.







Abstract
Fluoroarenes are abundant and readily available feedstocks. However, due to the high reduction potentials of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes, their photoreduction remains a continuing challenge, motivating the development of efficient activation modes to address this issue. This report presents the blue light&#8208;induced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed single electron reduction of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes for biaryl cross&#8208;couplings. We discovered that under blue light irradiation, NHC/tBuOK combination could construct powerful photoactive architectures to promote single electron transfer for Caryl&#8722;F bond reduction via forming highly reducing NHC radical anion. Notably, the strategy was also successful to reduce Caryl&#8722;O, Caryl&#8722;N, and Caryl&#8722;S bonds for biaryl cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Propargyl Alcohols as Bifunctional Reagents for Divergent Annulations of Biphenylamines via Dual C&#8722;H Functionalization/Dual Oxidative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed divergent and regioselective annulation of biphenylamines with propargyl alcohols (PAs) is demonstrated. These annulations run through an unsymmetrical dual C&#8722;H functionalization via a C&#8801;C bond cleavage, or through a dual oxidative cyclization. The method accommodates a wide range of PAs and showcases late&#8208;stage diversification of some natural products.







Abstract
The C&#8722;H functionalization strategy provides access to valuable molecules that previously required convoluted synthetic attempts. Dual C&#8722;H unsymmetrical functionalization, with a single bifunctional reagent, is an effective tactic. Propargyl alcohols (PAs), despite containing a reactive C&#8801;C bond, have not been explored as building blocks via oxidative cleavage. Annulations via C&#8722;H activation are a versatile and synthetically attractive strategy. We disclose PA as a new bifunctional reagent for unsymmetrical dual C&#8722;H functionalization of biphenylamine for regioselectively annulated outcomes. On tuning the conditions, the annulation bifurcated towards an unusual dual oxidative cyclization. This method accommodates a wide range of PAs and showcases late&#8208;stage diversification of some natural products.

         <title>Simultaneous Detection of L&#8208;Lactate and D&#8208;Glucose Using DNA Aptamers in Human Blood Serum
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly specific DNA aptamer for L&#8208;lactate with a Kd of around 0.4&#8197;mM was selected, showing binding even in 90&#8201;% human serum. Multiplexed detection of two highly related biomarkers, L&#8208;lactate and D&#8208;glucose, was achieved in the same sample by using aptamer sensors labeled with different fluorophores.







Abstract
L&#8208;lactate is a key metabolite indicative of physiological states, glycolysis pathways, and various diseases such as sepsis, heart attack, lactate acidosis, and cancer. Detection of lactate has been relying on a few enzymes that need additional oxidants. In this work, DNA aptamers for L&#8208;lactate were obtained using a library&#8208;immobilization selection method and the highest affinity aptamer reached a Kd of 0.43&#8197;mM as determined using isothermal titration calorimetry. The aptamers showed up to 50&#8208;fold selectivity for L&#8208;lactate over D&#8208;lactate and had little responses to other closely related analogs such as pyruvate or 3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate. A fluorescent biosensor based on the strand displacement method showed a limit of detection of 0.55&#8197;mM L&#8208;lactate, and the sensor worked in 90&#8201;% serum. Simultaneous detection of L&#8208;lactate and D&#8208;glucose in the same solution was achieved. This work has broadened the scope of aptamers to simple metabolites and provided a useful probe for continuous and multiplexed monitoring.

         <title>Homochiral versus Heterochiral Dimeric Helical Foldamer Bundles: Chlorinated&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic foldamer helices form stable head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimers in solution and in the solid state mediated by linear arrays of hydrogen bonds. The preference for dimerization between helices with opposite or identical handedness can be quantitatively reversed by the choice of chlorinated solvent.







Abstract
Aromatic oligoamide sequences programmed to fold into stable helical conformations were designed to display a linear array of hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors at their surface. Sequences were prepared by solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Solution 1H NMR spectroscopic studies and solid&#8208;state crystallographic structures demonstrated the formation of stable hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated dimeric helix bundles that could be either heterochiral (with a P and an M helix) or homochiral (with two P or two M helices). Formation of the hetero&#8208; or homochiral dimers could be driven quantitatively using different chlorinated solvents&#8212;exemplifying a remarkable case of either social or narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting or upon imposing absolute handedness to the helices to forbid PM species.

         <title>In Situ Probing and Identification of Electrochemical Reaction Intermediates by Floating Electrolytic Electrospray Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Floating electrolytic electrospray ionization provided a general solution for the in situ monitoring and characterization of electrochemical reaction intermediates by mass spectrometry. Its successful application in discovery and identification of active nitrene intermediates during electrochemical processes proved this platform a powerful tool for reaction&#8208;mechanism studies in the future.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study of electrochemical (EC) synthesis can require a powerful mass spectrometry (MS) analytical platform which can discover and identify fleeting intermediates in EC reactions. Here we report a floating electrolytic electrospray ionization (FE&#8208;ESI) strategy that can perform EC processes in a floating electrolytic cell and monitor intermediates by high&#8208;resolution MS. Compared with previous EC&#8208;MS methods, a significant advantage of FE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS is that it allows one to modulate the electrolytic and electrospray process individually, ensuring its high sensitivity in discovering intermediates and universality to investigate redox reactions in different scenarios. This powerful platform has been successfully used to investigate the EC reductive coupling of p&#8208;tolylboronic acid and p&#8208;nitrotoluene. A series of nitrene intermediates were discovered and identified by FE&#8208;ESI&#8208;MS, indicating that a hidden mechanism involving nitrene formation might play a key role in EC reductive coupling process.

         <title>Merging Copper(I) Photoredox Catalysis and Iodine(III) Chemistry for the Oxy&#8208;monofluoromethylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Bis(monofluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene, an efficient and alternative reagent for radical monofluoromethylation under visible&#8208;light copper(I) photoredox catalysis, provides access to CH2F&#8208;containing organic compounds. The broad utility of this radical monofluoromethylating reagent in alkene oxy&#8208;monofluoromethylation reactions, including for the synthesis of fluoromethylated amino acid derivatives and heterocycles, is demonstrated.







Abstract
A simple process for the oxy&#8208;monofluoromethylation of alkenes is described. In combination with visible&#8208;light copper(I) photoredox catalysis, an easily accessible iodine(III) reagent containing monofluoroacetoxy ligands serves as a powerful source of a monofluoromethyl (CH2F) radical, enabling the step economical synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;acetates from a broad range of olefinic substrates under mild conditions. Applications to late&#8208;stage diversification of alkenes derived from complex molecules, amino acids and the synthesis of fluoromethylated heterocycles are also demonstrated.

         <title>Medium&#8208;Ring Strategy Enables Multiple Resonance Emitters with Twisted Geometry and Fast Spin&#8208;Flip to Suppress Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The medium&#8208;ring molecular design strategy enables the first example of blue multi&#8208;resonance emitter with radiative decay rate (kR) as fast as 108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) as fast as 106&#8197;s&#8722;1 simultaneously. It exhibits superior electroluminescence performance with high efficiency and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Suppressing aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect and reducing device efficiency roll&#8208;off are both crucial yet challenging for multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters. Herein, we put forward a medium&#8208;ring strategy to design efficient MR emitters that feature heptagonal tribenzo[b,d,f]azepine (TBA) donors. The highly twisted conformation enlarges the intermolecular distances between the MR&#8208;emitting cores, and thus suppresses ACQ effect. Meanwhile, the introduction of heptagonal donors enhances spin&#8208;orbital coupling, so as to accelerate reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. This medium&#8208;ring strategy gives rise to the first example of blue MR emitter that simultaneously possesses radiative decay rate as fast as 108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and RISC rate as fast as 106&#8197;s&#8722;1. Accordingly, DTBA&#8208;B2N3 enables to assemble high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 30.9&#8201;% and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000: 20.5&#8201;%).

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Surfactant&#8208;Polyoxovanadate Soft Materials as Tuneable Vanadium Oxide Cathode Precursors for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decavanadate anions self&#8208;assemble with a dicationic surfactant to form ordered arrays which, when calcined, yield highly crystalline V2O5. In contrast, calcination of alkylammonium decavanadate leads to smaller V2O5 crystallites. The systems show contrasting, topology&#8208;dependent performance as cathode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries, offering a route to the controlled preparation of V2O5 electrode materials that balance energy and rate performance.







Abstract
The mixing of [V10O28]6&#8722; decavanadate anions with a dicationic gemini surfactant (gem) leads to the spontaneous self&#8208;assembly of surfactant&#8208;templated nanostructured arrays of decavanadate clusters. Calcination of the material under air yields highly crystalline, sponge&#8208;like V2O5 (gem&#8208;V2O5). In contrast, calcination of the amorphous tetrabutylammonium decavanadate allows isolation of a more agglomerated V2O5 consisting of very small crystallites (TBA&#8208;V2O5). Electrochemical analysis of the materials&#8217; performance as lithium&#8208;ion intercalation electrodes highlights the role of morphology in cathode performance. The large crystallites and long&#8208;range microstructure of the gem&#8208;V2O5 cathode deliver higher initial capacity and superior capacity retention than TBA&#8208;V2O5. The smaller crystallite size and higher surface area of TBA&#8208;V2O5 allow faster lithium insertion and superior rate performance to gem&#8208;V2O5.

         <title>Selective Removal of Sulfate from Water by Precipitation with a Rigid Bis&#8208;amidinium Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A readily prepared bis&#8208;amidinium compound can achieve near quantitative precipitation of SO42&#8722; from water with complete selectivity over a range of other anions. The precipitant functions by fully dehydrating the sulfate anion and surrounding it with eight charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A simple, readily prepared biphenyl bis&#8208;amidinium compound (1&#8901;Cl2) is able to selectively precipitate sulfate from water. The precipitant is effective at concentrations as low as 1&#8197;mM and shows complete selectivity against monovalent anions, and high selectivity even against CO32&#8722; and HPO42&#8722;. It is highly effective (&gt;90&#8201;% sulfate removed) in both seawater and highly acidic conditions relevant to mining waste&#8208;streams. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals that 1&#8901;SO4 forms a tightly packed, anhydrous, structure where each sulfate anion receives eight hydrogen bonds from amidinium N&#8722;H hydrogen bond donors.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Promoted Intramolecular para&#8208;Cycloadditions on Simple Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first synthesis of bridged bicycles through the dearomatization of sterically and electronically unbiased aryl fragments. The visible&#8208;light promoted method occurs at room temperature and has ample functional&#8208;group tolerance. The key to the difunctionalization of the aryl partner is the use of naphthalene as an additive, which stabilizes transient (bi)radicals through its extended &#960; cloud. This effect might lead to its broad use in radical sequences.







Abstract
Dearomative cycloadditions are a powerful tool to access a large chemical space exploiting simple and ubiquitous building blocks. The energetic burden due to the loss of aromaticity has however greatly limited their synthetic potential. We devised a general intramolecular method that overcomes these limitations thanks to the photosensitization of allenamides. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted process gives complex [2.2.2]&#8208;(hetero)&#8208;bicyclooctadienes at room temperature, likely through the stabilization of transient (bi)radicals by naphthalene. The reaction tolerates several valuable functionalities, offering a convenient handle for a myriad of applications, including original isoindoles and metal complexes.

         <title>Molecular Level Modulation of Anthraquinone&#8208;containing Resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde Resin Photocatalysts for H2O2 Production with Exceeding 1.2&#8201;% Efficiency</title>

Electron&#8208;deficient 1,4&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ) molecules were adopted to modulate the donor/acceptor ratio in resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) resin at the molecular level. The RF&#8208;DHAQ with matching donor and acceptor displays enhanced charge separation ability, lower energy barrier and overall photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by dual&#8208;pathway with solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency exceeding 1.2&#8201;%.







Abstract
Designing polymeric photocatalysts at the molecular level to modulate the photogenerated charge behavior is a promising and challenging strategy for efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis. Here, we introduce electron&#8208;deficient 1,4&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ) into the framework of resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) resin, which modulates the donor/acceptor ratio from the perspective of molecular design for promoting the charge separation. Interestingly, H2O2 can be produced via oxygen reduction and water oxidation pathways, verified by isotopic labeling and in situ characterization techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that DHAQ can reduce the energy barrier for H2O2 production. RF&#8208;DHAQ exhibits excellent overall photosynthesis of H2O2 with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency exceeding 1.2&#8201;%. This work opens a new avenue to design polymeric photocatalysts at the molecular level for high&#8208;efficiency artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Electroreduction of CO2 on Au(310)@Cu High&#8208;index Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 12, March 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au(310)@Cu truncated ditetragonal prisms (DTPs) enhance the activity and selectivity for CO2 electromethanation. Elemental mapping analysis shows Cu surface layers are uniformly distributed on the Au {310} facets of the DTPs. Operando Fourier transform infrared spectra show reactive adsorbed *CO as the main intermediate. CO stripping experiments reveal the high&#8208;index facets enhance the *CO formation followed by rapid desorption or hydrogenation.







Abstract
The chemical selectivity and faradaic efficiency of high&#8208;index Cu facets for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is investigated. More specifically, shape&#8208;controlled nanoparticles enclosed by Cu {hk0} facets are fabricated using Cu multilayer deposition at three distinct layer thicknesses on the surface facets of Au truncated ditetragonal nanoprisms (Au DTPs). Au DTPs are shapes enclosed by 12 high&#8208;index {310} facets. Facet angle analysis confirms DTP geometry. Elemental mapping analysis shows Cu surface layers are uniformly distributed on the Au {310} facets of the DTPs. The 7&#8197;nm Au@Cu DTPs high&#8208;index {hk0} facets exhibit a CH4&#8201;:&#8201;CO product ratio of almost 10&#8201;:&#8201;1 compared to a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio for the reference 7&#8197;nm Au@Cu nanoparticles (NPs). Operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra disclose reactive adsorbed *CO as the main intermediate, whereas CO stripping experiments reveal the high&#8208;index facets enhance the *CO formation followed by rapid desorption or hydrogenation.
