      <title>Using the Thiyl Radical for Aliphatic Hydrogen Atom Transfer: Thiolation of Unactivated C&#8211;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free thiyl radical&#8208;mediated activation of alkanes is described. Tetrafluoropyridinyl disulfide is used to perform thiolation of the C&#8211;H bonds under irradiation with 400 nm light emitting diodes. The key C&#8211;H activation step is believed to proceed via hydrogen atom abstraction effected by the fluorinated thiyl radical. Secondary, tertiary and heteroatom&#8208;substituted C&#8211;H bonds can be involved into the thiolation reaction.

      <title>Ultralow lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature in Cu4TiSe4</title>
      <dc:description>Ultralow thermal conductivity draws great attention in a variety of fields of applications such as themoelectics, thermal barrier coating, etc. Herein, crystal structure and transport properties of Cu  4  TiSe  4  is reported.Cu  4  TiSe  4  is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19 W m  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;1  at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics. This ultralow value of lattice thermal conductivity(k  L  ) can be attributed to the presence of the localized modes of Cu which partially hybridized with the Se atoms, which in turn leads to avoid crossing of acoustic phonon modes that reaches the zone boundary with a reduced frequency. Like a phonon glass electron crystal, Cu  4  TiSe  4  could also open the route for the finding of efficient thermoelectric materials, even, with chalcogenides of relatively high electrical resistivity and a large band gap, providing that their structures offer a sublattice with lightly bound cations.</dc:description>

      <title>Giant Optical Anisotropy in the UV&#8208;Transparent 2D Nonlinear Optical Material Sc(IO3)2(NO3)</title>
      <dc:description>Birefringence is a fundamental optical property for linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Thus far, it has proved to be very difficult to engineer large birefringence in optical crystals functioning in the UV region. Herein, we report the first 2D rare&#8208;earth iodate&#8208;nitrate crystal Sc(IO3)2(NO3) (SINO), which is shown to exhibit giant optical anisotropy. Air&#8208;stable SINO possesses a short UV absorption edge (298 nm), a strong NLO response (4.0 times that of benchmark KH2PO4) for the nitrate family, and the largest birefringence (&#916;n&#160;= 0.348 at 546 nm) of inorganic oxide optical crystals. The unusually large birefringence and NLO response can be attributed to an optimized 2D layered structure, combined with highly polarizable and anisotropic building units [IO3]&#8722;&#160;and [NO3]&#8722;. These findings will facilitate development of UV linear and NLO materials with giant optical anisotropy, and promote their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Due to their unique active movement ability, micro/nanomotors have brought about the possibility of breaking through the limitations of traditional passive drug delivery system for the treatment of many diseases, attracting more and more attention of researchers. However, at present, the realization of many advantages of micro/nanomotors in disease treatment  in vivo  is still in their infancy, which is caused by the complexity and particularity of diseases in different parts of human body. In this review, firstly, we focus on the biosafety and functionality of micro/nanomotors as a biomedical treatment system. Then, we address the treatment difficulties of various diseases  in vivo  (such as ophthalmic disease, orthopedic disease, gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer), and then review the research progress of biomedical micro/nanomotors in the past 20 years, Finally, we propose the challenges faced in this field and possible future development directions.</dc:description>

      <title>Vinyl and Alkynyl Triazenes: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Vinyl and alkynyl triazenes have emerged as highly versatile reagents in organic synthesis. The electron&#8208;donating character of the triazene function activates the triple bond of alkynyl triazenes, thereby facilitating addition, cyclization, annulation and rearrangement reactions. Vinyl triazenes, on the other hand, are convenient precursors for vinyl cations, and they can be converted via addition reactions into alkyl triazenes.







Abstract
Aromatic compounds containing triazenyl groups (N3RR&#8242;) have a profound impact on synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry. In contrast, the chemistry of vinyl and alkynyl triazenes was a largely uncharted territory until recently. The situation has changed over the last five years, and it has become apparent that vinyl and alkynyl triazenes are highly interesting compounds with a unique reactivity. The electron&#8208;donating properties of the triazenyl group provide alkynyl triazenes with an ynamide&#8208;like reactivity, which can be exploited in reactions of the triple bond. Vinyl triazenes, on the other hand, can be used for electrophilic vinylation reactions. The foundation for this new triazene chemistry are synthetic pathways which allow preparing vinyl and alkynyl triazenes in few steps from readily available starting materials. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments in this area.

      <title>The Network of Replication, Transcription, and Reverse Transcription of a Synthetic Genetic Cassette</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic nucleic acids, with four non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, can function as genetic materials. A comprehensive analysis of PCR amplification, transcription, reverse transcription, and cloning was done to screen for alternative genetic monomers. A small library of six modified nucleobases was selected: the modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (dZTPs) and ribonucleoside (rZTPs) triphosphates of 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;adenine, 5&#8208;chlorouracil, 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;guanine or inosine together with 5&#8208;fluorocytosine or 5&#8208;bromocytosine. The fragments composed of one to four modified nucleotides (denoted as DZA) have been successfully recognised and transcribed to natural or modified RNA (denoted as RZA) by T7 RNA polymerase. The fully modified RZA fragment could be reverse transcribed and then amplified in the presence of various dZTPs. Noticeably, modified fragments could function as genetic templates  in vivo  by encoding the 678 base pair gene of a fluorescent protein in bacteria. These results demonstrate the existence of a fully simulated genetic circuit that uses synthetic materials.</dc:description>

      <title>A 34&#8208;Electron Superatom Ag78 Cluster with Regioselective Ternary Ligands Shells and Its 2D Rhombic Superlattice Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>The coverage of surface ligands has important influence on the formation, structure and properties of atomically precise metal nanoclusters.  Herein, we report a 78&#8208;nuclei silver nanocluster [Ag  78  (  i  PrPhS)  30  (dppm)  10  Cl  10  ]  4+  (  SD/Ag78a  ; dppm = bis&#8208;(diphenyphosphino)methane) that is synthesized by one&#8208;pot reaction using [Ag(pz)]  n  as precursor (Hpz = pyrazole) and further characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.  SD/Ag78a  shows a core&#8208;shell structure comprised of an all&#8208;metallic Ag  53  kernel surrounded by an Ag  25  discontinuous metal&#8208;organic shell. The Ag  53  kernel is an Ag  13  Inodecahedron encaged by an Ag  40  drum&#8208;like shell, while the Ag  25  shell consists of two Ag  10  S  10  P  10  Cl  5  rings and five S&#8208;Ag&#8208;S staples. Three types of ligands regioselectively cap on the surface of the Ag  78  nanocluster, forming diverse metal&#8208;ligand interfacial structures such as  S&#8208;Ag&#8208;S staples, Cl&#8208;capped Ag  3  trigons and S&#8208;capped Ag  4  tetragons.  This nanocluster is a closed&#8208;shell 34&#8208;electron superatom with +4 charge state and shows highly featured molecule&#8208;like absorption spectra in the ultraviolet&#8208;visible region with a maximum around 493 nm. The rhombic superlattice assembled from  SD/Ag78a  through intercluster C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions can be formed by a simple drop&#8208;casting treatment.

      <title>Ultrathin Porous Carbon Nitride Bundles with an Adjustable Energy Band Structure toward Simultaneous Solar Photocatalytic Water Splitting and Selective Phenylcarbinol Oxidation</title>

ACN has adjustable band gaps (2.25 eV ~ 2.75 eV) and hollow microtubes with ultrathin pore walls, which enrich reaction sites, improve visible&#8208;light absorption and enhance charge separation. In the presence of phenylcarbinol, ACN exhibited excellent pure water&#8208;splitting ability (95.3 &#956;mol/h) and in the meanwhile phenylcarbinol was selectively oxidized to benzaldehyde (conversion of 90.9%, selectivity of 99.7%) under solar irradiation. For the concurrent reactions,  2  D isotope labeling, separation and detection were conducted to confirm that the proton source of released hydrogen is water. Further, we theorized the mechanism of water splitting and phenylcarbinol oxidation and hope that it provides inspiration for simultaneous utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes in one system.</dc:description>

      <title>Inverting the enantiopreference of nitrilase&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric hydrolysis of prochiral dinitriles by reshaping the binding pocket with a &#8220;mirror&#8208;image&#8221; strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrilase&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric hydrolysis of prochiral dinitriles is an attractive method for the synthesis of chiral cyanocarboxylic acids, the precursors to pharmaceutically important g&#8208;amino acids. However, the tested nitrilases towards 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or aryl substituted glutaronitriles mostly generate ( S  )&#8208;configurated cyanocarboxylic acids. Herein a &#8220;mirror&#8208;image&#8221; strategy, i.e. symmetry analysis of substrate&#8208;binding pocket, was applied to identify two key amino acid residues W170 and V198 that possibly modulate the enantiopreference of a nitrilase from Synechocystis  sp. PCC6803 towards 3&#8208;isobutyl glutaronitrile ( 1a  ). Exchange of these two residues resulted in the enantiopreference inversion ( S  , 90% ee  to R  , 47% ee  ). By further reshaping the substrate&#8208;binding pocket via routine site&#8208;saturation and combinatorial mutagenesis, variant E8 with higher activity and stereoselectivity (99% ee  , R  ) was obtained. The mutant enzyme was applied in the preparation of optically pure ( R  )&#8208;3&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;4&#8208;cyanobutanoic acid (( R  )&#8208; 2a  ), and showed similar stereopreference inversion towards a series of 3&#8208;substituted glutaronitriles. This study may offer a general strategy to switch the stereopreference of other nitrilases and other classes of enzymes toward the desymmetric reactions of prochiral substrates with two identical reactive functional groups, that are often desirable in asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Evidence of Highly Anharmonic Soft Lattice Vibrations in Zintl Rattler</title>
      <dc:description>Phonons are collective excitations from a periodic lattice and are the primary carriers of heat in an insulating crystalline solid. The extent of periodicity in a crystalline lattice is ensured by local chemical bonding, thereby, understanding the correlation between local structure and lattice dynamics is crucial in realizing intrinsically low thermal conductivity. Here, we present lattice dynamics associated with the local chemical bonding hierarchy in Zintl compound TlInTe  2  , which cause intriguing phonon excitations and strongly suppress the lattice thermal conductivity to an ultralow value (0.46 &#8208; 0.31 W/mK) in the 300&#8208;673 K. We established an intrinsic rattling nature in TlInTe  2  by studying the local structure and phonon vibrations using synchrotron X&#8208;ray Pair Distribution Function (PDF) (100 &#8211; 503 K) and Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) (5 &#8211; 450 K), respectively. We showed that while 1D chain of covalently bonded [InTe2](&#8208;n) (n)&#160; transport heat with Debye type phonon excitation, ionically bonded Tl rattles with a frequency ~30 cm  &#8208;1  inside distorted Thompson cage formed by&#160;[InTe2](&#8208;n) (n) . This highly anharmonic Tl rattling causes strong phonon scattering and consequently phonon lifetime reduces to ultralow value ~0.66(6) ps, which resulted ultralow thermal conductivity in TlInTe  2  .</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Phonons are collective excitations from a periodic lattice and are the primary carriers of heat in an insulating crystalline solid. The extent of periodicity in a crystalline lattice is ensured by local chemical bonding, thereby, understanding the correlation between local structure and lattice dynamics is crucial in realizing intrinsically low thermal conductivity. Here, we present lattice dynamics associated with the local chemical bonding hierarchy in Zintl compound TlInTe  2  , which cause intriguing phonon excitations and strongly suppress the lattice thermal conductivity to an ultralow value (0.46 &#8208; 0.31 W/mK) in the 300&#8208;673 K.

Moreover, the WPU film with DTDA exhibited a maximum recovery of 100% virgin mechanical properties after reprocessing for 4 times.

      <title>Phosphine Carboxylate &#8211; Probing the Edge of Stability of a Carbon Dioxide Adduct with Dihydrogenphosphide</title>
      <dc:description>We present a new adduct of carbon dioxide with dihydrogenphosphide, that may be prepared either by direct reaction of NaPH  2  with carbon dioxide or by hydrolysis of the phosphaethynolate ion (PCO  &#8211;  ). In this latter transformation, a new mechanism is proposed for the electrophilic reactivity of the phosphaethynolate ion. The resulting anion is shown to be a weak but stable adduct of carbon dioxide, reminiscent of transition&#8208;metal carbon dioxide complexes. Protonation to form phosphine carboxylic acid (PH  2  COOH) and functionalization to form esters is shown to increase the strength of the P&#8211;C interaction, allowing for comparisons to be drawn between this species and the analogous carbamic (NH  2  COOH) and carbonic acids (H  2  CO  3  ). Functionalization of the oxygen atom is found to stabilize the phosphine carboxylate while also allowing solubility in organic solvents whereas phosphorus functionalization is shown to facilitate decarboxylation. Substituent migration occurs in some cases.</dc:description>

      <title>Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) Functionalized with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene as Robust and Conductive Ligands to Stabilize Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>Due to their excellent stability and conductivity,  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have attracted great attention as versatile ligands for the functionalization of macroscopic gold surfaces.

      <title>Pairwise Proximity&#8208;differentiated Visualization of Single&#8208;cell DNA Epigenetic Marks</title>
      <dc:description>Spatial positioning and proximity of DNA epigenetic marks are fundamental to a deeper understanding of gene regulation and chromatin architecture. However, it remains poorly explored and technically challenging. Here we report pairwise proximity&#8208;differentiated visualization of single&#8208;cell 5&#8208;formylcytosine (5fC) and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). These two marks on chromatin in fixed cells are successively labeled and crosslinked with their DNA primer probes via click chemistry. Based on a pairwise proximity&#8208;differentiated mechanism, proximal 5fC/5hmC sites firstly and residual 5fC or 5hmC sites then are encoded with respective circularized barcodes. These barcodes are simultaneously amplified for multiplexed single&#8208;molecule imaging. Thus we demonstrate differentiated visualization of 5fC or 5hmC spatial positioning and their pairwise proximity in single cells. Such multi&#8208;level subcellular information may provide insights into regulation functions and mechanisms of chromatin modifications, and the spatial proximity can expose the potential crosstalk or interaction between their reader proteins.</dc:description>

More importantly, its discovery revealed a whole class of amino/imino ribonucleoside artifacts that are generated during RNA hydrolysis under ammonium&#8208;buffered mild basic conditions. We then identified digestion conditions that can reduce or eliminate their formation.

More importantly, its discovery revealed a whole class of amino/imino ribonucleoside artifacts that are generated during RNA hydrolysis under ammonium&#8208;buffered mild basic conditions. We then identified digestion conditions that can reduce or eliminate their formation. The discovery of such a class of artifacts will eliminate their misidentification as naturally occurring ribonucleosides, helping to improve the accurate detection of new RNA modifications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Structural Basis of Cav1.1 Modulation by Dihydropyridine Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines (DHP), the most commonly used antihypertensives, function by inhibiting the L&#8208;type voltage&#8208;gated Ca  2+  (Ca  v  ) channels. DHP compounds exhibit chirality&#8208;specific antagonistic or agonistic effects. The structure of rabbit Ca  v  1.1 bound to an achiral drug nifedipine reveals the general binding mode for DHP drugs, but the molecular basis for chiral specificity remains elusive. Here, we report five cryo&#8208;EM structures of nanodisc&#8208;embedded Ca  v  1.1 in the presence of the bestselling drug amlodipine, a DHP antagonist (  R  )&#8208;(+)&#8208;Bay K8644, and a titration of its agonistic enantiomer (  S  )&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;Bay K8644 at resolutions of 2.9&#8208;3.4 &#197;. The amlodipine&#8208;bound structure reveals the molecular basis for the high efficacy of the drug. All structures with the addition of the Bay K8644 enantiomers exhibit similar inactivated conformations, suggesting that (  S  )&#8208;(&#8208;)&#8208;Bay K8644, when acting as an agonist, is insufficient to lock the activated state of the channel for a prolonged duration.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Tuning the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom active sites via engineering atomic configuration is an effective strategy to boost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but still remains challenging because of the lack of rational guidance and effective methods. Here, we demonstrate the correlation between atomic configuration induced electronic density of single&#8208;atom Co active sites and ORR performance by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrochemical analysis.

As predicted, Co 1  &#8208;N 3  PS/HC exhibits outstanding alkaline ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.920 V and superior ORR kinetics with record&#8208;level kinetic current and ultralow Tafel slope of 31 mV dec &#8208;1  , exceeding the Pt/C and almost all non&#8208;precious ORR electrocatalysts.

      <title>Bunsen the Geochemist: Icelandic Volcanism, Geyser Theory, and Gas, Rock and Mineral Analyses</title>
      <dc:description>
Bunsen classified volcanic rocks in two types, trachytic and pyroxenic (today felsic and mafic) based on their chemical analyses. He explained the mechanism of geyser action. He refuted the widespread idea that volcanoes and geysers were connected with the sea, and that masses of common salt were produced in eruptions. He pioneered gas analysis by means of the eudiometer. He was a vehement inductive empiricist, vigorously rejecting hypotheses.







Abstract
Following the eruption of Hekla in 1845&#8211;1846 Bunsen was invited by King Christian VIII of Denmark and Iceland to participate in a geochemical expedition to Iceland together with the geologist Sartorius von Waltershausen and the physiologist Carl Bergmann from G&#246;ttingen. The French mineralogist Des Cloizeaux went to Iceland separately and joined the expedition. The eudiometer invented by Bunsen was crucial for his accurate characterization of volcanic gases and determination of the composition of mixtures. His analyses of the chemical compositions of numerous rocks and minerals led him to the classification of two fundamental rock types, the more silica rich (nowadays called felsic) and the less silica rich, more basic (mafic) in agreement with Des Cloizeaux and the Danish scientist J.&#8197;C. Schythe. Bunsen also formulated the correct mechanism of geyser action and helped disband the theory of connections between geysers, volcanoes and the sea. He disagreed vehemently with Waltershausen over the mechanisms of formation of sal ammoniac and of volcanic rocks and their chemical compositions. He revealed himself as an ardent experimentalist vigorously opposed to hypotheses of any kind, which also made him dismiss the new chemical theories, for example, those of Dumas and Kekul&#233;.

      <title>Synthesis of a pentasaccharide repeating unit of lipopolysaccharide derived from virulent E. coli O1 and identification of a glycotope candidate of avian pathogenetic E. coli O1</title>
      <dc:description>Avian pathogenic  Escherichia coli  (APEC) is a common bacterial pathogen infecting chickens, resulting in economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. In particular, APEC O1, one of the most common serotypes of APEC, is considered problematic due to its zoonotic potential. Therefore, many attempts have been made to develop an effective vaccine against APEC O1. In fact, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O&#8208;antigen of APEC O1 has been shown to be a potent antigen for inducing specific protective immune responses. However, the detailed structure of the O&#8208;antigen of APEC O1 is not clear. The present study demonstrates the first synthesis of a pentasaccharide repeating unit of LPS, &#946;&#8208;  d  &#8208;Man  p  NAc&#8208;(1,2)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;  l  &#8208;Rha  p  &#8208;(1,3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;  l  &#8208;Rha  p  &#8208;(1,3)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;  l  &#8208;Rha  p  &#8208;(1,4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;  d  &#8208;Glc  p  NAc, derived from virulent  E. coli  O1 and its conjugate with BSA. ELISA tests revealed that the semi&#8208;synthetic glycoconjugate effectively binds to antibodies in the chicken serum, which were obtained after immunization with APEC O1, competitively with LPS of APEC O1. These results indicate that the pentasaccharide is a glycotope candidate of APEC O1, with great potential as an antigen for vaccine development.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosting the Energy Density of Aqueous Batteries via Facile Grotthuss Proton Transport</title>
      <dc:description>The recent developments in rechargeable aqueous batteries have witnessed a burgeoning interest in the mechanism of proton transport in the cathode materials. Herein, for the first time, we report the Grotthuss proton transport mechanism in &#945;&#8208;MnO  2  which features wide [2&#215;2] tunnels. Exemplified by the substitution doping of Ni (~5 at.%) in &#945;&#8208;MnO  2  that increases the energy density of the electrode by ~25%, we reveal a close link between the tetragonal&#8208;orthorhombic (TO) distortion of the lattice and the diffusion kinetics of protons in the tunnels. Experimental and theoretical results verify that Ni dopants can exacerbate the TO distortion during discharge, thereby facilitating the hydrogen bond formation in bulk &#945;&#8208;MnO  2  . The isolated direct hopping mode of proton transport is switched to a facile concerted mode, which involves the formation and concomitant cleavage of O&#8208;H bonds in a proton array, namely via Grotthuss proton transport mechanism. Our study provides important insight towards the understanding of proton transport in MnO  2  and can serve as a model for the compositional design of cathode materials for rechargeable aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Effect of Particle Wettability and Particle Concentration on the Enzymatic Dehydration of n&#8208;Octanaloxime in Pickering Emulsions</title>
      <dc:description>Pickering emulsion systems have emerged as platforms for the synthesis of organic molecules in biphasic biocatalysis. Herein, the catalytic performance was evaluated for biotransformation using whole cells exemplified for the dehydration of  n  &#8208;octanaloxime to  n  &#8208;octanenitrile catalysed by an aldoxime dehydratase (OxdB) overexpressed in  E. coli  . This study was carried out in Pickering emulsions stabilised solely with silica particles of different hydrophobicity. We correlate, for the first time, the properties of the emulsions with the conversion of the reaction, thus gaining an insight into the impact of the particle wettability and particle concentration. When comparing two emulsions of different type with similar stability and droplet diameter, the oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (o/w) system displayed a higher conversion than the water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (w/o) system, despite the conversion in both cases being higher than that in a &#8220;classic&#8221; two&#8208;phase system. Furthermore, an increase in particle concentration prior to emulsification resulted in an increase of the interfacial area and hence a higher conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling Ultra&#8208;Large Optical Asymmetry in Amorphous Molecular Aggregations</title>
      <dc:description>Although ultra&#8208;large optical asymmetry appears in crystalline materials, distractions from the mesoscopic ordering often causes inauthenticity in chiropticity. In addition, the formation and maintenance of crystalline states require complicated technical efforts. In amorphous materials, however, it remained challenging and elusive to achieve large chiropticity, not to mention the control of the degree of asymmetry. Herein, we report the quantitative control of chiral amplification, on amorphous supramolecular structures of cholesteryl&#8208;linked bis(dipyrrinato)zinc(II), to an exceptionally high level. The amorphous molecular aggregations of these complex building blocks exhibit mirror&#8208;image chiropticity. A proper chiral packing of the building block at several molecular scale contributes considerably to the absorptive dissymmetry factor g  abs  , although the system is overall disordered. The intense and tunable aggregation strength renders a variable g  abs  value up to +0.10 and +0.31 in the solution and in film state, higher than those observed in most previously reported cases. On this basis, a superior ON&#8208;OFF switching of chiropticity is realized under external stimuli. By eliminating the demand on material crystallinity, this work establishes a general design principle to control over ultra&#8208;large optical asymmetry on a wider scope of chiral materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Chemiluminescent Probes with a Record Long Near&#8208;infrared Turn&#8208;on Wavelength for In vivo Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Chemiluminescence imaging is imperative for diagnostics and imaging due to its intrinsically high sensitivity. To improve in vivo detection of biomarkers, chemiluminophores that simultaneously possess near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and modular structures amenable to construction of activatable probes are highly desired, which however are rare. We herein report two chemiluminophores with record long NIR emission (&gt; 750 nm) via integration of dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;benzothiopyran or dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;benzoselenopyran with dioxetane unit. Caging of the chemiluminophores with different cleavable moieties leads to NIR chemiluminescence probes (NCP  S  ) that only activate signals upon reaction with reactive oxygen species or enzymes with the tissue&#8208;penetration depth up to 2 cm. Particularly, NCP  Sg  can trigger its chemiluminescence at 760 nm for sensitive detection of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (a cancer biomarker), allowing to image and differentiate the expression levels of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase in different cancer cells in living mouse. Thus, this study provides NIR chemiluminescence molecular scaffolds applicable for in vivo turn&#8208;on imaging of versatile biomarkers in deep tissues.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemiluminescence imaging is imperative for diagnostics and imaging due to its intrinsically high sensitivity. To improve in vivo detection of biomarkers, chemiluminophores that simultaneously possess near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and modular structures amenable to construction of activatable probes are highly desired, which however are rare. We herein report two chemiluminophores with record long NIR emission (&amp;gt; 750 nm) via integration of dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;benzothiopyran or dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;benzoselenopyran with dioxetane unit. Caging of the chemiluminophores with different cleavable moieties leads to NIR chemiluminescence probes (NCP  S  ) that only activate signals upon reaction with reactive oxygen species or enzymes with the tissue&#8208;penetration depth up to 2 cm. Particularly, NCP  Sg  can trigger its chemiluminescence at 760 nm for sensitive detection of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (a cancer biomarker), allowing to image and differentiate the expression levels of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase in different cancer cells in living mouse. Thus, this study provides NIR chemiluminescence molecular scaffolds applicable for in vivo turn&#8208;on imaging of versatile biomarkers in deep tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Multi&#8208;photocatalyst Cascade Sequences: Merging Singlet Oxygen Photooxygenations with Photoredox Catalysis for the Synthesis of Key Alkaloid Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>The development of photocascades that rapidly transform simple and readily accessible furan substrates into polycyclic alkaloid frameworks or erythrina natural products is described.

      <title>Sublimable Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes: From Spin&#8208;State Switching to Molecular Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
This review provides a complete account of the on&#8208;surface spin&#8208;state switching behavior of films of spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes of molecular to multilayer thickness. SCO&#8208;based molecular and thin&#8208;film device architectures fabricated employing vacuum sublimation are also described.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) active transition metal complexes are an important class of switchable molecular materials due to their bistable spin&#8208;state switching characteristics at or around room temperature. Vacuum&#8208;sublimable SCO complexes are a subclass of SCO complexes suitable for fabricating ultraclean spin&#8208;switchable films desirable for applications, especially in molecular electronics/spintronics. Consequently, on&#8208;surface SCO of thin&#8208;films of sublimable SCO complexes have been studied employing spectroscopy and microscopy techniques, and results of fundamental and technological importance have been obtained. This Review provides complete coverage of advances made in the field of vacuum&#8208;sublimable SCO complexes: progress made in the design and synthesis of sublimable functional SCO complexes, on&#8208;surface SCO of molecular and multilayer thick films, and various molecular and thin&#8208;film device architectures based on the sublimable SCO complexes.

      <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis Induced by Platinum(II) Tweezers with Excellent Environmental Tolerance</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular chirogenesis has emerged as an effective strategy to access symmetry breaking in artificial systems. However, the chirogenic signals suffer from high susceptibility toward environmental variations, which are disadvantageous for their applications in asymmetric catalysis, chiroptical devices etc. Herein an effective strategy has been developed to address this issue, by constructing non&#8208;covalent tweezer/guest complexes stabilized by two&#8208;fold donor&#8211;acceptor and Pt(II)&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Pt(II) metal&#8211;metal interactions. Upon guest encapsulation, the two pincers on achiral Pt(II) tweezer undergo stereospecific twist to minimize steric repulsion, thus locking the tweezer/guest complexes into preferred chiral conformations. The induced chiroptical effects display outstanding solvent&#8208; and temperature&#8208; tolerance, ascribed to strong tweezer/guest binding strength via the balance between electrostatic and desolvation effects for the involved non&#8208;covalent interactions. Moreover, hierarchical and multi&#8208;component supramolecular assembly of tweezer/guest complexes provide a convenient way to modulate chirogeneic signals for their intensities. Overall, the current study opens up new avenues toward artificial supramolecular chirogenesis with excellent environmental tolerability.</dc:description>

      <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Extraction of Adjacent Metals&#8212;A Disruptive Economic Window for In&#8197;Situ Resource Utilization of Asteroids?</title>
      <dc:description>
For in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, which will necessitate the development of new technologies from first principals. This Review unveils how chemical process intensification in the development of disruptive technologies and business matters.

Abstract
For the in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, and technologies may need to be conceptualised from first principals. By using this approach, this Review seeks to illustrate how chemical process intensification can help with the development of disruptive technologies and business matters, how this might influence space&#8208;industry start&#8208;ups, and even industrial transformations on Earth. The disruptive technology considered is continuous microflow solvent extraction and, as another disruptive element therein, the use of ionic liquids. The space business considered is asteroid mining, as it is probably the most challenging resource site, and the focus is on its last step: the purification of adjacent metals (cobalt versus nickel). The key economic barrier is defined as the reduction in the amount of water used in the asteroid mining process. This Review suggests a pathway toward water savings up to the technological limit of the best Earth&#8208;based processes and their physical limits.

Abstract
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed oxidative kinetic resolution of cyclic benzylic ethers through asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation is reported. The practical approach is applicable to a wide range of 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofurans bearing diverse functional groups and substituent patterns at the &#945;&#8197;position with extremely efficient enantiodiscrimination. The generality of the strategy was further demonstrated by efficient oxidative kinetic resolution of another type of five&#8208;membered cyclic benzylic ether, 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans, and six&#8208;membered 6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromenes. Direct late&#8208;stage oxidative kinetic resolution of bioactive molecules that are otherwise difficult to access was further explored.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A manganese&#8208;catalyzed oxidative kinetic resolution of cyclic benzylic ethers through asymmetric C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H oxidation is reported. The practical approach is applicable to a wide range of 1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofurans bearing diverse functional groups and substituent patterns at the &#945;&#8197;position with extremely efficient enantiodiscrimination. The generality of the strategy was further demonstrated by efficient oxidative kinetic resolution of another type of five&#8208;membered cyclic benzylic ether, 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans, and six&#8208;membered 6H&#8208;benzo[c]chromenes. Direct late&#8208;stage oxidative kinetic resolution of bioactive molecules that are otherwise difficult to access was further explored.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reversing Titanium Oligomers Formation towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Green Synthesis of Titanium&#8208;containing Molecular Sieves</title>
      <dc:description>Green and efficient synthesis of titanium&#8208;containing molecular sieves is limited by large amount of environmentally unfriendly additives and complicated synthesis procedures necessarily required to avoid the oligomerization of Ti monomers to anatase TiO  2  , due to a mismatch between hydrolysis rates of Si and Ti precursors. Here, we report a simple and generic additive&#8208;free route for the synthesis of Ti&#8208;containing molecular sieves (MFI, MEL, and BEA). This approach successfully reverses the Ti oligomers formation to match hydrolysis rates of Ti and Si species with the assistance of hydroxyl free radicals generated  in&#8208;situ  from ultraviolet irradiation. Moreover, fantastic catalytic performance for propene epoxidation with H  2  and O  2  is observed. Compared with the conventional hydrothermal method, this approach opens up new opportunities for high&#8208;efficiency, environmentally&#8208;benign, and easy&#8208;operating production of pure titanium&#8208;containing molecular sieves.</dc:description>

      <title>Surfactant&#8208;induced interfacial aggregation of porphyrins for structuring the color&#8208;tunable liquids</title>
      <dc:description>Locking&#8208;in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids into targeted architectures by the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles, i.e. structuring liquids, is an emerging area in material science. Here, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin (H6TPPS) shows three different aggregation states that present an absorption imaging platform to monitor the assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants at the liquid/liquid interface. The interfacial interconversion of H6TPPS, specifically H4TPPS2&#8208; dissolved in water, from a J to an H&#8208;aggregation state was induced by strong electrostatic interactions with amine terminated polystyrene (PS&#8208;NH2) dissolved in toluene at the water/toluene interface. This resulted in color&#8208;tunable liquids due to interfacial jamming of the nanoparticulate surfactants formed between H4TPPS2&#8208; and PS&#8208;NH2. However, the nanoparticulate surfactants formed cannot lock&#8208;in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids. In addition, a self&#8208;wrinkling behavior was observed when amphiphilic triblock copolymers of PS&#8208;block&#8208;poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) were used to interact with H4TPPS2&#8208;. Subsequently, the nanoparticulate surfactants formed can lock&#8208;in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids. The interfacial assembly and chromogenic transitions of these aggregates provided interesting insights into the formation, assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants and the structuring of liquids.</dc:description>

      <title>Z&#8208;Scheme Photocatalytic Systems for Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Where Are We Now?</title>
      <dc:description>
Mimicking natural photosynthesis: The latest progress on Z&#8208;scheme photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction is comprehensively discussed in this Review. Particular attention is given to modification strategies that improve photocatalytic performance as well as confirmation methods to assess the Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism.







Abstract
Transforming CO2 into fuels by utilizing sunlight is promising to synchronously overcome global warming and energy&#8208;supply issues. It is crucial to design efficient photocatalysts with intriguing features such as robust light&#8208;harvesting ability, strong redox potential, high charge&#8208;separation, and excellent durability. Hitherto, a single&#8208;component photocatalyst is incapable to simultaneously meet all these criteria. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, constructing artificial Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts provides a facile way to conquer these bottlenecks. In this review, we firstly introduce the fundamentals of photocatalytic CO2 reduction and Z&#8208;scheme systems. Thereafter we discuss state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Z&#8208;scheme photocatalytic CO2 reduction, whereby special attention is placed on the predominant factors that affect photoactivity. Additionally, further modifications that are important for efficient photocatalysis are reviewed.
