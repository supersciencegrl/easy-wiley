         <title>Breaking the Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off of RuO2 via Metallic Ru Bilateral Regulation for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. RuO2 electrocatalysts, which followed a kinetically favorable lattice oxygen mechanism, perform a preferable intrinsic activity, but poor stability for acidic OER. Recent work often sacrifices the intrinsic activity of RuO2 to enhance stability. The balance between the activity and stability of RuO2&#8208;based catalysts is still overlooked in current research. Here, we report a controlled method to introduce metallic Ru onto RuO2 catalysts to form the Ru4+&#8211;O&#8211;Ru0 interfacial structure for decreasing the Ru4+ oxidation state and promoting deprotonation kinetics. Metallic Ru can serve as the electron donor to lower the oxidation state of *Vo&#8208;RuO42&#8722; in Ru/RuO2 for stabilizing the structure of *Vo&#8208;RuO42&#8722;&#8208;Ru/RuO2 to favour the acidic OER stability. Moreover, the deprotonation kinetics via the interfacial oxygen site between Ru4+ and Ru0 is significantly enhanced on Ru/RuO2 catalysts to improve the acidic OER activity. This work offers a unique perspective to balance the acidic OER activity and stability of RuO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lugdunomycin via Sequential Photoinduced Spiroketalization and Isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical synthetic strategy inspired by the angucyclinone biosynthesis culminated in the total synthesis of lugdunomycin. The keys in the total synthesis were 1) the design of the photoinduced spiroketalization to constitute elmonin from actinaphthoran B, and 2) photoinduced isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between elmonin and iso&#8208;maleimycin to construct the polycyclic framework.








Abstract
The presence of sterically rigid contiguous quaternary stereocenters in natural products imposes conformational constraints with significant effects on their biological activities. However, achieving the direct synthesis of multiple contiguous quaternary stereocenters in a single step remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present the total synthesis of the antibacterial metabolite lugdunomycin (1) in thirteen steps via a sequence of photochemical transformations. A photoenolization, keto&#8211;enol tautomerization, and spiroketalization sequence was developed to generate the spiroketal 4 from actinaphthoran B (3). Subsequently, a photoinduced isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between elmonin (4) and iso&#8208;maleimycin (5) was developed to construct the polycyclic benzaza[4,3,3]propellane framework bearing three contiguous quaternary stereocenters in the compact C&#8208;ring along with a distal hydroxyl group at C19. The mechanism of these photochemical reactions was investigated using synthetic and computational approaches.

         <title>Iridium(III) Carbene Complexes Featuring Either Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) or Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer (TSCT) Blue Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir(III) complexes with contrasting MLCT or TSCT transition characters were synthesized, among which the TSCT emitter f&#8208;ct13b gave PhOLED device with an EQEmax of 22.2% and CIExy of (0.155, 0.120). Additionally, hyper&#8208;OLED bearing another TSCT sensitizer, f&#8208;ct13c and v&#8208;DABNA terminal emitter, achieved a narrowband blue hyperphosphorescence with EQEmax of 28.2% and CIExy of (0.123, 0.129), highlighting the effectiveness of TSCT phosphor in realizing blue electroluminescence.








Abstract
Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT), rather than the commonly postulated metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) process, was proposed in getting the lowest lying excited state of newly designed Ir(III) blue phosphors. Accordingly, two benzo[d]imidazolylidene pro&#8208;chelates, L12H2+ and L13H2+, one with two cyano groups at the peri&#8208;benzo and N&#8208;aryl pendent and the other with its peri&#8208;cyano group being replaced with methyl substituent, were employed in syntheses of Ir(III) complexes f&#8208;ct12b,c and f&#8208;ct13b,c. Notably, complexes f&#8208;ct12b,c exhibited the traditional MLCT process, while f&#8208;ct13b,c were dominated by the TSCT transition, resulting in a smaller S1&#8211;T1 energy gap &#916;EST. Next, it prompted us to explore whether their long&#8208;lived emission originated from phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Although temperature&#8208;dependent emission studies favor TADF, the unresolved concerns are still discussed in depth. For application, OLED with the TSCT&#8208;based dopant f&#8208;ct13b delivered a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.2% and a max. luminance of 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8210;2, together with CIExy of (0.155, 0.120). Moreover, the hyper&#8208;OLED with f&#8208;ct13c sensitizer and v&#8208;DABNA terminal emitter exhibited a max. EQE of 28.2% and CIExy of (0.123, 0.129), demonstrating a new approach in developing efficient Ir(III) blue phosphors.

         <title>Two&#8208;Color Single&#8208;Molecule Blinking Ratiometricity: A Functional Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging Approach for Resolving Lysosomal pH and Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduced two&#8208;color single&#8208;molecule blinking ratiometricity (2C&#8208;SMBR) for simultaneous nanoscale imaging and pH measurement in lysosomes. Using two pH&#8208;dependent blinking fluorophores, 2C&#8208;SMBR resolved lysosomal pH heterogeneity (4.0&#8211;6.0) and enabled real&#8208;time correlation of lysosomal dynamics with pH changes, offering new insights into lysosomal function.








Abstract
Fluorescence super&#8208;resolution microscopy has enabled nanoscale imaging of intracellular structures, but it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve structural imaging and quantitative functional characterization, such as pH measurement, within the same region. Here, we introduce two&#8208;color single&#8208;molecule blinking ratiometricity (2C&#8208;SMBR), a novel method that integrates structural and functional imaging with single&#8208;molecule precision. By loading lysosomes with two pH&#8208;dependent spontaneously blinking fluorophores of distinct colors, 2C&#8208;SMBR leverages single&#8208;molecule localization of either fluorophore to achieve nanoscale structural imaging of lysosomes, whereas the ratiometric analysis of blinking dynamics between the two fluorophores provides quantitative pH measurement at the single&#8208;lysosome level. This dual&#8208;color ratiometric approach at the single&#8208;molecule level enables precise quantification of lysosomal pH with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution. Using 2C&#8208;SMBR, we reveal that lysosomal pH is highly heterogeneous at the single&#8208;lysosome level, with distinct subpopulations exhibiting diverse pH values. Our measurements show a pH range of 4.0&#8211;6.0 within lysosomes, with perinuclear lysosomes averaging a pH of approximately 4.88, whereas peripheral lysosomes average around 5.64. Crucially, 2C&#8208;SMBR enables real&#8208;time correlation between lysosomal dynamics and pH changes, overcoming a key limitation of super&#8208;resolution imaging. This approach not only advances nanoscale organelle characterization but also provides mechanistic insights into lysosomal physiology and function.

         <title>Identifying Spatially Segregated Ir Sites Within ZSM&#8208;5 for Enhanced Redox Cycle in NOx Reduction by CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir@ZSM&#8208;5 was prepared via a one&#8208;pot synthesis, where Ir clusters were confined within the zeolite pores, achieving valence state balance through spatial confinement. SO2 and O2 synergistically regulate the valence states of Ir species, thereby influencing the reaction pathway of NOx reduction by CO.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance Ir&#8208;based catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NOx by CO (CO&#8208;SCR) under low temperatures remains challenging. This study presents an Ir&#8208;based catalyst encapsulated in Zeolite Socony Mobil&#8208;5 (Ir@ZSM&#8208;5), with Ir species partially confined in micropores (Ir&#948;+) and partially aggregated on the surface (Ir0), achieving &#8764;88% NOx conversion at 230&#160;&#176;C in the presence of 5% O2 and 100&#160;ppm SO2. The confined Ir&#948;+ species exhibit enhanced stability and oxidation states, whereas surface&#8208;aggregated Ir0 species, with weaker oxygen coordination, remain in a metallic state. The dynamic equilibrium between Ir&#948;+ and Ir0 significantly improves the balance of CO oxidation and NO reduction. O2 promotes the oxidation of Ir0 to Ir&#948;+, whereas SO2 facilitates the reverse, forming a reversible cycle that sustains catalytic efficiency. This work underscores the strategic interplay of Ir valence states and highlights a pathway for designing stable, high&#8208;performance Ir&#8208;based catalysts tailored for CO&#8208;SCR under complex reaction conditions.

         <title>Silylation of Aryl and Alkyl Chlorides by a Seven&#8208;Membered Dialkoxysilyl Group Si(pan)Me via an In Situ Generated Silylpotassium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals a facile silylation protocol that enables the delivery of a stable and activatable dioxasilepanyl group, Si(pan)Me, to aryl and alkyl chlorides. Of note is the X&#8208;ray structure of 18&#8208;C&#8208;6&#183;K&#8211;Si(pan)Me, which elucidates a pivotal silylpotassium intermediate. Our experimental mechanistic studies reveal a halogen&#8208;metal exchange (HME) pathway, with a partial SN2 mechanism for alkyl substrates, supported by computational rationale.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;containing compounds are increasingly vital in pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications, yet existing silylation methods face critical limitations: poor reactivity of unactivated silanes and instability of activated silylation reagents and their products. Here, we present a seven&#8208;membered dialkoxysilyl unit, dioxasilepane, abbreviated as Si(pan), that combines exceptional stability with controllable reactivity. We demonstrate a versatile method for Si(pan)Me incorporation into organic molecules through reactions with diverse aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl chlorides. Notably, we have isolated and structurally characterized the key silylpotassium intermediate as its 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 complex through X&#8208;ray crystallography. Experimental mechanistic studies reveal that this silylpotassium species mediates the transformation primarily through halogen&#8208;metal exchange (HME). Computational investigations confirm the HME pathway while suggesting a concurrent SN2 mechanism for specific primary alkyl chlorides. This methodology establishes Si(pan) as a robust building block for constructing silicon&#8208;containing molecular frameworks, addressing a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis.

         <title>Charge Tuning and Anchor Effect Achieving Stable High&#8208;Voltage Layered Metal Oxides for Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing La into the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode material, the release of lattice oxygen is suppressed due to the charge tuning effect of La. Simultaneously, the as&#8208;formed LaO6 octahedra serve as stable anchors to stabilize the TM layers, ultimately improving the performance of NFM under various extreme conditions.








Abstract
Layered metal oxides (LMOs) that can stably operate at high voltage are vital to developing high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the irreversible oxygen redox reaction of LMOs at the high voltage region (i.e., &gt;4.0&#160;V vs. Na+/Na) will cause serious oxygen evolution and structural instability, and therefore sharp capacity fading. Herein, we report the charge tuning and anchor effect of La doping to enhance the cycling stability of layered NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) under extreme conditions (e.g., high voltage and temperature). The La doping introduces additional negative charges to the oxygen ligands of transition metals (TM) and facilitates charge transfer, thereby reducing oxygen evolution at 4.1&#160;V and enhancing the kinetics of the redox process. Moreover, the as&#8208;formed LaO6 octahedra serve as stable anchors for the TM layers, preventing the formation of lattice nanocracks. As a result, the La&#8208;modified NFM exhibits a high capacity of 173.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C (1C = 150&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and capacity retention of 71.21% at 2.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V after 500 cycles at 1C, which are higher than those of NFM. Additionally, the full cell achieves a high energy density of 438.78&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on cathode mass), with a retention of 70.2% over 400 cycles, implying the great application potential of this concept.

         <title>A Modular Approach Toward BN&#8208;Embedded Terrylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of BN&#8208;embedded terrylene diimides (BN&#8208;TDIs) were synthesized in a modular manner. Manipulation of dipole moments of the BN&#8208;TDIs was achieved via different BN unit(s) insertion. Strong carbonyl&#8208;&#960; interactions were observed in their crystals, which could be utilized in the construction of supramolecular architectures. BN&#8208;TDIs showcased typical electron transport behavior, making them one of the few examples of n&#8208;type BN&#8208;embedded molecules.








Abstract
This work presents the first example of heteroatoms embedded terrylene diimides (TDIs), which were synthesized from the BN&#8208;embedded imide building block in a modular manner. Through the control of the amount and orientations of the BN unit(s), the manipulation of dipole moments of the obtained BN&#8208;embedded terrylene diimides (BN&#8208;TDIs) was achieved, which in turn extended the fluorescence of BN&#8208;TDIs to near infrared region. The structures of BN&#8208;TDIs were established via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions. Stronger carbonyl&#8208;&#960; interactions were observed for BN&#8208;TDIs in their crystal structures compared with that of TDI, which could be utilized in the construction of supramolecular architectures. The organic thin film transistors based on BN&#8208;TDIs were also fabricated. BN&#8208;TDI&#8208;S showcased higher electron mobilities than that of TDI, indicating the potential of BN&#8208;TDIs as promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors.

         <title>Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Water and Air Over Water&#8208;Dispersible Anthraquinone&#8208;Based Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design and synthesis of novel anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (AQ&#8208;PAFs) photocatalyst composed of AQ and thiophene&#8208;derived fragments are presented. The interfacial hydrogen bonding enables mono&#8208;dispersion states of these AQ&#8208;PAFs in water&#8208;only systems, which ensures the optimal exposure of catalytically active sites to light and reactants. This catalyst system promotes the optimal H2O2 photosynthesis from water and air in the absence of any organic alcohols, in a high H2O2 production rate of 7124&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. A continuous H2O2 production in AQ&#8208;PAFs&#8208;based flow system for 190&#160;h is also achieved.








Abstract
Photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide from earth&#8208;abundant water and air over organo&#8208;based semiconducting materials is a promising alternative to the traditional anthraquinone (AQ) method. However, the generally hydrophobic nature of organic semiconductors has led to their poor dispersibilities in aqueous systems, which built huge barriers for photon capture and reactant contact in water&#8208;based photocatalysis. Aiming at this issue, this study reports the facile synthesis of AQ&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (AQ&#8208;PAFs) by coupling AQ fragments with thiophene&#8208;derived linkers via robust carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. Remarkably, the interfacial hydrogen bonding interactions between water molecules and AQ sites on the surface improve the general hydrophilicity of AQ&#8208;PAFs, which can be well&#8208;dispersed in water&#8208;only systems with uniform particle size distributions. Moreover, the AQ moieties also function as mediators of photoinduced electrons, and the protons produced from water oxidation reaction (WOR), which would kinetically favor the charge separation and subsequent electron transfer reactions. The mono&#8208;dispersed AQ&#8208;PAF photocatalyst promotes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis from water and air under visible light achieving a high productivity of 7124&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the absence of any organic alcohol reagents among organic semiconductor photocatalysts. Furthermore, a continuous H2O2 photosynthesis for 190&#160;h is also achieved in a flow system.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Durable Anode Catalyst Layer Constructed with Deformable Hollow IrOx Nanospheres in Low&#8208;Iridium PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deformable hollow IrOx nanospheres as a structural&#8208;engineered catalyst architecture achieve an ultralow Ir packing density in anode catalyst layer while maintaining excellent catalytic activity and durability at reduced Ir loadings. The quasi&#8208;ordered close packing of hollow IrOx nanospheres simultaneously maximizes electrochemically active surface area, suppresses particle migration and agglomeration, and establishes percolated electron highways and rapid mass transport channels.








Abstract
Reducing iridium packing density (gIr&#160;cm&#8722;3 electrode) represents a critical pathway to lower geometric Ir loading in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), yet conventional approaches often cause performance issues of anode catalyst layer due to decreased structural stability and limited electron/mass transport efficiency. Here, we present deformable hollow IrOx nanospheres (dh&#8208;IrOx) as a structural&#8208;engineered catalyst architecture that achieves an ultralow Ir packing density (20% of conventional IrO2 nanoparticle&#8208;based electrodes) while maintaining high catalytic activity and durability at reduced Ir loadings. Scalable synthesis of dh&#8208;IrOx via a hard&#8208;template method&#8212;featuring precise SiO2 nanosphere templating and conformal Ir(OH)3 coating&#8212;enables batch production of tens of grams. Through cavity dimension and shell thickness optimization, dh&#8208;IrOx demonstrates excellent mechanical resilience to necessary electrode fabrication stresses, including high&#8208;shear agitation, ultrasonic processing and hot&#8208;pressing. In the anode catalyst layer, the quasi&#8208;ordered close packing of dh&#8208;IrOx nanospheres simultaneously maximizes electrochemically active surface area, suppresses particle migration and agglomeration, and establishes percolated electron highways and rapid mass transport channels. The architected anode delivers high PEMWE performance (e.g., 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 @1.60&#160;V and 2&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 @1.75&#160;V@80&#160;&#176;C), while demonstrating excellent operational durability with&#160;&lt;1.5% voltage loss over 3000&#160;h.

         <title>Surface Nonbonding Oxygen State Regulation for Reversible Anionic Redox Chemistry in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface nonbonding oxygen state is modulated by an integrated surface structure engineering to stabilize anionic redox chemistry. The oxidized oxygen of the designed material cannot become O2 gas and escape, but rather exists more in the form of high&#8208;valence oxygen dimer anions, reducing the reaction extent of surface anionic redox and inhibiting oxygen loss.








Abstract
Activated by the Li&#8211;O&#8211;Li configuration with nonbonding O 2p state (lO2p), anionic redox reaction (ARR) in Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) contributes to additional capacity but exhibits significant irreversibility, leading to severe surface oxygen loss. Herein, surface nonbonding oxygen state (SNBOS) is regulated by the integrated surface structure engineering to suppress surface oxygen loss and enhance the reversibility of ARR. On the outermost layer, the conversion of layered structure into a LiLaO2 layer and spinel phase structure eliminates lO2p, thereby preventing the activation of ARR and suppressing side reactions between electrolyte and oxidized oxygen ions. Besides, by introducing 5d metal La on the near surface, the energy of lO2p is decreased corresponding to the increased charge&#8208;transfer gap &#916; and the d&#8211;d coulomb repulsion term U is reduced, making U/2 decrease close to &#916; and enhancing ARR reversibility. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the oxidized oxygen of the modified sample cannot become O2 gas and escape, but rather exists more in the form of high&#8208;valence oxygen dimer anions O2n&#8722;$O_2^{n - }$, reducing the reaction depth of surface ARR and inhibiting oxygen loss. Therefore, the designed material demonstrates outstanding cycling stability and kinetics performance.

A readily prepared small molecule, 2,6&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;diethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine, enables rapid and highly sensitive &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence detection of PFOA in water via liquid&#8208;phase extraction. Detection limits as low as 40 ppt in deionized water and 100 ppt in tap water are achieved using a smartphone&#8208;based color scan &#8220;app&#8221;.

Abstract
Mounting concerns regarding per&#8208;/poly&#8208;fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on human health are focusing attention on trace&#8208;level PFAS detection in aqueous environments. Here, we report a readily prepared small molecule, 2,6&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;diethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (receptor 1), that displays high binding affinities (logKa&#160;=&#160;4.9&#8211;6.2) and produces a strong &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; emission response when exposed to representative PFAS in hexanes. The hydrophobic nature of 1, and its strong affinity for various PFAS, allowed hexanes solutions of 1 to be used as &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; emission sensors for dilute aqueous solutions of long&#8208;chain (&#8805;C8) PFAS under acidic conditions (pH 2) by liquid&#8208;phase extraction (LPE). In the case of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the response was rapid (under 10&#160;min) and sensitive. Limits of detection (LOD) as low as 250&#160;ppt were readily achievable by direct naked&#8208;eye observation. LOD as low as 40 and 100&#160;ppt, respectively, could be reached for deionized and tap water solutions of PFOA using a smartphone color&#8208;scanning application. Little change in the sensitivity was seen in the presence of a range of inorganic and organic species that could act as potential interferants. Support for the present findings came from UV&#8211;vis absorbance, fluorescence, 1H/19F NMR spectroscopic analyses, density functional theory calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses.

Limits of detection (LOD) as low as 250&#160;ppt were readily achievable by direct naked-eye observation. LOD as low as 40 and 100&#160;ppt, respectively, could be reached for deionized and tap water solutions of PFOA using a smartphone color-scanning application. Little change in the sensitivity was seen in the presence of a range of inorganic and organic species that could act as potential interferants. Support for the present findings came from UV&#8211;vis absorbance, fluorescence, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H/&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR spectroscopic analyses, density functional theory calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Stepwise one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction of the dimeric germole&#8208;ligated sandwich complexes [(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)]2 (M&#160;=&#160;Y, Gd, Dy) produces the isostructural complex anions [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]&#8722; and [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]2&#8722;, respectively. The additional electrons populate bonding molecular orbitals extending across the {M2Ge2} rings, resulting in four&#8208;center, multielectron bonding.








Abstract
Reduction of the germole&#8208;ligated sandwich complexes [(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)]2 (1M, M&#160;=&#160;Y, Gd, Dy) with one or two equivalents of KC8/2.2.2&#8208;cryptand produces [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]&#8722; (2M) and [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]2&#8722; (3M), respectively, as salts of [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]+ (CpGe = [GeC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8211;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8722;, Cpttt&#160;=&#160;1,2,4&#8208;C5tBu3H2. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that the bond lengths within the central {M2Ge2} rings contract markedly with each reduction. Computational analysis reveals the presence of unusual four&#8208;center, multielectron {M2Ge2} bonds, with the reduction increasing the germanium&#8211;germanium and metal&#8211;germanium bond orders while reducing the metal&#8208;Cpttt bond order. Analysis of 2Y by EPR spectroscopy reveals delocalization of the unpaired spin across both yttrium centers. Magnetic measurements on radical&#8208;bridged 2Gd show a large exchange coupling constant of &#8722;95 cm&#8722;1 (&#8722;2&#160;J formalism). Single&#8208;molecule magnet behavior is found for the dysprosium&#8211;germole complexes. Complexes 1Y, 2Y, and 3Y can be interconverted by one&#8208;electron oxidation or reduction reactions of 2Y, which itself can also be formed by comproportionation of 1Y and 3Y. The masked divalent reactivity of 3Y is demonstrated through one&#8208;electron reduction of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl to give [(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)Y(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy)]&#8722; (4Y) and activation of Ph2Se2 to give [(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe)Y(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)(SePh)]&#8722; (5Y).

         <title>Asymmetrical Triatomic Sites with Long&#8208;Range Electron Coupling for Ultra&#8208;Durable and Extreme&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The hetero&#8208;trimetallic FeCoNi SA catalyst (FCN&#8208;TM/NC) processes the asymmetric FeN4 configuration, long&#8208;distance hetero&#8208;metallic electron coupling, modulated local microenvironment, and optimized d orbital energy levels, exhibiting extraordinary oxygen electrocatalysis. The zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) equipped with FCN&#8208;TM/NC exhibits ultra&#8208;stable rechargeability (over 5500&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;60 &#176;C) and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability from &#8722;60 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Reversible zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) is a promising alternative for sustainable fuel cells, but the performance is impeded by the sluggish oxygen redox kinetics owing to the suboptimal adsorption and desorption of oxygen intermediates. Here, hetero&#8208;trimetallic atom catalysts (TACs) uniquely incorporate an electron regulatory role beyond primary and secondary active sites found in dual&#8208;atom catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and Raman spectroscopy elucidate Fe in FeCoNi SA catalyst (FCN&#8208;TM/NC) functions as the main active site, leveraging long&#8208;range electron coupling from neighboring Co and Ni to boost catalytic efficiency. The ZAB equipped with FCN&#8208;TM/NC exhibits ultra&#8208;stable rechargeability (over 5500&#160;h at 1&#160;&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C). The in&#8208;depth theoretical and experimental investigations attribute such superior catalytic activity to the asymmetric FeN4 configuration, long&#8208;distance electron coupling, modulated local microenvironment, optimized d orbital energy levels, and lower energy barrier for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. This work provides a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the structure&#8208;reactivity relationship in TACs for energy conversion.

         <title>Asymmetric Structural Design in Cobaloxime&#8208;Integrated Covalent Organic Frameworks to Facilitate Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric structural design strategy has been developed to construct covalent organic frameworks (COFs) composed of ternary units and dual linkages to generate long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states. By integrating the COF with cobaloxime complexes, the resulting hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular photocatalyst synergistically achieves spatially segregated redox sites and significantly enhances the photocatalytic overall water splitting efficiency.








Abstract
Herein, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular hybrid composed of a cobaloxime complex and a covalent organic framework (COF) that achieves photocatalytic overall water splitting. The designed COF features ternary units and dual linkages, which induce asymmetric linkers. Upon photoexcitation, this asymmetry facilitates directed electron transfer and spatially separated redox sites, resulting in a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state. Consequently, the COF, hydrogen&#8208;bonded with cobaloxime as a hydrogen (H2) production cocatalyst, enables visible&#8208;light photocatalytic overall water splitting, simultaneously producing H2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), outperforming the COFs with symmetric linker structures. This strategy of asymmetric structural design offers new insights for the design of photocatalysts with suppressed charge recombination for photocatalysis.

         <title>Constructing Biomimetic Channels in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework via Post&#8208;Synthesis for Enhanced Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton transport in biological systems relies on amino acid residues with hanging carboxylic acids as proton donors and acceptors. Here, we first demonstrate that post&#8208;synthesis can create unoccupied carboxylic acid groups in HOFs, stabilizing water molecules and forming continuous proton channels. This strategy achieves 1000&#8208;fold enhancement in proton conductivity and the structure transformation was clearly revealed by crystallography.








Abstract
Proton transport channels in biological systems are constructed by the specific amino acid residues with hanging carboxylic acid groups acting as proton donors and acceptors, enabling rapid proton conduction via the Grotthuss mechanism. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are promising candidates for artificially simulating proton channels due to their designable structure and abundant proton sources in the network. However, these protons were usually immobilized within hydrogen bonds between two building blocks, which require a high energy barrier for initiating proton transport. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) may be a viable solution to the above problems but has yet to be achieved in HOFs. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that unoccupied carboxylic acid groups can be created through post&#8208;synthesis which further stabilizes water molecules to construct continuous proton channels, bringing boosted proton conductivity by three orders of magnitude. The structure transformation process and the intermediate can be identified clearly by crystallography with an unveiled mechanism. This work offers a new approach to constructing biomimetic channels for proton conduction and HOF functionalization.

         <title>Organic Room&#8208;Temperature near&#8208;IR Phosphorescence Harvested by Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Sensitization in Composite Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular energy transfer in bichromophore molecules, regulated by the spatial separation between organic and metal&#8208;containing components, allows to attain room temperature near&#8208;IR phosphorescence of polyaromatic dyes, including those with very low intersystem crossing rates, by using conventional organometallic fragments as sensitizers.








Abstract
A family of coordination compounds with short intramolecular spatial separation between an organic chromophore and a metal center was studied. The specific geometry was realized by means of anthracene&#8208;functionalized tertiary aryl phosphanes. Their silver and gold complexes (1, 2) operate as conventional fluorophores, with photophysical behavior defined by anthracene&#8208;localized allowed transitions. In contrast, bichromophoric species, containing phenyl bipyridine&#8208; (3, 5, 6, 8) or terpyridine&#8208; (4, 7) derived platinum(II) fragments, demonstrate fast intersystem crossing to the triplet state associated with the pincer metal component. Theoretical results corroborated that the short intramolecular distance between the platinum constituent and the adjacent anthracene facilitates subsequent through&#8208;space triplet (T2, pincer fragment)&#8594;triplet (T1, anthracene) energy transfer. This process occurs at a rate of &#8764;1011 s&#8722;1, surpassing the rates of T2&#8594;S0 relaxation. This prevents visible phosphorescence from the platinum(II) motifs but enables near&#8208;IR organic phosphorescence in the solid state, including dyes with very inefficient intersystem&#8208;crossing (ISC). Thus, the composite molecules 3&#8211;8 illustrate a feasible approach to the tunable sensitization of organic dyes and the design of low&#8208;energy triplet emitters.

         <title>A d&#8208;Electron Deficient Pd Trimer for Exceptional Pyridine Hydrogenation Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel Pd trimer catalyst confined by the TiO2 lattice exhibits a 0.42 d&#8208;electron deficiency, effectively achieving nearly complete conversion of 2&#8208;phenylpyridine (PPY) to 2&#8208;phenylpiperidine (PPD) and maintaining performance over extensive use, with minimal activity or selectivity loss. This remarkable catalytic efficiency is attributed to the constrained adsorption of the pyridyl ring and the stabilization of the negatively charged transition state.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of pyridines containing reducible groups such as 2&#8208;phenylpyridine (PPY) typically has low yields due to strong nitrogen coordination with the metal as well as nonselective and over&#8208;hydrogenation. We report the synthesis of a novel Pd trimer catalyst through confined growth on an ordered mesoporous carrier, characterized by a 0.42 d&#8208;electron deficiency to address this challenge. This catalyst achieved a nearly complete conversion of 2&#8208;phenylpyridine and selectivity to 2&#8208;phenylpiperidine (PPD), maintaining its performance across eight batch cycles and continuous flow in the liquid phase for 800&#160;h with negligible loss of activity or selectivity. We discuss the roles of active sites, including Pd d charge and ensemble structure, in relation to activation entropy, a Hammett study, and the adsorption configuration of the reactant. The exceptional 2&#8208;phenylpyridine hydrogenation activity and selectivity are attributed to the adsorption constraint of the pyridyl ring and the stabilization of the negatively charged transition state in the rate&#8208;determining step produced by the d&#8208;electron deficient Pd trimer.

         <title>First Encapsulation of Organometallic Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet into Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulating chemically unstable organometallic single&#8208;molecule magnets in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes not only improves their chemical stability but also suppresses magnetic relaxation at zero magnetic fields, greatly improving their usability, which is essential for fabricating spintronic devices.








Abstract
An air&#8208;sensitive DyCp3 (Cp&#8722;&#160;= cyclopentadienyl) single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) complex (1) is encapsulated into single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to construct hybrid materials that are resistant to moisture and oxygen. The hybrid materials with independent slow&#8208;magnetic&#8208;relaxing centers are expected to become a key component of the next generation of information process devices based on spintronics. The resilience to moisture and oxygen further broadens its manufacturing methods and application scenarios. Furthermore, upon encapsulation into SWCNTs, DyCp3 exhibited clear ac frequency dependence in the ac magnetic susceptibility at a zero&#8208;dc field. This indicates that the guest molecule's slow magnetic relaxation properties are preserved, which is crucial and necessary to realize SMMs&#8208;based quantum information processing, by allowing a sufficient time window for quantum gate operations. This result exemplifies that encapsulation of air&#8208;sensitive organometallic SMMs into SWCNTs enhances their chemical stability and their magnetic relaxation time at a zero&#8208;dc magnetic field, which provides a novel method for their further applications.

         <title>Switchable Divergent Photocatalytic C&#8208;Glycosylation of Glycosyl Benzoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel radical deoxygenation C&#8208;glycosylation method using simple, stable glycosyl benzoates via reductive anomeric C&#9472;O bond cleavage enables divergent synthesis of alkyl and alkenyl C&#8208;glycosides with excellent stereoselectivity. This study highlights the innovative use of glycosyl benzoates as radical precursors and CO2&#8226;&#8722; as a reductant, opening new directions for radical glycosylation.








Abstract
Metabolically robust C&#8208;glycosides are crucial in various biological and medical applications, underscoring the need for efficient synthesis methods. While radical C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are known for their reliability and functional group tolerance, challenges such as glycosyl donor stability and atom economy persist. In this study, we investigate the underexplored potential of condition&#8208;controlled divergent synthesis of C&#8208;glycosides through a switchable photocatalytic C&#8208;glycosylation strategy, involving reductive anomeric C&#9472;O bond cleavage. Utilizing simple, readily available, and bench&#8208;stable glycosyl benzoates as novel O&#8208;based glycosyl radical precursors, we successfully achieve deoxygenative glycosylation of simple alkenes and styryl boronic acids, establishing a versatile platform for C&#8208;glycoside synthesis. A critical aspect of the challenging reductive cleavage of these benzoate esters is the introduction of strong single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reductants, combined with Br&#248;nsted acids to accelerate fragmentation following substrate reduction. Notably, CO2&#8226;&#8722;, generated via the consecutive photon&#8208;induced electron transfer process, is utilized for the first time in glycosylation reactions. By meticulously tuning the reaction conditions, including photocatalysts and formate additives, we facilitate the divergent synthesis of alkyl and alkenyl C&#8208;glycosides with good to high stereoselectivity and yields. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the reaction pathway and the underlying rationale behind this finely tuned, easily controlled photocatalytic system.

Utilizing simple, readily available, and bench-stable glycosyl benzoates as novel &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-based glycosyl radical precursors, we successfully achieve deoxygenative glycosylation of simple alkenes and styryl boronic acids, establishing a versatile platform for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycoside synthesis. A critical aspect of the challenging reductive cleavage of these benzoate esters is the introduction of strong single-electron transfer (SET) reductants, combined with Br&#248;nsted acids to accelerate fragmentation following substrate reduction. Notably, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, generated via the consecutive photon-induced electron transfer process, is utilized for the first time in glycosylation reactions. By meticulously tuning the reaction conditions, including photocatalysts and formate additives, we facilitate the divergent synthesis of alkyl and alkenyl &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosides with good to high stereoselectivity and yields. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the reaction pathway and the underlying rationale behind this finely tuned, easily controlled photocatalytic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Free High&#8208;Entropy Alloy for Acidic Water Oxidation at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;iridium high&#8208;entropy RuMnFeMoCo alloy catalyst with synergistic effects of different transition metal elements accelerates reaction kinetics and reduces overpotential of acidic oxygen evolution reactions, leading to the superior activity and stability in industrial proton exchange membrane water electrolysis at high current densities.








Abstract
Designing active and cost&#8208;effective catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critically important for improving proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) used in hydrogen production. In this study, we introduce a rapid and straightforward method to synthesize a quinary high&#8208;entropy ruthenium&#8208;based alloy (RuMnFeMoCo) for acidic OER. This iridium&#8208;free catalyst demonstrates a low overpotential of 170&#160;mV and exceptional stability, enduring a 1000&#8208;hour durability test at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Microstructural analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the incorporation of corrosion&#8208;resistant elements such as Ru, Mo, and Co enhances the overall stability of the catalyst under acidic conditions. Concurrently, the presence of Mn, Fe, and Co significantly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the OER process, thus accelerating the OER kinetics and lowering the overpotential. The PEMWE employing the RuMnFeMoCo catalyst operates stably at high current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 300&#160;hours with negligible performance degradation. This work illustrates a strategy for designing high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts by synergistically integrating the benefits of multiple elements, potentially overcoming the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off typically encountered in the catalyst development.

Abstract
The alkylidene transfer reactions of alkenes are of particular significance but challenging. Here, we report that enones can serve as diverse alkylidene sources for catalyst&#8208;controlled selective C&#9472;H alkylation and/or alkylidenation of various nucleophiles. Treatment of a mixture of ketone (or lactam), enone, and diarylmethanol, with a catalytic amount of Y[N(TMS)2]3, gave the corresponding &#945;&#8208;C&#9472;H bond alkylation products derived from the alkylidene transfer from enones to ketones/lactams, whereas the reaction of enones with various C&#8208;nucleophiles in the presence of KOH as a catalyst resulted in C&#9472;H alkylidenation. Moreover, the application of these strategies for the late&#8208;stage modification or structural simplification of some bioactive molecules is also presented. These alkylidene transfer reactions are characterized by operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions, and remarkable catalyst&#8208;controlled product outcomes. These results not only demonstrate a significant potential for easily accessible and recyclable enones to serve as versatile alkylidene sources in C&#9472;H alkylation and alkylidenation but also provide an attractive and concise method for hydrodealkylidenation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes.

         <title>Integrating Electronic&#8208;Storage Piperazine into Covalent Organic Frameworks for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piperazine units were first adopted to construct catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for oxygen reduction reactions. The electronic&#8208;storage feature promoted the electrons transferring from the electrodes to active catalytic sites and thus contributed to high activity.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as potential electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in new environmental&#8208;friendly electrochemical energy conversion technologies. However, their catalytic activity is hindered by inefficient electron transfer from electrodes to catalytic sites along extended frameworks. To overcome this bottleneck, herein, we first incorporated redox&#8208;active piperazine units into the COFs to catalyze ORR. The redox&#8208;active piperazine units enable to storage electrons, thus accelerate the electron transfer to the catalytic sites. Furthermore, the introduction of &#9472;OH group&#8208;containing building blocks induces keto&#8208;enol tautomerism (enabling reversible &#9472;OH / &#9472;C&#9552;O interconversion), improving framework polarity with a dipole moment of 6.87&#160;Debye (5.8 times increase compared to non&#8208;hydroxylated COFs). This polarity enhancement strengthens the intermediates binding ability, thereby improving the catalytic activity. As a result, the optimized PD&#8208;COF&#8208;OH exhibits a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#160;V, turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.045&#160;s&#8722;1, and electrochemically active surface area of 9.4&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most reported metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations further reveal synergistic roles of &#9472;OH and &#9472;C&#9552;O groups in stabilizing OOH* and OH* intermediates, contributing to the improved catalytic activity. This work establishes a novel design paradigm for catalytic COFs through a rational integration of electron reservoir units and tautomerism&#8208;enabled polarity modulation.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Induced Quantum Confinement of Negative Charge Carriers by Organic Nanoporous Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excess&#8208;electrons in organic nanoporous systems&#8212;nanohoops, their assemblies, and COFs&#8212;can be confined and transported via diffuse states stabilized by long&#8208;range polarization forces. These nanopore&#8208;bound states, localized in nanopores or away from molecular scaffolds, exhibit enhanced electron coupling and nearly&#8208;free&#8208;electron bands, unlike traditional skeletal&#8208;bound states, thus presenting a promising pathway for electron transport.








Abstract
We characterize the attachment of excess&#8208;electrons to organic nanoporous systems such as molecular nanohoops and models of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) using many&#8208;body methods. All the nanopore systems exhibit diffuse electronic states where the excess&#8208;electron is bound to the molecular scaffold via long&#8208;range polarization forces, and the excess&#8208;electron is predominantly localized in the interior of the nanopore or away from the molecular scaffold. Such &#8220;nanopore&#8208;bound&#8221; states show an enhanced electron&#8208;transfer coupling compared to more strongly&#8208;bound skeletal&#8208;states (or valence&#8208;bound states), where the excess&#8208;electron is confined to the molecular skeleton. For 1D assemblies of nanohoops, the bands formed from nanopore&#8208;bound states have a consistent nearly&#8208;free&#8208;electron character, indicating an efficient excited&#8208;state pathway for charge&#8208;carriers, while the bands from skeletal&#8208;states have higher effective mass along certain lattice directions. The nanopore&#8208;bound states show distinct size&#8208;dependent variations in electron affinities compared to skeletal&#8208;states and previously observed molecular quantum corral states. We conclude that nanopore&#8208;bound states emerge from polarization&#8208;induced quantum confinement, forming a distinct common feature of organic nanoporous matter with potential for efficient&#160;electron&#8208;transport.

         <title>Switching on Supramolecular DNA Junction Binding Using a Human Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimulus responsive control of DNA junction formation: Enzyme action cleaves flexible arms from a metallo&#8208;supramolecular cylinder, transforming an inert metallo&#8208;supramolecular structure into an active metallo&#8208;supramolecular agent, and switching on its ability to assemble, bind and stabilize DNA three&#8208;way junction structures.








Abstract
Non&#8208;canonical DNA junction structures are important in human disease and in nucleic acid nanoscience and there is a growing interest in how to bind and modulate them. A key next step is to exert &#8220;on command&#8221; control over such binding. Herein we develop a new metallo&#8208;supramolecular triple&#8208;helicate cylinder agent that is inert to DNA junction binding until activated by human enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and its cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). This inactive cylinder bears six flexible arms each with a quinone group at the termini. Reduction by the enzyme leads to all six arms being removed, transforming the inert cylinder into a new and active metallo&#8208;supramolecular agent that binds junctions. This gives the ability to &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8221; DNA junction formation and binding in response to the presence of two external stimuli &#8211; a human enzyme overexpressed in many disease states, and NADPH &#8211; and absence of inhibitor, giving NAND logic control. Modelling indicates the binding activation originates not in steric unblocking but changes in conformational flexibility. The work provides the foundation for and a route map toward future designs of sophisticated, inert, and supramolecular structures which are transformed by enzymes into new, active, and supramolecular structures for a variety of potential applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-canonical DNA junction structures are important in human disease and in nucleic acid nanoscience and there is a growing interest in how to bind and modulate them. A key next step is to exert &#8220;on command&#8221; control over such binding. Herein we develop a new metallo-supramolecular triple-helicate cylinder agent that is inert to DNA junction binding until activated by human enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and its cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). This inactive cylinder bears six flexible arms each with a quinone group at the termini. Reduction by the enzyme leads to all six arms being removed, transforming the inert cylinder into a new and active metallo-supramolecular agent that binds junctions. This gives the ability to &#8220;switch-on&#8221; DNA junction formation and binding in response to the presence of two external stimuli &#8211; a human enzyme overexpressed in many disease states, and NADPH &#8211; and absence of inhibitor, giving NAND logic control. Modelling indicates the binding activation originates not in steric unblocking but changes in conformational flexibility. The work provides the foundation for and a route map toward future designs of sophisticated, inert, and supramolecular structures which are transformed by enzymes into new, active, and supramolecular structures for a variety of potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vanillin&#8208;Derived Degradable and Reprocessable Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Epoxy Resins with High Intrinsic Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demand for high&#8208;functionality and miniaturized consumer electronics is driving the development of polymer packing materials with intrinsic high thermal conductivity. Herein, a novel vanillin&#8208;based liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy monomer (BEP) and three curing agents (ICA&#8208;1, ICA&#8208;2 and ICA&#8208;3) containing conjugated aromatic imine structures were synthesized.&#160;The results of X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements show that the structure orderliness of the epoxy resins based on BEP and ICAs increases with the number of conjugated benzene rings in ICAs. Compared with the conventional epoxy reference (0.23 W&#183;m&#8315;&#185;&#183;K&#8315;&#185;), the prepared liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy resins exhibit enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity (0.28&#8208;0.38 W&#183;m&#8315;&#185;&#183;K&#8315;&#185;) due to the synergistic effect from the liquid crystal phase structure in BEP and the additional ordered structure (via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking) in ICAs. Both experimental and molecular dynamics calculation results&#160;show that the thermal conductivity of the epoxy resins is proportional to the length of the conjugated&#160;structures in ICAs. Owing the incorporation of dynamic aromatic imine bonds, the three cured epoxy resins based on BEP and ICAs demonstrate excellent reprocessibility through imine metathesis, and are chemically degradable in the amine solution.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been rapidly developed worldwide, with much attention to fluid dynamic, fluid crystallization, and fluid interfaces, all falling within the realm of fluid chemistry. It is widely recognized that the theory of fluid chemistry has been proven to provide an effective means for the improvement of perovskite crystallization and the enhancement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) performance. In this review, the fluid behavior and aging process of perovskite materials are first investigated, with emphasis on the related improvement methods and chemical mechanisms. Secondly, the internal crystallization chemistry, external interface chemistry and the large&#8208;area PSCs based on the fluid chemistry are discussed. Finally, four specific directions for future studies of fluid chemistry of MHPs are proposed, aiming to harness the theoretical advantages of fluid chemistry and contribute to the industrialization of PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalized Porphyrin&#8208;Based COFs for Conductive Porous Layers in Perovskite Solar Cells to Enhance Electron Injection, Defect Passivation and Lead&#8208;Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the introduction of an intermediate layer to bridge the transport and photoactive layers has become a key strategy for enhancing carrier extraction efficiency. However, traditional approaches are often limited by the seesaw effect, making it challenging to achieve an optimal balance between electron transport and defect passivation. In this study, we employed a Cu2+&#8208;loaded metalized porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF) as a conductive porous layer (CPL) at the perovskite bottom interface. Experimental results showed that a Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF coverage of 19% significantly enhanced electron transport and effectively suppressed long&#8208;distance electron diffusion. Moreover, the carefully designed Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF provided abundant active sites, which improved the film&#8208;forming quality of the perovskite layer, thereby facilitating the beneficial synergy of electron injection and defect passivation. The n&#8208;i&#8208;p type devices achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.41% (0.09 cm2) and 21.99% (1.01 cm2). Using Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF to stabilize the perovskite crystal structure, the unencapsulated devices retained over 83% of its initial efficiency after 2000 hours. Additionally, Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;COF effectively chelated lead ions and thus enhanced the environmental sustainability of PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Crystallinity Wave&#8221;&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Hollow Multi&#8208;Shell Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hollow multi&#8208;shell covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with abundant modular interfaces, high loading capacity, and various microenvironments are expected to hold great potential for chemical separation, heterogeneous catalysis, and energy storage/conversion. However, the synthetic methodology of COF hollow multi&#8208;shell nanoarchitectures has not been established. Herein, we demonstrate an ingenious &#8220;crystallinity wave&#8221;&#8208;induced regional difference ripening strategy to synthesize a series of hollow multi&#8208;shell COF particles with controllable shell numbers and shell thickness. The methodology relies on the isolation effect of the local crystalline COF thin layer inserted between the two layers of amorphous covalent organic polymer by the short&#8208;time Ostwald ripening, so that different regions of the particles exhibit distinct reaction stages before reaching chemical equilibrium in the subsequent dynamic imine exchange reaction, and then regions that tend to hydrolyze dissolve during the complete ripening process to form a hollow multi&#8208;shell structure. Remarkably, this strategy can be extended to prepare other hollow multi&#8208;shell COFs by altering monomers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, the obtained hollow multi&#8208;shell COFs are used as the electrode materials for supercapacitor. Benefiting from the short mass transfer path of hollow multi&#8208;shell structure, ordered channel of COFs, and their high surface area, the as&#8208;prepared particles exhibit remarkably enhanced specific capacitance.</dc:description>

         <title>B &#8592; N Lewis Pair Fusion of N,N&#8208;Diaryldihydrophenazines: Effect on Structural, Electronic, and Emissive Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping of PAHs with boron and/or nitrogen is emerging as a powerful tool to tailor the electronic structure and photophysical properties.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Docking Effect Enabling Rechargeable High&#8208;Voltage Magnesium&#8208;Iodine/Chlorine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries represent a promising energy storage system by offering low cost and dendrite&#8208;less propensity. However, the limited selection of cathode materials, and often with low voltage and capacity, constrain Mg batteries. Herein, by exploiting the ion&#8208;docking effect between two halogen species &#8212; iodine cations (I+) and chlorine anions (Cl&#8208;) &#8212; we activate the cathodic activity of halogens and develop a magnesium&#8208;iodine/chlorine (Mg&#8208;I/Cl) battery prototype with high energy and power density. The ion&#8208;docking effect enables I+ and Cl&#8208; to mutually balance and disperse their charges, weakens the coordination strength between Cl&#8208; and Mg2+ while enhances the stability of I+, thus facilitating the multi&#8208;electron (2+1/3) redox reactions of halogens. We also find the solvation state of iodine species determine the reaction process of the I0/I3&#8208;/I&#8208; redox couples. The here&#8208;developed magnesium&#8208;iodine/chlorine battery features an impressively high discharge plateau of up to 3.0 V with a high capacity exceeding 400 mAh g&#8208;1, and demonstrates a stable lifespan for 500 cycles, with the ability of ultra&#8208;fast charging at 20C and low&#8208;temperature cycling under &#8208;30 &#176;C. These findings may provide new insights for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Mg battery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Zn2+ Ferrying Effect with Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction to Mitigate Space Charge Layer Enables Ultra&#8208;High Utilization Rate Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A major dilemma faced by Zn anodes at high zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is the insufficient supply of ionic carriers that initiate the space charge layer (SCL) subject to rampant growth of Zn dendrites. Herein, an &#8216;anion&#8208;cation co&#8208;regulation&#8217; strategy, associated with a fundamental principle for screening potential electrolyte additives coupling the Zn2+ ferrying effect with anion&#8208;retention capability, are&#160;put forward to construct dendrite&#8208;free, high&#8208;ZUR Zn anode. Taking ninhydrin&#8208;modified ZnSO4 system as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the multiple zincophilic polar groups of ninhydrin facilitate the transport of Zn2+ ions while its electron&#8208;deficient aromatic ring retains SO42&#8208; counterions via anion&#8208;&#960; interaction, constructing an ion&#8208;rich interface that minimizes the SCL&#8208;driven Zn deterioration. Consequently, the Zn anode can endure ~240 h continuous cycling at an ultrahigh ZUR of 87.3%. The superiority brought by ninhydrin is further reflected by the ultralong cycling durability of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries (over 100000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1, ~20&#8208;fold lifespan extension). Even at an ultralow N/P ratio of 1.1 (~90.6% ZUR), the battery with a capacity of ~5.27 mAh cm&#8208;2 can still sustain for 350 cycles, which has been hardly achieved in aqueous Zn batteries. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this strategy is fully validated by a series of additives sharing similar fundamentals.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Redox Shotgun Proteomics Reveals Specific Lipopolysaccharide Effects on Intestinal Epithelial Cells, Mitigated by a Mn Superoxide Dismutase Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteomics and redoxomics are efficient to quantify the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide in intestinal epithelial cells (HT29) at the proteome and at the Cys&#8208;redoxome levels. Oxidative stress is the initial trigger of LPS leading to inflammation. A Mn&#8208;based superoxide mimetic (or mimic) was able to reduce oxidative stress and to mitigate the effects at the proteome level.








Abstract
Overproduction of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant superoxide dismutases (SOD1, SOD2) dysregulation contribute to chronic inflammation such as generated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A kinetic redox shotgun proteomic strategy (OcSILAC for Oxidized cysteine Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture) was used to explore the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects including LPS&#8208;induced oxidation and inflammation cascades on a dedicated intestinal epithelial cell line (HT29&#8208;MD2) together with the potential mitigating role of a Mn&#8208;based SOD&#8208;mimic Mn1. While LPS induced transient oxidative damages at early times (15&#160;min), cells incubated with Mn1 showed, in this time frame, a significantly reduced cysteine oxidation, highlighting Mn1 antioxidant properties. Over time, cysteine oxidation of LPS&#8208;treated cells was counteracted by an overexpression of antioxidant proteins (SOD1, NQO1) and a late (6&#160;h) preponderant increase in SOD2 level. Mn1, when co&#8208;incubated with LPS, attenuated the level of most LPS&#8208;modified proteins, that is, proteins involved in the inflammatory response. Our results highlight Mn1 as a potentially effective antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent to consider in the treatment of IBD, as well as a useful tool for exploring the interconnection between oxidative stress and inflammation.

         <title>Blocking Orbital &#960;&#8208;Conjugation to Boost Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling in Carbonyl&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach, i.e., blocking orbital &#960;&#8208;conjugation via either molecular&#8208;structure distortion or meta&#8208;arrangement of chemical substituents is proposed, to boost spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOC) in carbonyl&#8208;embedded polycyclic heteroatomic emitters. This work not only provides a deep insight into the structure&#8208;property relationship on SOC but also opens the door for designing more efficient OLED emitters with large SOCs.








Abstract
Both reducing singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES1T1) and enhancing spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOCs) are key to improving reverse intersystem crossing rates (kRISC) in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. While considerable efforts have focused on reducing &#916;ES1T1, investigations on SOCs remain limited. Here, blocking &#960;&#8208;conjugation in carbonyl&#8208;embedded polycyclic heteroaromatic (PHA) molecules as potential approach to elevate &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, allowing its hybridization with n&#960;* excitation, thereby increasing SOCs is proposed. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept isomers, DNDK&#8208;1 and DNDK&#8208;2 are synthesized, with different orientations of carbonyl units. DNDK&#8208;1 adopts a heavily twisted structure that hinders &#960;&#8208;conjugation, while DNDK&#8208;2 remains quasi&#8208;planar, maintaining stronger &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Experimental measurements reveals stark differences in their photophysical properties, with DNDK&#8208;1 exhibiting faster kRISC and much higher electroluminescence efficiency. The ab&#8208;initio calculations elucidate that hindered conjugation in DNDK&#8208;1 elevates &#960;&#960;* excitation energy, enabling n&#960;*&#8208;&#960;&#960;* mixing, thus significantly boosting SOCs. In contrast, smooth &#960;&#8208;conjugation in DNDK&#8208;2 leads to marginal n&#960;*&#8208;&#960;&#960;* mixing. In addition, utilizing groups composed of meta&#8208;arranged carbonyl&#8208;Ar&#8208;carbonyl and meta&#8208;arranged N&#8208;Ar&#8208;N units emerges as another approach to block &#960;&#8208;conjugation and enhance SOCs. This joint experimental and theoretical work provides promising pathways to enhance SOCs by blocking &#960;&#8208;conjugation, offering crucial insights for designing carbonyl&#8208;embedded PHA emitters with larger SOCs.

         <title>Construction of Multi&#8208;step Charge Transfer Pathways in Bi0@Bi3+&#8208;KNbO3 for Significantly Accelerated Photoconversion of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoconversion of waste plastics into valuable CO and CH3COOH represents a ground&#8208;breaking strategy for addressing plastic pollution issues. However, this process currently encounters significant challenges, primarily due to the limitation of catalyst activity and the difficulty in breaking C&#8211;C bonds. Herein, we present a novel approach that integrates multi&#8208;step charge transfer pathways with photothermal&#8208;driven reactions to improve photoconversion efficiency. By incorporating Bi0/Bi3+ metal as an electron transport mediator for multi&#8208;step charge transfer, we markedly enhanced the separation and transport of photoelectrons, thereby accelerating the generation of active species. Meanwhile, the heat generated by the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Bi0 drove the reactions related to the photoconversion of polypropylene. Subsequently, the photo&#8208;conversion rates of PP into CO by Bi0@Bi3+&#8208;KNbO3 reached 209.41 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is 27.55 times higher than that achieved with KNbO3. Furthermore, the dual Bi&#8208;Nb sites effectively stabilize the key intermediate *COOH, thereby promoting the production of CH3COOH at a rate of 213.00 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. This strategy of boosting photoconversion activity of PP into CO and CH3COOH offers an effective green solution to the serious issue of plastic pollution.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances and Challenges in Low&#8208;Temperature Upcycling of Waste Polyolefins via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of recent advances in mild catalytic transformations of polyolefins, emphasizing the kinetic and thermodynamic interplay between endothermic C&#9472;C bond cleavages and the exothermic formation of new C&#9472;H, C&#9472;C, and C&#9472;O bonds. The aim is to identify existing challenges and potential routes for catalytic conversions that reduce energy consumption and carbon footprints. 








Abstract
Polyolefin waste is the largest polymer waste stream that could potentially serve as an advantageous hydrocarbon feedstock. Upcycling polyolefins poses significant challenges due to their inherent kinetic and thermodynamic stability. Traditional methods, such as thermal and catalytic cracking, are straightforward but require temperatures exceeding 400&#160;&#176;C for complete conversion because of thermodynamic constraints. We summarize and critically compare recent advances in upgrading spent polyolefins and model reactants via kinetic (and thermodynamic) coupling of the endothermic C&#9472;C bond cleavage of polyolefins with exothermic reactions including hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, metathesis, cyclization, oxidation, and alkylation. These approaches enable complete conversion to desired products at low temperatures (&lt;300&#160;&#176;C). The goal is to identify challenges and possible pathways for catalytic conversions that minimize energy and carbon footprints.

         <title>Biomimetic Localized Gel Electrolyte for Practical Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a biomimetic antifreeze protein localized gel electrolyte (ALGE), which combines electrolyte modification and interface optimization to tackle the challenges of zinc batteries. ALGE suppresses hydrogen evolution and promotes uniform zinc deposition, enabling excellent cycling performance in both symmetric cells and pouch cells. This solution demonstrates scalable potential without relying on costly or exotic materials.








Abstract
Incompatible electrode/electrolyte interface often leads to dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and corrosion, posing significant challenges to the application of Zn anodes. Herein, we introduce a biomimetic antifreeze protein localized gel electrolyte (ALGE) with multifunctional capabilities to address these issues by combining electrolyte modification with interface optimization. ALGE modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure and the hydrogen&#8208;bond network adjacent to the zinc anode, effectively suppressing hydrogen evolution. Additionally, ALGE promotes (002)Zn crystal plane&#8208;dominated deposition by protein&#8208;zinc surface interactions, enabling a long&#8208;range dendrite&#8208;free deposition. The absence of by&#8208;products and inhibited corrosion further highlights the practical potential of ALGE. Symmetric cells with ALGE&#8208;modified zinc demonstrate an impressive lifespan of 610&#160;&#160;h under a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a capacity of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The pouch cell integrating a manganese dioxide cathode and ALGE&#8208;modified Zn anode retains 75.8% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This localized gel electrolyte strategy offers a practical and scalable approach to stabilizing Zn anodes for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.

         <title>PPh3/Isocyanide and N2/Isocyanide Exchange: Pathways to Isolable Alkali Metal Keteniminyl Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of isolable keteniminyl anions through substitution of the phosphine ligand in metalated ylides or the N&#8322; ligand in diazomethanides with isocyanides is reported. The anions feature a bent geometry, with the angle decreasing with increasing donor ability of the nitrogen substituent, and exhibit broad applicability in the formation of heterocycles via cycloaddition reactions. 








Abstract
Keteniminyl anions hold significant promise for advancing ketenimine chemistry, yet their isolation has remained elusive until now. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in ligand exchange reactions at carbon, we report the successful synthesis of a series of isolable alkali metal keteniminyl anions through substitution of the phosphine ligand in metalated ylides or the N&#8322; ligand in diazomethanides with isocyanides. The exchange reactions were found to proceed more rapidly with aryl isocyanides than with the more electron&#8208;rich alkyl&#8208;substituted derivatives and were also more efficient when starting from the diazo compounds. The resulting keteniminyl anions exhibit bent geometries, which can be attributed to a donor&#8211;acceptor interaction with the isocyanide, giving rise to a carbone&#8208;like structure. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the nitrogen enhance backbonding, thus leading to larger bending angles and a more pronounced ynamide character as also evidenced by a blue&#8208;shifted ketenimine stretch in the IR spectrum. The keteniminyl anions react efficiently with unsaturated compounds to form a diverse array of heterocycles, highlighting their potential as versatile building blocks in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Semiconductor Spacers with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure Drive 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells Beyond 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites have emerged as promising photovoltaic materials. However, their further improvement in photovoltaic efficiency is hindered by the large dielectric mismatch and high exciton binding energy caused by the insulating spacers. Herein, two semiconductor spacers, namely MeBThMA and CNBThMA, were developed for 2D RP perovskite solar cells. In contrast to MeBThMA, the CNBThMA spacer, which features a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure, exhibits a larger dipole moment and adopts a face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular stacking arrangement in the single crystal. The unique D&#8208;A structure effectively eliminates the dielectric mismatch between the organic and inorganic layers, contributing the formation of energy levels, adjusting the anisotropic charge transport properties, and improving the film quality of layered RP perovskites. Consequently, the devices based on CNBThMA (nominal n = 5) achieved a champion efficiency of 20.82%, which is a record efficiency for 2D RP PSCs using semiconductor spacers to the best of our knowledge. Our work pioneers a novel way to design organic semiconductor spacers using D&#8208;A structure for highly efficient 2D PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethylene Pretreatment Enhances Ethylene Adsorption and Separation over Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient ethylene/ethane (C2H4/C2H6) separation using low&#8208;energy technologies is crucial for the chemical industry yet remains challenging due to the lack of industrially applicable adsorbents. Cu(I)&#8208;based adsorbents show significant potential; however, traditional synthesis methods often involve complex procedures or reduction steps. Herein, we report that Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO zeolite, synthesized for the first time via a one&#8208;pot method with cyclam as the Cu(II) ligand, exhibits a remarkable C2H4/C2H6 selectivity of 22.6, a C2H4 uptake of 3.08 mmol/g, and a separation factor of 9.4 under ambient conditions by using a C2H4 pretreatment, placing it among the best&#8208;performing zeolitic materials.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Efficient ethylene/ethane (C2H4/C2H6) separation using low-energy technologies is crucial for the chemical industry yet remains challenging due to the lack of industrially applicable adsorbents. Cu(I)-based adsorbents show significant potential; however, traditional synthesis methods often involve complex procedures or reduction steps. Herein, we report that Cu@SAPO-RHO zeolite, synthesized for the first time via a one-pot method with cyclam as the Cu(II) ligand, exhibits a remarkable C2H4/C2H6 selectivity of 22.6, a C2H4 uptake of 3.08 mmol/g, and a separation factor of 9.4 under ambient conditions by using a C2H4 pretreatment, placing it among the best-performing zeolitic materials. The C2H4 pretreatment enhances separation efficiency by partially reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and water resistance through the formation of carbon species during pretreatment. Structural analysis using Rietveld refinement reveals that Cu2+ ions occupy the corners of elliptical single 8-rings (s8r).

         <title>Compacting Molecular Stacking and Inhibiting Self&#8208;Aggregation in Fullerene Transporting Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The underdevelopment of electron transport layer (ETL) materials remains a critical bottleneck limiting the overall photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Fullerene derivatives, such as PCBM, are widely employed ETL materials in PSCs due to their excellent electron affinity and energy level alignment with perovskite layer. However, PCBM suffers from high energy disorder, self&#8208;aggregation predilection, and insufficient defect passivation ability, leading to significant charge carrier recombination and accumulation at interfaces. Herein, a phosphate&#8208;substituted fullerene derivative, FuPE, is developed to enhance the performance of PCBM&#8208;based ETLs for PSCs. Incorporating FuPE efficiently compacts molecular stacking, enforces crystallinity and intermolecular interaction, suppresses self&#8208;aggregation and improves interfacial compatibility for the FuPE:PCBM blend. Such endows the FuPE:PCBM blend film with enhanced electron mobility (0.183 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1), lower trap density, more uniform film morphology, and superior defect&#8208;passivation ability, compared to the PCBM pristine one. Consequently, PSCs employing FuPE:PCBM achieve reduced trap&#8208;assisted recombination, enhanced charge carrier extraction, and thus a remarkable power conversion efficiency exceeding 26% alongside improved operational stability. This work highlights an effective strategy for optimizing fullerene&#8208;based ETLs, advancing the development of highly efficient and durable PSCs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;based batteries provide promising opportunities for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries. Nevertheless, Zn anode encounters severe challenges, such as Zn dendrite formation, surface corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we report a strategy to spontaneously construct a boron&#8208;fluoride dual&#8208;atom regulated SEI (ZnBOF), which involves the formation of a B&#8208;compound coating through etching process and followed by an in&#8208;situ F substitution during the initial electrochemical cycling. The ZnBOF/Zn anode benefit preferential deposition of Zn2+ along the (002) plane without Zn dendrite, and the side reaction including by&#8208;product and HER are dramatically suppressed. A combination of characterization methods, such as X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, show that the B&#8208;containing passivation layer facilitates the transport of Zn2+ and mitigates water&#8208;related side reactions, and the F atoms serve as zincophilic sites that enhance the transfer kinetics of Zn2+. As expected, the well&#8208;designed ZnBOF/Zn anode exhibits ultra&#8208;stable Zn plating/stripping for 5000 h at 2 mA cm&#8208;2. The assembled ZnBOF/Zn||MnO2 batteries show impressive cycling stability, remaining 96.2% of the initial capacity (234.3 mAh g&#8208;1) after 1700 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8208;1. Therefore, this work reveals a dual&#8208;atom synergistic regulated strategy to fabricate a robust SEI for Zn anode, which contributes to the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Structurally Simple Polymer Donor Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Minimal Energy Losses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structurally simple wide bandgap polymer, PBDCT, based on 3,4&#8208;dicyanothiophene, is developed, which is free from halogen substituents and fused ring electron&#8208;deficient building blocks. A record&#8208;breaking low energy loss of 0.476&#160;eV has been obtained, which resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 19.84%, the highest value achieved by halogen&#8208;free polymer donors in binary organic solar cells to date.








Abstract
Energy loss (Eloss) between optical energy gap (Eg) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (eVoc) sets efficiency upper limits for organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, further breaking the limit of Eloss in OSCs is challenging, especially via structurally simple materials in binary OSCs. Herein, a structurally simple nonhalogenated polymer donor, namely PBDCT, is developed for realizing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs with record&#8208;breaking Eloss. The critical building block 3,4&#8208;dicyanothiophene with high electron affinity results in a deep&#8208;lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which effectively reduces radiative and nonradiative recombination energy losses in OSCs. Meanwhile, the finely tuned alkyl chains offer high crystallinity and low energetic disorder for the polymer, which enables efficient exciton dissociation at low energy loss. Moreover, bi&#8208;continuous crystalline fibrillary network structure is formed in the blend consisting of PBDCT due to the optimal aggregation property of the polymer, which is conducive to exciton diffusion and charge transport. Consequently, the OSC with a record&#8208;breaking low Eloss of 0.476&#160;eV has been achieved, which thereby resulted in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.84%, the highest value achieved by nonhalogenated polymer donors in binary OSCs to date. This work demonstrates the prospect of breaking the limit of Eloss and realizing efficiency breakthroughs in OSCs.

         <title>In Situ High Selectivity Contact&#8208;Electroreduction of CO2 to Methanol Using an Imine&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8208;Free Vitrimer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vitrimer catalyst with C&#9552;N bond enables efficient CO2 reduction via contact&#8208;electrocatalysis, driven by water droplet&#8208;induced charges. Imine groups stabilize CO2 adsorption, enrich electrons, and mediate electron transfer, achieving &gt;90% methanol selectivity. The system demonstrates exceptional stability, recyclability, and sustained catalysis, offering a sustainable pathway for CO2 conversion to methanol.








Abstract
Metal catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) face challenges such as high cost, limited durability, and environmental impact. Although various structurally diverse and functional metal&#8208;free catalysts have been developed, they often suffer from slow kinetics, low selectivity, and nonrecyclability, significantly limiting their practical applications. In this study, we introduce a recyclable nonmetallic polymer material (vitrimer) as a catalyst for a new platform in contact&#8208;electrocatalysis. This approach harnesses the contact charges generated between water droplets and vitrimer to drive CO2RR, achieving methanol selectivity exceeding 90%. The imine groups within the vitrimer play a dual role, facilitating CO2 adsorption and enriching friction&#8208;generated electrons, thereby mediating efficient electron transfer between the imine groups and CO2 to promote CO2RR. After 84&#160;h of CO2RR, the system achieved a methanol production rate of 13 nmol&#183;h&#8722;1, demonstrating the excellent stability of the method. Moreover, the vitrimer retains its high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic activity even after recycling. Mechanistic studies reveal that, compared to traditional metal catalysts, the N&#9472;O bond in the imine, which adsorbs the key intermediate *OCH3, breaks more readily to produce methanol, resulting in enhanced product selectivity and yield. This efficient and environmentally friendly contact&#8208;electroreduction strategy for CO2 offers a promising pathway toward a circular carbon economy by leveraging natural water droplet&#8208;based contact&#8208;electrochemistry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The initial monomer free energy of polymerization (&#8710;GROP) is traditionally regarded as the benchmark for the polymer's chemical recyclability. But if we instead consider every ring size present at equilibrium (&#8710;GRCE), a different viewpoint emerges. We found that polymers previously regarded as unsuitable for chemical recycling are highly chemically recyclable at low temperatures under the right concentration and catalytic conditions.








Abstract
Aliphatic polyesters synthesized via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) have properties competitive to incumbent plastic (PE, PP), while simultaneously opening up for chemical recycling to monomer (CRM). However, not all aliphatic polyesters are prone to undergo CRM, and the ability to shift the equilibrium between polymer and monomer is tightly associated with the initial monomer structure. The standard strategy to measure CRM is to evaluate the change in free energy during polymerization (&#8710;GROP). However, &#8710;GROP is only one&#8208;dimensional by assessing the equilibrium between initial monomer and polymer. But under active catalytic conditions, the depolymerization of polymers can lead to formation of larger rings, such as dimers, trimers, tetramers, and so on, via the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium (RCE), meaning that the real thermodynamic recycling landscape is multi&#8208;dimensional. This work introduces a multi&#8208;dimensional chemical recycling to all rings (CRR) via a highly active catalytic system to reach RCE. Thermodynamically &#8710;GRCE is completely different from &#8710;GROP. Using &#8710;GRCE instead of &#8710;GROP allows us to achieve CRR for polymers notoriously difficult to achieve CRM for, as exemplified within by CRR for poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone), poly(pentadecalactone), and mixed polymer systems. Overall, this work provides a new general concept of closing the material loop.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Ammonia Synthesis by Using Zero&#8208;Valent Metal Powder with Alcohols or Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we discovered the first molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation with inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle zero&#8208;valent metal powders and alcohols or water in the presence of a catalytic amount of samarium compounds, where more than 1000 equiv of ammonia were formed based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst. 








Abstract
We have recently achieved a highly effective ammonia formation from dinitrogen using samarium diiodide and water under ambient reaction conditions. However, further research is needed to establish a carbon&#8208;free green ammonia production route without carbon dioxide emissions. In this study, we have developed a novel molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation method using a combination of zero&#8208;valent metal powders as reductants and alcohols or H2O as a proton source under ambient reaction conditions. In this reaction system, samarium compounds serve as crucial electron mediators for the molybdenum complexes. Remarkably, the combination of zinc powder and water in the presence of samarium triiodide facilitates highly selective ammonia production over dihydrogen under ambient reaction conditions, yielding up to 900 equiv of ammonia per Mo atom in the catalyst. Intriguingly, using magnesium powder, known for its potent reducing capability, reduces the requisite amount of samarium compounds to catalytic levels. We believe that the novel insights gained from this reaction system represent a substantial step toward achieving green ammonia production.

         <title>Explainable Synthesizability Prediction of Inorganic Crystal Polymorphs Using Large Language Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilized LLMs for structure&#8208;based general synthesizability prediction along with their explanations. Fine&#8208;tuned LLMs and LLM&#8208;embedding&#8208;based bespoke ML models showed promising performance compared to the traditional graph&#8208;based bespoke ML models. Furthermore, fine&#8208;tuned LLMs can provide explainability by inferring the reasons for determining the synthesizability with simple prompts. 








Abstract
We evaluate the ability of machine learning to predict whether a hypothetical crystal structure can be synthesized and explain those predictions to scientists. Fine&#8208;tuned large language models (LLMs) trained on a human&#8208;readable text description of the target crystal structure perform comparably to previous bespoke convolutional graph neural network methods, but better prediction quality can be achieved by training a positive&#8208;unlabeled learning model on a text&#8208;embedding representation of the structure. An LLM&#8208;based workflow can then be used to generate human&#8208;readable explanations for the types of factors governing synthesizability, extract the underlying physical rules, and assess the veracity of those rules. These explanations can guide chemists in modifying or optimizing non&#8208;synthesizable hypothetical structures to make them more feasible for materials design.

         <title>In situ light&#8208;driven pH modulation for NMR studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange is a fundamental chemical event, and NMR provides the most direct readout of protonation events with site&#8208;specific resolution. Conventional approaches require manual titration of sample pH to collect a series of NMR spectra at different pH values. This requires extensive sample handling and often results in significant sample loss, leading to reduced signal or the need to prepare additional samples. Here, we introduce a novel approach to control pH in NMR samples using water soluble photoacids, which alter the pH of the solution from near neutral to acidic pH upon in situ photo&#8208;illumination. We show that the solution pH can be precisely controlled by choice of illumination wavelength and intensity and sufficient protons are released from the photoacid to achieve meaningful pH change in samples where the molecule of interest has significant buffering capacity, such as a &gt;100 &#181;M protein sample. The pH is monitored in situ using internal standards with pH&#8208;sensitive chemical shifts. This method enables precise, calibrated, non&#8208;invasive change of sample pH within an NMR magnet, dramatically reducing the necessary sample handling. These findings highlight the potential of light&#8208;induced pH control in NMR experiments and increase the robustness and reliability of pH&#8208;dependent studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present the first reductive kinetic resolution of racemic 2H&#8208;azirines to prepare optically enriched N&#8208;H aziridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates, which are bench stable and easily diversifiable building blocks, concomitantly with the corresponding enantiomerically enriched 2H&#8208;azirines. The N&#8208;H aziridines were obtained with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1) and high enantioselectivity (up to 94%). A Hammett study revealed a linear free energy relationship between the &#916;&#916;G&#10727; of the diastereomeric transition states and the &#963;p&#8208; values. DFT calculations and non&#8208;covalent interaction analysis suggested that non&#8208;classical H&#8211;bonding interactions and edge&#8208;to&#8208;face aromatic interactions between the substrate and the ligand are responsible for the stereoselectivity and also for the substrate electronic effects observed in the Hammett study.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Ring Expansion of Furyl Hydrosilanes: Synthesis of&#160;1,2&#8208;Oxasilines as Diels&#8208;Alder Diene Components</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new methods for aromatic ring&#8208;expansion offers a strategic means of transforming abundant aromatic feedstocks into intricate structures via skeletal editing, thereby unlocking valuable avenues for organic synthesis. We report herein a mild and efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;expansion of 2&#8208;silylfurans to form 1,2&#8208;oxasilines with wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. DFT calculations suggest the reaction proceeds through regioselective insertion of furan double bond into a Ru&#8211;H bond, followed by skeletal rearrangement, 1,2&#8208;hydride transfer, and elimination steps. The resulting 1,2&#8208;oxasilines are electron&#8208;rich cyclic dienes with an extrusable and transformable Si&#8211;O linker, which exhibit&#160;unique and versatile reactivity in Diels&#8208;Alder cyclization with electron&#8208;deficient dienophiles, enabling modular assembly of molecular skeletons with higher complexity.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Deformation Mode and Amplitude of Liquid Crystal Actuators through Orthogonal Light and Heat&#8208;Induced Exchanges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are versatile soft actuators known for their flexible texture, low density, and ability to undergo reversible deformations that mimic the behavior of skeletal muscles. These properties make them highly attractive for applications in exoskeletons, soft robotics, and medical devices. However, their functionality is typically limited to simple and discontinuous deformations. This study introduces a novel structural design that enables precise control of both the mode and amplitude of deformation. This design integrates photo&#8208;reactive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties and temperature&#8208;dependent hydrogen bonds into the LCE structure. The o&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties enable irreversible reconfiguration of the LCE crosslinked network through photoreactions, allowing for easy alignment and reshaping of the material. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonds act as "temperature&#8208;dependent locks", regulating the mobility of polymer chains during thermal deformation. By adjusting the heating temperature, the deformation amplitude can be finely tuned across a wide range (0~103%). The synergy of these two mechanisms&#8212;light&#8208;induced irreversible reconfiguration and temperature&#8208;induced reversible H&#8208;bond exchanges&#8212;empowers LCEs to achieve customizable and continuous deformations. This represents a significant advancement in bridging the gap between synthetic actuators and biological motion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;in&#8208;Mesopore Complex for 20 Ah&#8208;Level Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs) have arisen as one of the most promising safe energy storage solutions, yet practical development, especially for the Ah&#8208;level ZABs, is severely plagued by unmanageable side reactions and notorious dendrite proliferation. Here, we propose a cation&#8208;in&#8208;mesopore (CiM) complex chemistry by confining Zn2+ within single&#8208;mesopore cavities to construct a novel paradigm of 20 Ah&#8208;level ZABs. Molecule dynamic and X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure analyses reveal that the single&#8208;mesopore SiO2 (smSiO2) traps Zn2+, replacing H2O molecules in the primary sheath and forming Zn2+&#8208;smSiO2 complexes. In&#8208;situ electrochemical digital holography, in&#8208;situ interface Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, and H&#8208;bonds density analyses clearly confirm that Zn2+&#8208;smSiO2 complexes migrate and adhere onto the metallic Zn, facilitating the formation of mesopore weak H&#8208;bonds interface by disrupting the aggregation of solvated H2O. Consequently, the Zn anode operates over 800 h under 55% depth of discharge, effectively suppressing H2O degradation and dendrite growth. The Zn//VO2 pouch battery demonstrates capacities of 20.5 Ah at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 and 8.59 Ah at 1 A g&#8722;1, and energy density of 65 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 96 Wh L&#8722;1. The proposed cation&#8208;in&#8208;mesopore complex chemistry may mark a substantial step forward towards more sustainable and reliable ZABs.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Coupling Electronic&#8211;Ionic Transport in Organic Mixed Conductors as Cathodes for Efficient Zn&#8211;V Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In conventional electrodes, concentration polarization by unbalanced charge transport and solid&#8208;state diffusion resistance result in sluggish reaction kinetics, hindering the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we propose an integrated mixed electronic&#8208;ionic conductor by spatially coupling charge transport pathways, which could achieve redistribution and fast transport of charge (Zn2+/e&#8208;). Operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed the charge transport mechanisms and intrinsic conducting characteristics at timescale. Through confinement by vanadium oxide, dual&#8208;conductive pathways were self&#8208;assembled at the nanoscale and provided effective charge storage. This provided high charge density and accelerated ionic diffusion in the bulk phase, resulting in more active sites and faster reaction kinetics. Moreover, reversible ionic channels from self&#8208;doping/de&#8208;doping process reduced the dissolution of active materials by protons and enabled conversion chemistry, improving cycling stability at low current density. Consequently, the modulated cathode (PEDOT&#8208;SO3&#8208;ZnVO) delivered a high&#8208;rate performance of 310/148 mAh g&#8208;1 (0.2/10 A g&#8208;1) at 10 mg cm&#8208;2. Importantly, the conventional electrode at 21 mg cm&#8208;2 achieved an ultra&#8208;high areal capacity of 6.0 mAh cm&#8208;2 and superior cycling stability (79.1% retention over 100 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8208;1). This work opens the way for the precise modulation of the electrochemical performance of functional nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;entropy environments enable metal surface&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical biomass conversion offers a sustainable route to diverse products, minimizing environmental impact. However, conventional 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural electrooxidation (HMFOR) catalysts such as Ni(OH)2 and NiS suffer from low conductivity, poor stability, and limited active sites. This work introduces a CoNiMnMoPd high entropy alloy (HEA) to address these limitations by simultaneously maintaining high conductivity, stability, and a high Ni oxidation state, enabling nucleophilic dehydrogenation. The HEA catalyst achieved a 92.5% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) Faradaic efficiency, 89.5% HMF conversion, and 95.8% FDCA selectivity, maintaining performance for over 100 hours. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the multi&#8208;element composition of the HEA enabled Ni sites to maintain a high&#8208;valence state, serving as the primary adsorption sites for HMF, and the dehydrogenation reaction occurs preferentially at non&#8208;Ni sites within the HEA. Compared to monometallic Ni, the d&#8208;band center shift and reduced anti&#8208;bonding filling contributed to a decrease in the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the HMF&#8208;to&#8208;FDCA conversion, from 0.770 eV to 0.567 eV. This work offers novel insights for the development of Ni&#8208;based HEA catalysts for biomass valorization.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple and Rapid Tumor EV Enrichment Enabled by Long DNA Probe&#8208;Guided Entanglement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Specific subpopulations of extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold significant clinical potential for biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis, and therapeutic agents. However, this field remains underutilized due to the lack of straightforward and versatile techniques for isolating EV subpopulations from biofluids. Here, we present LODGE, a long DNA probe&#8208;guided EV entanglement strategy for the simple, rapid, and selective enrichment of tumor&#8208;derived EVs (tEVs) from clinical specimens. LODGE uses two long DNA affinity probes to recognize specific subpopulations, causing them to aggregate with the assistance of splint strands, thereby achieving non&#8208;destructive, high&#8208;yield, and high&#8208;purity separation of tEVs within a short period. Proteomic analysis revealed that the isolated tEVs contributed to the identification of tumor&#8208;associated biomarkers compared to total EVs. Additionally, by incorporating a split G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;containing molecular trap domain, a novel structure that significantly improves the fluorescence emission of thioflavin T (ThT), into DNA affinity probes, we developed an innovative LODGE&#8208;ThT sensing strategy for the highly sensitive profiling of multiple tEV subpopulations. Using data from the tEVs alongside clinical indicators processed with machine learning algorithms, we effectively classified five tumor types. Our results show that LODGE is a promising tool for identifying specific EV subpopulations, fostering their biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Driven Ferroelectric Coordination Polymer Exhibiting Distinct Phase Transitions Under Thermal and Pressure Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the first example of a 1D spiro&#8208;based ferroelectric coordination polymer, which exhibits distinct phase transitions under thermal or pressure stimuli, triggered by the flipping of a spiro ring fragment as well as the deformation of the main chain.








Abstract
Controllable strategies for the design of molecular ferroelectrics have been actively pursued in recent years due to their promising applications in modern electronic devices. In this work, we present a spiro&#8208;driven approach for the design of a new class of molecular ferroelectrics. Using 2&#8208;morpholinoethanol (MEO) as a bidentate chelating ligand and the SCN&#8315; anion as a bridging co&#8208;ligand, we obtained a neutral chain&#8208;like ferroelectric coordination polymer, [Cd(MEO)(SCN)&#8322;]. Interestingly, it undergoes both a thermal&#8208;induced phase transition, driven by ring&#8208;conformational flipping of the spiro&#8208;like [Cd(MEO)] fragment, and a pressure&#8208;induced transition, triggered by significant deformation of the spring&#8208;like [Cd(SCN)&#8322;]&#8734; helical chain. Unlike most previously reported ferroelectric coordination polymers, which often rely on organic cationic guests, this work introduces a new avenue for designing neutral ferroelectric coordination polymers. Overall, the spiro&#8208;driven strategy provides valuable insights and a novel structural motif for the development of advanced molecular ferroelectrics.

Interestingly, it undergoes both a thermal-induced phase transition, driven by ring-conformational flipping of the spiro-like [Cd(MEO)] fragment, and a pressure-induced transition, triggered by significant deformation of the spring-like [Cd(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;&#8322;&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt; helical chain. Unlike most previously reported ferroelectric coordination polymers, which often rely on organic cationic guests, this work introduces a new avenue for designing neutral ferroelectric coordination polymers. Overall, the spiro-driven strategy provides valuable insights and a novel structural motif for the development of advanced molecular ferroelectrics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Reinventing the High&#8208;rate Energy Storage of Hard Carbon: the Order&#8208;degree Governs the Trade&#8208;off of Desolvation&#8211;Solid Electrolyte Interphase at Interfaces</title>

         <dc:description>
A trade&#8208;off (represented by the seesaw in the cover picture) between solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and desolvation is linked to the structural feature of hard carbon for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, as demonstrated by Wei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202425507). In a more disordered state, desolvation and the SEI work in concert. The desolvation process is progressively enhanced with increasing structural ordering.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: A Metastable State Facilitates Low Temperature CO Oxidation over Pt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable surface states play a crucial yet poorly understood role in catalysis. However, they are difficult to isolate and even harder to identify. In their Communication (e202423880), Christian Reece et al. successfully isolate and identify a highly active metastable surface state over Pt nanoparticles, which forms after CO desorbs from well&#8208;coordinated Pt sites. The cover image is a stylised representation of how this state emerges following CO desorption.

         <title>Enhancing Immune Responses Through Modulation of Innate Cell Microenvironments in Lymph Nodes with Virus&#8208;Mimetic Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a versatile platform for co&#8208;delivering antigens and adjuvants, termed virus&#8208;mimetic vaccines (VMVs). VMVs drain into the lymph nodes, recruiting and activating multiple antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs), including CD8+ and CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and neutrophils. This process modulates the innate cell environments, enhancing immune responses.








Abstract
Nanovaccines hold significant promise for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. However, the efficacy of many nanovaccines is often limited by inadequate stimulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Herein, we explore a rational vaccine strategy aimed at modulating innate cell microenvironments within lymph nodes (LNs) to enhance the generation of effective immune responses. Inspired by the structure and natural infection process of viruses, we developed a versatile antigen and adjuvant co&#8208;delivery platform, termed virus&#8208;mimetic vaccines (VMVs). Specifically, polyarginine&#8208;tagged antigens were noncovalently assembled onto nucleic acid nanogels containing cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotide via a salt&#8208;bridge zipper mechanism, which can activate Toll&#8208;like receptor 9. Upon intramuscular immunization, VMVs effectively drained into the LNs, recruiting and activating multiple innate cells, including CD8+ dendritic cells (DCs), CD103+ DCs, macrophages, plasmacytoid DCs, and neutrophils. This activation modulates the innate cell microenvironments and relocates antigen&#8208;presenting cells within LNs, optimizing adaptive immune responses. VMVs induced a robust antigen&#8208;specific immune response, characterized by high levels of neutralizing antibodies, augmented memory T cell activity, and enhanced development of germinal center B cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that dynamic modulation of innate cell microenvironments by VMVs leads to optimized generation of both humoral and cellular immunity against infectious diseases.

         <title>An Olefin Radical Based Thiele's Hydrocarbon Derivative and Macrocyclic Tetraradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A persistent boron&#8208;containing derivative of Thiele's hydrocarbon and a macrocyclic tetraradical were synthesized under mild conditions. They both had an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state, and the macrocyclic tetraradical showed considerable tetraradical character and weak macrocyclic anti&#8208;aromaticity with an anticlockwise ring current. This method to construct a cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated tetraradical paves the way for future developments in cyclic polyradicals.








Abstract
A persistent Thiele's hydrocarbon derivative, containing two five&#8208;membered dioxoborocyclic monoradical units bridged by a p&#8208;phenylene moiety, was generated. It exhibits an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a large singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap. A macrocyclic molecule composed of two units of the Thiele's hydrocarbon derivative was also prepared. The macrocyclic molecule possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state but with considerable tetraradical character. The diradical and tetraradical compounds can be viewed as a zwitterionic species containing olefin radical cations. These newly formed compounds are stable in both the solid state and solution under an inert atmosphere for several days. They have been fully investigated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, and SQUID measurements, as well as theoretical calculations.

It exhibits an open-shell singlet ground state with a large singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap. A macrocyclic molecule composed of two units of the Thiele's hydrocarbon derivative was also prepared. The macrocyclic molecule possesses an open-shell singlet ground state but with considerable tetraradical character. The diradical and tetraradical compounds can be viewed as a zwitterionic species containing olefin radical cations. These newly formed compounds are stable in both the solid state and solution under an inert atmosphere for several days. They have been fully investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV-vis spectroscopy, and SQUID measurements, as well as theoretical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Anionic Double Capture/Displacement to Trigger Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Interpenetrating Polymer Networks with Desired Ionic Conductivity for Durable Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpenetrating polymer network interface is constructed to enable a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for the protection of the Zn anodes through an anionic double capture/displacement mechanism, and thereby inhibiting the corrosion of the Zn anode, preventing the side reaction, elevating the Zn ion transference number and stabilized the plating/striping of zinc ions.








Abstract
The engineering of single&#8208;ion conductors (SICs) is a promising strategy to stabilize the anode/electrolyte interface in zinc&#8208;ion batteries. However, the commonly employed single&#8208;ion conductive solid or quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes often lead to a significant reduction in overall ionic conductivity, thereby impeding ion diffusion kinetics. Here, we propose a compromise strategy that effectively balances ionic conductivity and ion transference number. Specifically, a single&#8208;ion conductive interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with phase&#8208;functional decoupling is developed solely on the anode side, while a liquid electrolyte is retained on the cathode side. This design facilitates a high ion transference number (0.84) while maintaining the ionic conductivity at an optimal level (12.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1). The single&#8208;ion&#8208;conductive mechanism is unveiled as a spontaneous anionic dual capture/displacement process, which synergizes zincophilic&#8211;hydrophobic functionality to ensure efficient reversible Zn2+ stripping and plating. The modified electrode demonstrates outstanding cycling stability of 1300&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The assembled NH4V4O10//IPNs@Zn full cell exhibits an exceptional lifespan, enduring 9000 cycles with a remarkable retention of 80.8% at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work introduces an effective approach for balancing ionic conductivity and ion transference numbers in SICs, offering a promising pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance SICs.

         <title>Donor&#8208;&#928;&#8208;Acceptor Self&#8208;Adaptive Conjugated Perylene Derivative with Low Solubility, High Capacity, and Swift Ion Transport Kinetics for High Performance Organic Cathode</title>

         <dc:description>
The perylene derivative (DPL), encapsulated within a hollow nanocage terminated with radical PO polymer molecules bearing N&#9472;O radicals, has been conceptualized and designed to showcase high efficiency in potassium storage. This is attributed to the smart construction of helically twisted D&#8208;&#928;&#8208;A self&#8208;adaptive coordination conjugate (TSCC). This design yields exceptional fast&#8208;charging and long durable stability based on the small organic molecules.








Abstract
Organic perylene has been heralded as a promising candidate due to abundant structural diversity and tunability. However, its practical application is severely plagued by facile solubility, scarce redox&#8208;active sites, and andante kinetics behaviors. Herein, the perylene derivative (DPL), i.e., (1,6,7,12&#8208;tetrakis (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxy) perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride) conjugates with polyoxime ester (PO) and is further nested with N, P grafted hollow matrix with anchored Cu single atoms (Cu&#8208;NPC). Such Cu&#8208;NPC@DPL@PO with helically twisted donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) conjugate bridged by Cu atoms was evaluated for K+ storage. Based on extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugated structure, intensified interactions between PO and DPL, the minimal solubility of DPL is approached. Together with the core&#8208;shell solvation structure and compact cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) synergistically improves its long lifespan. The abundant stabled radical nitroxides, isocyano groups, and sp&#8208;C sites contribute greatly to the capacity elevation. The twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A self&#8208;adaptive coordination conjugate (TSCC) significantly elevates the distortion toward for the easier tendency to flipping and vibrating and thus expedited kinetics behaviors. Consequently, Cu&#8208;NPC@DPL@PO reconciles the trade&#8208;off between fast&#8208;charging and long cycle stability involved 8&#8208;electron participation. This work exemplifies the importance of advanced design of the molecular scale engineering, including modulated redox&#8208;active sites and high stability toward for fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;lifespan cell devices.

Ultrafast absorption spectroscopy highlights that the excited state of the radical anion of 4DPAPN, a TADF chromophore employed as a photocatalyst, is not directly involved in a ConPeT mechanism. Instead, its high reducing ability stems from the generation of solvated electrons through a two&#8208;photon process in acetonitrile solution.








Abstract
Recently, in a communication to this journal, Qiao, Jang, and coworkers described an asymmetric photoredox reaction promoted by TADF cyanoarene photocatalysts (specifically 4DPAPN (3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(diphenylamino)phthalonitrile)). The authors claimed that the high reduction potential required for the reaction in acetonitrile was achieved by the radical anion of the photocatalyst in its excited state, which initiated the reaction. This mechanism is usually named consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPeT), in which two photons are involved: the first one to excite the photocatalyst and generate the radical anion 4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; and the second photon to promote 4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; to its excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211;. Employing ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, here we report that, although two photons are indeed involved in this transformation, the excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; is short&#8208;lived, not emissive, and not quenched by the organic substrate employed in the reaction, opposite to what was claimed by the authors. The photocatalyst in the excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; can generate a solvated electron that is able to reduce the substrate involved in this chemistry. It is worth noting that a different photochemical mechanism is likely to be operative in CH2Cl2, where solvated electrons are much less stabilized and reduction of the solvent might occur.

         <title>Precise Tuning of Functional Group Spatial Distribution on Porphyrin Rings for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atropisomers o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; and &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) with dual effects are ingeniously designed to efficiently modulate CO2RR selectivity, leveraging hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance to provide adsorption sites and protect intermediates. As a result, the sterically symmetric o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) interacts with carbonate, prevents C&#8211;C coupling, and exhibits excellent CH4 selectivity.








Abstract
Molecular catalysts play a critical role in regulating the selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet the understanding of ligand function is largely restricted to modulating the electronic structure of the metal and reaction kinetics. Herein, a hydroxyl (&#9472;OH) ligand is introduced into a sterically hindered amino&#8208;porphyrin (o&#8208;TAPP) to synthesize the atropisomers porphyrin&#8208;salicylimine&#8208;Cu (o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa) with hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions (O&#9472;H&#8943;O), enabling efficient selection of CO and CH4 under dual effects. Detailed analysis shows that the &#9472;OH of o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) forms a noncovalent hydrogen bond with carbonate, characterized by a bond length of 2.01&#160;&#197; and an angle of 27.6&#176;, and this interaction reduces the reaction energy barrier, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 84% for CH4. Moreover, the steric hindrance effect of the symmetric distribution of &#9472;OH facilitates protonation reactions by preventing C&#8211;C coupling. In contrast, &#9472;OH aggregated on o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945;) forms a pocket&#8208;like hydrogen bond grid, which restricts free CO2 adsorption, and the rapid dissociation of *CO also interrupts the reaction. This work highlights the pivotal role of dual effects induced by ligand atropisomerization in regulating selectivity, offering new insights for the design of efficient molecular catalysts.

Detailed analysis shows that the &#9472;OH of o-Cu-Por-Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) forms a noncovalent hydrogen bond with carbonate, characterized by a bond length of 2.01&#160;&#197; and an angle of 27.6&#176;, and this interaction reduces the reaction energy barrier, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 84% for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, the steric hindrance effect of the symmetric distribution of &#9472;OH facilitates protonation reactions by preventing C&#8211;C coupling. In contrast, &#9472;OH aggregated on o-Cu-Por-Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945;) forms a pocket-like hydrogen bond grid, which restricts free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, and the rapid dissociation of *CO also interrupts the reaction. This work highlights the pivotal role of dual effects induced by ligand atropisomerization in regulating selectivity, offering new insights for the design of efficient molecular catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Ultraviolet Light&#8208;Activated Asymmetric Photopolymerization for the Synthesis of CPL&#8208;Active Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a high&#8208;performance circularly polarized ultraviolet light (CP&#8208;UVL, &#955;em&#160;=&#160;360&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;0.188), achieved through thermodynamic regulation of the chiral supramolecular assembly. The asymmetric photopolymerization of RM257&#8208;based blend film can be realized by utilizing the CP&#8208;UVL as a chiral excitation source, resulting in the generation of blue CPL (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;460&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.072).








Abstract
Circularly polarized ultraviolet light (CP&#8208;UVL) offers significant potential for practical applications in asymmetric photocatalysis and photopolymerization. However, the development of CP&#8208;UVL&#8208;active materials has been hindered by their low emission dissymmetry factors (gem). Here, we present a high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;UVL material for asymmetric photopolymerization, achieved through thermodynamic regulation of a chiral supramolecular assembly. The chiral coassembled enantiomers, R/S&#8208;BNC/OXD&#8208;7, are synthesized using the naphthylamine derivative R/S&#8208;BNC as the chiral donor and OXD&#8208;7 as the achiral acceptor. Upon annealing at different temperatures, OXD&#8208;7 detaches from the chiral coassembly of S&#8208;BNC/OXD&#8208;7 and then self&#8208;assembles into ordered helical nanostructures, exhibiting temperature&#8208;dependent CP&#8208;UVL (&#955;em = 360&#160;nm, with gem up to&#160;+0.188). Remarkably, the strong CP&#8208;UVL emission acts as a chiral excitation source, triggering the asymmetric photopolymerization of RM257 (which contains the achiral dye TPABBI and the photoinitiator Irg651), resulting in the generation of blue CPL (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;460&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.072). This study provides a simple yet effective strategy for designing high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;UVL materials for CPL&#8208;induced asymmetric photopolymerization.

         <title>Thermal Activation of Asymmetry Amplification Effects in Helical Polymer&#8211;Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of helical polymer&#8208;metal complexes between chiral poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) and metal ions can trigger different asymmetry amplification effects, e.g. screw&#8208;sense enhancement, helix inversion, or the sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers effect. Adding a metal&#8208;scavenger resin (nonreversible) or lowering the temperature (reversible) can reverse the amplification, allowing the development of a metal ion or a temperature switch from a single chiral PPA.








Abstract
Dynamic helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) exhibit different asymmetry amplification effects, e.g., helix inversion or screw&#8208;sense induction, in the presence of different external stimuli such as temperature, solvents, or metal ions that usually operate independently through interaction with the pendant on the monomer repeating units (m.r.u.). In this work, we will demonstrate that the helical structure of a chiral PPA can be tamed by playing with two different external stimuli such as temperature and metal ions. Thus, when a metal ion salt is delivered to a chloroform solution of a chiral PPA to generate a chiral PPA (m.r.u.)/Mn+ complex in a ratio of 1.0/&lt;0.5&#160;mol/mol, a temperature&#8208;responsive material is obtained. Interestingly, when the temperature is lowered to about 278&#8211;283&#160;K, the metal ion uncomplexes, which recovers the initial helical structure adopted by the PPA. This complexation&#8211;decomplexation between the chiral PPA and the metal ions is fully reversible and triggers different asymmetry amplification effects&#8208;helix inversion, screw&#8208;sense induction or Sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;Soldiers (SaS), among others&#8212;, allowing the creation of a temperature&#8208;responsive helical polymer&#8211;metal complex (HPMC) from a metal&#8208;responsive helical polymer.

         <title>Elucidating the Role of Electric Fields in Fe Oxidation via an Environmental Atom Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field&#8208;Assisted Fe Oxidation imaged by Environmental Atom Probe. The oxidation of iron (Fe) at the tip of a sharp needle under high electrostatic fields has been visualized using an Environmental Atom Probe (EAP) and corroborated through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and a mean&#8208;field model applied to a multi&#8208;faceted catalytic grain, alongside statistical&#8208;mechanical analyses. EAP observations underscore the impact of surface structures, revealing that Fe oxidation predominantly occurs on exposed facets such as Fe{244} and Fe{112}, while facets with higher coordination numbers like Fe{024}, Fe{013}, and Fe{011} exhibit comparatively lower levels of oxidation. Intense electrostatic fields exert a significant influence on Fe oxidation by polarizing and attracting gas molecules toward the surface, thereby effectively raising the local pressure via enhanced electric field concentrations at the tip&#8216;s apex.







Abstract
We quantify the effects of intensely applied electric fields on the Fe oxidation mechanism. The specimen are pristine Fe single crystals exposing a variety of surface structures identified by field ion microscopy. These crystals are simultaneously exposed to low pressures of pure oxygen gas, on the order of 10&#8722;7&#8197;mbar, while applying intense electric fields on their surface of several tens of volts per nanometer. The local composition of the different surface structures is probed directly and in real time using an Environmental Atom Probe and successfully compared with first principles&#8208;based models. We found that rough Fe{244} and Fe{112} facets are more reactive toward oxygen than compact Fe{024} and Fe{011} facets. Results demonstrate that the influence of an electric field on the oxidation kinetics depends on the timescales that are involved as the system evolves toward equilibrium. The initial oxidation kinetics show that strong increases in electric fields facilitate the formation of an oxide. However, as one approaches equilibrium, high field values mitigate this formation. Ultimately, this study elucidates how high externally applied electric fields can be used to dynamically exploit reaction dynamics at the nanoscale towards desired products in a catalytic reaction at mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Chemical Bonds Containing Hydrogen: Choices for Hydrogen Carriers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen carriers utilizing B&#9472;H, C&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, and O&#9472;H bonds are evaluated for their potential in hydrogen storage and release. Key candidates such as methanol, ammonia, and formic acid are examined with a focus on critical factors influencing performance, including the nature of chemical bonds, reaction pathways, and catalytic processes. Both fundamental and applied research efforts are crucial to advancing hydrogen carrier technologies for large&#8208;scale hydrogen deployment. 








Abstract
Compounds containing B&#9472;H, C&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, or O&#9472;H bonds with high hydrogen content have been extensively studied as potential hydrogen carriers. Their hydrogen storage performance is largely determined by the nature of these bonds, decomposition pathways, and the properties of the dehydrogenation products. Among these compounds, methanol, cyclohexane, and ammonia stand out due to their low costs and established infrastructure, making them promising hydrogen carriers for large&#8208;scale storage and transport. They offer viable pathways for decarbonizing society by enabling hydrogen to serve as a clean energy source. However, several challenges persist, including the high temperatures required for (de)hydrogenation, slow kinetics, and the reliance on costly catalysts. To address these issues, strategies such as chemical modification and catalyst development are being pursued to improve hydrogen cycling performance. This review highlights recent progress in hydrogen carriers with B&#9472;H, C&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, or O&#9472;H bonds. It examines the fundamental characteristics of these bonds and carriers, as well as advances in catalyst development. Our objective is to offer a comprehensive understanding of current state of hydrogen carriers and identify future research directions, such as molecular modification and system optimization. Innovations in these areas are crucial to advance hydrogen storage technologies for a large&#8208;scale hydrogen deployment.

         <title>A Sequential Release Micro&#8208;nano System for Colitis Therapy via Gut Microbiota and Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The micro&#8208;nano system achieves the sequential release of drugs in response to gut microbiota and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inulin prebiotics restore gut microbiota balance. Selenium compounds scavenge ROS and promote macrophage polarization, while 3&#8208;oxolithocholic acid suppresses TH17&#8208;cell differentiation. As a multifactorial therapeutic approach, inulin microspheres containing nanomicelles target the gut microbiome and immune responses for treating acute colitis.







Abstract
Commencing with the breakdown of the intestinal barrier, various pathogenic factors, such as dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, harmful inflammatory cytokines, and immune system imbalance, collectively contribute to the development of colitis. Numerous interventions focusing on single factors have been developed to provide short&#8208;term therapeutic benefits, but the continued existence of unresolved pathogenic factors can lead to disease exacerbation. Here we have designed a multicomponent system&#8208;inulin microspheres encapsulating selenium&#8208;containing nanomicelles, aiming to tackle the multiple factors associated with colitis. This micro&#8208;nano drug delivery platform achieves sequential release of drugs in the inflamed colon, with each component of the system functioning independently and jointly. The outer layer of inulin supplies nutrients for probiotics. The inner core comprises selenocystamine and 3&#8208;oxolithocholic acid, which polarize macrophages towards an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype and regulate adaptive immunity by inhibiting TH17&#8208;cell differentiation, respectively. In an acute colitis mouse model, this therapeutic system ameliorates colonic inflammation, enhances the abundance of gut microbiota, and modulates the mucosal immune system, showing potential in preventing colitis.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Molecular Design for Dual Circularity: Polyester with Complementary Mechanical and Chemical Recyclability under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual circularity concept to prevent plastic waste accumulation is presented by Yue Han and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202421431). The concept is exemplified for triarylmethane&#8208;containing polyesters and their facile closed&#8208;loop recyclability via complementary mechanical and chemical routes. For the polymers with dual circularity, it is recommended to proceed with mechanical recycling when we can, and switch to chemical recycling when we must.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrate electrocatalytic reduction to ammonia occurs with exceptional performance on ultrathin&#8208;sheet&#8208;assembled Fe80Ni20 nanoflowers, as described by Jason Lam et al. in their Research Article (e202500167). Mechanistic studies revealed that NO3&lt;M&#8208;&gt; preferentially adsorbs and is reduced to NO2&lt;M&#8208;&gt; on the Fe surface. Subsequently, NO2&lt;M&#8208;&gt; is efficiently hydrogenated to NH3 on the Ni surface. This in&#8208;tandem mechanism between Fe and Ni significantly enhances the electrocatalytic reduction of NO3&lt;M&#8208;&gt; to NH3.

         <title>[C2N4H7O][NH2SO3]: High&#8208;Performance Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Ditrigon Coupled Guanylurea Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on unit coupling strategy, a high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) functional unit, guanylurea ([C2N4H7O]+), was proposed, and a novel KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like UV NLO crystal [C2N4H7O][NH2SO3] was designed and synthesized. This crystal achieves an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second harmonic generation response (6.2&#215;KDP), and a large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm).







Abstract
The Development of high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wave ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals is critical in the field of optoelectronic functional crystals. High&#8208;performance NLO functional units are crucial for achieving desired target crystals. In this study, a promising group, guanylurea ([C2N4H7O]+, abbreviated as GU), was investigated using a unit coupling strategy. Furthermore, by modifying the KBe2BO3F2 template structure at the molecular level, the first metal&#8208;free guanylurea sulfamate [C2N4H7O][NH2SO3] was successfully synthesized. This crystal achieved an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.2&#215;KDP), and large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm). In addition, the remarkable phase&#8208;matching capability provides the potential for a fourth&#8208;harmonic generation (266&#8197;nm) in the Nd: YAG laser. Theoretical calculations indicated that GU and its favorable arrangement were primarily responsible for the large SHG effect and birefringence. Our study demonstrates that the GU group is promising for the development of UV NLO crystals.

&lt;p&gt;Based on unit coupling strategy, a high-performance nonlinear optical (NLO) functional unit, guanylurea ([C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), was proposed, and a novel KBe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like UV NLO crystal [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O][NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] was designed and synthesized. This crystal achieves an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second harmonic generation response (6.2&#215;KDP), and a large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Development of high-performance short-wave ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals is critical in the field of optoelectronic functional crystals. High-performance NLO functional units are crucial for achieving desired target crystals. In this study, a promising group, guanylurea ([C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, abbreviated as GU), was investigated using a unit coupling strategy. Furthermore, by modifying the KBe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; template structure at the molecular level, the first metal-free guanylurea sulfamate [C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O][NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] was successfully synthesized. This crystal achieved an effective balance between the short UV cutoff edge (227&#8197;nm), strong second-harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.2&#215;KDP), and large birefringence (0.225@1064&#8197;nm). In addition, the remarkable phase-matching capability provides the potential for a fourth-harmonic generation (266&#8197;nm) in the Nd: YAG laser. Theoretical calculations indicated that GU and its favorable arrangement were primarily responsible for the large SHG effect and birefringence. Our study demonstrates that the GU group is promising for the development of UV NLO crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Assembly of Single&#8208;Crystal 2D Porphyrin&#8208;Based Organic Polymers via Dative B&#9472;N Bonds and Halogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pioneering instances of single&#8208;crystal 2D porphyrin&#8208;based organic polymers, namely BN&#8208;Cl and BN&#8208;Br, have been successfully synthesized through an innovative synergistic assembly approach that leverages halogen bonding and dative B&#8211;N interactions. Both BN&#8208;Cl and BN&#8208;Br crystals can attain sizes exceeding 1&#160;mm, making them ideal candidates for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD) analysis to elucidate their intricate structures. Remarkably, their single crystals exhibit exceptional photocatalytic performance in generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen, without the necessity of adding sacrificial agents.








Abstract
The rigorous synthetic methodologies have significantly impeded the progress in developing single&#8208;crystal extended organic polymers. Notably, the existence of macroscopic single&#8208;crystalline 2D porphyrin&#8208;based organic polymers has never been documented in the literature until now. In this study, we present a groundbreaking example of single&#8208;crystal 2D porphyrin&#8208;based organic polymers that are compatible with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD) for precise structural elucidation. Their formation is fundamentally dependent on the synergistic assembly facilitated by dative B&#9472;N bonds and halogen bonds. These crystals exhibit remarkable stability in both air and aqueous environments. Notably, the formation of the B&#8211;N Lewis pairs within these crystals significantly enhances the separation of photogenerated carriers, and their single crystals demonstrate exceptional photocatalytic activity for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen, without the requirement for sacrificial agents. This pioneering discovery establishes a new approach for crystalline control within the realm of organic polymers.

         <title>Modulating Binding Strength and Acidity of Benzene&#8208;Derivative Ligands Enables Efficient and Hysteresis&#8208;Free Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We systematically explored the impact of binding strength and acidity of a library of molecules on the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite surface to fabricate efficient and hysteresis&#8208;free perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Ultimately, (2&#8208;phenylethyl)phosphonic acid (PEPA) has the optimal passivation effect and enhances the charge extraction capability, achieving a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 32.13% (certified 31.72%) for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Passivating defects at the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite/C60 interface without impeding interfacial charge transport can effectively enhance the efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). Herein, we study the impact of benzene&#8208;derivative ligands with elaborately modulated binding strength and acidity on wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites for high&#8208;performance perovskite/silicon TSCs. Specifically, the acidity/alkalinity and binding strength are preliminarily tuned using different functional groups of &#8208;PO&#8323;H&#8322;, &#8208;COOH, and &#8208;NH&#8322;, and further finely adjusted by altering the chain lengths between the benzene ring and the functional groups. The results show that strong binding is indispensable for effectively suppressing voltage loss. However, the commonly used benzylphosphonic acid (BPPA) for firm surface binding exhibits too strong acidity that can etch the perovskite surface, resulting in halide&#8208;vacancy defects and pronounced hysteresis. Increasing the side chain length of BPPA to (2&#8208;phenylethyl)phosphonic acid not only enables a suitable acid dissociation constant (pKa) to avoid acid&#8208;induced etching but also achieves robust anchoring to the perovskite surface with a parallel adsorption orientation, which reduces the charge transport barrier at the interface. These properties enable strong&#8208;adsorption surface termination (SAST) of the perovskite surface while preventing acid&#8208;induced etching. As a result, the SAST strategy achieves a remarkable efficiency of 32.13% (certified 31.72%) for hysteresis&#8208;free perovskite/silicon TSCs.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of S(IV)&#8208;Stereogenic Sulfinimidate Esters by Sulfinamide Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfinamide activation strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of S&#8208;chiral sulfinimidate esters by employing a naturally occurring cinchonidine catalyst is disclosed. The catalytically obtained enantioenriched sulfinimidate esters offer a versatile platform for the construction of a wide range of S&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfilimines and sulfoximines.








Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled approaches for the synthesis of S&#8208;stereogenic compounds have propelled significant advancements in asymmetric synthetic chemistry. In contrast, control over S&#8208;heteroatom (e.g., O) bond formation to access sulfinimidate esters remains an underexplored area. Drawing inspiration from recent progress in electrophilic amide activation, herein, we present a sulfinamide activation strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of S&#8208;chiral sulfinimidate esters. This method involves the activation of racemic sulfinamides by sulfonyl chloride, yielding a reactive aza&#8208;sulfinyl mixed anhydride intermediate. Employing a naturally occurring cinchonidine catalyst, the process achieves excellent enantiocontrol in the subsequent formation of S&#9472;O bonds with alcohols involving a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process, resulting in sulfinimidate esters with excellent enantioselectivity. The catalytically obtained enantioenriched sulfinimidate esters offer a versatile platform for the construction of S&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfilimines and sulfoximines, with promising applications in asymmetric synthesis and drug discovery.

         <title>Constructing Stable and Wavelength&#8208;Extended Heptamethine Cyanines&#160;via Donor Ectopic Substitution for NIR&#8208;IIa/b Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic NIR&#8208;II dyes, particularly cyanine fluorophores, offer high molar extinction coefficients, biocompatibility and structural tunability and are popular for non&#8208;invasive, high&#8208;resolution and &#8208;contrast in vivo imaging. However, achieving stable, long&#8208;wavelength and large Stokes shift NIR&#8208;II cyanine suitable for NIR&#8208;IIa/IIb bioimaging is still a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a novel strategy that extends the emission wavelength by the enhanced HOMO&#8208;LUMO separation through simple donor ectopic substitution at the terminal structure of NIR&#8208;II cyanine. Compared to the original NIR&#8208;II cyanine Flav7, these novel dyes (NIR&#8208;ACs) exhibited a significant emission redshift and larger Stokes shift, with the maximum emission wavelength exceeding 1300 nm (NIR&#8208;IIa) and a tail emission exceeding 1500 nm (NIR&#8208;IIb). Notably, they also demonstrate excellent stability and deeper tissue imaging ability in vivo imaging. Finally, through surface modification of nanoparticles, NIR&#8208;ACs nanoparticles (NPs) have successfully achieved high&#8208;contrast tumor and bone&#8208;targeted detecting as well as multicolor imaging, providing robust tools for in&#8208;vivo diagnostics and biomedical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiro&#160;Units Embedded in the B/N Center for Constructing Highly Efficient Multiple Resonance TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This research departs from the conventional molecular design strategy that utilizes spiral units solely as side chains, terminal groups, or linkage units. Instead, we integrate the rigid 9,9'&#8208;spirobi[fluorene] (SF) unit fully or partially into the boron/nitrogen multiple resonances (B/N&#8208;MR) emitting core and successfully developed a range of new proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept isomerized MR thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, SF&#8208;BN1, SF&#8208;BN2, SF&#8208;BN3, and SF&#8208;BN4. Remarkably, these novel emitters exhibit exceptionally narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values of 15&#65374;21 nm in dilute toluene solutions and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 90% in doped films. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on SF&#8208;BN1 achieved high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 29.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.13, 0.08), closely aligning with the BT.2020 blue emission standard. Sky&#8208;blue OLEDs based on SF&#8208;BN3 can achieve a high EQE of 29.8%, with a narrow FWHM value of 18 nm; the hyperfluorescent (HF) OLEDs based on SF&#8208;BN3 improved the EQE of 35.5%. Moreover, we elucidated subtle variations in the connectivity of chemical functional groups within emitters and the polar environment and doping concentrations of OLEDs, which can significantly impact these isomers' optical and electroluminescent (EL) properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Weak Attractive Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Weak attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions, specifically CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#8943;O/N contacts, between catalysts and substrates have recently gained renewed attention in asymmetric hydrogenations, despite their historical underappreciation due to challenges in detection. Emerging evidence underscores the significant role of these interactions in improving reactivity and/or enantioselectivity, particularly in sustainable catalytic systems that utilize Earth&#8208;abundant transition metals. This minireview summarizes advancements in asymmetric hydrogenations catalyzed by both noble and Earth&#8208;abundant metal complexes under a H&#8322; atmosphere, with a focus on the roles of CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#183;&#183;&#183;O/N non&#8208;covalent interactions in improving reactivity and/or enantioselectivity. Taking into account the weak attractive character of these non&#8208;covalent interactions, it is expected to help the design of novel chiral transition metal catalysts and develop more efficient asymmetric hydrogenation systems for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of diverse chiral compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of Transmembrane Alkane Monooxygenases to Improve a Key Reaction Step in the Synthesis of Polymer Precursor Tulipalin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone tulipalin A, a defense compound found in tulips, can polymerize via addition at the vinyl group or via ring&#8208;opening polymerization, making it a highly promising monomer for bio&#8208;based polymers. Since the biosynthesis of tulipalin&#160;A in plants remains elusive, we propose an alternative pathway for its synthesis starting from the terpenoid intermediate isoprenyl acetate. While fungal unspecific peroxygenases showed a preference for the unwanted epoxidation of its exo&#8208;olefin group, bacterial alkane monooxygenases were selective for terminal hydroxylation. By combining protein engineering based on de novo structure prediction of the membrane enzymes with cell engineering, the specific activity was increased 6&#8208;fold to 1.83&#160;U&#160;gcdw&#8208;1. Oxidation of the formed allylic alcohol by a three&#8208;enzyme cascade and subsequent lactonization yielded tulipalin A. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of producing the polymer precursor tulipalin&#160;A from terpenoid intermediates and provide a solid foundation for future metabolic engineering endeavors.</dc:description>

         <title>Environmental History is Transferred via Minerals Altering Formose Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is generally accepted that minerals were an important source of prebiotic catalysis. In this work we demonstrate how the prebiotic sugar forming formose reaction is guided to unique reaction compositions in the presence of a variety of minerals. When the same mineral is transferred between multiple sequential batch reactions, a new reaction composition is obtained after each reaction cycle. We attribute this effect to the adsorption of catalytic Ca(OH)2 to mineral surfaces. Further exploration shows that first exposing the mineral surface to the aqueous catalyst allows the mineral to subsequently produce formose outputs without the need for any additional catalyst to be present. The impact of the minerals on the formose reaction is dependent on the previous environment. As such, the mineral surface functions as storage of the preceding environmental conditions. Our work supports the development of chemical complexity through the transfer of information between sequences of chemical environments.</dc:description>

         <title>All Iron&#8208;Group and Platinum&#8208;Group Elements Metal High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEA) are promising catalyst materials for important energy transformations. So far, the focus has been on platinum&#8208;group metals which possess excellent catalytic performance and similar properties, thus being easy to synthesize. However, incorporating more abundant and cheaper elements is preferable for large&#8208;scale applications and is fundamentally more interesting as elements with different properties are expected to greatly affect the structural and electronic characteristics of the resulting alloy. Unfortunately, significant differences in elemental properties greatly complicate the synthesis and require extreme reaction conditions. In this work, we demonstrate the first synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles containing the nine neighboring elements used most often in heterogeneous catalysis: all the iron&#8208;group metals (Fe, Co and Ni) and all the platinum&#8208;group metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt) through a simple low temperature solution process. Remarkably, alloying the iron&#8208;group base metals with the platinum&#8208;group metals results in 50% increase in the catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions (TOF@25mV=1.58 s&#8208;1) compared to the equivalent alloy containing only platinum&#8208;group metals conditions (TOF@25mV=1.2 s&#8208;1). This activity is three times that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst (TOF@25mV=0.58 s&#8208;1) demonstrating simultaneous reduction in precious metal content and performance enhancement of electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Enabled, Light&#8208;Driven Decarboxylative Oxygenation of Amino Acid Derivatives and Short Peptides using O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a photocatalytic method for the decarboxylative oxygenation of amino acid derivatives and short peptides using dioxygen as a green oxidant. A reverse catalytic strategy utilizing Lewis basic diphenyl diselenide as a Lewis acid catalyst to activate carboxylic acid via chalcogen bonding interaction&#160;is the key to this work. This synthetic method is tolerant of functionalities present in both natural and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, enabling the efficient synthesis of C&#8208;terminal amides or imides. Mechanistic studies suggest there is a dual noncovalent interaction between diphenyl diselenide and carboxylic acid, which allows radical decarboxylation through photoinduced intermolecular electron transfer. This new activation mode of carboxylic acids will add a new dimension to classical decarboxylative reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing Intermediates Formation on Atomically Pd&#8208;Bridged Cu/Cu2O Interfaces for Kinetics&#8208;Matching Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical C&#8208;N coupling of CO2 and nitrogenous species provides a promising approach for synthesizing valuable chemicals such as urea, amides, and other C&#8208;N compounds. However, the unbalanced formation of C&#8208; and N&#8208;intermediates results in slow C&#8208;N coupling kinetics. Herein, we report an atomically Pd&#8208;bridged Cu/Cu2O (Pd1&#8208;Cu/Cu2O) catalyst, synthesized through the in situ electrochemical reconstruction of Pd1&#8208;Cu2Te nanosheets. This catalyst features Pd&#8208;Cu dual sites that significantly enhance C&#8208;N coupling both thermodynamically and kinetically. The reconstructed Pd1&#8208;Cu/Cu2O achieves a urea yield rate of 31.8 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat.&#8208;1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 42.2%, along with excellent stability over 100 h.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical C-N coupling of CO2 and nitrogenous species provides a promising approach for synthesizing valuable chemicals such as urea, amides, and other C-N compounds. However, the unbalanced formation of C- and N-intermediates results in slow C-N coupling kinetics. Herein, we report an atomically Pd-bridged Cu/Cu2O (Pd1-Cu/Cu2O) catalyst, synthesized through the in situ electrochemical reconstruction of Pd1-Cu2Te nanosheets. This catalyst features Pd-Cu dual sites that significantly enhance C-N coupling both thermodynamically and kinetically. The reconstructed Pd1-Cu/Cu2O achieves a urea yield rate of 31.8 mmol h-1 gcat.-1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 42.2%, along with excellent stability over 100 h. In situ spectroscopic examinations and theoretical calculations disclose that the Pd-Cu dual sites on Pd1-Cu/Cu2O modulate the reduction kinetics of CO2 and NO3-, balance the formation of crucial *CO and *NH2 intermediates, and lower the energy barrier for C-N coupling, thereby facilitating urea synthesis. Furthermore, the Pd1-Cu/Cu2O enables the unprecedented C-N coupling of aniline with CO, resulting in a remarkable acetanilide yield rate of 1021.2 mmol h-1 gcat.-1 with an FE of 23.7%. This heteroatom bridging strategy offers a new pathway for designing efficient electrocatalyst for the synthesis of C-N coupled compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Develop Complex Photocatalytic System of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;type Conjugated Porous Polymers and Benzyl Alcohol Mediated Autocatalysis for Practical Artificial Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 is conceived to be an ideal approach for replacing the industrial anthraquinone method that suffers from hefty energy penalties and environmental toxicity. However, the low concentration of H2O2 resides as the biggest hurdle for industrial production. Herein, with a focus on fabricating high&#8208;performance heterogeneous photocatalysts and establishing a highly efficient complex photocatalytic system, we report the preparation of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;type conjugated porous polymers containing a photosensitizer and redox&#8208;active anthraquinone moiety for endowing highly efficient H2O2 production up to 3.0 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. Further, by exploiting the autocatalytic photooxidation feature of benzyl alcohol, &#8226;OOH as the key species contributing to H2O2 formation received a substantial accumulation, which stems from the collaboration of the photocatalytic and autocatalytic cycle. Mechanistically, the hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between the photocatalyst and benzyl alcohol are formed to lower the free energy of the transition states, thus leading to unprecedently high efficiency in photosynthesis of H2O2 up to 140.4 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, with the concentration of 35.1 mmol L&#8208;1 and apparent quantum yield of 49%. This work provides critical insights in advancing sustainable energy conversion research.</dc:description>

         <title>Macromolecule&#8208;Enriched Solvation Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a viable alternative for sustainable and cost&#8208;effective energy storage, yet their energy density is curtailed by relatively low voltage outputs (&lt; 4 V) due to the lack of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes. Here, for the first time, we describe a high&#8208;voltage Na+ electrolyte featuring a macromolecule&#8208;enriched solvation architecture. The vulnerable small molecules in the Na+ solvation shell are replaced by macro polyamide (PA) molecules with high thermodynamic resilience, ensuring a wide electrochemical stability window for the electrolytes with suppressed oxidative/reductive decomposition. Concomitantly, the anions engage in H&#8208;bonding with the amido groups of PA, which not only stabilizes the anions against hydrolysis, but also delivers a high Na+ transference number of 0.93. Importantly, the nitrogen&#8208;rich composition of the macromolecule&#8208;enriched electrolyte (MEE) fosters the formation of robust nitride interphases that impart  enduring stability to both the cathode and anode. As a result, the hard carbon (HC) || NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) full cells demonstrate significant rechargeability even with an ultrahigh cutoff voltage of 4.4 V. Our approach distinctively avoids the use of fluorinated molecules typically found in (localized&#8208;) high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, presenting a novel principle that could revolutionize high&#8208;voltage electrolyte design.</dc:description>

         <title>Urea&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework as a Li&#8208;ion Guided Channel Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Anode in Carbonate&#8208;based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal exhibits great potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. However, the practical application of Li metal anodes is severely hindered by the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites as well as the instability of the spontaneously generated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), causing safety concerns and lifespan issues. Herein, we customize a novel urea&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;531) as an interfacial Li&#8208;ion pump. The COF&#8208;531 is constructed utilizing a highly dynamic urea&#8208;linkage, which balances the low reactivity of N&#8208;rich melamine (MA), and could simultaneously provide abundant lithiophilic N sites and crystallinity ordered ion channels. This structure is able to promote efficient Li+ de&#8208;solvation and transport, leading to uniform deposition via inhibiting dendrites growth. As a result, the COF@Li anode exhibits remarkable cycling performance under high current density (10 mA cm&#8208;2 over 11500 h and 20 mA cm&#8208;2 over 6000 h in the symmetric Li cells, and 1013 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles under 8.4 A g&#8208;1 in a COF@Li || S&#8208;in&#8208;CMK&#8208;3 cell), setting a new benchmark for long&#8208;cycle performance in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. Remarkably, the COF&#8208;531 can be produced at a low&#8208;cost (~58.6 USD kg&#8208;1) on a kilogram scale. This work&#160;addresses a critical bottleneck in the commercialization of Li&#8208;metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Euphane Triterpenoids Using Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Euphane triterpenoids are widely distributed in nature and show various intriguing bioactivities, but relatively few synthetic routes to them have been described. Here we report asymmetric convergent total syntheses of euphanes involving two triterpenoids and two nortriterpenoids: euphol, 25,26,27&#8208;trisnor&#8208;3&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;euphan&#8208;24&#8208;al, euphorbiumrin D and oxo&#8208;tirucall&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;3,20&#8208;dione. The syntheses employ an enantioselective Antilla allylboration and intramolecular radical cyclization to construct ring A, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Liebeskind stannane&#8208;thioester coupling to connect ring A with the bicyclic CD system, and a novel radical cascade with metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) to complete the polycyclic architecture. The late&#8208;stage syntheses of both triterpenoids feature a diimide reduction and a MHAT/1,5&#8208;hydrogen transfer cascade to diastereoselectively forge the C20 and C17 stereogenic centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Double&#8208;Chain Copolymer Network via In Situ Polymerization Enables High&#8208;Stability and Lead&#8208;Safe Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made significant progress due to their low cost and high efficiency. However, the long&#8208;term stability and lead toxicity of PSCs remain a huge challenge for further commercialization. Herein, we designed a multifunctional additive PAE with photosensitive properties to overcome these difficulties. A unique double&#8208;chain copolymer network can be constructed via in situ polymerization induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. The multiple active sites in the polymer chains can passivate various defects and enhance charge transfer. Meanwhile, the vast network provides an effective defense for perovskite to stabilize the internal structure and resist harsh external environments, thus delaying the degradation of devices and maximizing the suppression of toxic lead leakage. Remarkably, the devices protected by the network achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.20% (certified as 25.69%), the unencapsulated devices suppressed 80% of lead leakage and the encapsulated devices maintained 93% of the initial PCE after 1000 h in a humid and thermal environment (65 &#176;C and 85% RH).</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling CO&#8208;Tolerance Mechanism in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells via Operando Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO poisoning remains a critical challenge for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Current studies of CO tolerance primarily focus on solid/liquid interfaces (in&#8208;situ conditions), which differ significantly from PEMFCs' solid/liquid/gas triple&#8208;phase interfaces (operando conditions) in microenvironment and mass transport. Herein, we developed an operando transmission infrared spectroscopy method that enables direct observation of CO tolerance mechanism on commercial PtRu/C catalysts in PEMFCs. Under in&#8208;situ conditions, hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity is governed by CO mass transfer, and is insensitive to the availability of active sites, while it is highly sensitive under operando conditions due to enhanced mass transfer, thereby aggravating CO poisoning effects. Notably, 76% of HOR activity can recover upon switching to pure H2. Based on CO band evolution, we proposed a new pathway beyond the traditional bifunctional mechanism of CO tolerance: CO migrates from Pt to Ru sites, undergoing oxidation at potentials as low as 0.01 V vs.&#160;reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).</dc:description>

         <title>Proximal and Remote Hydrocarboxylation of Alkenes with Carbon Dioxide Enabled by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of carbon dioxide and alkenes as feedstocks for the synthesis of carboxylic acids holds great significance in the realm of sustainable chemistry. Nonetheless, achieving selective C&#8722;H bond carboxylation of alkenes with broad applicability has long been a challenging task. Herein, we present a straightforward and unifying approach for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;carboxylic acids through nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical hydrocarboxylation of both functionalized and unactivated, simple alkenes, at proximal and remote sites. Notably, this operationally simple catalytic reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope, having excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities, and is suitable for late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic investigations showed that a nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (Ni&#8208;HAT) pathway is in operation, accounting for the site&#8208;selective hydrocarboxylation protocol for various alkene substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Development of Chemically Tailored Peptide Binders of RNF43/ZNRF3 to Enable Versatile Design of Membrane Protein&#8208;Targeting PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically tailored peptide binders of RNF43/ZNRF3 developed by a structure&#8208;guided design strategy are used to establish a novel E3 ligase&#8208;mediated modular platform for membrane protein degradation. This innovative system enables robust generation of synthetic bispecific chimeras featuring enhanced structural diversity and smaller size. The platform demonstrates broad applicability in degrading diverse membrane&#8208;bound therapeutic targets, including programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).








Abstract
Targeted membrane protein degradation using cell surface E3 ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 via proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represents an effective strategy for treating membrane drug targets that cannot be fully inhibited using traditional inhibitors. Several ingenious chimeras have been developed to tether RNF43/ZNRF3 to target membrane proteins, resulting in the degradation of targets at sub&#8208;nanomolar concentrations both in vitro and in vivo. However, currently available RNF43/ZNRF3 binders are genetically encoded and have poor plasticity, which limits the design and promotion of such PROTACs. Here, we exploited the AlphaFold&#8208;predicted complex structures of ligand&#8208;bound RNF43/ZNRF3 and developed a class of chemically tailored peptide binders for ZNRF3/RNF43. With these peptide binders that can be conveniently prepared by de novo peptide synthesis, we established a new membrane protein degradation platform that allows versatile modular design and targeted degradation of clinically relevant membrane proteins, i.e., PD&#8208;L1 and EGFR. This study presents a new subtype within the PROTAC field to develop therapeutic peptides targeting membrane proteins.

         <title>Amphipathic Antimicrobial Peptides Illuminate a Reciprocal Relationship Between Self&#8208;assembly and Cytolytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we demonstrate a reciprocal relationship between self&#8208;assembly and membrane lytic activity for a class of antimicrobial peptides derived from amphipathic helices. Peptide modifications that stabilized the assembly abrogated membrane activity, while modifications that promoted dynamic behavior induced lytic activity. CryoEM was employed to determine the structure of the AMP assembly, which revealed a unique helical bilayer nanotube. 








Abstract
Amphipathic character, encoded within the polar sequence patterns of antimicrobial peptides, is a critical structural feature that influences membrane disruptive behavior. Similarly, polar sequence patterns induce self&#8208;assembly of amphipathic peptides, which results in the formation of ordered supramolecular structures. The relationship between self&#8208;assembly and membrane activity remains an open question of relevance for the development of effective antimicrobial peptides. Here, we report the structural investigation of a class of lytic peptides that self&#8208;assemble into filamentous nanomaterials. CryoEM analysis was employed to determine the structure of one of the filaments, which revealed that the peptides are self&#8208;assembled into a bilayer nanotube, in which the interaction between layers of amphipathic &#945;&#8208;helices was mediated through hydrophobic interactions. The relative stability of the filament peptide assemblies depended on the influence of sequence modifications on the helical conformation. Antimicrobial assays indicated that cytolytic activity was associated with dynamic disassociation of the filamentous assemblies under the assay conditions. Structural modifications of the peptides that stabilized the filaments abrogated lytic activity. These results illuminate a reciprocal relationship between self&#8208;assembly and antimicrobial activity in this class of amphipathic peptides and that reversible assembly was critical for the observation of biological activity.

         <title>Trifunctionalization of Iodoarenes via Sequence&#8208;Controlled Double Ortho C&#8208;H Acylations by Palladium/Norbornene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a novel palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed trifunctionalization reaction of ortho&#8208;unsubstituted iodoarenes by incorporating two distinct acyl groups at their ortho C&#8208;H positions and replacing the ipso&#8208;iodide with an alkenyl or aryl group. Notably, this transformation was enabled by the alkyl/aryl mixed anhydrides, which were utilized as dual acylation reagents by abstracting their central oxygen atom with electrophilic 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine. Mechanistic studies revealed that the alkyl&#8208;acyl unit of such an anhydride was employed for the first C&#8208;H alkyl&#8208;acylation, and in situ released aryl carboxylate anion was then rapidly activated with triazine chloride to provide an aryl&#8208;acyl electrophile for the second C&#8208;H acylation, thus enabling the trifunctionalization of iodoarenes by termination with an intermolecular Heck or intramolecular arylation reaction. In addition, the synthetic utility of this method is exemplified by the selective manipulation of carbonyl groups of the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Coupling of Carboxylic Acids with Amines and Alcohols via Ynamide Mediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylic acids are readily available chemicals with broad applications in chemistry&#8208;related areas, and their coupling with amines and alcohols is a fundamental transformation in organic synthesis. However, the catalytic enantioselective coupling of carboxylic acids remains elusive, especially for the atroposelective reaction. Here we report a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid (CBA)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with amines and alcohols using ynamides as coupling reagents. The novel enantiocontrol involving CBA&#8208;catalyzed ester addition enables the straightforward construction of axially chiral amides and planar&#8208;chiral esters with high enantioselectivities through atroposelective intermolecular amidation and intramolecular macrolactonization. Diverse medicinally relevant carboxylic acids can undergo direct late&#8208;stage modification by this method. Importantly, this reaction represents the first atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with amines, as well as the first chemocatalytic atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with alcohols. The resulting atropisomeric skeletons can be readily derivatized to chiral ligands and catalysts for asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next&#8208;generation piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to engineer tailor&#8208;made solid&#8208;state assemblies. Using crystal engineering principles, and techniques such as co&#8208;crystallisation, these materials can be engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials that have been structurally characterised by methods such as X&#8208;Ray Diffraction, computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here we present our database of small molecular crystals, and their Density Functional Theory (DFT) predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT (https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular, the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring longitudinal piezoelectric response (d11/d22/d33). This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal piezoelectricity to date.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Amination of 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds and Analogous Reactive Enolate&#8208;Precursors Using Ammonia Under Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein introduce a method for the direct a&#8208;amination of different carbonyl compounds by employing aqueous ammonia as the N&#8208;source. Upon using NH3 in combination with hypochlorites as simple oxidants under phase&#8208;transfer catalytic conditions it is possible to carry out the direct a&#8208;amination of reactive enolate&#8208;precursors such as cyclic b&#8208;ketoesters, oxindoles, as well as malonitriles and malonates with good to excellent yields, while simple ketone precursors being out of the scope thus far. Furthermore, a first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an asymmetric variant by employing a chiral quaternary ammonium salt is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioconvergent Deacylative Functionalization towards &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of readily available prochiral or racemic quaternary carbons to access enantioenriched ones offers a promising alternative to conventional synthesis from tertiary or planar substrates. Unlike desymmetrization that modifies an existing substituent with limited reactivity, a functional group swap can install a new motif that is structurally distinct and non&#8208;derivable from the replaced group. However, achieving enantioconvergence in these quaternary&#8208;to&#8208;quaternary transformations is challenging, especially for acyclic stereocenters. Here, we report that acyl groups of &#946;&#8208;ketonitriles can be stereoselectively replaced by allyl, propargyl, or benzyl moieties using easily accessible alcohols under palladium catalysis. The deacylative functionalization proceeds through a retro&#8208;Claisen&#8208;type elimination of ketonitrile with alkoxide and the absence of diastereoisomerism in the resulting ketenimine anion assists the subsequent asymmetric addition. Together with the pair of &#945;&#8208;substituents, the retained nitrile and the incoming alkyl motif instill significant derivatization potential into the enantioenriched quaternary stereocenters.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzamide&#8208;Directed Hydroarylative Cross&#8208;Couplings Using Minimally Activated Alkenes: Enantioselective Synthesis of Tertiary and Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ir&#8208;systems modified with ferrocene&#8208;based homochiral diphosphonite ligands, prepared from functionalized SPINOL derivatives, promote benzamide&#8208;directed hydroarylative cross&#8208;couplings involving minimally activated alkenes. The processes are highly branched selective and enantioselective. Accordingly, tertiary benzylic stereocenters are generated under byproduct free conditions. This contrasts conventional cross&#8208;coupling approaches, which are less step and atom economical. Preliminary results show that the process extends to the formation of quaternary benzylic stereocenters.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Dendritic Oligo&#8208;Glycerol Cationic Surfactants for Enhanced Antibacterial Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial infections and antibiotic resistance present an ever&#8208;increasing threat to human health worldwide, and medicine urgently needs new alternatives for the successful treatment of bacterial infections. Cationic surfactants have proven to be effective antibacterial agents due to their ability to disrupt bacterial membranes, inhibit biofilm formation, and combat a broad spectrum of pathogens. We employed a orthogonal click chemistry strategy for the efficient modular synthesis of six novel cationic surfactants. Our results emphasize the strong correlation between the surfactant design and its antibacterial potential. Among these six cationic surfactants we identified a prime candidate, which possessed an impressive antibacterial effect against gram&#8208;positive and gram&#8208;negative bacteria, including drug&#8208;resistant strains. We found that our surfactant can prevent biofilm formation and eradicate already existing biofilms. Cryo&#8208;TEM imaging was used to reveal the membrane&#8208;disrupting properties of the surfactant. In&#8208;vivo wound healing experiments underline the surfactants&#8217; ability to inhibit wound infections. Cationic surfactants often face the challenge of balancing strong antibacterial activity with minimal cytotoxicity. Our strategic design and orthogonal click chemistry approach have enabled precise fine&#8208;tuning of molecular structures to achieve an optimal balance between antibacterial efficacy and biocompatibility, effectively overcoming this critical limitation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Binding Energy Is Insufficient for Describing Hydrogen Evolution on Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design principles for metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been extensively studied. While hydrogen binding energy ([[EQUATION]]) has long been used as a HER descriptor during the past decades,&#160;its applicability to HER SACs has been met with significant controversy. Herein, we investigate the effects of HO*/O* poisoning and H* coverage on SACs with varied metal centers and coordination environments using pH&#8208;dependent surface Pourbaix diagrams at the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale and microkinetic modeling. Our findings reveal that HO* poisoning, realistic H* adsorption strengths at active metal sites, and the potential HER activity at the coordinating N&#8208;sites are crucial factors that should be considered for accurate descriptor development. Experimental validation using a series of M&#8208;phthalocyanine/CNT catalysts&#160;confirms the theoretical predictions, with excellent agreement in exchange current densities and the role of N&#8208;sites in Ni/Cu&#8208;phthalocyanine/CNT catalysts. More importantly, the controversy surrounding HER SAC design principles is resolved through a novel 2D microkinetic volcano model that incorporates active sites, H* coverage, and HO* poisoning. This work provides answers to a long&#8208;lasting debate on HER descriptors by establishing [[EQUATION]] and [[EQUATION]] as a combined HER descriptor for SACs, offering new guidelines for catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling Electrode Surface Chemistry in Determining Interphase Stability and Deposition Homogeneity for Anode&#8208;free Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium metal batteries with an anode&#8208;less/&#8208;free configuration could realize competitive energy density, which requires exceptional potassium plating/stripping reversibility via guiding smooth potassium growth and building mechanically stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Electrolyte engineering has been the most widely adopted strategy, but there is less understanding of the electrode effect. We demonstrate that the extent of electrolyte decomposition could also be regulated through electrode surface modification. Elevating the work function of an Al current collector by coating a thin layer of Ni&#8208;decorated carbon nanofiber could greatly suppress the copious solvent reduction, leading to the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs. Such SEIs possess a large elastic deformation energy to accommodate the volume change and a high ionic conductivity to boost the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the potassiophilic nickel species offer abundant active sites to induce homogeneous potassium deposition. Benefiting from the synergy of stable interphases and promoted nucleation, the modified Al enables a 4.4 V anode&#8208;free cell in a normal&#8208;concentration electrolyte without anode precycling.</dc:description>

         <title>The Flexibility of Tetra(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Ligands Controls the Nuclearity and Geometry of Polynuclear MI&#8210;NHC Assemblies</title>

         <dc:description>A series of tetrakisimidazolium salts bearing two di(phenylimidazolium)amine groups linked by differently substituted anthracenes has been prepared. These are H4&#8208;1a(PF6)4 (anthracene bridge), H4&#8208;1b(PF6)4 (phenyl&#8208;anthracene&#8208;phenyl bridge), H4&#8208;1c(PF6)4 (anthracene&#8208;phenyl bridge) and H4&#8208;1d(PF6)4 (anthracene&#8208;phenyl&#8208;anthracene bridge). X&#8208;ray crystallography showed that those ligand precursors having the di(phenylimidazolium)amine connected directly to the anthracene experience restricted rotation about the N&#8722;Canthracene bond. Depending on their flexibility, the reaction of the tetrakisimidazolium salts with Ag2O followed by transmetalation with [AuCl(THT)] yielded octanuclear ([Au8(1a)4](PF6)8), tetranuclear ([Au4(1b)2](PF6)4), hexanuclear ([Au6(1c)3](PF6)6) or octanuclear ([Au8(1d)4](PF6)8) assemblies, demonstrating the direct bonding strategy can be employed for the selective synthesis of polynuclear poly&#8208;NHC (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) metallosupramolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer to Break Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;off of Oxygen Electroreduction Catalysts for Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are regarded as effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, integrating high active and long&#8208;term durability on SACs is still challenging due to the severe limitations of activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. Herein, we report an integrative electrocatalyst combining isolated Fe sites and MoC nanoparticles (MoC/Fe&#8208;NC). MoC nanoparticles accelerate ORR kinetics via the proton&#8208;feeding effect and optimize Fe site microstructure. Thus, MoC/Fe&#8208;NC exhibits a high alkaline ORR activity with half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.916 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, and exceptional durability of 50k cycles with 5 mV E1/2 loss. The observed ORR performance is further verified in a zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) with a high peak power density of 316 mW cm&#8722;2 and operational stability over 1000 h. Moreover, the fabricated temperature&#8208;adaptive quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB can cycle stably for 150 h under alternating temperatures. Theory calculations and experiment characterizations, involving scanning electrochemical microscopy techniques and distribution of relaxation times analysis, reveal that the excellent capabilities of MoC/Fe&#8208;NC arise from accelerated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, weakened *OH adsorption, and strengthened Fe&#8722;N bonds fueled by MoC nanoparticles. This work sheds light on breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off barrier of SACs for energy&#8208;conversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Single Atom Copper Catalyst as a Redox Mediator in the Cathodic Reduction of Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of clean electric energy to activate inert compounds has garnered significant attention. Homogeneous redox mediators (RMs) in organic electrosynthesis are effective platforms for this purpose. However, understanding the RM's electronic structure under operational conditions, electron transport processes at the electrode surface, and substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption dynamics remains challenging. Here, we synthesized a Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC, named Cu&#8208;N&#8208;P@NC) with a CuN3P1 micro&#8208;coordination structure, employing it as a unique cathode redox mediator. Introducing phosphine atoms into the coordination system allowed modulation of the SAC's electronic metal&#8208;support interaction, optimizing catalyst&#8208;substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption dynamics and accelerating electrochemical reactions. Utilizing the heterogeneous SAC strategy, we achieved a novel electro&#8208;reduction coupling ring&#8208;opening reaction of inert quinazolinone frameworks. The Cu&#8208;SAC exhibited exceptionally high catalytic activity and substrate compatibility, operating smoothly at gram&#8208;scale production. Additionally, we applied the SAC to modify 11 natural product molecules. Integrating micro&#8208;coordination environment regulation and theoretical adsorption models elucidated the significant influence of electrode&#8208;RMs&#8208;substrate interactions on reaction kinetics and catalytic efficiency&#8208;a feat challenging for homogeneous RMs. This approach offers a novel pathway for advancing efficient organic electrosynthesis reactions and provides critical insights for mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>From sequence definition to structure&#8208;property relationships in discrete synthetic macromolecules: insights from molecular modeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the exquisite properties emerging from the sequence order in nucleic acids and proteins, researchers are increasingly considering synthetic sequence&#8208;defined macromolecules (SDMs) to reach precise functions, e.g. for catalysis, data storage, energy, and health. While researchers develop iterative techniques permitting the synthesis of perfectly defined sequences, there is still an important gap to achieve the desired properties leading to their utilization as materials. This arises from the fact that the effect of the sequence order on the 3D structure is unknown for most&#160;synthetic SDMs. While the Protein Data Bank gathers hundreds of thousands of elucidated 3D structures, and many more computed (using e.g. AlphaFold), extended information on sequence&#8208;structure relationships do not exist yet for synthetic SDMs. To tackle this problem for relatively flexible macromolecules, one can nowadays utilize the existing tools of molecular modeling. In this Review, we report advanced practices to reveal the 3D structures and the interactions, through the combination of molecular dynamics simulations and network analysis&#160;applied to different&#160;SDMs. By combining the computational results to the experimental ones, we show the potential of this approach for&#160;understanding sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships in discrete macromolecular systems, towards guiding their rational design for specific functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Effects in Membrane&#8208;Electrode&#8208;Assembly CO Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA)&#8208;based CO electrolysis (COE) has demonstrated the capability to produce C2+ products with high faradaic efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current densities. However, most studies on COE have achieved performance benchmarks under strongly alkaline conditions (e.g., &#8805;1 M KOH, pH &#8805; 14), raising the question of whether such high pH levels are essential for optimal performance. In this study, we investigated the effects of different electrolytes (KHCO3, K2CO3, and KOH) on MEA&#8208;based CO electrolysis, focusing on the influence of pH and the impact of anodic oxidation on the selectivity of various liquid products. By adjusting electrolyte concentration and pH, we achieved significant partial current densities for ethanol (189 &#177; 5 mA cm&#8208;2) and propanol (89 &#177; 4 mA cm&#8208;2) using 0.5 M K2CO3. This high performance is attributed to the creation of a moderate local alkaline environment and the relatively high resistance to anodic oxidation. Additionally, durability measurements emphasized the critical importance of eliminating anodic oxidation to optimize MEA&#8208;based COE for ethanol and propanol production.</dc:description>

         <title>High Voltage Design for Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) are recognized as a promising candidate for next generation of safe battery systems, owing to their inherent advantages. However, the performance of traditional ZABs is constrained by a lower theoretical voltage of 1.65 V, presenting a significant challenge in enhancing their practical application. This paper demonstrates a prototype of acid&#8208;alkaline hybrid quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air battery (HSZAB), featuring a unique design in both a new acidic gel electrolyte and battery structure. Our approach involves regulating the electrolyte pH and ionic conductivity to achieve an enhanced theoretical voltage, resulting in an open circuit voltage of up to 2.0 V. Additionally, the HSZAB demonstrates substantially improved peak power density (417 mW cm&#8208;&#178;, five times higher than the conventional alkaline ZABs) and increased energy efficiency (from 60% to 82%). This finding underscores the promising prospects of high voltage zinc&#8208;air batteries, offering a substantial step forward in the field of energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Interfacial Chemistry and Ion&#8208;Solvent Interactions to Enable Reversible Magnesium Metal Anode in Chloride&#8208;Free Mg(TFSI)2 Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passivation of magnesium (Mg) anode in the chloride&#8208;free magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2) electrolyte is a key challenge for Mg metal batteries. Tailoring solvation structure and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been considered an effective strategy. Herein, a series of imidazole co&#8208;solvents with different branched&#8208;chain structures (methyl, ethyl and propyl) are introduced into the Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;ether electrolyte to address the passivation issue. The ion&#8208;solvent interaction, interfacial adsorption effect and SEI formation are comprehensively studied by theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations. Through molecular structure analysis, the long&#8208;chain 1&#8208;propylimidazole (PrIm) exhibits a strong coordination ability to Mg2+ and a favorable parallel adsorption configuration on the Mg surface. As a result, PrIm co&#8208;solvent can not only restructure the solvation sheath of Mg2+, but also act as a dynamic protective shield to repel a part of TFSI&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) away from the Mg surface. Benefited from the synergistic regulation effect of interfacial chemistry and ion&#8208;solvent interactions, the chloride&#8208;free Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;DME+PrIm electrolyte ensures a minimal interface passivation and achieves highly reversible Mg plating/stripping. This work provides a guiding strategy for solvation structure regulation and interface engineering for rechargeable Mg metal battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Upcycling of Polyolefin Waste to Light Aromatics via Coupling C&#8208;C Scission and Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The upcycling of waste polyolefins into light aromatics has great potential to generate hundreds of millions of tons of valuable aromatic carbon feedstock. However, the conventional high&#8208;temperature radical cracking method for aromatizing polyolefins on zeolites faces challenges in aromaticity control and rapid deactivation due to coke. Here, we present a unique strategy that integrates traditional cracking&#8208;aromatization process&#160;of PE&#160;with CO insertion, a key step of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis, achieving a rise of yield of light aromatics by 4 times, with an&#160;absolute value up to 67% by weight at only 280 &#176;C. The insertion of CO into the Ru&#8208;alkyl intermediates formed during polyolefin cracking facilitates the generation of active oxygenate species, guarantees an ideal C&#8208;C chain length range, and smoothing the way for subsequent efficient aromatization on Hol&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5@S1 with a short b&#8208;axis. According to the technical economic analysis, this low&#8208;carbon&#8208;footprint and economic approach can reduce approximately 1/3 of carbon emissions compared to traditional naphtha cracking technologies, and holds promise for reshaping the global aromatic hydrocarbon cycle of petrochemical industry through polyolefin degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Mn&#8208;Br Hybrid Perovskite Assembled by Achiral Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications in various advanced technological fields. CPL activity typically requires compounds that crystallize in noncentrosymmetric chiral space groups. Achieving noncentrosymmetric crystal structures using achiral molecular architectures is highly appealing but remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a strategy for designing and synthesizing high&#8208;performance CPL materials via crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly using achiral architectures. We successfully obtained Mn2+&#8208;based halide enantiomeric hybrids (P&#8208;1 and M&#8208;1), self&#8208;assembled from [MnBr4]2&#8208; anions and rotational symmetric [Pr&#8208;dabco]2+ cations (Pr&#8208;dabco2+ = 1&#8208;Propyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), crystallizing in the chiral space group P212121. The single crystals of 1 exhibit exceptionally high CPL performance, with a luminescence dissymmetry factor |glum| and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 4.8&#215;10&#8208;2 and 86.8%, respectively, thus a record&#8208;high figure of merit (FM) of 4.2&#215;10&#8208;2 among reported Mn2+&#8208;based CPL materials. Furthermore, P/M&#8208;1 based UV&#8208;LED devices demonstrated outstanding light&#8208;emitting performance, including high color&#8208;purity, excellent stability, remarkable luminous brightness (74,591.94 cd m&#8208;2), and a high electroluminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) value of 3.6&#215;10&#8208;2. This study offers a robust strategy for the design and development of high&#8208;performance CPL materials utilizing achiral molecular architectures.</dc:description>

We successfully obtained Mn2+-based halide enantiomeric hybrids (P-1 and M-1), self-assembled from [MnBr4]2- anions and rotational symmetric [Pr-dabco]2+ cations (Pr-dabco2+ = 1-Propyl-1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octan-1-ium), crystallizing in the chiral space group P212121.

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical&#8208;Enzymatic Conversion of PET to Formate Coupled with Nitrate Reduction over Ru&#8208;Doped Co3O4 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reforming presents a sustainable route for the conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8208;) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into value&#8208;added chemicals, such as ammonia (NH3) and formic acid (HCOOH). However, its widespread application has been constrained by low selectivity due to the complexity of reduction processes and thus energy scaling limitations. In this study, the atomically dispersed Ru sites in Co3O4 synergistically interact with Co centers, facilitating the adsorption and activation of hydroxyl radicals (OH*) and ethylene glycol (EG), resulting in a remarkable HCOOH selectivity of 99 % and a yield rate of 11.2 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 surpassing that of pristine Co3O4 (55 % and 3.8 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2). Furthermore, when applied as a bifunctional cathode catalyst, Ru&#8208;Co3O4 achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.5 % for NH3 production (3.54 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) at &#8208;0.3 V vs. RHE. Additionally, we developed a prototype device powered by a commercial silicon photovoltaic cell, enabling on&#8208;site solar&#8208;driven production of formate and NH3 through enzyme&#8208;catalyzed PET and NO3&#8208; conversion. This study offers a viable approach for waste valorization and green chemical production, paving the way for sustainable energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Conversion of Bestmann Ylide into Carbophosphinocarbene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ortho&#8208;carboranyl carbophosphinocarbene (CPC) has been synthesized through a click&#8208;type reaction between the super strained carborane&#8208;fused borirane 1,2&#8208;BN(SiMe3)2&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10 and Bestmann ylide Ph3PCCO. The [Cl(CO)2Ir&#8208;CPC] and [Cl3Ga&#8208;CPC] complexes were synthesized, allowing the measurement of their Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) and the sum of Cl&#8208;Ga&#8208;Cl bond angles (&#8721;ClGaCl), respectively. These data highlight their remarkable electron&#8208;donating ability. Further insights into its electron donating properties were gained through theoretical calculations, including analysis of frontier orbitals and proton affinity (PA). Preliminary reactivity investigations demonstrate that the new CPC readily forms adducts with boranes and can effectively stabilize borenium cations. Its strong nucleophilicity enables reactions with carbon dioxide, while its exceptional Br&#248;nsted basicity allows it to deprotonate imidazolium to generate carbene species.</dc:description>

         <title>Avoiding the Kauzmann Paradox via Interface&#8208;Driven Divergence in States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kauzmann paradox suggests that deeply supercooled liquids can have a lower entropy than the corresponding crystalline solids. While this entropy catastrophe has been thoroughly studied via equilibrium thermodynamics, the solidification process occurs far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium. By analyzing this process experimentally and theoretically, we show that surface speciation in core&#8208;shell particles can perturb the entropy production to an extent that a continuum equilibrium phase transition is not possible. Speciation of the surface causes divergence of associated stress vectors that generate nonequilibrium fluxes and frustrates homogeneous nucleation hence deep undercooling. The asymmetry of the speciation&#8208;derived surface tensor skews the minimum entropy production criterion. We analyze a set of nonequilibrium models, one showing and one averting the entropy catastrophe. Applying thermodynamic speed limits to these models, we show that the Kauzmann paradox takes another form. Deviations from the speed limit diverges the configurational entropy of the glass, but adding an interfacial state avoids the entropy catastrophe with significantly large supercooling.</dc:description>

         <title>Gromomycins: An Unprecedented Class of Triterpene Antibiotics Produced by a Novel Biosynthetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current situation with drug&#8208;resistant microbial pathogens is critical dictating an acute need for novel efficient antibiotics. Herein, we report a new class of antibiotics entitled gromomycins with significant activity especially against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens including methicillin&#8208; and daptomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Gromomycins are pentacyclic triterpenes with a cyclic guanidino group forming the fifth six&#8208;membered ring. We have used transposon mutagenesis to identify the gromomycin biosynthetic gene cluster since it could not be assigned by any available bioinformatics tools, highlighting its unique biosynthetic route. Using gene cluster engineering, feeding experiments, LC&#8208;MS and NMR analyses we have proposed the biosynthetic pathway for gromomycins, which are the first bacterial triterpenes synthesized independently of the squalene pathway. They also exhibit a so far unprecedented cyclization route that utilizes a hexaprenylguanidine linear precursor. Leveraging our understanding of their biosynthesis, we have identified additional gromomycin producers, resulting in the isolation of novel bioactive derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Alcohol Self&#8208;Aggregation: the Preferred Configurations of the Ethanol Trimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four isomers of the ethanol trimer were identified by their rotational spectra aided by extensive quantum chemical calculations. All aggregates show cyclic structures linking the &#8722;OH groups through O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds, and additional C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions. Gauche ethanol conformations are prevalent but there is no homochirality synchronization. Our results underscore the critical changes involved in alcohol aggregation as size increases.







Abstract
An atomic&#8208;level knowledge of the aggregation of archetypal molecular systems is essential to accurately model supramolecular structures and the transition from gas to liquid phase. The structures and forces involved in ethanol aggregation have been investigated using microwave spectroscopy and extensive quantum chemical calculations. Four isomers of the ethanol trimer have been observed and identified based on comparisons between experimental and predicted spectroscopic parameters, and considering collisional relaxation in the supersonic expansion. All observed isomers exhibit O&#8722;H

         <title>Simultaneous Fabrication of P and M Helices in One&#8208;Component Chiral System by Methanol&#8208;Water Mediated Dual Assembly Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a methanol&#8208;water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one&#8208;component chiral system. The conformation of L&#8208;phenylaniline derivates (LBpyF) is controlled to folded state in CH3OH. Addition of H2O into above CH3OH solution of LBpyF results in the simultaneous occurrence of two self&#8208;assembly pathways, due to the synchronous process of 1)&#8197;self&#8208;assembly of folded LBpyF into M&#8208;helices and 2)&#8197;H2O induced unfolding of folded LBpyF molecules followed by self&#8208;assembly of them into P&#8208;helices.







Abstract
The synergetic evolution of multiple chiral structures stemmed from same building units is ubiquitous in nature and vital to living systems, but achieving it in artificial systems remains a challenge. Herein, we report a methanol&#8208;water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one&#8208;component chiral system. The conformation of l&#8208;phenylaniline derivates (LBpyF) is controlled to folded state in CH3OH due to the hydrogen bonds as well as C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between LBpyF and CH3OH. Addition of H2O into above CH3OH solution of LBpyF results in the simultaneous occurrence of two self&#8208;assembly pathways and double networks of P and M helices were therefore formed, due to the synchronous process of 1)&#8197;self&#8208;assembly of folded LBpyF into M&#8208;helices and 2)&#8197;H2O induced unfolding of folded LBpyF molecules followed by self&#8208;assembly of them into P&#8208;helices. The bipyridine core, phenyl ring, amide unit all adapted into different stacking modes in M&#8208;helices and P&#8208;helices, and energy analysis indicated that the minority M&#8208;helices were more thermodynamically favored products. This study provides an approach to explore synergetic evolution of multiple chiral structures by manipulating the multiple assembly pathway.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Characterization of Native Bacterial Biofilms via Dynamic Nuclear Polarization&#8208;Enhanced Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial biofilms cause persistent infections and contribute to antimicrobial resistance. We utilized for the first time hyperpolarized DNP solid&#8208;state NMR to structurally characterize native bacterial biofilm. We collected 1D/2D spectra within seconds/minutes and detected polysaccharide, protein and other signals. These structural information will boost structure&#8208;guided approaches for combating biofilm&#8208;forming microbes.







Abstract
Bacterial biofilms are major contributors to persistent infections and antimicrobial resistance, posing significant challenges to treatment. However, obtaining high&#8208;resolution structural information on native bacterial biofilms has remained elusive due to the methodological limitations associated with analyzing complex biological samples. Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) has shown promise in this regard, but its conventional application is hindered by sensitivity constraints for unlabeled samples. In this study, we utilized high&#8208;sensitivity Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) ssNMR to characterize native Pseudomonas fluorescens colony biofilms. The ~75&#8208;fold sensitivity enhancement provided by DNP enabled structural characterization without isotope labeling or chemical/physical modification. We successfully collected 1D 13C/15N, and 2D 1H&#8722;13C, 1H&#8722;15N and 13C&#8722;13C ssNMR spectra within seconds, minutes or hours, facilitating the identification and quantification of biofilm extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Additionally, DNP ssNMR allowed quantitative detection of both flexible and rigid biofilm components by favorable freezing conditions. This study represents the first application of ultrasensitive DNP ssNMR to characterize a native bacterial biofilm, significantly expanding the capabilities of ssNMR for analyzing the composition and structure of a wide array of in&#8197;vitro and ex&#8197;vivo biofilms. The versatility of this approach will accelerate structure&#8208;guided efforts to combat infections caused by biofilm&#8208;forming microbes.

         <title>Mechanics&#8208;Photophysics Correlation in Tough, Stretchable and Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescence Ionogels Deciphered by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) spectra to establish mechanics&#8208;DMA&#8208;photophysics correlation for ionogels. This resembles parallel and sequential processing of human brain from sensation to cognition. This work provides an enabling strategy towards the early indication of performance of ionogels without laborious characterization.







Abstract
The development of tough, stretchable and long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials holds great significance for manufacturing and processing photoluminescent materials, but limited techniques are available to profile their mechanics&#8208;photophysics correlation. Here we report glassy ionogels, and their mechanical properties and photophysical properties are fused by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), functioning like a human brain that perceives a material instantaneously by linking sensory perception and cognition.

&lt;p&gt;We employ dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) spectra to establish mechanics-DMA-photophysics correlation for ionogels. This resembles parallel and sequential processing of human brain from sensation to cognition. This work provides an enabling strategy towards the early indication of performance of ionogels without laborious characterization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of tough, stretchable and long-lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials holds great significance for manufacturing and processing photoluminescent materials, but limited techniques are available to profile their mechanics-photophysics correlation. Here we report glassy ionogels, and their mechanical properties and photophysical properties are fused by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), functioning like a human brain that perceives a material instantaneously by linking sensory perception and cognition. Depending on two special temperatures presented in DMA curves, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; (glass transition temperature), the ionogels can vary from being either tough with persistent phosphorescence, extensible with effective phosphorescence or resilience with inefficient phosphorescence. Leveraging this method, we achieve stretchable and long-lived RTP ionogels with tensile yield strength of 53&#8197;MPa, tensile strain of 497&#8201;%, Young's modulus of 782&#8197;MPa, toughness of 111.2&#8197;MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and lifetime of 113.05&#8197;ms. Our work provides a simple yet powerful method to reveal the mechanics-photophysics correlation of RTP ionogels, to predict their performance without laborious synthesis and characterization, opening new avenues for applications of RTP materials, including applications in harsh conditions (257&#8197;K or 347&#8197;K), shape memory and shape reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diastereoselective Polypseudorotaxane Formation with Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Co&#8208;crystallization Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective polypseudorotaxane formation was achieved through the simple co&#8208;crystallization of a diastereomeric pillar[5]arene macrocycle and poly(ethylene glycol). During the co&#8208;crystallization process, the concentration gradually increased, allowing the pillar[5]arene and poly(ethylene glycol) to assemble closely. Consequently, the matched packing of the pillar[5]arene side chains facilitated the cooperative arrangement of pillar[5]arenes with the same chirality along the polymer chain.







Abstract
As the number of chiral ring molecules in chiral polyrotaxane increases, the number of possible stereoisomers exponentially increases. Consequently, the selective synthesis of a specific stereoisomer becomes much more challenging. To address this problem, we co&#8208;crystallized poly(ethylene glycol) and a diastereomeric ring molecule, pillar[5]arene, in the solid state. The co&#8208;crystallization formed polypseudorotaxanes with a high diastereomeric excess (ca. 88&#8201;% de), meaning that polypseudorotaxanes containing (S, pS) stereoisomer pillar[5]arene rings were synthesized selectively. By contrast, in solution and evaporation systems, the selectivity remained low (ca. 10&#8201;% de). The results suggested that the packing effect by the co&#8208;crystallization contributed to the denser assembly of ring molecules on the polymeric chain, resulting in the diastereoselective formation. High diastereoselectivity was also observed even in higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(ethylene glycol)s. These selectivities arose from the cooperative effects of the ring molecules on the polymeric chain, which were supported by calculating the stabilization energy.

         <title>Optimized Adsorption of Had and OHad over Amorphous SrRuPtOxHy Nanobelts towards Efficient Alkaline Fuel Cell Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a new class of amorphous SrRuPtOxHy nanobelts (a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs) with excellent performance towards alkaline HOR and AEMFCs. Electrochemical experiments and calculations collectively show that a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs have optimized HBE and OHBE as well as low HOR barrier, which all greatly improve the HOR efficiency.







Abstract
PtRu&#8208;based catalysts toward hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) suffer from low efficiency, CO poisoning and over&#8208;oxidation at high potentials. In this work, an amorphization strategy is adopted for preparation of amorphous SrRuPtOxHy nanobelts (a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs). The a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs has optimized adsorption of intermediates (H and OH), increased number of active sites, highly weakened CO poisoning and enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation ability owing to the special amorphous structure. Consequently, a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs displays superior HOR performance with a mass activity of 7.5&#8197;A/mgPt+Ru, 25 and 5&#8197;times of that of SrRuPt(OH)x NBs and commercial PtRu/C, respectively, and long&#8208;lasting stability. Besides, a peak power density of 750&#8197;mW/cm2 and a specific power of 14.8&#8197;W/mgPt+Ru have been achieved for a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs at a low loading of 0.05&#8197;mgPt+Ru/cm2, surpassing many reported HOR catalysts. Mechanism investigation indicates that Pt and Ru are present in oxide/hydroxide forms and H in a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs participates in HOR. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that there are three catalytic mechanisms participating in a&#8208;SrRuPtOxHy NBs, which all exhibit low catalytic barrier and highly improved HOR efficiency. This work provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts towards fuel cells.

         <title>Artificial Gold Enzymes Using a Genetically Encoded Thiophenol&#8208;Based Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Binding Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of artificial metalloenzymes containing genetically encoded noble&#8208;metal&#8208;binding sites featuring a non&#8208;canonical thiophenol&#8208;based amino acid, which serves as an excellent soft ligand for binding various noble metals, was developed. The corresponding gold(I) enzyme was characterised, confirming gold binding to the thiophenol, and successfully applied in catalytic hydroamination reactions.







Abstract
Incorporating noble metals in artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) is challenging due to the lack of suitable soft coordinating ligands among natural amino acids. We present a new class of ArMs featuring a genetically encoded noble&#8208;metal&#8208;binding site based on a non&#8208;canonical thiophenol&#8208;based amino acid, 4&#8208;mercaptophenylalanine (pSHF), incorporated in the transcriptional regulator LmrR through stop codon suppression. We demonstrate that pSHF is an excellent ligand for noble metals in their low oxidation states. The corresponding gold(I) enzyme was characterised by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and successfully catalysed hydroamination reactions of 2&#8208;ethynyl anilines with turnover numbers over 50. Interestingly, two equivalents of gold(I) per protein dimer proved to be required for activity. Up to 98&#8201;% regioselectivity in the hydroamination of an ethynylphenylurea substrate was observed, yielding the corresponding phenyl&#8208;dihydroquinazolinone product, consistent with a &#960;&#8208;activation mechanism by single gold centres. The ArM was optimized by site saturation mutagenesis using an on&#8208;bead screening protocol. This resulted in a single mutant that showed higher activity for one class of substrates. This work brings the power of noble&#8208;metal catalysis into the realm of enzyme engineering and establishes thiophenols as alternative ligands for noble metals, providing new opportunities in coordination chemistry and catalysis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By empowering the supercapacitor function into the diode, the reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;compatible supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode) and corresponding computing blocks effectively mimic the biological system: Unidirectional ion flow is mimicked based on the significant capacitance difference; Dendritic computing is mimicked based on the tunable ion rectification; Neuromorphic computing is mimicked based on the volatile/nonvolatile charge&#8208;storage.







Abstract
Biological system utilizes unidirectional ion flow to produce and transmit signals. To realize bioinspired artificial intelligence and thus seamless human&#8208;machine interaction, ion rectification devices should be developed. Here, a reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;compatible supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode) is developed by resettling the pseudo&#8208;capacitive and electrochemical&#8208;double&#8208;layer&#8208;capacitive components of a lithium&#8208;ion pseudocapacitor into the positive and negative voltage regions respectively through engineering the redox peaks.

         <title>Mn Doping at High&#8208;Activity Octahedral Vacancies of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 for Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysis in Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8722;Fe2O3/CNT catalyst was synthesized by doping Mn into the highly active octahedral sites, and displays efficient and stable electrocatalytic performance for ORR and Metal&#8208;air batteries. The strong electron donating capability of octahedral sites and synergistic effect between Mn and Fe optimized reaction energy barriers, and the vacancies in &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 located only at octahedral sites were confirmed by the clarification doping sites of Mn.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 with the intrinsic cation vacancies is an ideal substrate for heteroatom doping into the highly active octahedral sites in spinel oxide catalysts. However, it is still a challenge to confirm the vacancy location of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 through experiments and obtain enhanced catalytic performance by preferential occupation of octahedral sites for heteroatom doping. Here, a Mn&#8208;doped &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 incorporated with carbon nanotubes catalyst was developed to successfully achieve preferential doping into highly active octahedral sites by employing &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 as the precursor. Further, the vacancy in &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 was only located on octahedral sites rather than tetrahedral ones, which was first proved by direct experimental evidence through the clarification doping sites of Mn. Notably, the catalyst shows outstanding activity towards oxygen reduction reaction with the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.82&#8197;V and 0.64&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, respectively, as well as the maximum power density of 179 mWcm&#8722;2 and 403 mWcm&#8722;2 for Mg&#8208;air batteries and Al&#8208;air batteries, respectively. It could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the doping Mn on octahedral sites and the substrate &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 along with the modification of the adsorption/desorption properties for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates as well as the optimization of the reaction energy barriers.

Abstract
We introduce the fragment&#8208;pairwise Local Energy Decomposition (fp&#8208;LED) scheme for precise quantification of individual interactions contributing to the binding energy of arbitrary chemical entities, such as protein&#8208;ligand binding energies, lattice energies of molecular crystals, or association energies of large biomolecular assemblies. Using fp&#8208;LED, we can assess whether the contribution to the binding energy arising from noncovalent interactions between pairs of molecular fragments in any chemical system is attractive or repulsive, and accurately quantify its magnitude at the coupled cluster level &#8208; commonly considered as the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; of computational chemistry. Such insights are crucial for advancing molecular and material design strategies in fields like catalysis and therapeutic development. Illustrative applications across diverse fields demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of this theoretical framework, promising profound implications for fundamental understanding and practical applications.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Approach Enables RNA Aptamers to Function as Sensors for Reactive Inorganic Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activity&#8208;based light&#8208;up aptamer system was developed to enable a single RNA aptamer to detect non&#8208;fluorogenic and reactive inorganics. This method can easily turn E. coli into whole&#8208;cell sensors of redox species. Organic chemistry principles can advance aptamers by expanding their target scope without nucleic acid engineering or in vitro selection.







Abstract
Fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamer (FLAP) systems are promising (bio)sensing platforms that are genetically encodable. However, FLAP&#8208;mediated detection of each distinct target necessitates either in vitro selection or engineering of nucleic acid sequences. Furthermore, an aptamer that binds an inorganic target or a chemical species with a short lifetime is challenging to realize. Here, we describe a small&#8208;molecule approach that makes it possible for a single FLAP system to detect chemically unique, non&#8208;fluorogenic, and reactive inorganics. We developed functionalized pre&#8208;ligands of RNA aptamers that bind benzylidene imidazolinones (Baby Spinach, Broccolli, Squash). Reactive inorganics, hydrogen sulfide (H2S/HS&#8722;) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), can specifically convert these pre&#8208;ligands into native ligands that fluoresce with FLAPs. Adaptation of this platform to live cells opened an opportunity for constructing whole&#8208;cell sensors: Escherichia coli transformed with a Baby Spinach&#8208;encoding plasmid and incubated with pre&#8208;ligands generated fluorescence in response to exogenous H2S/HS&#8722; or H2O2. Leveraging the functional group reactivity of small molecules eliminates the requirement of in vitro selection of a new aptamer sequence or oligonucleotide scaffold engineering for distinct molecular targets. Our method allows for detecting inorganic, short&#8208;lived species, thereby advancing FLAP systems beyond their current capabilities.

         <title>Isomerization&#8208;Controlled Aggregation in Photoactive Layer: An Additive Strategy for Organic Solar Cells with Over 19.5&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomeric molecules are employed as additives in organic photovoltaics. Stepwise regulations of acceptor aggregation are realized. Liquid additive LCB retards solvent evaporation, preventing excessive aggregation. Solid additive SCB shortens aggregation period, obtaining tight molecular stacking. While volatile solid additive VCB fine&#8208;tunes intermolecular interactions, achieving optimal molecular aggregation, which lead to significant efficiency enhancement of PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices up to 19.51%







Abstract
Morphology control of the photoactive layer is crucial for achieving high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs), yet it remains a significant challenge in this field. One effective approach is the additive strategy, which fine&#8208;tunes the morphology of the photoactive layer. However, the underlying mechanisms governing the impact of different types of additives from liquid, solid, to volatile solid, on the bulk heterojunction morphology and device performance are not fully understood. Herein, we present an aggregation regulation strategy for acceptor molecules by incorporating three novel isomeric additives: 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene (LCB), 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene (SCB), and 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dichlorobenzene (VCB) into the blend active layer. This approach optimizes the bulk heterojunction morphology and enhances the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Our results reveal that these additives induce stepwise regulation of acceptor molecule aggregation during film formation. The liquid additive LCB primarily extends solvent evaporation time, effectively preventing excessive aggregation, while the solid additive SCB significantly shortens the aggregation period during the film evolution, resulting in the most compact molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Furthermore, the volatile solid additive VCB fine&#8208;tunes the intermolecular interactions and crystallization within the active layer, promoting optimal molecular self&#8208;assembly and aggregation for ideal molecular stacking.

     alt="Isomerization-Controlled Aggregation in Photoactive Layer: An Additive Strategy for Organic Solar Cells with Over 19.5&#8201;% Efficiency"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three isomeric molecules are employed as additives in organic photovoltaics. Stepwise regulations of acceptor aggregation are realized. Liquid additive LCB retards solvent evaporation, preventing excessive aggregation. Solid additive SCB shortens aggregation period, obtaining tight molecular stacking. While volatile solid additive VCB fine-tunes intermolecular interactions, achieving optimal molecular aggregation, which lead to significant efficiency enhancement of PM6:L8-BO-based devices up to 19.51%
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphology control of the photoactive layer is crucial for achieving high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs), yet it remains a significant challenge in this field. One effective approach is the additive strategy, which fine-tunes the morphology of the photoactive layer. However, the underlying mechanisms governing the impact of different types of additives from liquid, solid, to volatile solid, on the bulk heterojunction morphology and device performance are not fully understood. Herein, we present an aggregation regulation strategy for acceptor molecules by incorporating three novel isomeric additives: 4-bromo-1,2-dichlorobenzene (LCB), 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene (SCB), and 2-bromo-1,4-dichlorobenzene (VCB) into the blend active layer. This approach optimizes the bulk heterojunction morphology and enhances the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. Our results reveal that these additives induce stepwise regulation of acceptor molecule aggregation during film formation. The liquid additive LCB primarily extends solvent evaporation time, effectively preventing excessive aggregation, while the solid additive SCB significantly shortens the aggregation period during the film evolution, resulting in the most compact molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Furthermore, the volatile solid additive VCB fine-tunes the intermolecular interactions and crystallization within the active layer, promoting optimal molecular self-assembly and aggregation for ideal molecular stacking. Consequently, the power conversion efficiencies of 19.33&#8201;% and 19.51&#8201;% were achieved for the VCB-processed D18&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO- and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO-based OSCs, respectively, outperforming the LCB-processed and SCB-processed devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminophore Switches Photodynamic Processes via Protein Complexation for Biomarker&#8208;Activatable Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared Type&#8208;I photodynamic chemiluminescent&#8208;protein complex (HEDPN) is designed which can be specifically activated by the tumor&#8208;overexpressed nitroreductase for chemiluminescence&#8208;guided PDT.







Abstract
Despite the potential in cancer therapy, phototheranostic agents often face two challenges: limited diagnostic sensitivity due to tissue autofluorescence and suboptimal therapeutic efficacy due to the Type&#8208;II photodynamic process with the heavy oxygen reliance. In contrast, chemiluminescent theranostic agents without the requirement of real&#8208;time light excitation can address the issue of tissue autofluorescence, which however have been rarely reported for photodynamic therapy (PDT), not to mention less oxygen&#8208;dependent Type&#8208;I PDT. In this work, we synthesize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminophores with the specific binding towards human serum albumin (HSA) to form chemiluminophore&#8208;protein complex for cancer detection and photodynamic therapy. Interestingly, after the complexation with HSA, the chemiluminescence (CL) intensities of chemiluminophores are enhanced by over 10&#8208;fold; meanwhile, the photodynamic process switches from Type&#8208;II (singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;generation dominated) to Type&#8208;I (superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical dominated), while the previously reported activated chemiluminophore with non&#8208;specific HSA binding can't switch photodynamic process. Based on the optimal chemiluminophore, a nitroreductase&#8208;activatable CL probe&#8208;protein complex is synthesized, which specially turns on its CL and Type&#8208;I PDT in hypoxic tumors for precision therapy. Thus, this study provides a complexation strategy to improve phototheranostic performance of chemiluminophores.

         <title>Enhanced Stability and Properties of Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Copolymers through Engineered Coupled Equilibria

         <dc:description>
Replacing an ester by an ether function in the side chain of a chiral benzene1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer (magenta and red disks, resp.) greatly favours its copolymerization with achiral BTA monomers (green disk), due to the minimization of competing species. The resulting supramolecular copolymers exhibit greater stability which translates into better catalytic and rheological properties.







Abstract
Improving the stability of multi&#8208;component and functional assemblies such as supramolecular copolymers without impeding their dynamicity is key for their implementation as innovative materials. Up to now, this has been achieved by a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach, requiring the time&#8208;consuming characterization of a series of supramolecular coassemblies. We report herein that this is possible to significantly enhance the stability of supramolecular copolymers by a minimal change in the chemical nature of one of the interacting monomers. This is achieved by replacing an ester function by an ether function in the structure of a chiral benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer, used as &#8220;sergeant&#8221;, coassembled with achiral monomers, the &#8220;soldiers&#8221;. Pseudo&#8208;phase diagrams, constructed by probing the nature of the coassemblies with multifarious analytical techniques, confirm that the greater stability of the resulting copolymers is mainly due to the minimization of competing species. This leads to better rheological and catalytic properties of the corresponding supramolecular copolymers. Favouring coassembly over undesired assembly pathways must be considered as a blueprint for the development of better&#8208;performing supramolecular multi&#8208;component systems.

         <title>A Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Radical Emission System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic and multi&#8208;emission band radical luminescence systems have been built by co&#8208;assembling inorganic metal salts with carbonyl compounds in ionic liquids. The ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer and ligand&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer effects between metal compounds and organic radicals endow these systems&#8217; multi&#8208;band and multiple stimulus&#8208;response emissions. In addition, such materials have been used to detect radioactive metal ions.







Abstract
Developing new organic radical emission systems and regulating their luminescence properties presents a significant challenge. Herein, we build dynamic and multi&#8208;emission band radical luminescence systems by co&#8208;assembling inorganic metal salts with carbonyl compounds in ionic liquids. After the assembling, dual&#8208;band, and excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emission was observed upon ultraviolet light irradiation, one emission band originates from carbonyl radical after light irradiation, the other band from the ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) state, which benefits from the charge transfer from the radicals to the metal salts. The dual emission centers also introduce excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties for the molecules. In addition, three&#8208;band emission covering the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions can be shown when two or three kinds of metal ions are simultaneously doped into the radical system driven by the ligand&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMMCT). Interestingly, visible light can quickly quench the radical emission of systems, thus realizing a dynamic luminescence. The LMMCT effect and strong supramolecular interactions significantly improve the photoluminescence quantum yield by up to 67.2&#8201;%. Moreover, such materials can be successfully used for detecting radioactive metal ions and information encryption. This study develops a platform for manufacturing various metal&#8208;organic radical emission systems with diverse properties.

         <title>Conditional Relay Activation of Theranostic Prodrug by Pretargeting Bioorthogonal Trigger and Fluorescence&#8208;Guided Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

We devise a click&#8208;photo&#8208;activatable theranostic prodrug platform exemplified by tetrazine&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;conjugated SN&#8208;38 prodrug 1 with masked fluorescence, low cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an IEDDA reaction between the tetrazine unit on the prodrug and a biotinylated trans&#8208;cyclooctene (biotin&#8208;TCO) on the tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell&#8208;selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation to liberate the caged drug SN&#8208;38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells.







Abstract
Bioorthogonalized light&#8208;responsive click&#8208;and&#8208;uncage platform has enabled precise cell surface engineering and timed payload release, but most of such photoactivatable prodrugs have &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; photoactivity leading to the dark toxicity. On the other hand, the conditionally activatable photocage is limited to the application of fluorogenic probe/photosensitizer liberation. Herein, we devise a conditionally activatable theranostic platform based on the tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) construct, in which tetrazine serves as a quencher motif to disable both the fluorescence and photoresponsivity of BODIPY. The uncaged BODIPY upon the bioorthogonal transformation of the tetrazine reinstates fluorescence on&#8208;target to guide the subsequent visible light irradiation thereby releasing the therapeutic payload in situ. The proof of concept for such &#8220;light where is lit up&#8221;&#8208;activated theranostics was demonstrated by the tetrazine&#8208;BODIPY conjugated SN&#8208;38 (1) with masked fluorescence, up to 70&#8197;times&#8208;reduced cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction between tetrazine unit on 1 and a biotinylated trans&#8208;cyclooctene (biotin&#8208;TCO) as a pretargeted trigger on tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell&#8208;selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation (500&#8211;520&#8197;nm) to activate the caged drug SN&#8208;38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells, offering high spatiotemporal precision of disease diagnosis and therapy.

On the other hand, the conditionally activatable photocage is limited to the application of fluorogenic probe/photosensitizer liberation. Herein, we devise a conditionally activatable theranostic platform based on the tetrazine (Tz)-boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) construct, in which tetrazine serves as a quencher motif to disable both the fluorescence and photoresponsivity of BODIPY. The uncaged BODIPY upon the bioorthogonal transformation of the tetrazine reinstates fluorescence on-target to guide the subsequent visible light irradiation thereby releasing the therapeutic payload &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;. The proof of concept for such &#8220;light where is lit up&#8221;-activated theranostics was demonstrated by the tetrazine-BODIPY conjugated SN-38 (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with masked fluorescence, up to 70&#8197;times-reduced cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an inverse electron-demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction between tetrazine unit on &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and a biotinylated &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclooctene (biotin-TCO) as a pretargeted trigger on tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell-selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation (500&#8211;520&#8197;nm) to activate the caged drug SN-38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells, offering high spatiotemporal precision of disease diagnosis and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Fused vs 575&#8208;Ringed Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;Systems: Selective Synthesis, Reactivity and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Scholl reaction has been used for the selective synthesis of two different boron&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems: an unexpected spiro&#8208;formation via dearomatization as well as the desired 575&#8208;ringed &#960;&#8208;extension via cyclodehydrogenation. The two products have fully distinct chemical reactivities, electronic structures, and photophysical properties.







Abstract
Incorporation of heteroatoms and/or non&#8208;hexagonal rings into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can alter their intrinsic structures and physical properties. However, it is challenging to construct PAHs featuring boron/carbon composition and non&#8208;hexagonal combination. Herein, we disclose the selective synthesis of spiro&#8208;type and pentagon/heptagon&#8208;containing boron&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems by the Scholl reaction. Two spiro&#8208;fused organoboranes 1 and 2 and one 575&#8208;ringed boron&#8208;doped nanographene 3 were synthesized. The key point is that the boron&#8208;edged &#960;&#8208;system enabled unexpected spiro&#8208;formation via dearomatization, whereas the boron&#8208;centered &#960;&#8208;system enabled desired 575&#8208;ringed &#960;&#8208;extension via cyclodehydrogenation. The thus&#8208;obtained molecules exhibit the intriguing but fully distinct reactivity, electronic structures and properties, for instance, while 2 may react with Br&#248;nsted acid to display reversible chemochromism and further convert into 1, 3 possesses very broad absorption, short excited&#8208;state lifetime and no fluorescence nature. As disclosed, the boron atom together with the spirocycle region or 575&#8208;ringed structural motif significantly contribute to their characteristic properties. Thus, this study sheds light on control over the Scholl reaction using organoborane &#960;&#8208;systems and will promote the exploration of more sophisticated polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems as organic reactive and optical scaffolds.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Specific Control of Mammalian Gene Expression Using DNA Repair Inducible Ribozyme Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch based on site&#8208;specific DNA lesion&#8208;modified plasmids was designed for cell&#8208;specific control of gene expression. This strategy was demonstrated to allow selective control the expression of different proteins for signal reporting and gene editing in cancer cells, providing a compact system for DNA repair monitoring and precision gene therapy.







Abstract
The ability to control gene expression is vital for elucidating gene functions and developing next&#8208;generation therapeutics. Current techniques are challenged by the lack of cell&#8208;specific control designs or immunogenicity risk from foreign proteins. We develop a DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch that enables cell&#8208;specific control of gene expression in cells and in vivo. This strategy designs plasmids with a DNA lesion (8&#8208;oxoG and O6&#8208;MeG) site&#8208;specifically installed within the ribozyme encoding region, generating active hammerhead ribozyme for mRNA degradation due to transcriptional mutagenesis, whereas DNA repair yields a single&#8208;base mismatch in the ribozyme to abrogate its activity. This strategy is demonstrated to allow specific control of gene expression in cancer cells with overexpressed DNA repair enzymes such as MutY DNA glycosylase and O6&#8208;methylguanine&#8208;DNA&#8208;methyltransferases. It also shows the capability of conditionally regulating the expression of different proteins for signal reporting and gene editing, enabling DNA repair monitoring and targeted gene therapy in cancer cells. This strategy is demonstrated using the inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system for in vivo editing of oncogenic Polo&#8208;like kinase 1 in a mouse model, resulting in significant tumor growth suppression. The DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch may provide a compact system for cell&#8208;specific gene expression control toward precise gene therapy.

         <title>Molecular Conjugated&#8208;Polymer Electrode Enables Rapid Proton Conduction for Electrosynthesis of Ammonia from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyaniline&#8208;based molecular electrode with copper catalyst is reported for selective nitrate electroreduction to ammonia. The polyaniline in the electrode mediates proton transfer reactions involved in the process of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. This work demonstrates the feasibility for molecular engineering of electrode supports to promote the selectivity and energy efficiency for NH3 electrosynthesis from NO3&#8722;.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of ammonia (NH3) from nitrate (NO3&#8722;) using renewable energy holds promise as a supplementary alternative to the Haber&#8722;Bosch process for NH3 production. Most research focuses on tuning the catalytic activity of metal catalysts by modification of the catalyst structures. However, the electrode supports which could influence the catalytic activity have not been well&#8208;explored. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 still exhibit limited energy efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current density. Herein, we report a polyaniline&#8208;based molecular electrode with Cu catalyst for selective and energy&#8208;efficient NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3. In the electrode, the polyaniline promotes protonation of the key intermediate formed during NO3&#8722; reduction at Cu, which circumvents the limitation of the Cu catalyst in the efficiency&#8208;limiting proton transfer step. The molecular electrode produces NH3 at a partial current density of 2.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an energy efficiency of 62&#8201;%, demonstrating much better electrochemical performance than common Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts and indicating the great potential in molecular engineering of electrode supports for selective NO3&#8722; reduction.

         <title>Beyond Dimerization: Harnessing Tetrameric Coiled&#8208;Coils for Nanostructure Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing tetrameric coiled&#8208;coils into CCPO structures can improve their stability and expands the possible topologies that can be constructed. Assembling proteins from two units could be used as delivery systems, as their assembly could be controlled via external modulators. The first cryo&#8208;EM structure of a CCPO is presented.







Abstract
Versatile DNA and polypeptide&#8208;based structures have been designed based on complementary modules. However, polypeptides can also form higher oligomeric states. We investigated the introduction of tetrameric modules as a substitute for coiled&#8208;coil dimerization units used in previous modular nanostructures. Tetramerizing helical bundles can run in parallel or antiparallel orientation, expanding the number of topological solutions for modular nanostructures. Furthermore, this strategy facilitates the construction of nanostructures from two identical polypeptide chains. Importantly, tetrameric modules substantially stabilized protein nanostructures against air&#8211;water interface denaturation, enabling the determination of the first cryo&#8208;electron microscopy three&#8208;dimensional structure of a coiled&#8208;coil&#8208;based nanostructure, confirming the designed agreement of the modules forming a tetrahedral cage.

         <title>Constraining CO2 Coverage on Copper Promotes CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;carbon Products in Strong Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

Diluting CO2 feed enhances CO2 electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products on Cu in strong acid. Reduced CO2 coverage stabilizes intermediates such as *CO2 and *CO, while suppressing C1 (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation. Enriched CO surface coverage and optimized CO adsorption configuration, promote C&#8722;C coupling for C2+ production. This work addresses CO2 reactant loss and advances direct flue gas electrolysis for valuable chemicals and fuels.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products in strong acid presents a promising approach to mitigate the CO2 loss commonly encountered in alkaline and neutral systems. However, this process often suffers from low selectivity for C2+ products due to the competing C1 (e.g., CO and HCOOH) formation and complex C&#8722;C coupling kinetics. In this work, we report a CO2 coverage constraining strategy by diluting CO2 reactant feed to modulate the intermediate distribution and C&#8722;C coupling pathways for an enhanced electrosynthesis of C2+ products in strong acid. Lowering the CO2 feed concentration reduces CO2 coverage on copper catalyst, enriching the surface coverage and optimizing the adsorption configuration of the key CO intermediate for C&#8722;C coupling. This approach efficiently suppresses the formation of undesired C1 products. By employing a 20&#8201;% CO2 feed, we achieved a significant improvement in C2+ Faradaic efficiency, reaching 68&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, approximately 1.7&#8197;times higher than the 41&#8201;% obtained using pure CO2. We demonstrated the direct electroreduction of a 30&#8201;% CO2 feed&#8212;representative CO2 concentration of typical industrial flue gases&#8212;in a full electrolyzer, achieving a C2+ selectivity of 78&#8201;% and an energy efficiency of 23&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Bulk Stereoselective Cationic Polymerization of Vinyl Ethers by the Coordination of ZrCl4 with Tunable Spirocyclic Phosphoric Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective polymerization of vinyl ethers was achieved using ZrCl4 coordinated with a spirocyclic phosphoric acid, featuring low catalyst loads, solvent&#8208;free, high tacticity control, and recyclable catalyst.







Abstract
Control over stereochemistry in poly(vinyl ether)s leads to a notable change in their physical properties, yet remains a grand challenge. Here, we demonstrate the bulk stereoselective cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers using ZrCl4 coordinated with a spirocyclic phosphoric acid (SPA). The widely variable substituents in SPAs exert a profound impact on the stereochemical and activity outcome of the polymerization: the % m of poly(vinyl ether)s linearly increases with the Hammett substituent constant (&#963;) of SPAs; the catalytic activity increases with the &#963;; the large steric hindrance groups lead to decreased polymerization activity. Mechanism studies suggest that the coordination of ZrCl4 with three equivalents of SPAs generates the chiral complex. The complex can abstract chlorine from the initiator/chain end to form the chiral ion pair allowing the selective facial addition of incoming monomers. The catalyst system features characteristics of no solvent, low loads, high tacticity control, high monomer scope, and recyclability.

         <title>Synthesis of Arenesulfenyl Fluorides and Fluorosulfenylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, and &#945;&#8208;Diazocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of arenesulfenyl fluorides (ArS&#8208;F) has been achieved via a Halex reaction. Several arenesulfenyl fluorides have been characterized by NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and FTIR spectroscopy, including structural analysis of two compounds by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group engages in direct, efficient, and highly regioselective&#160;anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes.







Abstract
Sulfenyl fluorides are organic compounds of sulfur in formal oxidation state +2 with the formula R&#8722;S&#8722;F. Although the chloride, bromide, and iodide analogues have been extensively described in the literature, arenesulfenyl fluorides remain essentially unstudied. These structures have been implicated as putative intermediates in established processes to access polyfluorinated sulfur species; however, definitive and direct evidence of their existence has not been obtained, nor has a systematic understanding of their reactivity. Here, we report the synthesis, isolation, and spectroscopic characterization of several arenesulfenyl fluorides, including structural analysis of 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride and 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group undergoes direct, efficient, and highly regioselective anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes. The resulting &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;fluoro thioether adducts can be readily transformed into useful fluorinated motifs, for example by modification of the sulfur groups (to sulfonamides or sulfonyl fluorides), by sulfur elimination (to generate formal C&#8722;H fluorination products), or by Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination (to form vinyl fluorides). Thus, we establish that sulfenyl fluorides are unexpectedly accessible and stable compounds, which serve as versatile reagents for the production of fluorinated organic compounds.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Pt Nanowires with Disordered Shells for Highly Active Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt sub&#8208;nanometer nanowires, which feature a unique architecture with a monoatomic&#8208;layer surface of disordered, bonding&#8208;unsaturated Pt atoms surrounding a crystalline core as narrow as 0.58&#8197;nm in diameter, are succsessfully synthesized. It significantly boosts the electrochemical surface area and catalytic efficiency for formic acid oxidation, a key reaction in direct formic acid fuel cells, which have the potential to outperform current battery technologies for lightweight, long&#8208;lasting portable power.







Abstract
Controlled synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional materials at atomic&#8208;scale dimensions represents a milestone in nanotechnology, offering the potential to maximize atom utilization while enhancing catalytic performance. However, achieving structural stability and durability at such fine scales requires precise control over material structure and local chemical environment. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA) as a small&#8208;molecule modifier, in contrast to conventional long&#8208;chain surfactants, to interact with surface Pt atoms. This approach facilitates the removal of surface Pt atoms bonded to nitrogen atoms in DMA during solubilization in water, effectively stripping the size of Pt nanowires down to sub&#8208;nanometer. The resulting Pt subnanometer nanowires (subNWs) feature a monoatomic&#8208;layer surface composed of disordered, bonding&#8208;unsaturated Pt atoms, and an interior crystalline core as narrow as 0.58&#8197;nm in diameter. These unique structural characteristics confer the Pt subNWs with an electrochemically active surface&#8208;area of 189&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 during formic acid oxidation. Furthermore, the amorphous&#8208;like surface structure lowers the free energy of *OCOH intermediates and inhibits the formation of toxic byproducts CO, demonstrating exceptional electrocatalytic activity of 18.1&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1, surpassing most reported Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Our work introduces a novel strategy for the controlled construction of nanowire&#8208;structures at sub&#8208;nanometer scale, effectively bridging the gap between ultrafine structural design and performance stability.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Diffusion and Crystallization Kinetics Modulation of Two&#8208;Step Deposited Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Film via Reducing Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing formic acid (FA) as cationic solvent retards reaction rate and stabilizes I&#8722;, while further introduction of dithiothreitol (DTT) precisely modulates reaction&#8208;diffusion and crystallization kinetics through establishing a targeted interaction with SnI2, thus obtaining high&#8208;quality perovskite film and highlighting the importance of kinetic balance. Ultimately, the DTT&#8208;incorporated device delivers the highest PCE of 12.68&#8201;% in a DMSO&#8208;free solvent by the two&#8208;step sequential deposition method.







Abstract
The two&#8208;step deposition method effectively mitigates the efficiency decline observed in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPVSCs) with increasing cell area, stemming from film in&#8208;homogeneity. However, the high solubility of SnI2 in the conventionally used solvent isopropyl alcohol, coupled with the absence of effective modulation of reaction&#8208;diffusion process, results in inadequate film coverage and conversion. In this study, we introduce formic acid as the second&#8208;step solvent and introduce dithiothreitol (DTT) to regulate reaction&#8208;diffusion/crystallization kinetics meticulously. Moreover, this research underscores a fundamental principle that the suitable binding energy ranging from &#8722;1.38 to &#8722;10.10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 between ligands and Sn2+ significantly enhances the effectiveness of two&#8208;step crystallization control. Notably, a uniform perovskite film is achieved on large&#8208;scale substrate, and TPVSCs processed with DTT exhibit the highest efficiencies of 12.68&#8201;% for 0.04&#8197;cm2 device and 11.30&#8201;% for 1&#8197;cm2 device among tin&#8208;based perovskite devices in two&#8208;step sequential deposition method, even in the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide. This study lays the groundwork for the potential scale&#8208;up development of lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Divergent Oxidation Reactions of E&#8208; and Z&#8208;Allylic Primary Alcohols by an Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unspecific peroxygenase rAaeUPO&#8208;PaDa&#8208;I&#8208;H catalyses the oxidation of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and aldehyde/acid products, respectively. Both reactions were performed on a preparative scale with yields of up to 80&#8201;%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) catalyze the selective oxygenation of organic substrates using only hydrogen peroxide as the external oxidant. The PaDa&#8722;I variant of the UPO from Agrocybe aegerita catalyses the oxidation of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and carboxylic acid/aldehyde products respectively. Both reactions can be performed on preparative scale with isolated yields up to 80&#8201;%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee). The divergent reactions can also be used to transform E/Z mixtures of allylic alcohols, enabling both product series to be isolated from a single reaction. The utility of the epoxidation method is exemplified in the total synthesis of both enantiomers of the insect pheromone disparlure, including a highly enantioselective gram&#8208;scale transformation. These reactions provide further evidence for the potential of UPOs as catalysts for the scalable preparation of important oxygenated intermediates.

         <title>Through Space &#960;&#8208;Electrons Communication in [2,2]&#8208;Paracyclophanes: Unprecendented Stabilization of Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D spatial configuration of paracyclophanes lowers the activation energy for alkoxyamine to afford stabilized radicals. This family of new compounds is able to initiate nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization and also exhibits antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines.







Abstract
Efforts to understand radical stability have led to considerable progress in radical chemistry. In this article, we investigated a novel approach to enhancing the radical stability of carbon&#8208;centered radicals through space electron delocalization within [2,2]&#8208;paracyclophanes. Alkoxyamines possessing a paracyclophane scaffold exploit face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;interactions between the aromatic rings to effectively lower bond dissociation energy (BDE) for NO&#8722;C bond homolysis. Electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments and computational modeling have confirmed a better stability compared to the analogues without the paracyclophane core. Theoretical analyses further elucidate the role of through&#8208;space electron communication in enhancing radical stability. This study highlights promising applications in fields such as organic synthesis, material science, and drug design. By achieving a low BDE for homolysis, the alkoxyamines efficiently release radicals, enabling successful application in nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP) of styrene, which provides high control over polymer architecture. Additionally, preliminary anti&#8208;proliferative assays reveal that the alkoxyamines exhibit promising anti&#8208;cancer activities against lung, breast, and prostate cells, which is correlated to their ability to release radicals upon homolysis.

         <title>Latent Solvent&#8208;Induced Inorganic&#8208;Rich Interfacial Chemistry to Achieve Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel latent solvent, 1,2&#8208;dibutoxyethane (DBE), is proposed into low&#8208;concentration electrolyte to manipulate the anion&#8208;reinforced solvation sheath. The designed electrolyte exhibits enhanced oxidation resistance, low desolvation energy, and highly stable SEI film with superior potassium storage performances.







Abstract
Low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) have attracted great attention due to their cost effectiveness and low viscosity, but suffer undesired organic&#8208;rich interfacial chemistry and poor oxidative stability. Herein, a unique latent solvent, 1,2&#8208;dibutoxyethane (DBE), is proposed to manipulate the anion&#8208;reinforced solvation sheath and construct a robust inorganic&#8208;rich interface in a 0.5&#8197;M electrolyte. This unique solvation structure reduces the desolvation energy, facilitating rapid interfacial kinetics and K+ intercalation in graphite. Additionally, enhanced anion&#8208;cation interactions promote the formation of a thin and robust interfacial layer with excellent cycling performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Graphite||perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride full cell exhibits a good capacity retention of 80.3&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles, and delivers a high discharge capacity of 131.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study demonstrates the feasibility of latent solvent&#8208;optimized electrolyte engineering, providing a pathway of superior electrochemical energy storage in PIBs.

         <title>Extended Tetrathiafulvalene Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Incorporating 4,5&#8208;Dihydroazuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene Cores</title>

A novel class of extended tetrathiafulvalenes incorporating a dihydro&#8208;azulenoazulene core is presented. Upon oxidation to the dication, a non&#8208;benzenoid, aromatic core is obtained as corroborated by DFT computations, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR/EPR spectroelectrochemistry, and X&#8208;ray as well as electron diffraction studies. The redox and optical properties are finely tuned by ring fusion (benzene, naphthalene or thiophene) at the azulenoazulene core.







Abstract
The introduction of 4,5&#8208;dihydroazuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene as a central core between two 1,4&#8208;dithiafulvene (DTF) units provides a novel class of extended tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) electron donors. Herein we present the synthesis of such compounds with the azulenoazulene further expanded by annulation to benzene, naphthalene, or thiophene rings. Moreover, unsymmetrical donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores with one DTF and one carbonyl at the central core are presented. The effect of the odd&#8208;membered rings of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon cores on the geometrical features and the extent of bond conjugation in these systems were investigated by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, (spectro)electrochemical studies, X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction, and computational studies. Altogether these studies reveal that, upon oxidation, the non&#8208;planar core of the bis(benzo)&#8208;fused dihydro&#8208;azulenoazulene&#8208;extended TTF generates a large 22&#960;&#8208;aromatic system (together with two 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic 1,3&#8208;dithiolium appendages) characterized by significant bond length equalizations. The dication formed by oxidation is EPR silent, indicating a singlet ground state. Computations reveal that the closed&#8208;shell singlet species and its open&#8208;shell singlet counterpart are nearly degenerate and of lower energy than a triplet species. According to cyclic voltammetry, the compounds can be oxidized further and present multi&#8208;redox systems.

         <title>Achieving High Solid&#8211;Liquid Ratio through Competitive Coordination towards Efficient Recovery of Metals from Spent Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the potential of DESs for practical applications, we propose a novel competition coordination strategy for designing the ternary DESs, which can reinforce the construction of H&#8208;bond interaction and facilitate the exsolution of the ligand (OxA), leading to an enhanced mass transfer kinetic and an excellent selective precipitation of metals (Ni).







Abstract
The recycling of critical metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries represents a significant step towards meeting the enhancing resource requirements in the new energy industry. Nevertheless, achieving effective leaching of metals from the stable metal&#8208;oxygen (MO6) structure of spent ternary cathodes and separation of metal products simultaneously still remained a huge challenge towards industrial applications. Herein, a competitive coordination strategy was proposed to design a novel deep eutectic solvent (DESs), which improved both leaching and selective metal recycling capacity even at high solid&#8211;liquid ratio (1&#8201;:&#8201;10). The results demonstrated that the number of hydrogen bonds in designed ternary DESs was 16.5&#8201;% higher compared to those in the binary DESs, resulting in efficient reaction kinetics to break the metals&#8208;oxygen bond. More importantly, the competing&#8208;ligand (p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid) could preferentially enter into the first nanostructure sheath and reduce the proportion of solvated oxalic acid (OxA) from 28.36&#8201;% to 17.76&#8201;% within the nanostructure, which enable OxA molecules to enhance the coordination interaction with metal for precipitating NiC2O4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O product (~95.7&#8201;% purity) from spent cathodes. This work achieved impressive profitability ($16.05 per kg feedstock) and effectively reduction of GHG emissions during the recycling process, making it applicable to critical sustainability initiatives.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Swing Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework Films for Fast and Precise Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation and growth kinetics of COFs are regulated using the temperature&#8208;swing synthesis strategy, which contributes to highly crystalline and porous COF films. The regular channels within the COF enable fast solvent permeation and excellent selectivity to precisely discriminate fine antibiotic mixtures. This work paves the way towards the structural orderliness of framework materials.







Abstract
Producing crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) films is intimately related to the elusive nucleation and growth processes, which is desirable for efficient molecular transport. Rational control over these processes and insights into the mechanisms are crucial to improve synthetic methodology and achieve COF films with regular channels. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of COF films via the temperature&#8208;swing strategy and explore their crystallization from monomer assemblies to film formation. A detailed time&#8208;dependent study reveals that COF crystallites preferentially coalesce at low temperature, progressing from assembled nanospheres to continuous films through lateral and vertical interactions. Moreover, appropriately elevating the synthesis temperature promotes crystal growth and eliminate the defects of weakly crystalline regions, contributing to highly crystalline and porous COF film with a surface area of 746&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. The prepared COF composite membrane exhibits a methanol permeance of 79&#8197;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, which is 4.5 times higher than the weakly crystalline counterpart. In addition, the molecular sieving test recognize great membrane selectivity to discriminate the antibiotic mixture with a high separation factor of 15.4. This work offers a feasible way for the rational design of the synthesis environment, enabling access to highly crystalline framework materials for targeting molecular separations.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Process for the Regiodivergent Double Hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed divergent, one&#8208;step double hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene produced either adiponitrile or 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile with high regioselectivity. The success of this process is attributed to the highly tunable binding pockets of the bidentate phosphite ligands, which create a geometrically defined coordination space around the nickel center.







Abstract
In industry, the two important nitrile starting materials, adiponitrile and 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile, are primarily manufactured through the well&#8208;known DuPont process, which consists of a tandem sequence including first hydrocyanation, isomerization and second hydrocyanation. However, this mature process has the intrinsic defects of step efficiency and regioselectivity. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed divergent, one&#8208;step double hydrocyanation of 1,3&#8208;butadiene to produce either adiponitrile or 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile in high regioselectivity. The key to this success lies in the highly tunable binding pockets of the bidentate phosphite ligands, which creates a geometrically defined coordination space around the nickel center. The first hydrocyanation that produces either the linear or branched alkenyl nitrile was identified as the selectivity&#8208;determining step. Organometallic studies confirm the formation of well&#8208;defined diphosphite nickel diene complexes in solution, and the role of ligands in dictating regioselectivity was further rationalized by DFT computations. This result provides the first example of a highly selective nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of adiponitrile and 2&#8208;methylglutaronitrile from butadiene, and it also represents a high&#8208;level of catalyst&#8208;controlled regioselectivity via the fine&#8208;tuning of ligand pocket geometry.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrolytes with High Disordered Solvation Structures for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel low&#8208;concentration HE electrolyte is developed to address dendrite formation and side reactions in aqueous ZIBs. This HE electrolyte features weakly solvated structures and multiple anions, leading to highly disordered solvation shells that enhance zinc ion diffusion kinetics and electrode interface stability. As a result, Zn||Zn symmetric cells reach over 2,000&#8197;hours of cycling, and Zn||Cu cells achieve 99.9&#8201;% CE over 1,000 cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are playing an increasingly important role in the field of energy storage owing to their low cost, high safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their practical applications are still handicapped by severe dendrite formation and side reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction and corrosion) on the zinc anodes. Herein, a low&#8208;concentration high&#8208;entropy (HE) electrolyte strategy is proposed to achieve high reversibility and ultra&#8208;durable zinc metal anode. Specifically, this HE electrolyte features multiple anions participating in coordination and highly disordered solvation shells, which would disrupt the intrinsic H&#8208;bond network between water molecules and suppress interfacial side reactions. Moreover, these diversified weakly solvated structures can lower the solvation energy of Zn2+ solvation configurations and enhance zinc ion diffusion kinetics, thereby promoting uniform Zn deposition and electrode interface stability. Consequently, Zn||Zn symmetric cells exhibit over 2,000&#8197;hours of cycling stability, and Zn||Cu asymmetric cells achieve a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the Zn||PANI full cell with the optimized HE&#8208;50&#8197;mM electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity of 110.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 2,000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 70.4&#8201;% at 15&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 10,000 cycles. Remarkably, even at a low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, the Zn||PANI full cells equipped with HE&#8208;50&#8197;mM electrolyte still demonstrate long&#8208;term cycling stability over 600 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.5&#8201;%. This research provides a promising strategy for the design of aqueous electrolytes, aiding in the development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, and high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Zeolite Encapsulation to Enhance Interfacial Gas Availability for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulating the photocatalyst within S&#8208;1 zeolite efficiently enriched gaseous oxygen and accelerated the photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 by creating a gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface, which significantly increased the concentration of gaseous oxygen in the microporous structure of zeolite and facilitated its interaction with the surface of the photocatalyst at the liquid&#8208;solid interface.







Abstract
The photocatalytic oxidation of water with gaseous oxygen is environmentally benign for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), but it is currently constrained by the inadequate supply of gaseous oxygen at the catalyst surface in a solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas triple&#8208;phase reaction system. Herein, we address this challenge by employing the zeolite encapsulated catalysts that efficiently enrich gaseous oxygen and accelerate the H2O2 synthesis in aqueous conditions. We focus on the classical titania photocatalyst, encapsulating it within siliceous MFI zeolite crystals. This encapsulation results in a significant enhancement in H2O2 synthesis efficiency, achieving a yield that is ten times greater than that with unencapsulated TiO2. Mechanism study reveals that gaseous oxygen is notably concentrated within the microporous structure of the zeolite under aqueous conditions, thereby facilitating its interaction with the titania surface at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. In addition, the H2O2 product could swiftly transfer through the micropores, thereby reducing the side reaction of decomposition. This design provides an alternative pathway to address the poor gas solubility of gaseous reactants in water, and paves the way for advancements in various other photocatalytic processes.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships for s&#8208;Block Metal/Co(III) Heterodinuclear Catalysts in Cyclohexene Oxide Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterodinuclear catalysts featuring Co(III) in combination with s&#8208;block metals are reported for the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide with phthalic anhydride, and with carbon dioxide at 20 and 1&#8197;bar pressures. Quantifiable structure&#8211;activity trends are observed; activity increases with decreasing s&#8208;block metal Lewis acidity, as measured by the pKa of the s&#8208;block metal aqua complexes. These relationships reveal key mechanistic insights to help inform future catalyst design.







Abstract
In homogeneous catalysis, uncovering structure&#8211;activity relationships remains very rare but invaluable to understand and rationally improve performances. Here, generalizable structure&#8211;activity relationships apply to a series of heterodinuclear polymerization catalysts featuring Co(III) and s&#8208;block metals M(I/II) (M=Na(I), K(I), Ca(II), Sr(II), Ba(II)). These are shown to apply to polycarbonate production by the ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), conducted at high (20&#8197;bar) and low (1&#8197;bar) CO2 pressures, and to polyester production by copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide and phthalic anhydride (PA). For the CHO/PA and high&#8208;pressure CHO/CO2 copolymerizations, activity increases exponentially with s&#8208;block metal acidity peaking at the Co(III)K(I) catalyst, whilst for the low&#8208;pressure CHO/CO2 copolymerization it increases linearly to the same metal combination. The polymerization kinetics fit second order rate laws and the correlations support dinuclear metallate mechanistic hypotheses. These relationships help understand and identify key metal complex structural features in synergic polymerization catalysis.

         <dc:description>
Triangular and square metal&#8208;organic nanotubes were constructed based on paddlewheel Rh dimer complexes. The side chains introduced into the metal complexes allowed the nanotubes to dissolve in solutions. The nanotubes were cast on a substrate to form a solid film oriented over a wide area. In addition, the nanotubes encapsulated guest molecules.







Abstract
A new series of metal&#8208;organic nanotubes was constructed through one&#8208;dimensional assembly using molecular triangles or molecular squares composed of paddlewheel dirhodium complexes and bidentate axial ligands. The metal&#8208;organic nanotubes were significantly different from conventional solid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) motifs. They exhibit good solubility owing to the branched side chains at their periphery and demonstrate high orientation capabilities in thin films owing to their anisotropic structure. Furthermore, the nanotubes can accommodate guest molecules in nanochannels and orient them on a large scale on a glass substrate.

         <title>Conformer&#8208;Mediated Helical Chirality in 2D Layered Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers of chiral organic ammonium ion are arranged alternatively in the structure of 2D hybrid perovskites. The two conformers have very different strengths of non&#8208;covalent interactions at the organic&#8211;inorganic interface. This periodic asymmetry in non&#8208;covalent interactions induces the rare helical chirality within the inorganic sublattice with interesting chiroptic properties. This conformer&#8208;mediated chirality is a novel concept.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral hybrid perovskites A2PbI4 (A: chiral organic ion) enable chirality controlled optoelectronic and spin&#8208;based properties. A+ organic sublattice induces chirality into the semiconducting [PbI4]2&#8722; inorganic sublattice through non&#8208;covalent interactions at organic&#8211;inorganic interface. Often, the A+ cations in the lattice have different orientations, leading to asymmetry in the non&#8208;covalent interactions. In a novel approach, we use different conformers of A+ cations to create asymmetry in the non&#8208;covalent interactions, thereby, achieving chiral perovskites with rare helical enantiomorphic structures. We prepared (R&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 and (S&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 (IdPA: 1&#8208;iodopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ammonium) which crystallize in the helical enantiomorphic space groups P43212 and P41212, respectively. The gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers of IdPA+ are arranged alternatively in the hybrid structure. Importantly, the anti&#8208;conformer of IdPA+ ion have significantly stronger electrostatic, N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I hydrogen bonding, and I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bonding interactions with the [PbI4]2&#8722; sublattice, compared to the gauche&#8208;conformer. This periodic asymmetry in non&#8208;covalent interactions caused by the alternative arrangement of gauche&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformers induces chirality in the inorganic sublattice with four&#8208;fold screw axes (43 and 41). The enantiomers (R&#8208;/S&#8208;IdPA)2PbI4 show mirror&#8208;image like circular dichroism from excitonic absorption of the inorganic sublattice. This conformer&#8208;based design of chiral hybrid perovskites in helical space groups broadens material choices for advanced optoelectronic applications.

     alt="Conformer-Mediated Helical Chirality in 2D Layered Hybrid Perovskites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gauche- and anti-conformers of chiral organic ammonium ion are arranged alternatively in the structure of 2D hybrid perovskites. The two conformers have very different strengths of non-covalent interactions at the organic&#8211;inorganic interface. This periodic asymmetry in non-covalent interactions induces the rare helical chirality within the inorganic sublattice with interesting chiroptic properties. This conformer-mediated chirality is a novel concept.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) chiral hybrid perovskites A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (A: chiral organic ion) enable chirality controlled optoelectronic and spin-based properties. A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; organic sublattice induces chirality into the semiconducting [PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; inorganic sublattice through non-covalent interactions at organic&#8211;inorganic interface. Often, the A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations in the lattice have different orientations, leading to asymmetry in the non-covalent interactions. In a novel approach, we use different conformers of A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations to create asymmetry in the non-covalent interactions, thereby, achieving chiral perovskites with rare helical enantiomorphic structures. We prepared (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-IdPA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-IdPA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (IdPA: 1-iodopropan-2-ammonium) which crystallize in the helical enantiomorphic space groups P4&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2 and P4&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2, respectively. The gauche- and anti-conformers of IdPA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are arranged alternatively in the hybrid structure. Importantly, the anti-conformer of IdPA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion have significantly stronger electrostatic, N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I hydrogen bonding, and I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I halogen bonding interactions with the [PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; sublattice, compared to the gauche-conformer. This periodic asymmetry in non-covalent interactions caused by the alternative arrangement of gauche- and anti-conformers induces chirality in the inorganic sublattice with four-fold screw axes (4&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 4&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). The enantiomers (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-IdPA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; show mirror-image like circular dichroism from excitonic absorption of the inorganic sublattice. This conformer-based design of chiral hybrid perovskites in helical space groups broadens material choices for advanced optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A photochromic dysprosium&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnet displays reversible redox transformation upon ultraviolet irradiation and subsequent dark treatment, leading to a significant change of magnetic memory effect.







Abstract
A photochromic dysprosium&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnet [Dy(CyPh2PO)2(H2O)5](PMo12O40)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3CyPh2PO&#8901;H2O (1&#8208;Dy) is synthesized via cocrystal engineering of a polyoxomolybdate (POMo) anion and an Ising&#8208;type cation with pseudo pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. Upon ultraviolet irradiation, MoVI&#8208;to&#8208;MoV single&#8208;electron photoreduction occurs in the POMo moiety, resulting in significant changes of optical and magnetic properties. The emergence of intervalence charge&#8208;transfer transitions in heteropoly blue state 1&#8208;Dy* facilitates photothermal conversion in near&#8208;infrared region. Meanwhile, the coercive field of hysteresis loop is altered from 0.72&#8197;T (1&#8208;Dy) to 0.04&#8197;T (1&#8208;Dy*) at 2&#8197;K, which might be contributed to the magnetic interaction between DyIII and MoV. After dark treatment, 1&#8208;Dy* can convert to the initial state with the recovery of magnetic memory effect. These results presented herein provide a blueprint for developing versatile opto&#8208;magnetic materials via the coupling of photochemical regulation and magnetic interaction.

         <title>Anchorable Polymers Enabling Ultra&#8208;Thin and Robust Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for High&#8208;Efficiency Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Coordinative pyridyl units are introduced as side&#8208;chains on poly&#8208;triarylamine (PTAA) backbone with varied contents by copolymerization method, resulting in chemical interactions between polymeric HTMs and substrates. The strong interaction allows them to be processed into ultra&#8208;thin, uniform, and robust hole&#8208;transporting layers, greatly decreasing charge transport losses. Based on the optimal CP4, we achieved highly efficient inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 26.21&#8201;%.







Abstract
Currently, the development of polymeric hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) lags behind that of small&#8208;molecule HTMs in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A critical challenge is that conventional polymeric HTMs are incapable of forming ultra&#8208;thin and conformal coatings like self&#8208;assembly monolayers (SAMs), especially for substrates with rough surface morphology. Herein, we address this challenge by designing anchorable polymeric HTMs (CP1 to CP5). Specifically, coordinative pyridyl groups are introduced as side&#8208;chains on poly&#8208;triarylamine (PTAA) backbone with varied contents by copolymerization method, resulting in chemical interactions between polymeric HTMs and substrates. The strong interaction allows them to be processed into ultra&#8208;thin, uniform, and robust hole&#8208;transporting layers through employing low&#8208;concentration solutions (0.1&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1, vs. 2.0&#8211;5.0&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 for conventional PTAA), greatly decreasing charge transport losses. Moreover, upon systematically tuning the pyridyl substitution ratio, the energy levels, surface wetting, solution processability, and defect passivation capability of such anchorable HTMs are simultaneously optimized. Based on the optimal CP4, we achieved highly efficient inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 26.21&#8201;%, which is on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SAM&#8208;based inverted PSCs. Furthermore, these devices exhibit enhanced stabilities under repeated current&#8211;voltage scans and reverse bias ageing compared with SAM&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Striking Impact of Solvent Polarity on the Strength of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Complexes: A Nexus Between Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conventional belief that the stability of H&#8208;bonded complexes decreases in a more polar solvent is being questioned in this study. Our analysis indicates that the stability of neutral H&#8208;bonded complexes increases in a more polar solvent, provided there is substantial charge transfer between the subsystems. Experimental NMR, IR and quantum chemical micro&#8208;solvation and periodic metadynamics methods confirm the findings.







Abstract
The binding free energy of hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes is generally inversely proportional to the solvent dielectric constant. This occurs because the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of the complex is always smaller than that of the individual subsystems, leading to a reduction in solvation energy. The present study explores the potential for stabilizing hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes in a solvent with higher polarity. Contrary to the established understanding, we have demonstrated that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex (CH3CH2COOH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine) can be better stabilized in a solvent with higher polarity. In this case, a significant charge transfer between the subsystems results in an increased dipole moment of the complex, leading to its stabilization in a more polar solvent. The expected inverse relationship between binding free energy and solvent dielectric constant is observed when the charge transfer between the subsystems is low. Thus, the magnitude of the charge transfer between subsystems is possibly the key factor in determining the stabilization or destabilization of H&#8208;bonded complexes in different solvents. Here, we present a comprehensive study that combines experimental and theoretical approaches, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR) spectroscopies and quantum chemical calculations to validate the findings.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired MXene&#8208;Integrated Mechanochromic Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Visible&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Radar Multispectral Camouflage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cephalopod&#8208;inspired MXene&#8208;integrated cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (MXene&#8208;CLCEs) with multispectral camouflage capability exhibit dynamic structural color changes, tunable infrared radiation, and switchable microwave shielding across wide ranges upon mechanical stretching. Advanced pneumatically driven octopus&#8208;inspired soft models demonstrate visible&#8208;infrared camouflage and microwave shielding switching between two compatible states.







Abstract
Multispectral camouflage materials that provide adaptable features across a wide spectrum, from visible light to radar frequencies, play a vital role in sophisticated multi&#8208;band electromagnetic (EM) applications. However, conventional single&#8208;band stealth is difficult to align with the growing demand for multi&#8208;band compatibility and intelligent adaptation. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of cephalopod&#8208;inspired MXene&#8208;integrated cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (MXene&#8208;CLCEs) with multispectral camouflage capability, which was fabricated through in situ thiol&#8208;acrylate Michael addition and free&#8208;radical photopolymerization of CLCE precursor and isocyanate&#8208;mediated robust covalent chemical bonding of MXene nanocoating at the interface. The resulting MXene&#8208;CLCE exhibits dynamic structural color changes, tunable infrared radiation, and switchable microwave shielding across wide ranges upon mechanical stretching, with its infrared stealth and microwave shielding properties being realized through the reconfiguration of surface morphology from planar to cracked states via mechanical actuation. A visible&#8208;to&#8208;infrared camouflage octopus&#8208;patterned MXene&#8208;CLCE is demonstrated to achieve a stealth effect across the visible&#8208;infrared spectrum upon mechanical stretching. As an illustration, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept pneumatic&#8208;driven octopus&#8208;inspired soft models are demonstrated, which enables dynamic visible&#8208;infrared camouflage and microwave shielding switching between two compatible states. The research herein can offer new perspectives on the development of bioinspired smart camouflage materials and their application in various emerging fields such as smart optical stealth, dynamic thermal management, and switchable electromagnetic devices.

         <title>Exogenously and Endogenously Sequential Regulation of DNA Nanodevices Enables Organelle&#8208;Specific Signal Amplification in Subcellular ATP Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating exogenous NIR light&#8208;triggered photoactivation and endogenous enzyme&#8208;mediated signal amplification with DNA sensor technology, spatiotemporally selective, amplified imaging of ATP in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum is achieved. The dual&#8208;regulated nanodevices enable monitoring of ATP fluctuations in the specific organelles following drug intervention.







Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency in cells, is dynamically regulated across different subcellular compartments. The ATP interplay between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) underscores their coordinated roles in various biochemical processes, highlighting the necessity for precise profiling of subcellular ATP dynamics. Here we present an exogenously and endogenously dual&#8208;regulated DNA nanodevice for spatiotemporally selective, subcellular&#8208;compartment specific signal amplification in ATP sensing. The system allows for exogenous NIR light&#8208;controlled spatiotemporal localization and activation of the aptamer sensor in mitochondria or ER, while a specific endogenous enzyme in the organelles further drives signal amplification via the consumption of molecular beacon fuels, resulting in significantly enhanced sensitivity and spatial precision for the subcellular ATP profiling in the organelle of interest. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this system for robust monitoring of ATP fluctuations in mitochondria and ER following drug interventions. This advancement provides a powerful tool for improving our understanding of cellular energetics at the subcellular level and holds potential for the development of targeted therapeutics.

         <title>Supercritical Ethane Processing of ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes towards Pressure&#8208;Resistant C3H6/C3H8 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneered the preparation of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes using supercritical ethane as solvent. Owing to its high diffusivity, low viscosity, and chemical inertness, grain boundary defects could be largely eliminated, resulting in superior and pressure&#8208;resistant C3H6/C3H8 separation performances.







Abstract
ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have shown great promise in industrial&#8208;scale C3H6/C3H8 separation. Nonetheless, sustainable preparation of pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes remains a grand challenge. In this study, we pioneered the use of supercritical ethane (scC2H6) as reaction medium for preparing pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. Membrane growth in neutral organic environment was proven to have less disturbance to structure integrity compared with supercritical CO2 (scCO2). Gas permeation results indicated that obtained ZIF&#8208;8 membrane exhibited an ideal C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 172.1 with C3H6 permeance of 5.9&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Pa&#8722;1. Of particular note, the membrane maintained stable C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of ~150 with C3H6 flux of ~1.6&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 at operation pressure of 6&#8197;bar, which was significantly different from ZIF&#8208;8 membranes obtained from scCO2 reaction medium. Through combining with advantages of zero pollutant discharge and full ligand recovery, our protocol holds great promise in sustainable preparation of pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes towards practical application in high&#8208;purity C3H6 production.

The Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation&#8208;enabled one&#8208;pot reductive amination and reductive amination&#8212;functionalization of common carboxylic esters to form N&#8208;alkylated, and tandem N&#8208;alkylated, &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines are described. The reactions relies on cationic [Ir(COD)2]BArF, which exhibited high efficiency (at 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ir&#8208;loading, and 0.001&#8197;mol&#8201;% in a 15&#8197;g scale) and good stability (alleviates the use of glovebox). {BArF=tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate; COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene}.







Abstract
Reported herein is a convenient and efficient method for one&#8208;pot, catalytic reductive amination, as well as the first multi&#8208;component tandem reductive amination&#8212;functionalization of bench&#8208;stable and readily available common carboxylic esters. This method is based on the cationic [Ir(COD)2]BArF&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective hydrosilylation of esters, followed by one&#8208;pot acid&#8208;mediated amination and nucleophilic addition. The reaction was conducted under mild conditions at a very low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Ir), which could be further reduced to 0.001&#8197;mol&#8201;%, as demonstrated by a reaction at a 15&#8197;g scale. The method is highly versatile, allowing the use of esters with or without &#945;&#8208;protons for the N&#8208;mono&#8208;alkylation of primary and secondary amines to produce diverse secondary and tertiary amines, as well as &#945;&#8208;branched/functionalized amines. The method is highly chemoselective and tolerates a variety of functional groups such as bromo, trifluoromethyl, ester, and cyano groups. The value of the method was demonstrated by the one&#8208;step catalytic synthesis of two bio&#8208;relevant N&#8208;mono&#8208;methyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters and the antiparkinsonian agent piribedil, as well as by the use of two shorter chain triglycerides as alkylating feedstock.

         <title>Promoting Hydrogen Transfer in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction via a Hydrogen on Demand Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism was proposed for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, realizing the hydrogen supply matches CO2 protonation. This new mechanism addresses the contradiction between activity and selectivity faced with the traditional &#8220;hydrogen supply&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
The proceeding of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires the formation of active hydrogen species for CO2 protonation, while traditional catalysts fail to balance the rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. Herein, we propose a &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism, in which the polarity of the adsorbed CO2 is enhanced to allow the capture of hydrogen from water without forming free hydrogen species, realizing the matching rate of hydrogen supply and CO2 protonation. As a proof of concept, we construct Zn&#8722;N sites modified by Se atoms, allowing the proceeding of CO2RR under the &#8220;hydrogen on demand&#8221; mechanism with superior efficiency. The catalyst achieves an industrial CO current of &#8722;539.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faradaic efficiencies of CO &gt;90&#8201;% over a broad window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and a high turnover frequency of 7.6&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1 in flow cell. In situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Se sites enhance the electron localization around the Zn sites, thus increasing the polarity of adsorbed CO2&#8722; with improved ability to acquire hydrogen species from water to facilitate the protonation process.

         <title>Reversing Surface Charge for Highly&#8208;Active Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface charge reversal strategy is introduced to regulate the charge character of organic photovoltaic catalyst (OPC). Nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by cationic surfactant exhibit a raised Fermi level, larger surface band bending and Schottky barrier relative to OPC NPs stabilized by anionic surfactant, enhancing charge separation and transfer efficiency while suppressing charge carrier recombination and therefore demonstrating better photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Organic photovoltaic materials typically exhibit low charge separation and transfer efficiency and severe exciton/carrier recombination due to high exciton binding energy and short exciton diffusion lengths, limiting the enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Here, we introduce a surface charge reversal strategy to regulate the charge character of organic photovoltaic catalyst (OPC). Compared to OPC nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by an anionic surfactant ((&#8722;)&#8201;NPs), NPs stabilized by a cationic surfactant ((+)&#8201;NPs) exhibit a raised Fermi level, larger surface band bending and Schottky barrier, thereby enhancing charge separation and transfer efficiency while suppressing charge carrier recombination. As a result, (+)&#8201;NPs demonstrate better photocatalytic performance than (&#8722;)&#8201;NPs, independent of the chemical structure of OPCs and surfactant molecules. Under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the PM6: 2FBP&#8208;4F NPs stabilized by cationic surfactant (dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, DTAB) exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution (up to 946.1&#177;15.76&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) than that of PM6: 2FBP&#8208;4F NPs stabilized by anionic surfactant, among the best results reported so far for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under simulated sunlight.

         <title>Unveiling the Photoluminescence Mechanism of Carbonized Polymer Dots: Evolution and Synergistic Photoluminescence of Multiple Molecular Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular fluorophore named 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,8,13,14&#8208;tetrahaydroimidazo[2,3&#8208;k][4,7,11]&#8208;triazaacephenanthrylene&#8208;1,5,10(12H)&#8208;trione (IATO) was separated from the carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) prepared with citric acid and ethylenediamine. IATO had been proven to evolve from 5&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;7&#8208;carboxylic acid (IPCA). Further research revealed the whole photoluminescence mechanism of CPDs to be the evolution and synergistic photoluminescence of multiple molecular fluorophores linked on CPDs nanoparticle.







Abstract
Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) are a class of exceptional fluorescent materials with diverse applications. However, their photoluminescence (PL) mechanism remained enigmatic and controversial, hindering further development and application. While molecular fluorophores explain primary fluorescence in some CPDs, the overall PL of CPDs still cannot be fully explained, such as their excitation&#8208;dependent behaviors, let alone the modulation of PL. Besides, the extracted molecular fluorophores are dissociative, raising questions including the purity of CPDs and whether the PL of CPDs nanoparticles come from these molecular fluorophores. Here, the emission around 510&#8197;nm of citric acid&#8208;ethylenediamine CPDs (CA&#8208;EDA CPDs) was proved to be contributed by a molecular fluorophore, which evolved from another molecular fluorophore following the quantum confinement effect. Further research revealed the whole PL mechanism of CA&#8208;EDA CPDs to be the evolution and synergistic PL of multiple molecular fluorophores linked on CPDs nanoparticle. The evolution of molecular fluorophores had also been observed in another two systems, indicating the universality of this mechanism, and a new approach for regulating the optical properties of CPDs was put forward inspired by this mechanism. This study not only refined the PL mechanism but also paved the way for future advancements of CPDs.

         <title>Rapidly Generated, Ultra&#8208;Stable, and Switchable Photoinduced Radicals: A Solid&#8208;State Photochromic Paradigm for Reusable Paper Light&#8208;Writing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapidly responsive and ultra&#8208;stable photoinduced radical platform was constructed by the anti&#8208;parallelly aligned para&#8208;hydroxyphenyl groups of persulfurated arenes. The ultra&#8208;fast high&#8208;contrast photochromism upon UV irradiation is stable for 3&#8197;months in dark. The superior photochromic behavior also remains in the ground sample, for which it can be further processed into reusable papers for light&#8208;writing.







Abstract
Although photochromic molecules have attracted widespread interest in various fields, solid&#8208;state photochromism remains a formidable challenge, owing to the substantial conformational constraints that hinder traditional molecular photoisomerization processes. Benefiting from the significant color change upon radical generation, chemical systems enabling a photoinduced radical (PIR) behavior through photoinduced electron transfer (PET) could be ideal candidates for solid&#8208;state photochromism within minimized need of conformational freedom. However, the transient nature of radicals causes a dilemma in this Scheme. Herein, we present a general crystal engineering strategy for rapidly generated (7&#8208;s irradiation to saturation) and ultra&#8208;stable (lasting 12&#8197;weeks) PIRs in the solid state, based on the anti&#8208;parallel alignment of para&#8208;hydroxyphenyl groups of persulfurated arenes to form a strong non&#8208;covalent network for efficient PET and radical stabilization. Using this strategy, a PIR platform was constructed, with a superior photochromic behavior remaining in different solid forms (even in the fully&#8208;ground sample) due to their transcendent crystallization ability. On this basis, our compounds can be further processed into reusable papers for light&#8208;writing, accompanied by water fumigation for modulating the reversible process. This work provides new insights into addressing solid&#8208;state photochromism and can inspire a wide range of optical material design from the switchable radical perspective.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Construction and Application of Axially Chiral Spiro&#8208;bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative cyclization, a class of configurationally stable axially chiral spiro&#8208;bisindole skeletons were accessed for the first time with excellent enantiocontrol.

Spiro skeletons have emerged as a privileged class of chiral carriers across various research fields, including asymmetric catalysis and functional materials, due to their remarkable configurational rigidity. However, limited structural diversity of spiro frameworks significantly restricts the expansion of their applications. Here we present a new class of axially chiral spiro&#8208;bisindole frameworks and report their first enantioselective construction via a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative cyclization reaction. Unlike the classical SPINOL backbone, incorporation of indole moieties in place of phenol enhances the nucleophilicity of ketone substrates, thereby eliminating the need for a tedious pre&#8208;activation process. By leveraging the retained active sites of indole, the resulting highly enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles can be rapidly transformed into other valuable structures. More importantly, axially chiral fluorescent molecules with good asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency are readily accessed, opening a new avenue for developing chiral fluorescent materials. Control experiments demonstrate the pivotal role of both unmasked N&#8722;H bonds in achieving good efficiency and enantiocontrol.

         <title>BN&#8208;Acene Ladder with Enhanced Charge Transport for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

Two novel ladder&#8208;type BN&#8208;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) featuring a highly ordered BC3N2 acene unit were prepared via a nitrogen&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. In micro&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), these compounds demonstrate enhanced charge transport, achieving a hole mobility of up to 0.62&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which ranks among the highest values for BN&#8208;PAH&#8208;based OFETs.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth research on the charge transport properties of BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) still lags far behind studies of their emitting properties. Herein, we report the successfully synthesis of novel ladder&#8208;type BN&#8208;PAHs (BCNL1 and BCNL2) featuring a highly ordered BC3N2 acene unit, achieved via a nitrogen&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed their unique and compact herringbone packing structures. Micro&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) demonstrated that an enhanced charge transport capability, with BCNL2 achieving a hole mobility of up to 0.62&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8211;three orders of magnitude higher than that of BCNL1 (&#956;hmax=6 &#215; 10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), ranking among the highest values for BN&#8208;PAHs&#8208;based OFETs. Detailed calculations attribute this significant enhancement in the hole mobility to the marked reduction in reorganization energy (&#955;) of BCNL2, resulting from the five&#8208;membered pyrrole ring annulation and molecular skeleton elongation. This work provides insight into molecular design principles for potential BN&#8208;PAHs in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Growth of Metallocluster Inside Heterometal&#8208;Organic Cage to Switch Electron Transfer for Targeted CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetranuclear Cu cluster was coordinated endogamously inside a cluster&#8208;based heterometallic&#8208;organic cage which takes a crucial role in modulating the orbital alignment for a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state towards targeted CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.







Abstract
Construction of metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with internal modifications is a promising avenue to build enzyme&#8208;like cavities and unlocking the mystery of highly catalytic activity and selectivity of enzymes. However, current interests are mainly focused on single&#8208;metal&#8208;node cages, little achievement has been expended to metallocluster&#8208;based architectures, and the in situ endogenous generation of metal clusters. Herein, based on the hard&#8208;soft&#8208;acids&#8208;bases (HSAB), the metallocluster&#8208;based heterometallic MOC (Cu3VMOP) constructed of [Cu3OPz3]+ and [V6O6(OCH3)9(SO4)(CO2)3]2&#8722; clusters was obtained by one&#8208;pot method. In addition, Cu4I4 was generated in situ in the cage to form Cu4I4@Cu3VMOP by the coordination&#8208;driven hierarchical self&#8208;assembly strategy. As catalysts for CO2 reduction, Cu3VMOP produces HCOOH and CH3COOH as the main reduction product with yield of CH3COOH up to 0.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1, ranking among the highest value of reported materials, whereas Cu4I4@Cu3VMOP exhibited targeted CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion with 100&#8201;% formic acid selectivity and the yield outperforms that of Cu3VMOP by 5 fold. Theoretical calculations and femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption reveal that endogenous Cu4I4 not only regulates orbital arrangements and enhances localized electron states to generate a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state, but also raises *CO coupling energy barrier, resulting in the targeted conversion of CO2 to formic acid.

         <title>Tunable Mechanically Interlocked Semi&#8208;Crystalline Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked semi&#8208;crystalline polymer networks were constructed to achieve the synchronous enhancement of seemingly conflicting material properties including mechanical robustness, toughness, elasticity and reprocessability. The improvement was ascribed to the synergic mechanism of mechanical interlocked crosslinks, physical crystalline domains, and dynamic disulfide bonding.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance polymers based on dynamic chemistry have been widely explored for multi&#8208;field advanced applications. However, noncovalent sacrificial bond&#8208;mediated energy dissipation mechanism causes a trade&#8208;off between mechanical toughness and resilience. Herein, we achieved the synchronous boost of seemingly conflicting material properties including mechanical robustness, toughness and elasticity via the incorporation of mechanical chemistry into traditional semi&#8208;crystalline networks. Detailed rheological tests and all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulation reveal that the excellent mechanical robustness and toughness are attributed to the dissociation of crystalline domains threading through the sieve&#8208;shape macrocycles. Reversible nano&#8208;crystalline domains and ring&#8208;sliding&#8208;effect accelerated segment motion efficiently reduce energy dissipation to achieve instantaneous resilience. Moreover, the model polymers demonstrate that the multiple dynamic components endow the resulting polymer with excellent reprocessability under mild conditions. This mechanically interlocked semi&#8208;crystalline polymer exhibits potential applications as a thermal/photo actuator. This work reveals the synergic effects of mechanically interlocked sites and tunable crystalline domains, thus providing a reliable guide for the comprehensive improvement of material performance.

The temperature and light&#8208;dependent synergistic switching effects in magnetic, structural, and spectral properties have been discovered for a three&#8208;dimensional spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) material [FeII(4&#8208;acetylpyridine)2][HgII(&#956;&#8208;SCN)4]. Tunable terahertz absorption through temperature and light stimuli is associated with phonon vibrations around Fe2 centers through SCO behavior supported by ab initio calculation.







Abstract
The development of molecular switches with tunable properties has garnered considerable interest over several decades. A novel spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) material based on iron(II) complexes incorporating 4&#8208;acetylpyridine (4&#8208;acpy) and [Hg(SCN)4]2&#8722; anions was synthesized and formulated as [Fe(4&#8208;acpy)2][Hg(&#956;&#8208;SCN)4] (1). Compound 1 is crystallized in a three&#8208;dimensional network in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric orthorhombic space group Pna21 with two octahedral [Fe(4&#8208;acpy)2(NCS)4] entities featuring two distinct Fe centers (Fe1 and Fe2). Crystallographic, magnetic, and M&#246;ssbauer measurements reveal an incomplete SCO exclusively at Fe2, with transition temperature T1/2&#8776;102&#8197;K. Photomagnetic studies conducted at 10&#8197;K with lasers ranging from 405 to 1310&#8197;nm evidence light&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (LIESST) and reverse&#8208;LIESST effects, with a unique near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive LIESST phenomenon at 1064 and 1310&#8197;nm. Advanced photocrystallographic studies at 40&#8197;K provide precise structural evidence for these metastable states. The optical and vibrational properties consistently corroborate with magnetic and photomagnetic studies. Additionally, temperature&#8208; and light&#8208;dependent terahertz (THz) absorptions are associated with phonon vibrations around Fe2 centers, through SCO behavior, as supported by ab initio calculation. The Fe(II)&#8722;Hg(II) systems can be promising benchmarks for exploring synergistic switching effects in structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic properties.

         <title>3,6&#8208;Bis(methylthio)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Highly Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A methylthiocarbazole&#8208;based phosphonic acid, MeS&#8208;4PACz, capable of forming a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide has been developed. The molecule induces an interfacial dipole and passivates iodide vacancies in FAPbI3 perovskite. Inverted perovskite solar cells using MeS&#8208;4PACz SAM as a hole&#8208;selective layer achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.134&#8201;%.







Abstract
The photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) relies on effectively managing the interface between the hole extraction layer and the light&#8208;absorbing perovskite layer. In this study, we have synthesised (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (MeS&#8208;4PACz), which forms a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode. The molecule&#8216;s methylthio substituents generate a favourable interfacial dipole moment and interact with the perovskite layer. This interaction results in well&#8208;aligned energy levels among the FTO/SAM/perovskite layers, promoting efficient hole extraction and significantly reducing carrier recombination losses. Additionally, the methylthio groups passivate iodide vacancies and interact with Pb2+ ions of the perovskite, reducing defect&#8208;induced trap states and enhancing the crystalline growth of the perovskite layer. Consequently, inverted PSCs incorporating MeS&#8208;4PACz achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.13&#8201;%, along with outstanding photostability.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Induced Ordered Carbonaceous Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a high&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated method is proposed to induce phase separation of the assembled units and the evolution of micellar templates, enabling the successful construction of polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;induced hierarchical superstructures in a single preparation step. These superstructures exhibit a unique surface architecture composed of discontinuous nanodots and demonstrate enhanced catalytic activity, showcasing excellent electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries.







Abstract
Constructing hierarchical superstructures through one&#8208;step bottom&#8208;up synthesis poses significant challenges due to strong interactions between additives and micelles, which hinders the formation of heterogeneous configurations. Here, we propose a high&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated method to weaken these interactions and manipulate the thermal instability of micellar templates. This approach successfully synthesizes hierarchical superstructures that combine a carbonaceous nanosheet substrate with polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;induced, highly ordered discontinuous nanodots in a single preparation step. The surface nanodots have a diameter of approximately 19&#8197;nm and are spaced about 32&#8197;nm apart. Besides, the nanodots with various arrangements can be generated by simply adjusting the amount of POM. Importantly, the superstructure features more exposed POM catalytic sites than conventional carbonaceous hybrids lacking surface architectures, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. This high&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated approach offers new insights for designing hierarchical superstructures and functional materials with enhanced activities.

Spherical Na4Fe2.96Mg0.02Cu0.02(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMCPP) cathode materials have been successfully synthesized via the combination of spray&#8208;drying and solid&#8208;state reaction method. The Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping can effectively mitigate the lattice volume change and promote the electronic conductivity of NFMCPP. While, the small NFMCPP particles with spherical geometry exhibit an enhanced structural stability, due to the high sphericity structure enables a low high&#8208;stress concentration and alleviated diffusion&#8208;induced stress during the extensive (de)sodiation cycling.







Abstract
Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) has been regarded as the promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the practical applications of NFPP are hindered by its high&#8208;volume changes, poor intrinsic electron conductivity and sluggish Na+ ions diffusion kinetics. Herein, a spray&#8208;drying and solid&#8208;state reaction method have been utilized to fabricate the spherical trace amount Mg/Cu co&#8208;doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMCPP). The Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping can effectively mitigate the lattice volume change and promote the electronic conductivity of NFMCPP by reducing band gap between the conduction and valence bands. While, the unique spherical structured NFMCPP with a carbon film even coated on its surface ensures rapid electron transport. Moreover, small NFMCPP particles with spherical geometry demonstrate an alleviated diffusion&#8208;induced stress and enhanced structural stability, due to the high sphericity structure enables fluent Na+ extraction/insertion, leads to a low high&#8208;stress concentration and uniform stress/strain distribution during extensive (de)sodiation process. Consequently, the optimized spherical NFMCPP cathode materials exhibit an excellent rate capability and cyclic stability.

         <title>Isomerism Effect of 3D Dimeric Acceptors for Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with 20&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular isomerization strategy was employed to develop 3D dimeric acceptors (CH8&#8208;4/4A/4B), which demonstrate varying molecular pre&#8208;aggregation in o&#8208;xylene. These distinctive properties significantly affect the film&#8208;forming process and the resulting morphological characteristics. Due to the moderate pre&#8208;aggregation of CH8&#8208;4, an impressive efficiency of 20.0&#8201;% was received for CH8&#8208;4&#8208;based device, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in non&#8208;halogen solvent&#8208;processed organic solar cells.







Abstract
Organic photovoltaic materials that can be processed via non&#8208;halogenated solvents are crucial for the large&#8208;area manufacturing of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the limited available of electron acceptors with adequate solubility and favorable molecular packing presents a challenge in achieving efficient non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processed OSCs. Herein, inspired by the three&#8208;dimensional dimeric acceptor CH8&#8208;4, we employed a molecular isomerization strategy to synthesize its isomers, CH8&#8208;4A and CH8&#8208;4B, by tuning the position of fluorine (F) atom in the central unit. The differing intramolecular fluorine&#8208;sulfur non&#8208;covalent interactions among these isomers led to differences in molecular pre&#8208;aggregation abilities (CH8&#8208;4B&lt;CH8&#8208;4&lt;CH8&#8208;4A) in o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) solution, which significantly influence the film&#8208;forming process and the resultant morphological characteristics. Among these, the blend film of CH8&#8208;4, characterized by moderate molecular pre&#8208;aggregation, achieved optimal bi&#8208;continuous donor/acceptor phase separation. Consequently, the o&#8208;xylene processed PM6&#8201;:&#8201;CH8&#8208;4 device achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.1&#8201;%, outperforming that of two other devices. By incorporating L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D as a guest acceptor, we attained an impressive PCE of 20.0&#8201;% for the CH8&#8208;4&#8208;based ternary device, alongside a high PCE nearing 16&#8201;% for the mini&#8208;module (13.5&#8197;cm2). Our findings underscore the potential of isomerism in 3D dimer acceptors to enhance the performance of eco&#8208;friendly OSCs.

         <title>Inverting Methanol Dehydrogenation Selectivity by Crowding Atomic Ni Species over &#945;&#8208;MoC Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

Metal carbides are promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts but face challenges in controlling reaction pathways due to strong adsorption of reactants. This study shows that bare &#945;&#8208;MoC favors bimolecular methanol dehydrogenation to methyl formate and H2, while Ni&#8208;decorated &#945;&#8208;MoC shifts selectivity to monomolecular dehydrogenation to CO and H2. Mechanistic insights reveal Ni sites enhance C&#8722;H bond cleavage, enabling complete alcohol dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Metal carbides with earth&#8208;abundant elements are widely regarded as promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts. Although comparable catalytic performances have been observed for metal carbides in several types of reactions, precise control of reaction pathways on them remains a formidable challenge, partially due to strong adsorption of reactants or intermediates. In this study, we show that bimolecular dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate and H2 is kinetically favored on bare &#945;&#8208;MoC catalysts, while monomolecular dehydrogenation to CO and H2 becomes the dominant pathway when &#945;&#8208;MoC is decorated with crowding atomic Ni species. Under optimal conditions, excellent selectivities of the target products (&gt;90&#8201;%) were achieved in both cases, with unprecedented production rates of methyl formate and H2 for the former and latter mechanisms, respectively. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational assessments were integrated to clarify the mechanism driving this remarkable selectivity inversion. Isolated Ni sites bound to &#945;&#8208;MoC exhibit superior dehydrogenation activity, which promotes complete cleavage of C&#8722;H bonds in methanol&#8208;derived intermediates rather than the C&#8722;O coupling between them. Our study offers an effective approach to modulating the selectivity of carbide&#8208;based catalysts in alcohol dehydrogenation towards different target products.

         <title>Surface Coverage Tuning for Suppressing Over&#8208;Oxidation: A Case of Photoelectrochemical Alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;Aldehyde/Ketone Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It has been found that oxidative species derived from H2O exhibit a stronger competitive adsorption ability compared to alcohol substrates during photoelectrochemical (PEC) alcohol oxidation, leading to poor formation of pre&#8208;oxidized intermediates and excessive alcohol oxidation. However, after PEC polarization, the adsorption of alcohol substrates is significantly enhanced, enabling competition with oxidative species. This boosts the formation of pre&#8208;oxidized intermediates, effectively suppressing alcohol over&#8208;oxidation and enhancing the oxidation kinetics of alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;aldehyde conversion.







Abstract
Suppressing over&#8208;oxidation is a crucial challenge for various chemical intermediate synthesis in heterogeneous catalysis. The distribution of oxidative species and the substrate coverage, governed by the direction of electron transfer, are believed to influence the oxidation extent. In this study, we presented an experimental realization of surface coverage modulation on a photoelectrode using a photo&#8208;induced charge activation method. Through the surface coverage modulation, both pre&#8208;oxidized alcohol substrates and surface coverage were increased, which not only improved the reaction kinetics but also suppressed the over&#8208;oxidation of the generated aldehydes/ketones. As a demonstration, the Faradaic efficiency for the conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone increased from 31.8&#8201;% to 46.8&#8201;% (with selectivity rising from 47.6&#8201;% to 71.3&#8201;%), from 73.4&#8201;% to 87.8&#8201;% for benzyl alcohol to benzyl aldehyde (selectivity increasing from 76.7&#8201;% to 92.4&#8201;%) and from 4.2&#8201;% to 53.6&#8201;% for ethylene glycol to glycolaldehyde (selectivity increasing from 6.2&#8201;% to 62.7&#8201;%). Our findings offer a promising strategy for the production of high&#8208;value carbon products in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis Enables Ring&#8208;Opening of Cyclopropene and Ring Expansion of Aryl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding interaction enables catalyzing the ring expansion of aryl ketones appending a cyclopropene moiety as carbene precursor. In contrast, transition metal and thermal approaches prefer the formation of furan side product. This research reveals that chalcogen bonding catalysts can play a role in producing and regulating carbene species, thus providing an alternative platform for solving reactivity problem in carbene transformations.







Abstract
Catalytic transformation of carbene species constitutes a fundamental part in organic synthesis, and the research in this direction has been dominated by transition metals while organic catalysts are difficult to mimic such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity. It would significantly advance carbene chemistry if organic catalysts enable achieving classical metal&#8208;carbene approaches otherwise unrealizable reactions. Herein, we report that chalcogen bonding catalysis can solve reactivity problem to achieve an elusive Buchner ring expansion of aryl ketones appending a cyclopropene moiety as carbene precursor. In this work, the ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropene and the ring&#8208;expansion of aryl systems were added in the field of noncovalent catalysis. This work demonstrates that chalcogen bonding can mediate carbene transformations beyond the known ionic approach. In contrast, transition metals such as rhodium, palladium, and copper complexes, could not solve the reactivity problem to achieve ring expansion of aryl ketones but instead these metal&#8208;carbene approaches prefer the formation of furan side product. In addition, a thermal approach even being conducted at 200&#8201;&#176;C could not achieve this ring expansion reaction. Mechanistic investigation suggests Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction with cyclopropene facilitates the ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropene and chalcogen bonding with carbene intermediate changes the reaction pathway, thus overriding the furan reaction pathway.

         <title>Partially Interstitial Silicon&#8208;Implanted Ruthenium as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The partially interstitial silicon implanted ruthenium not only converts the Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. In addition, the spontaneously generated built&#8208;in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption property of the Ru sites, further significantly lowering the thermodynamic energy barrier for the alkaline HER.







Abstract
To enhance the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it is crucial, yet challenging, to fundamentally understand and rationally modulate potential catalytic sites. In this study, we confirm that despite calculating a low water dissociation energy barrier and an appropriate H adsorption free energy (&#916;G*H) at Ru&#8208;top sites, metallic Ru exhibits a relatively inferior activity for the alkaline HER. This is primarily because the Ru&#8208;top sites, which are potential H adsorption sites, are recessive catalytic sites, compared with the adjacent Ru&#8208;hollow sites that have a strong &#916;G*H. To promote the transformation of Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites, interstitial Si atoms are implanted into the hollow sites. However, complete interstitial implantation leads to a high water dissociation energy barrier at the RuSi intermetallic surface. Thus, we present a partial interstitial incorporation strategy to form a Ru&#8722;RuSi heterostructure that not only converts the Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. Moreover, the spontaneously formed built&#8208;in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption ability of the Ru sites, thereby greatly reducing the thermodynamic energy barrier and enhancing the alkaline HER.

         <title>Molecular Micellar Aggregate Electrolytes Enable Durable Electrochemical Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular micellar aggregate is designed as non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes for stable and high&#8208;voltage electrochemical proton storage. Such aggregates impart rapid and stable electrochemical proton storage with a widened operating voltage (1.8&#8197;V vs. 1.5&#8197;V in aqueous electrolyte). A symmetric full proton battery using the optimal CTAB electrolyte achieves a maximum energy density of 102.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a maximum power density of 10.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Proton electrochemistry holds eminent potential for developing high capacity and rate energy storage devices in the post&#8208;lithium era. However, the decomposition of water in acidic aqueous electrolytes causes electrode corrosion, leading to capacity fading. Herein, we report a judicious design of molecular micellar aggregates as non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes for stable and high&#8208;voltage electrochemical proton storage. The key to our strategy lies in introducing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), forming micelles to improve the miscibility of acetonitrile (ACN) and H3PO4, afford channel for proton transport, and electrostatically interact with phosphate ions of H3PO4 to further promote proton transport. Such aggregates impart rapid and stable electrochemical proton storage with a widened operating voltage (1.8&#8197;V vs. 1.5&#8197;V in aqueous electrolyte). By optimizing CTAB content, proton transport can be enhanced. Asymmetric full proton battery using the optimal CTAB electrolyte achieves a maximum energy density of 102.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a maximum power density of 10.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Our simple yet robust route to micellar aggregate electrolytes enables stable proton storage, underscoring its potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, emergency power supplies, and portable electronics.

         <title>Multifaceted Hidden Catalysis Revealed by Mechanistic Analysis of FeBr3&#8208;Catalysed Arene Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic analysis revealed the iron&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H borylation of 2&#8208;phenylpyridine derivatives with 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ([H&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN]2) operates through hidden catalysis with the iron salt mediating the formation of Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN, the active catalyst. The reaction was shown to proceed through an electrophilic borylation mechanism.







Abstract
Arene borylation reactions provide direct access to aryl organoboranes, including aryl boronic esters. Precious metals, namely Ir, Rh, Pt, remain the go&#8208;to for metal&#8208;catalysed borylation reactions, however, significant efforts have been expended in developing Earth&#8208;abundant metal alternatives. The iron&#8208;catalysed borylation of 2&#8208;aryl pyridine derivatives with 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (H&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN) offers unique reactivity by using only FeBr3 as the catalyst, without added ligand(s). Mechanistic analysis of this borylation reaction revealed an alternative, hidden catalysis pathway whereby the iron salt acts not as a borylation catalyst, but as an initiator for the generation of a catalytically active haloborane, Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN. The roles of iron salt, Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN, and HBr in catalyst formation, the mode of catalytic turnover, and catalyst regeneration were all determined using single&#8208;turnover and catalytic studies. The borylation reaction was found to proceed by a catalytic electrophilic borylation using, in situ generated, Br&#8208;B&#8208;9&#8208;BBN. These studies highlight a new, orthogonal method of generating haloboranes and their previously unobserved role as hidden catalysts within arene borylation reactions.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Plasma&#8208;Driven Ammonia Synthesis Using a AuCu3/Cu Composite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient radio&#8208;frequency (RF) plasma&#8208;driven ammonia synthesis has been achieved using an integrated AuCu3/Cu composite catalyst. The Cu antenna facilitates the generation of reactive species, while surface AuCu3 nanoparticles (NPs) serve as catalytic sites for efficient ammonia synthesis, owing to the unique Cu&#8722;Au interface and a downshifted d&#8208;band center. The synergistic effect of Cu antenna and surface AuCu3 NPs comprehensively boosts ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
Green ammonia synthesis using fluctuating renewable energy supply in decentralized process is a goal that has been long sought after. Ammonia synthesis with non&#8208;thermal plasma under mild conditions is a promising technology, but it faces the critical challenge of low energy efficiency. Herein, we develop an easily&#8208;scalable AuCu3/Cu catalyst, which consists of a decimeter&#8208;scale metallic Cu antenna and nano&#8208;scale AuCu3 catalytic sites on metallic Cu surface, significantly enhancing the energy efficiency and ammonia yield in a radio&#8208;frequency (RF) plasma system. Compared to plasma alone, the single&#8208;pass ammonia yield over AuCu3/Cu increases by a factor of 20, approaching 10&#8201;%. Mechanistic studies indicate that Cu antenna can amplify the millimeter&#8208;scale local electric field, thereby facilitating the generation of active nitrogen species, including nitrogen radicals and vibration&#8208;excited nitrogen molecules. Due to the downshifted d&#8208;band center and unique Cu&#8722;Au interface structure, the AuCu3 nanoalloy modified on Cu antenna surface significantly reduces hydrogenation barriers of active NHX (x=0,1,2) species (the rate&#8208;determining step) and facilitates ammonia desorption at lower temperature. The synergistic effect of Cu antenna and surface AuCu3 nanoalloy comprehensively enhances ammonia synthesis through both the nitrogen radical&#8208;mediated Eley&#8208;Rideal pathway and the vibration&#8208;excited nitrogen molecule&#8208;mediated Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood pathway.

         <title>Molecular Customization of Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfaces for Enhanced Stability and Reversibility in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Carbon Capacitors</title>

The pyridine group enables interfacial aggregation and anchoring of vitamin molecules, while the hydroxyl group coordinates with Zn2+, optimizing the solvation structure near the anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This dual modulation regulates Zn2+ deposition, reducing corrosion and hydrogen evolution, enhancing zinc electrochemistry reversibility and enhancing zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors&#8217; cycling stability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors display application potential in green power and high&#8208;end equipment owing to their high security, large power and sustainability. The water&#8208;rich zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface (AEI) and disordered zinc&#8208;ion diffusion are the culprits triggering corrosion reactions and dendrite growth, threatening the sustainability of aqueous zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors. Herein, a polyfunctional biomolecular, vitamin B6, is introduced into the traditional aqueous electrolyte for customizing the functional AEI and fine&#8208;regulating the interfacial coordination environment of zinc ions. Specifically, the preferential anchoring of pyridine nitrogen enables trace vitamin (2.0&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) to construct a robust AEI and suppress corrosion reactions. The hydroxyl function zone provides high&#8208;octane guidance for zinc&#8208;ion diffusion at the AEI, resulting in flat zinc (002) oriented growth. Consequently, the Zn//Zn symmetrical cell features an ultrahigh cumulative capacity of 4.0&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under 34&#8201;% depth of discharge. The vitamin&#8208;optimized zinc&#8208;carbon capacitor features extended operational lifetimes exceeding 8&#8197;months (200 thousand cycles at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and demonstrates a high areal capacity of averaging 0.68&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exceptional durability over 2000&#8197;hours at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 under a high discharge depth of zinc anode (averaging 11.6&#8201;%). This work offers valuable insights into sustainable and cost&#8208;effective zinc&#8208;carbon capacitors.

         <title>Poly(2&#8208;Hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;Oxazoline) as Super&#8208;Hydrophilic Antifouling Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protected alcohol functional 2&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline (AcOMeOx) is synthesized with the aim of making a super hydrophilic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) for biomedical applications. The monomer showed unanticipated and intriguing reactivity during CROP as it very slowly polymerizes at low temperature while the polymerization rate constant at high temperature is amongst the highest known values. Additionally, first order kinetic plots for the copolymerisation of AcOMeOx with EtOx at high temperature revealed that EtOx is incorporated at a faster rate than the AcOMeOx, confirming both the low nucleophilicity of AcOMeOx and the chain end&#8208;activation by the ester side chains. Hydrolysis of the PAcOMeOx generates poly(2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PHOMeOx) which is found to be the most hydrophilic non&#8208;ionic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) reported to date. Strong anti&#8208;fouling properties of intensely hydrophilic and cytocompatible PHOMeOx against serum protein was confirmed from the cell association study.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ionic &#8220;super&#8208;hydrophilic&#8221; polymers generally possess strong non&#8208;fouling characteristics and, therefore, can suppress non&#8208;specific and unwanted interactions with blood proteins when attached to in vivo nanomedicine ranging from drug or gene delivery to diagnostics. In this contribution, we revitalize a protected alcohol functionalized 2&#8208;oxazoline monomer, 2&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline, that was first reported almost fifty&#8208;five years ago and explore the possibility of making &#8220;super&#8208;hydrophilic&#8221; poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s for biomedical applications. The synthesis of the 2&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline monomer and its cationic ring&#8208;opening homopolymerization and copolymerization kinetics are reported. The monomer showed unanticipated and intriguing reactivity during homopolymerization as it very slowly polymerizes at low temperature while the polymerization rate constant at high temperature is amongst the highest known values. Additionally, first order kinetic plots for the copolymerisation of AcOMeOx with EtOx at high temperature revealed that AcOMeOx is incorporated at a slower rate than EtOx confirming its lower nucleophilicity, while EtOx was accelerated in the copolymerization indicating chain&#8208;end activation by the ester side&#8208;chains. Subsequently, controlled hydrolysis of the resulting poly(2&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PAcOMeOx) generates the alcohol (&#8722;OH) side chain functional poly(2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PHOMeOx). The relative hydrophilicity of PHOMeOx was analyzed and compared with the previously reported most hydrophilic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s, such as poly(2&#8208;methoxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) and poly(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline), revealing that PHOMeOx is the most hydrophilic poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) reported to date. Finally, the cytocompatibility of these different hydrophilic polymers with MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 breast cancer cells was explored where all polymers revealed high cytocompatibility. Most importantly, strong anti&#8208;fouling properties of the most hydrophilic PHOMeOx against serum protein were observed during the cell association studies. Hence, the &#8220;super&#8208;hydrophilic&#8221; and anti&#8208;fouling PHOMeOx might be an interesting candidate to be explored in the area of polymeric drug and gene delivery as well as anti&#8208;fouling surfaces.

         <title>Printing Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy for Microvasculature using Degradable DNA Biolubricant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general PRINting Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy (PRINCESS) and successfully fabricated microvasculatures using degradable DNA biolubricant. This is the first demonstration of direct cell printing to fabricate microvasculature. Utilizing the DNA hydrogel as biolubricant, we can print a 70&#8197;&#956;m endothelialized microvasculature and cell&#8208;laden tissue constructs with branched microvasculatures.







Abstract
Microvasculature is essential for the continued function of cells in tissue and is fundamental in the fields of tissue engineering, organ repair and drug screening. However, the fabrication of microvasculature is still challenging using existing strategies. Here, we developed a general PRINting Cell Embedded Sacrificial Strategy (PRINCESS) and successfully fabricated microvasculatures using degradable DNA biolubricant. This is the first demonstration of direct cell printing to fabricate microvasculature, which eliminates the need for a subsequent cell seeding process and the associated deficiencies. Utilizing the shear&#8208;thinning property of DNA hydrogels as a novel sacrificial, cell&#8208;laden biolubricant, we can print a 70&#8197;&#956;m endothelialized microvasculature, breaking the limit of 100&#8197;&#956;m. To our best knowledge, this is the smallest endothelialized microvasculature that has ever been bioprinted so far. In addition, the self&#8208;healing property of DNA hydrogels allows the creation of continuous branched structures. This strategy provides a new platform for constructing complex hierarchical vascular networks and offers new opportunity towards engineering thick tissues. The extremely low volume of sacrificial biolubricant paves the way for DNA hydrogels to be used in practical tissue engineering applications. The high&#8208;resolution bioprinting technique also exhibits great potential for printing lymphatics, retinas and neural networks in the future.

         <title>Unveiling the Structure&#8208;Fluorogenic Property Relationship of Seoul&#8208;Fluor&#8208;Derived Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized fluorogenic Seoul&#8208;Fluor (SF)&#8208;based tetrazine (Tz) probes with differentiated turn&#8208;on fluorescence upon inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN), and spiro[2.3]hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene (Sph). Through electronic modifications and quantum calculations, we elucidated the relationship between dienophile&#8208;Tz adduct structures and their fluorogenic properties. These probes enabled simultaneous multicolor bioorthogonal imaging of diverse cellular targets using a single probe.







Abstract
Tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;embedded fluorescent probes, known for their fluorogenicity following bioorthogonal inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (iEDDA) reactions, are extensively used in bioimaging. Despite extensive research on fluorogenic Tz probes, there has been limited systematic exploration of their fluorogenic responses with various dienophiles. In this study, we elucidate the structure&#8208;fluorogenic property relationship of bioorthogonal Tz probes. We synthesized a series of Seoul&#8208;Fluor&#8208;Tz (SFTz) probes designed to exhibit differentiated turn&#8208;on fluorescence upon iEDDA reactions with three dienophiles: trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN), and spiro[2.3]hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene (Sph). Our findings revealed that the fluorogenic properties of the SFTz probes are highly dependent on the structures of Tz&#8208;dienophile adducts. By systematically modifying the electronic properties and employing quantum chemical calculations, we developed a series of SFTz probes with optimal dienophile&#8208;dependent fluorescence. These probes enabled simultaneous dual&#8208;color imaging of different cellular targets using a single probe, providing a robust approach for advanced bioimaging applications that require precise and efficient multicolor labeling strategies.

By systematically modifying the electronic properties and employing quantum chemical calculations, we developed a series of SF&lt;sub&gt;Tz&lt;/sub&gt; probes with optimal dienophile-dependent fluorescence. These probes enabled simultaneous dual-color imaging of different cellular targets using a single probe, providing a robust approach for advanced bioimaging applications that require precise and efficient multicolor labeling strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Electrolyte Network Structure for Improved Kinetics and Dendrite Suppression in Zn&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating co&#8208;solvents (PM) and additives (ZnI2), the electrolyte network structure was optimized, enhancing the interfacial stability between the cathode and anode while promoting the reversibility of sulfur cathodic transitions. Experimental results demonstrated that PM reshaped the ligand structure, improving Zn2+ transport kinetics. Additionally, PM interacted synergistically with ZnI2 to reduce cell polarization, catalyze sulfur cathode reactions, and mitigate I3&#8722;&#8208;induced zinc anode corrosion, significantly enhancing the electrochemical performance of the aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur battery.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur batteries (Zn&#8722;S) are promising alternatives to conventional lithium&#8208;ion technology due to their high energy density, low cost, and enhanced safety. However, challenges such as slow redox kinetics of sulfur cathode conversion and inadequate anode stability persist. This study demonstrates that by tuning the electrolyte structure with the introduction of propylene glycol methyl ether (PM) as a co&#8208;solvent and ZnI2 as an electrolyte additive, and significant improvements at both electrodes could be achieved. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the larger polar &#8722;OH and C&#8722;O&#8722;C electron&#8208;donating groups in the PM molecule can donate electrons for the redox reaction of I&#8722;/I3&#8722;. Its role as a redox mediator improves the reversibility of the sulfur cathodic transformation. Additionally, the dipole moment induced by the hydroxyl groups in PM enhances electron transfer from the zinc anode to the electrolyte and promote the decomposition of anions (OTF&#8722;), improving the interfacial stability of the zinc anode. The synergistic effect of PM and the I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox mediator pair enables the zinc&#8208;sulfur battery to deliver an impressive capacity of 1456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 471.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Optimizing s&#8211;p Orbital Overlap Between Sodium Polysulfides and Single&#8208;Atom Indium Catalyst for Efficient Sulfur Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The s&#8208;p orbital overlap degree between the s orbitals of Na in sodium polysulfides and the p orbitals of the carbon&#8208;supported p&#8208;block single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which serves as a descriptor to efficiently design promising nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;supported InN5 SACs with excellent sulfur reduction and oxidation reaction activities.







Abstract
P&#8208;block metal carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (C&#8208;SACs) have emerged as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries, due to their high atom utilization and unique electronic structure. However, the ambiguous electronic&#8208;level understanding of Na&#8208;dominant s&#8208;p hybridization between sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) and p&#8208;block C&#8208;SACs limits the precise control of coordination environment tuning and electro&#8208;catalytic activity manipulation. Here, s&#8208;p orbital overlap degree (OOD) between the s orbitals of Na in NaPSs and the p orbitals of p&#8208;block C&#8208;SACs is proposed as a descriptor for sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and sulfur oxidation reaction (SOR). Compared to NG and NG&#8208;supported InN4 (NG&#8208;InN4) SACs, the nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;supported InN5 (NG&#8208;InN5) SACs show the largest s&#8208;p OOD, demonstrating the weakest shuttle effect and the lowest reaction energy barriers in both SRR and SOR. Accordingly, the designed catalysts allow the Na&#8722;S pouch batteries to retain a high capacity of 490.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 96&#8201;% at a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 4.5&#8197;&#956;l&#8201;mg&#8722;1. This work offers an s&#8208;p orbital overlap descriptor describing the interaction between NaPSs and p&#8208;orbital&#8208;dominated catalysts for high&#8208;performance RT Na&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Cascade Reaction Enables Heterointerfaces&#8208;Enriched Nanoarrays for Ampere&#8208;Level Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

This study introduces an innovative cascade reaction in a molten salt environment to synthesize heterostructure nanoarrays, enhancing hydrogen production. Using nickel foam, transition metal salts and potassium thiocyanate, it develops catalysts with superior interfaces that significantly improve electrochemical activity and stability under high current densities.







Abstract
Designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts with superior catalytic activity and stability is essential for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Heterostructure nanoarrays are promising candidates, though achieving both high activity and stability simultaneously, especially under high current densities, remains challenging. To this end, we have developed a cascade reaction process that constructs a series of heterostructure nanoarrays with rich heterointerfaces. This process involves treating nickel foam (NF) with molten KSCN and transition metal salts. Initially, NF reacts with KSCN to form Ni9S8 nanoarrays and S2&#8722; ions, which are subsequently captured by transition metal ions to form sulfides that are directly integrated onto the nanoarrays, resulting in abundant heterointerfaces. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that these rich heterointerfaces significantly enhance the interfacial interaction between Ni9S8 and RuS2 within the nanoarrays (termed RH&#8208;Ni9S8/RuS2), markedly improving both the intrinsic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Impressively, the RH&#8208;Ni9S8/RuS2 demonstrates exceptional HER performance, achieving a low overpotential of just 180&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for up to 500&#8197;h under such high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions. This innovative approach paves the way for the interfacial design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance catalysts for ampere&#8208;level hydrogen production.

         <title>Breaking Performance Barriers in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) Analogs by Functional Group Self&#8208;Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel KBBF&#8208;analog arsenates, CsAs2O3Br and CsAs4O6Br, have been successfully synthesized via functional group self&#8208;polymerization. These compounds set a new benchmark among KBBF&#8208;like materials, exhibiting extraordinary second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (20.5&#215; KDP for CsAs2O3Br) and large uniaxial birefringence (0.26@546&#8197;nm for CsAs4O6Br), breaking performance barriers for KBBF analogs.







Abstract
Enhancing the conversion efficiency of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lasers through the rational design of crystal materials with superior linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a novel approach to optimizing these properties in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF)&#8208;analog crystals via functional group self&#8208;polymerization. This strategy led to the synthesis of two new optical crystals: noncentrosymmetric CsAs2O3Br and centrosymmetric CsAs4O6Br. By incorporating highly optically active [AsO3]3&#8722; units into the classical 2D [Be2BO3F]&#8734;&#8722; framework, we facilitated the self&#8208;assembly of [As2O3]&#8734; layers, forming a densely packed and highly ordered structure that enhances macroscopic optical activity. CsAs2O3Br exhibited an extraordinary second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, 20.5 times stronger than KH2PO4 (KDP), while CsAs4O6Br demonstrated exceptional birefringence (0.26 at 546&#8197;nm), setting new performance benchmarks among KBBF analogs. Theoretical analyses reveal that these superior properties arise from the efficient alignment and high density of self&#8208;polymerized functional units. This work represents a significant advancement in the design of high&#8208;performance UV NLO materials, particularly for fourth&#8208;harmonic generation, and paves the way for future innovations in photonic technologies, including solar&#8208;blind UV laser systems and advanced photonic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Two novel KBBF-analog arsenates, CsAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br and CsAs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Br, have been successfully synthesized via functional group self-polymerization. These compounds set a new benchmark among KBBF-like materials, exhibiting extraordinary second-harmonic generation responses (20.5&#215; KDP for CsAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br) and large uniaxial birefringence (0.26@546&#8197;nm for CsAs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Br), breaking performance barriers for KBBF analogs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhancing the conversion efficiency of all-solid-state lasers through the rational design of crystal materials with superior linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a novel approach to optimizing these properties in KBe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (KBBF)-analog crystals via functional group self-polymerization.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; framework, we facilitated the self-assembly of [As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt; layers, forming a densely packed and highly ordered structure that enhances macroscopic optical activity.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Covalent Organic Frameworks on Carbon Nanotubes for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

The TpPa&#8208;COF enriched with &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine has been in situ grown on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNT) via a simple solvothermal method, which can activate numerous K+ storage sites. Enol&#8208;keto tautomerism reinforces the structural stability and improves K+ adsorption capability. The obtained TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocables exhibit outstanding potassium storage performance, with high reversible capacity, excellent rate property, and ultralong cycling stability.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been demonstrated as promising organic electrodes in many electrochemical devices. However, their inherently low conductivity significantly hinders the full utilization of their internal redox&#8208;active sites. To address this issue, a simple solvothermal method is used to in situ polymerize 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP) and p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PA) on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), generating a nanocable&#8208;like COF&#8208;based nanocomposite, TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocables, which contain abundant &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine groups. By combining the high specific surface area and dense active sites of COFs with the superior conductivity of CNTs, the TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocables as the anode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries displayed excellent performance. The reason is that the isomerization between the enolic and keto forms reinforces the stability of molecular architecture, while the transformation of active sites from C=N to C=O improves the K+ adsorption capability. Notably, the TpPa&#8208;COF@CNT nanocable anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 446.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains 282.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after 2000&#8197;cycles at a higher current density of 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, a full battery assembled with 3,4,9,10&#8208;Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride heat&#8208;treated at 450&#8201;&#176;C as the cathode retains a reversible capacity of 273.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Hybrid Enzyme&#8208;Electrocatalyst Cascade Modified Gas&#8208;Diffusion Electrodes for Methanol Formation from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards the development of technologies for the conversion of excess atmospheric CO2, a hybrid electrocatalytic/bioelectrocatalytic system combining an inorganic catalyst with a bienzymatic cascade for CO2 electroreduction to methanol is presented. The Ag&#8208;Bi2O3 electrocatalyst enables the selective conversion of CO2 to formate. The generated formate is subsequently converted in a two&#8208;step process catalyzed by the two NADH&#8208;dependent enzymes, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, via formaldehyde to methanol. NADH regeneration is ensured by diaphorase wired to the electrode by a redox polymer.







Abstract
We propose a hybrid electrocatalytic&#8208;bioelectrocatalytic reaction cascade integrated on a gas diffusion electrode for CO2 reduction under selective formation of methanol. Ag&#8208;Bi2O3 selectively reduces gaseous CO2 to formate at neutral pH conditions. A subsequent enzymatic cascade comprising formaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, which are both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)&#8208;dependent, further reduce formate sequentially to formaldehyde and methanol. The enzymatically oxidized redox cofactor NAD+ is regenerated through the enzyme diaphorase which is electrochemically coupled to the electrode by embedding it into a cobaltocene&#8208;based low&#8208;potential redox polymer. Methanol formation is confirmed using a highly selective biosensor based on alcohol oxidase in combination with horseradish peroxidase integrated into a specifically adapted redox polymer. The proposed hybrid electrocatalytic&#8208;bioelectrocatalytic cascade is an example for a general strategy for enhancing the selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions and/or to replace bioelectrochemically challenging steps such as the synthesis of formate from CO2 using highly oxygen&#8208;sensitive formate dehydrogenases by more robust inorganic electrocatalysts.

We successfully synthesized and isolated a stable triplet&#8208;ground&#8208;state Kekul&#233; diradical polycyclic hydrocarbon &#8211; a kinetically blocked derivative of dianthraceno[2,3&#8208;a:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene. Its triplet ground state was unequivocally confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance and superconducting quantum interference device measurements, and its structure and electronic properties were revealed. The electronic structures of its dication and dianion were also studied.







Abstract
High&#8208;spin polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) hold significant potential in organic spintronics and organic magnets. However, their synthesis is very challenging due to their extremely high reactivity. Herein, we report the successful synthesis and isolation of a kinetically blocked derivative (1) of dianthraceno[2,3&#8208;a&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;h]&#8208;s&#8208;indacene, which represents a rare persistent triplet diradical of a Kekul&#233; PH. Its triplet ground state was unambiguously confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance and superconducting quantum interference device measurements. Its structure was also unequivocally confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and its electronic properties were systematically investigated by both experiments and theoretical calculations. The key design principle is to extend the &#960;&#8208;conjugation for achieving the decrease of the bonding interaction and the increase of the exchange interaction between unpaired electrons, which are essential for accessing the stable triplet ground state. Due to kinetic blocking, 1 shows a reasonable stability with a half&#8208;life time of 64&#8197;h under ambient conditions. It has a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and displays amphoteric redox behavior. Notably, its dication and dianion exhibit a closed&#8208;shell ground state and near&#8208;infrared absorption, and the structures were identified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. This study will shed new light on the design and synthesis of novel stable PHs with high&#8208;spin multiplicity.

         <title>Photosynthesis of H2O2 using Phenothiazine&#8208;Based Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks Mimicking Coenzyme Q</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report COFs based on oxidized phenothiazine to emulate Coenzyme Q, enhancing charge transfer and H2O2 synthesis efficiency. The PTH&#8208;SO2&#8208;COF showed a 7755&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 synthesis rate, a 720&#8201;% improvement over PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF, reaching 13565&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 upon adjusting the sacrificial agent ratio. In situ characterizations and simulations confirmed three H2O2 evolution pathways, advancing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts through artificial enzyme&#8208;mimicking.







Abstract
Mimicking natural enzymes through artificial enzyme engineering represents a powerful strategy to fine&#8208;tune the performance of photocatalysts, while the manipulation of electron transfer systems through atomic precision control is challenging. Herein, we reported a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on progressively oxidized phenothiazine (PTH) core as the platform for emulating Coenzyme Q, achieved through meticulous stepwise adjustments of their redox states. Compared to the original PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF, the COFs with incrementally oxidized sulfur sites exhibited enhanced charge transfer efficiencies, facilitating efficient electron donation to O2 and thereby providing a favorable pathway for H2O2 synthesis. Notably, the PTH&#8208;SO2&#8208;COF achieved a remarkable synthesis rate of 7755&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, marking a 720&#8201;% improvement over the PTH&#8208;S&#8208;COF baseline. Furthermore, upon adjusting the sacrificial agent ratio, this rate soared to an impressive 13565&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing the most reported photo&#8208;active COFs. In situ characterizations and simulations verified that three H2O2 evolution pathways (2e&#8722; ORR, 4e&#8722; OER, and 4e&#8722; ORR) all involved in the H2O2 production process. As a result, our findings introduce a novel pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts through the innovative application of artificial enzyme&#8208;mimicking techniques.

         <title>Precise Supramolecular Nanoarchitectonics for Simultaneous Enhanced Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis in a Co&#8208;Assembly by a Biomimetic Isolation&#8208;Conduction Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two mutually exclusive physicochemical processes of photoluminescence and photocatalysis have been achieved simultaneously in a co&#8208;assembly by a biomimetic isolation&#8208;conduction strategy based on arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (A&#8722;P) interactions. The resultant co&#8208;assembly has been exploited to build a sequential fluoric wastewater reuse system for real&#8208;time fluorescence detection/removal of perfluorooctanoic acids (PFOA) and photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
Limited by the two mutually exclusive physicochemical processes of separation and recombination of photogenerated carriers, achieving photoluminescence and photocatalysis simultaneously is extremely challenging but essential for ever&#8208;growing complex issues and specialized scenarios. Here we proposed a biomimetic isolation&#8208;conduction strategy induced by an arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (A&#8722;P) interaction for enabling photoluminescence and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in the co&#8208;assembly of aromatic monomers and octafluoronapthalene (OFN). Inspired by the isolation&#8208;conduction effect of periodic isolation of myelin sheaths on the axons of vertebrate nerve fibers by node of Ranvier, we use OFN as a molecular isolator embedded in the aromatic monomers array to block the singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet pathway, while the enlarged intermolecular dipoles resulting from the A&#8722;P interactions facilitate the conduction of photogenerated carriers in the isolated regions. The resultant co&#8208;assembly exhibits an enhanced monomeric green emission compared to the corresponding monocomponent self&#8208;assembly with weak red emission. Meanwhile, it also has an enhanced photocatalytic HER performance with a rate of 2.45&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 15.2&#8197;times more than the self&#8208;assembled one. On this basis, a sequential fluoric wastewater reuse system that includes real&#8208;time fluorescence detection/removal of perfluorooctanoic acids and photocatalytic HER device is constructed.

         <title>Simultaneous High Current Density and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 through Intermediate Balancing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative CuBIM catalyst has a remarkable CH4 formation rate of 3.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a high CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 51.7&#8201;% at 1,300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH. The distant Cu&#8722;Cu sites (~5.7&#8197;&#197;) in the Cu&#8722;N coordination polymer favor multistep *CO hydrogenation, and the proper ratio of CuO component ensures adequate *H supply, enabling high current density and highly selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4 is promising for carbon neutrality and renewable energy storage but confronts low CH4 selectivity, especially at high current densities. The key challenge lies in promoting *CO intermediate and *H coupling while minimizing side reactions including C&#8722;C coupling and H&#8722;H coupling, which is particularly difficult at high current density due to abundant intermediates. Here we report a cooperative strategy to address this challenge using Cu&#8208;based catalysts comprising Cu&#8722;N coordination polymer and CuO component that can simultaneously manage the key intermediates *CO and *H. A fast CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion rate of 3.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 is achieved at 1,300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 51.7&#8201;%. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations show that the increased Cu&#8722;Cu distance in the Cu&#8722;N coordination polymer component favors multistep *CO hydrogenation over the dimerization, and the CuO component ensures an adequate supply of *H, together contributing to the selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion at high current densities. This work develops a cooperative strategy for the electrosynthesis of CH4 with simultaneous high current density and high selectivity by rational catalyst design, paving the way for its applications.

         <title>Chemistry as a Catalyst for Transforming the Health and Wealth of South Africa</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>

South Africa's rich natural resources fuelled its industrialisation but are marred by its colonial past. Despite 30&#8197;years of democracy, deep inequalities remain, with infectious diseases disproportionately affecting disadvantaged communities. Chemistry and biomedical research can help to address these challenges. This Viewpoint advocates for chemistry&#8208;driven advancements tailored to South Africa's socioeconomic needs to improve healthcare and economic outcomes.







Abstract
South Africa's rich natural resources remain a key driver of its chemical industrialisation but are tainted and constrained by its complex colonial history. Thirty years since the advent of democracy in South Africa, deep sociopolitical inequalities are amplified by an intolerable infectious disease burden amongst disadvantaged communities. In that respect, South Africa shares challenges with many other nations in the Global South; there are limited opportunities for the economic development and growth needed to uplift all strata of society. This Viewpoint examines the role of the chemical sciences in South Africa's unique history and the current state of its academic and industrial sectors, with a focus on the intersection of chemistry, healthcare and biomedical research. We argue that the opportunities offered through chemistry research and development, including local manufacturing, should be exploited and that scientific advancements should be tailored to and integrated with the socioeconomic realities of South Africa for an effective and multidisciplinary approach to improving healthcare outcomes. This Viewpoint aims to inspire a renewed focus on the pivotal role of chemical scientists and their broader societal contributions to combating the country's infectious disease burden and shaping a healthier future for South Africa.

&lt;p&gt;South Africa's rich natural resources fuelled its industrialisation but are marred by its colonial past. Despite 30&#8197;years of democracy, deep inequalities remain, with infectious diseases disproportionately affecting disadvantaged communities. Chemistry and biomedical research can help to address these challenges. This Viewpoint advocates for chemistry-driven advancements tailored to South Africa's socioeconomic needs to improve healthcare and economic outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa's rich natural resources remain a key driver of its chemical industrialisation but are tainted and constrained by its complex colonial history. Thirty years since the advent of democracy in South Africa, deep sociopolitical inequalities are amplified by an intolerable infectious disease burden amongst disadvantaged communities. In that respect, South Africa shares challenges with many other nations in the Global South; there are limited opportunities for the economic development and growth needed to uplift all strata of society. This Viewpoint examines the role of the chemical sciences in South Africa's unique history and the current state of its academic and industrial sectors, with a focus on the intersection of chemistry, healthcare and biomedical research. We argue that the opportunities offered through chemistry research and development, including local manufacturing, should be exploited and that scientific advancements should be tailored to and integrated with the socioeconomic realities of South Africa for an effective and multidisciplinary approach to improving healthcare outcomes. This Viewpoint aims to inspire a renewed focus on the pivotal role of chemical scientists and their broader societal contributions to combating the country's infectious disease burden and shaping a healthier future for South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Mechanics&#8211;photophysics correlation in tough, stretchable and long&#8208;lived roomtemperature phosphorescence ionogels is deciphered by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). In their Research Article (e202419114), Y. Tang et al. utilize DMA to explore the relationship between the mechanical and photophysical properties and explain it using two special temperatures (Tloss and Tg). Such a method shows the merits of immediate indication of performance toward ionogels, like a human brain that perceives a material instantaneously by linking visual senses with the tactile senses.

Diverse chirality evolution originating from the same building blocks can be simultaneously triggered, as demonstrated by Chuanliang Feng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202417876). The study highlights the construction of supramolecular networks composed of M&#8208; and P&#8208;type nanofibers through the self&#8208;assembly of homochiral phenylalanine derivatives. The cover illustration symbolizes this phenomenon, depicting flowers with opposite chirality, all blossoming simultaneously from the same seeds.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective polypseudorotaxane formation via co&#8208;crystallization of stereodynamic planar chiral pillar[5]arene and polyethylene glycol is reported by Tomoki Ogoshi et al. in their Research Article (e202420115). In the image, the bracelet represents the polypseudorotaxane, with blue and red stones depicting the pS and pR forms of the pillar[5]arene ring, respectively. The crystals between the stones imply the crystallization method. As the number of stones increases, the possible combinations multiply, making selection more difficult, but ultimately, you will find the bracelet that suits you best.

The structural motifs and interaction patterns of four different isomers of ethanol trimer were identified by their rotational spectra aided by extensive quantum chemical calculations, as reported by M. Eugenia Sanz et al. in their Research Article (e202415229). Higher&#8208;energy ethanol conformers are predominant in the observed clusters but there is no homochirality synchronization. This study provides insight into the aggregation of an archetypal alcohol.

Ultrasensitive characterization of native bacterial biofilm: A high&#8208;sensitivity dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR method illuminates the composition of intact native bacterial biofilm. The DNP sensitivity boost (~75&#8208;fold) allows observing NMR signals of biofilms composed of bacteria and extracellular matrix at natural abundance, shown here for Pseudomonas. Chemical identification quantifies the biofilm components, as reported by &#220;mit Akbey et^^al. in their Research Article (e202418146).

         <title>Frontispiece: Improving Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin with Triethanolamine as a CO2 Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to improve carbon dioxide delivery in solutions for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is reported by Xue&#8208;Peng Zhang, Rui Cao et al. in their Communication (e202500154). By shuttling CO2 with triethanolamine, which can capture CO2 to form zwitterionic alkylcarbonate and release the bound CO2 at catalytic Fe tetraphenylporphyrin sites, the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity can be significantly increased.

&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy to improve carbon dioxide delivery in solutions for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is reported by Xue-Peng Zhang, Rui Cao et al. in their Communication (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202500154"&gt;e202500154&lt;/a&gt;). By shuttling CO2 with triethanolamine, which can capture CO2 to form zwitterionic alkylcarbonate and release the bound CO2 at catalytic Fe tetraphenylporphyrin sites, the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity can be significantly increased.

         <title>Fluorescent Macrocyclic Arenes: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides a comprehensive summary of the synthesis, properties, and applications of fluorescent macrocyclic arenes (FMAs) composed of polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic skeletons that have emerged in the past decade. The FMAs are categorized on the basis of the different building blocks incorporated.







Abstract
Fluorescent macrocyclic arenes have attracted increasing interest in macrocyclic and supramolecular chemistry due to their exceptional photophysical properties and versatile applications. Classical macrocyclic arenes modified with fluorescent groups at the upper or bottom rims have long provided valuable platforms across various fields. Recently, a large number of novel fluorescent macrocyclic arenes directly composed of polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic building blocks including naphthalene, anthracene, tetraphenylethene, pyrene, fluorene, carbazole, acridan, phenothiazine, coumarin, triphenylamine, benzothiadiazole and so on, have been reported, and they have shown specific fluorescent property, and also exhibited broad applications in molecular recognition, sensing, bioimaging and functional materials. In this review, we focus on the recent advances in the synthesis and applications of fluorescent macrocyclic arenes containing polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic skeletons emerged in the past decade. By categorizing these fluorescent macrocyclic arenes based on the different building blocks, this review provides a comprehensive summary of their synthesis, properties and applications.

Creating functional polyolefins using customized units has attracted increasing attention. This review summarizes the application of functional units such as comonomers, chain transfer agents, post&#8208;polymerization modification reagents, and functional fillers for preparing functional polyolefins and composites.







Abstract
Polyolefins are simple hydrocarbons that require additional chemical modifications or functional additives to give them custom functions. Recent research in the development of functional polyolefins has surpassed the traditional approach of simply improving surface properties by incorporating polar moieties. Creating custom functionalized polyolefins by using specific functional units has attracted increasing attention. This review summarizes advances in preparing custom functionalized polyolefin materials using functional units such as comonomers, chain&#8208;transfer agents, post&#8208;polymerization modification reagents, and functional fillers. Exploring new functional units and innovative synthetic strategies will further enhance the performance and expand the applications of functional polyolefins.

It also explores some significant breakthroughs in the field of combination therapy.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials offer a transformative platform for photothermal therapy (PTT) due to their unique physicochemical properties and exceptional photothermal conversion efficiencies. This Minireview summarizes the photothermal mechanisms of common 2D nanomaterials and details their synthesis, surface modification, and optimization strategies. Recent advances leveraging 2D nanomaterials for enhanced PTT are highlighted, with particular emphasis on synergistic therapeutic modalities.

         <title>Metal Nanoclusters as Highly Efficient, Versatile Type&#8208;II Photoinitiators via Generating Radicals from Non&#8208;Conventional Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that metal nanoclusters can function as highly efficient, versatile type&#8208;II photoinitiators via generating various types of non&#8208;conventional thiyl and nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals. Discovery of this underlying photochemcial process could open the door of applying metal nanoclusters in photolithography and other emerging applications using inexpensive light sources with low intensities.







Abstract
Development of highly efficient photocatalysis or photoinitiation systems that are applicable to various types of illumination source is critical to virtually all the light&#8208;driven applications. Here, we report a generalizable strategy to achieve highly sensitive, versatile photoinitiation systems based on the combination of metal nanoclusters with non&#8208;conventional hydrogen donors (co&#8208;initiators). Discovery of this type&#8208;II photoinitiation pathway in metal nanoclusters not only improves their two&#8208;photon initiation sensitivity by up to three&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude, it further opens the door for metal nanoclusters to trigger the photopolymerization using the low&#8208;power UV light&#8208;emitting diodes. Different from molecular type&#8208;II photoinitiators, we found that the selection rules of hydrogen donors for metal nanoclusters are largely dependent on their ligand structures. More importantly, using electron paramagnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy, we for the first time demonstrate that the photoexcited metal nanoclusters can function as versatile hydrogen atom abstractors which generate various types of previously unreported thiyl and nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals. This finding indicates the broad opportunity of the future application of metal nanoclusters in light&#8208;driven organic synthesis and radical chemistry.

         <title>Thermally Induced Reversible Martensitic Phase Transition and Self&#8208;Healing in Nickel Glycinamide Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A martensitic&#8208;type polymorphic transition accompanied by self&#8208;healing was observed in a nickel coordination compound. A single crystal is transformed into a two&#8208;component twinned crystal in a reversible twinning/detwinning thermally induced polymorphic transition. The coexistence of both polymorphs was observed within the same crystal, and the cracks heal upon the reversible transition.







Abstract
Martensitic phase transitions and self&#8208;healing in molecular compounds are extremely rare, and while they carry potential for rapid energy transduction, they are currently found only by serendipity. Here, we report the observation of both phenomena in a coordination compound of glycinamide (Glyam), [Ni(H2O)2(Glyam)2]I2 (1). Upon cooling to 205&#8211;213&#8197;K, the high&#8208;temperature polymorph of this material (1RT) transforms into twinned crystals of the low&#8208;temperature polymorph (1LT(twinned)), while upon heating, it is converted back to 1RT in the temperature range 217&#8211;223&#8197;K. When this transformation occurs in single crystals, evolution of cracks is observed upon cooling that disappear upon heating. The forward transition 1RT&#8594;1LT(twinned) is completed in a few seconds, while the reverse one, 1LT(twinned)&#8594;1RT, proceeds up to several hours, contrary to the fast transition in polycrystalline samples. We determined the concomitant presence of 1RT and 1LT(twinned) in the same single crystal. The crystal structure analysis revealed complex inter&#8208; and intramolecular displacements of atoms during the transition. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second report where a thermally induced reversible martensitic phase transition and self&#8208;healing are observed in crystals of a coordination compound, and indicates the potential generality of these extraordinary phenomena.

&lt;/b&gt; in the temperature range 217&#8211;223&#8197;K. When this transformation occurs in single crystals, evolution of cracks is observed upon cooling that disappear upon heating. The forward transition &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;RT&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8594;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;LT(twinned)&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is completed in a few seconds, while the reverse one, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;LT(twinned)&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8594;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;RT&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, proceeds up to several hours, contrary to the fast transition in polycrystalline samples. We determined the concomitant presence of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;RT&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;LT(twinned&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; in the same single crystal. The crystal structure analysis revealed complex inter- and intramolecular displacements of atoms during the transition. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second report where a thermally induced reversible martensitic phase transition and self-healing are observed in crystals of a coordination compound, and indicates the potential generality of these extraordinary phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Barrierless Electron Transfer in a Photosynthetic Reaction Center Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast IR absorption spectroscopy was utilized to interrogate excited&#8208;state electron transfer in a strongly&#8208;coupled, cyanide&#8208;bridged photoinduced mixed&#8208;valent system. Despite structural asymmetry, a flat excited&#8208;state potential energy surface with a single minimum was found, showing a Class&#8197;III behavior. These findings were supported by DFT/TD&#8208;DFT calculations.







Abstract
Vibrational spectroscopy is the ultimate tool to reveal whether any donor&#8208;acceptor system is truly delocalized and therefore characterized by a single&#8208;welled potential energy surface, or if it is marginally localized with a barrier that defines two minima. Our femtosecond IR absorption investigations on cyanide&#8208;bridged mixed valence systems show a broad, intense and downshifted CN vibration signature, revealing, for the first time, an asymmetric, fully delocalized Class III photoinduced mixed valence system.

         <title>Surface&#8208;like NOx Reduction at an Atomically&#8208;Precise Tricopper Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report catalytic total denitrification of nitric oxide (NO) at a surface&#8208;like tricopper cluster complex. This process is shown to proceed via an oxygen atom transfer pathway that leverages the metal&#8208;metal cooperativity of the polynuclear core. Stoichiometric deoxygenation of nitrite and nitrate are also demonstrated, mapping out the complete denitrification cycle.







Abstract
The combustion of nitrogen&#8208;containing fuels and increasing use of nitrogen&#8208;rich fertilizers is accumulating NOx pollutants in the environment. Copper is an attractive catalyst material for reductive NOx remediation, yet ambiguity persists regarding the elementary bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking steps occurring at the catalyst interface. Starting from a molecular tricuprous &#956;3&#8208;oxo complex (1), an unusually reduced and highly reactive surface&#8208;like cluster (2) has been prepared. Characterization data and electronic structure calculations are consistent with 2 featuring &#963;&#8208;aromaticity that primes the tricopper core for two&#8208;electron chemistry. Cluster 2 mediates catalytic reductive coupling of NO to N2, proceeding through N2O, via sequential oxygen atom transfer steps. Stoichiometric reduction of NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722; is also disclosed, mapping the complete denitrification cycle at an atomically&#8208;precise molecular cluster.

         <title>Halogenated Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes as Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropene Surrogates</title>

         <dc:description>
Halogenated donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes (HDACs) are presented as viable surrogates for donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8722;A) cyclopropenes. Upon cycloaddition with a variety of 2&#960;&#8208;components, spontaneous elimination of HX occurs, giving rise to the products of a formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition to a (D&#8722;A) cyclopropene. Six types of cycloaddition reactions are presented using HDACs and a kinetic study was undertaken to gain further understanding of this reactivity.







Abstract
Herein we report (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition reactions of halogenated donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes (HDACs) as surrogates for donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropenes. Upon reaction with a variety of 2&#960;&#8208;components, cycloaddition followed by elimination generates the unsaturated five&#8208;membered ring products. A series of HDACs were shown to be effective in reactions with thioketones. Five further cycloaddition reactions were used to showcase the broad applicability of these donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropene surrogates. Kinetic studies allowed the proposal of a plausible mechanism for this reaction.

         <title>Improving Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin with Triethanolamine as a CO2 Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of Fe porphyrins can be significantly enhanced with triethanolamine, which can function as a CO2 shuttle to capture CO2 and bring it to the Fe porphyrin site for binding and activation. The unique tripodal structure of triethanolamine is essential for capturing CO2 to form a zwitterionic alkylcarbonate. This work is significant to present a new strategy to promote the activation of CO2 in solutions.







Abstract
Delivering CO2 molecules to catalyst sites is a vital step in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Achievements have been made to develop efficient catalysts, but few efforts have been dedicated to improving CO2 delivering in solutions. Herein, we report on electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion using Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP) as a catalyst and triethanolamine as a CO2 shuttle. Compared to ethanol, the electrocatalytic CO2RR current with triethanolamine increases by more than three times. We show that triethanolamine can effectively capture a CO2 molecule to form a zwitterionic alkylcarbonate through the collaboration between its tripodal alcohol and amine units. This alkylcarbonate can release the bound CO2 molecule for activation at the Fe site upon its interaction with FeTPP. In addition to shuttling CO2, alkylcarbonates can also provide protons to assist the C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Therefore, this work is significant to demonstrate a new strategy to improve electrocatalytic CO2RR by shuttling CO2.

         <title>Selective and Potent Molecular Glue Degraders for NIMA&#8208;Related Kinase 7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first well&#8208;characterized and selective NIMA&#8208;related kinase 7 (NEK7) molecular glue degrader LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 was developed. By degrading NEK7 protein, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 deactivated the NLRP3 inflammasome and showed potent inhibitory effects on the release of the downstream cytokines.







Abstract
Molecular glue degraders (MGDs) represent a promising strategy for targeted protein degradation within cells. While chemoproteomics has unveiled hundreds of potential MGD targets, very few proteins are degraded by highly selective and potent MGDs. Here, we developed a novel glutarimide analog with a tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine scaffold that exhibited strong NIMA&#8208;related kinase 7 (NEK7) degradation potential. Further optimization led to the identification of LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 as a leading NEK7 MGD candidate, demonstrating potent activity with a half&#8208;maximal degradation (DC50) of 7&#8197;nM and a maximum degradation (Dmax) of 90&#8201;% in MOLT&#8208;4 cells. Notably, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 displayed high selectivity for NEK7 across the proteome. Mechanistic studies indicated that the degradation was mediated by the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) and relied on the glycine 57 (G57)&#8208;containing degron motif in NEK7. Additionally, two amino acids adjacent to the degron motif were found to be crucial for modulating the compound's selectivity and potency, underscoring the significance of neighbouring residues in MGD design. Moreover, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 effectively inhibited secretion of the downstream cytokines, including IL&#8208;1&#946; and IL&#8208;18, highlighting the potential therapeutic applications of NEK7 MGDs in treating inflammatory diseases.

&lt;p&gt;The first well-characterized and selective NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) molecular glue degrader LC-04-045 was developed. By degrading NEK7 protein, LC-04-045 deactivated the NLRP3 inflammasome and showed potent inhibitory effects on the release of the downstream cytokines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular glue degraders (MGDs) represent a promising strategy for targeted protein degradation within cells. While chemoproteomics has unveiled hundreds of potential MGD targets, very few proteins are degraded by highly selective and potent MGDs. Here, we developed a novel glutarimide analog with a tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]pyrazine scaffold that exhibited strong NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) degradation potential. Further optimization led to the identification of LC-04-045 as a leading NEK7 MGD candidate, demonstrating potent activity with a half-maximal degradation (DC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 7&#8197;nM and a maximum degradation (D&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 90&#8201;% in MOLT-4 cells. Notably, LC-04-045 displayed high selectivity for NEK7 across the proteome.

         <title>Metal&#8722;Organic Framework with Constrained Flexibility for Benchmark Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D ligand metal&#8722;organic framework ZUL&#8722;C6 with an alkyl&#8208;rich, confined pore system, obtains high&#8208;capacity molecular sieving separation for hexane isomer mixtures in a wide pressure range, benefiting from its constrained flexibility which is driven by the non&#8208;centrosymmetric rotation and distortion of the coordination units with a high deformation energy barrier, achieving benchmark hexane isomer separation performance.Twitter/X handle: vigaryang76749.







Abstract
Flexible metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for adsorptive separations, but achieving a balance among flexibility, adsorption capacity, and selectivity remains challenging. Herein, we report a novel flexible MOF, Ni(bhdc)(ted)0.5 (ZUL&#8722;C6), incorporating hybrid three&#8208;dimensional alkane&#8208;bridged ligands, which realizes high&#8208;capacity molecular sieving for hexane isomer separation &#8208; a critical process in the petroleum industry. The alkyl&#8208;rich, confined pore system within the ZUL&#8722;C6 framework facilitated a strong affinity for n&#8208;hexane and 3&#8208;methylpentane. However, the narrow pore size and the constrained flexibility limited the uptake of 2,2&#8208;dimethylbutane (&lt;4.0&#8197;mg/g), accompanied by a high gate&#8208;opening pressure. The gating behavior was elucidated by guest&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal (SC) X&#8208;ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which revealed a unique SC to SC transformation driven by the non&#8208;centrosymmetric rotation of the 3D bhdc linker and distortion of the metal cluster and pillar units, along with a high deformation energy barrier. As a result, ZUL&#8722;C6 exhibited not only significantly higher uptake and selectivity than the industrially used 5&#8197;A molecular sieve, but also the record&#8208;high nHEX/3MP breakthrough uptake (92.8/73.9&#8197;mg/g) and unprecedented 22DMB producing time (309.2&#8197;min/g, corresponding to the productivity of 770&#8197;mmol/kg and yield of 92.8&#8201;%) among reported MOFs.

         <title>Validation and Mechanistic Studies of the Headspace Effect in MOF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a fixed vessel volume, the rate of metal&#8211;organic framework formation is shown to depend on the amount of solution employed. This headspace effect is demonstrated to arise only in the presence of oxygen. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that oxygen reacts with the formamide solvent and contributes to nitrosamine side products.







Abstract
The influence of headspace volume and composition on metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) synthesis has been largely overlooked with no mechanisms currently invoking these factors. Herein, we reveal that an increased volume of oxygen in the headspace during the synthesis of zinc carboxylate&#8208;based MOFs (MOF&#8208;5, MOF&#8208;177, and IRMOF&#8208;8) as well as UiO&#8208;66 and ZJU&#8208;28 accelerates crystal formation. Investigation into the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon elucidates the critical roles played by all reagents, and some of their byproducts, in MOF synthesis. These insights are the key to developing more efficient and sustainable synthetic strategies for MOF production.

         <title>Divergent Total Syntheses of Six Crinipellin&#8208;Type Diterpenoids through Tandem 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization/Dicycloexpansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 12, March 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A more straightforward approach to synthesize densely congested crinipellins has been accomplished in just 9&#8211;11 steps through strategic tandem 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/dicycloexpansion cascade and a series of highly regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and diastereoselective late&#8208;stage transformations without using protecting groups.







Abstract
Crinipellins are a significant class of naturally occurring highly congested tetraquinane diterpenoids, with many members exhibiting bio&#8208;important antibacterial and anticancer activities. However, their complex structures, particularly their dense 5/5/5/5 tetracyclic frameworks, have made efficient synthesis challenging, leading chemists to attempt to create highly efficient and divergent routes. This study presents a concise, divergent synthesis of six crinipellins, completed in just 9&#8211;11 steps using commercially available materials. Particular highlights include: (1) a vital one&#8208;step 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/dicycloexpansion cascade that rapidly constructs the angular/fused tetraquinane scaffold with two contiguous quaternary carbons, and (2) strategic functionalizations through iso&#8208;propylation, methylation, and Wacker oxidation/dehydrogenation, enabling the divergent syntheses of the six crinipellin members without using protecting groups. This approach provides a versatile platform for accessing additional crinipellin derivatives, which we believe will benefit medicinal and biological research.
