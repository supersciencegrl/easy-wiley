         <title>Chemical O&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylations: Synthesis and Bioconjugation of ADPr&#8208;Peptides/Proteins from NAD+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ADP&#8208;ribosylation is a complex post&#8208;translational modification involved in key physiological processes and associated with various health and disease states. The growing interest in ADP&#8208;ribosylation necessitates straightforward and efficient synthetic methods for the preparation of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides/proteins. In this study, we report a facile reaction between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and alcohols promoted by a combination of ionic liquids, yielding up to 94% with &#945;:&#946; ratios ranging from 88:12 to 99:1 and a switchable configuration selectivity. This method significantly simplifies the production of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides and proteins, enabling diverse applications. It allows detailed investigation of side&#8208;chain structure&#8208;activity relationships, facilitates two&#8208;step clickable conjugation of ADP&#8208;ribosyl groups to proteins, and, for the first time, enables non&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides/proteins from natural counterparts and NAD+.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Evaporation Enthalpy Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting at Low Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic COFs with numerous hydrophilic sites and high water stability were developed, achieving efficient water vapor adsorption and low enthalpy of evaporation at low humidity, offering cost&#8208;effective solutions for fresh water collection in desert regions.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce a series of ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with a focus on addressing the challenge of water collection at low relative humidity levels below 25&#8201;%. These iCOFs are characterized by numerous hydrophilic sites and high water stability, enabling efficient water vapor adsorption even at relatively low humidity levels. Through the use of various hygroscopic salt cations and precise control of ion concentration within the pores, the water state within the iCOFs pores can be effectively managed. Among the iCOFs, TB&#8208;COF&#8208;Li stands out with an impressive adsorption capacity of 0.24&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 from 0 to 22&#8201;% RH. Notably, due to its ionic porous structure, TB&#8208;COF&#8208;Li exhibits a significantly lower enthalpy of evaporation, measured at 967.04&#8197;J&#8201;g&#8722;1, compared to bulk water with an enthalpy of 2387.40&#8197;J&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, under simulated conditions of 1.5 solar intensity at 60&#8201;&#176;C, the majority of the adsorbed water can be rapidly desorbed without the need for additional energy input. This efficient desorption process contributes to a high water collection rate of 0.092&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in the final atmospheric water harvesting device. The development of these iCOFs offers a promising and cost&#8208;effective solution for obtaining fresh water in arid regions.

         <title>Complementary Reducing Agents are Responsible for Temporally Distinct Nucleation and Growth Phases During the Polyol Synthesis of Ag Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) end&#8208;groups are shown to initiate nucleation in the polyol synthesis of silver nanocubes. The rate of nucleation (k1) is smaller than digestion by O2/Cl&#8722; (k&#8208;1) until air is removed, but larger than growth of the cubes (k2), which is critical for maintaining shape control. Nuclei number density is controlled only by PVP end&#8208;group concentration, independent of Ag+ concentration. Selectivity to cubes requires a narrow window of particle number density due to the autocatalytic growth mechanism.







Abstract
Ethylene glycol or one of its oxidation products are believed to serve as reducing agents in the shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of Ag nanocubes (NCs) by the polyol process. The identity of end&#8208;groups of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) impacts shape control with alcohol and aldehyde moieties serving as a primary Ag reducing agent. We explored the role of PVP end&#8208;groups in the polyol process by measuring the dependence of particle number density of Ag NCs produced on the initial concentration(s) of Ag and PVP using small angle x&#8208;ray scattering and statistically large particle size distributions analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The number density of Ag NCs is strongly dependent on the starting concentration of PVP chains demonstrating PVP end&#8208;groups play an important role in the nucleation of NCs. The concentration of Ag+ is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the end&#8208;groups suggesting ethylene glycol must participate in the reduction of Ag+ during growth. Perturbation experiments and analysis of resultant particle size distribution reveal nucleation is fast relative to growth of NCs, reinforcing the synergy between PVP end&#8208;groups and ethylene glycol. The evidence demonstrates PVP end&#8208;groups and ethylene glycol are tandem reducing agents operative in temporally distinct phases of the polyol synthesis of Ag NCs.

         <title>Calcium Chemistry as A New Member of Post&#8208;Lithium Battery Family: What Can We Learn from Sodium and Magnesium Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium batteries are promising post&#8208;lithium technology featuring high&#8208;energy, low&#8208;cost and sustainability. According to the periodic table, Ca has similar physicochemical properties with Na and Mg in some aspects. This review discusses the similarity and difference between Ca and the other two more matured battery chemistries, hoping to provide new insights into the transport and storage mechanisms that accelerate the development of the emerging technology.







Abstract
The development of next&#8208;generation battery technologies needs to consider their environmental impact throughout the whole cycle life, which has brought new chemistries based on earth&#8208;abundant elements into the spotlight. Rechargeable calcium batteries are such an emerging technology, which shows the potential to provide high cell voltage and high energy density close to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Additionally, the use of Ca2+ as a charge carrier renders significant sustainable values. Although pioneering work on the electrochemistry of Ca has been carried out for more than half a century, demonstration of reversible Ca0/Ca2+ redox chemistry in non&#8208;aqueous media was only achieved within the past decade. In this review, we will present recent development of rechargeable calcium batteries, focusing on mainly the similarities but also differences between Ca chemistry and other post&#8208;lithium chemistry. According to the periodic nature of elements, magnesium (an alkaline earth element as Ca) and sodium (a diagonally adjacent element to Ca) have similar chemical properties to Ca in various aspects. We shall elaborate on how the solution chemistry, metal behaviors and transport mechanisms of Ca&#8208;ions can be better understood in light of the established principles in the respective Mg/Na systems. We hope the discussion will inspire synergetic development between Ca batteries and other post&#8208;lithium systems.

         <title>3,6&#8208;Bis(methylthio)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Highly Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methylthiocarbazole&#8208;based phosphonic acid, MeS&#8208;4PACz, capable of forming a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide has been developed. The molecule induces an interfacial dipole and passivates iodide vacancies in FAPbI3 perovskite. Inverted perovskite solar cells using MeS&#8208;4PACz SAM as a hole&#8208;selective layer achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.134&#8201;%.







Abstract
The photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) relies on effectively managing the interface between the hole extraction layer and the light&#8208;absorbing perovskite layer. In this study, we have synthesised (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (MeS&#8208;4PACz), which forms a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode. The molecule&#8216;s methylthio substituents generate a favourable interfacial dipole moment and interact with the perovskite layer. This interaction results in well&#8208;aligned energy levels among the FTO/SAM/perovskite layers, promoting efficient hole extraction and significantly reducing carrier recombination losses. Additionally, the methylthio groups passivate iodide vacancies and interact with Pb2+ ions of the perovskite, reducing defect&#8208;induced trap states and enhancing the crystalline growth of the perovskite layer. Consequently, inverted PSCs incorporating MeS&#8208;4PACz achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.13&#8201;%, along with outstanding photostability.

     alt="3,6-Bis(methylthio)-9H-carbazole Based Self-Assembled Monolayer for Highly Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A methylthiocarbazole-based phosphonic acid, MeS-4PACz, capable of forming a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on fluorine-doped tin oxide has been developed. The molecule induces an interfacial dipole and passivates iodide vacancies in FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite. Inverted perovskite solar cells using MeS-4PACz SAM as a hole-selective layer achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.134&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) relies on effectively managing the interface between the hole extraction layer and the light-absorbing perovskite layer. In this study, we have synthesised (4-(3,6-bis(methylthio)-9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-carbazol-9-yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (MeS-4PACz), which forms a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode. The molecule&#8216;s methylthio substituents generate a favourable interfacial dipole moment and interact with the perovskite layer. This interaction results in well-aligned energy levels among the FTO/SAM/perovskite layers, promoting efficient hole extraction and significantly reducing carrier recombination losses. Additionally, the methylthio groups passivate iodide vacancies and interact with Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions of the perovskite, reducing defect-induced trap states and enhancing the crystalline growth of the perovskite layer. Consequently, inverted PSCs incorporating MeS-4PACz achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.13&#8201;%, along with outstanding photostability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Engineering of Chalcogen&#8208;Bridged Chiral Molecules for Efficient OLEDs with Diverse Luminescence Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing isomeric molecular engineering to tune electronic and vibrational spin&#8208;orbital coupling effects, several chiral molecules have been developed to exploit both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) mechanisms for efficient luminescence. The TADF&#8208;based OLEDs achieve a high external quantum efficiency of 30.1&#8201;%, and by modulating the TADF and RTP emissions, single&#8208;molecule white emission has been realized.







Abstract
The exploration of circularly polarized luminescence is important for advancing display and lighting technologies. Herein, by utilizing isomeric molecular engineering, a novel series of chiral molecules are designed to exploit both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) mechanisms for efficient luminescence. The cooperation of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, moderate spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC), and large oscillator strength enables efficient TADF emission, with photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 90&#8201;%. By altering the symmetry of molecular structures, it is demonstrated that the intrinsic electronic SOC and vibrational SOC effects can be greatly enhanced to facilitate RTP emission. Notably, through modulating simultaneous TADF and RTP emissions, single&#8208;molecule white emission is successfully achieved. Accordingly, the TADF&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency up to 30&#8201;%, representing exceptional performance of non&#8208;aromatic amine&#8208;based emitters. Furthermore, the first single&#8208;molecule white OLED based on TADF and RTP dual&#8208;emissive chiral material is developed, establishing a benchmark for the development of advanced display and lighting technologies.

         <title>Exploration of Chemical Space Through Automated Reasoning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we develop an automated reasoning method, COMGEN to determine valid compositions for a given set of domain expert defined constraints. We demonstrate the method in an automated workflow with crystal structure prediction and properties models to locate and predict new potential Li&#8208;ion solid state electrolytes.







Abstract
The vast size of composition space poses a significant challenge for materials chemistry: exhaustive enumeration of potentially interesting compositions is typically infeasible, hindering assessment of important criteria ranging from novelty and stability to cost and performance. We report a tool, Comgen, for the efficient exploration of composition space, which makes use of logical methods from computer science used for proving theorems. We demonstrate how these techniques, which have not previously been applied to materials discovery, can enable reasoning about scientific domain knowledge provided by human experts. Comgen accepts a variety of user&#8208;specified criteria, converts these into an abstract form, and utilises a powerful automated reasoning algorithm to identify compositions that satisfy these user requirements, or prove that the requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied. In contrast to machine learning techniques, explicitly reasoning about domain knowledge, rather than making inferences from data, ensures that Comgen's outputs are fully interpretable and provably correct. Users interact with Comgen through a high&#8208;level Python interface. We illustrate use of the tool with several case studies focused on the search for new ionic conductors. Further, we demonstrate the integration of Comgen into an end&#8208;to&#8208;end automated workflow to propose and evaluate candidate compositions quantitatively, prior to experimental investigation. This highlights the potential of automated formal reasoning in materials chemistry.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Divergent Cyclization of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the solvent&#8208;dependent divergent 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;cyclization of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes were achieved. This protocol straightforwardly led to a diverse range of oxa&#8208;bicyclic heptanes, which may serve as lead bioisosteres in drug discovery, as well as highly functionalized cyclobutanes with exceptional diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic investigation revealed that solvent effects dominate the reaction pathway, as the rate of acid&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of BCBs varies with different solvents. Furthermore, the gram&#8208;scale reactions and various post&#8208;synthetic modifications of the products demonstrated their potential applications in synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) have recently garnered significant research interest as versatile precursors for synthesizing potential [n.1.1] bioisosteres and multi&#8208;functionalized cyclobutanes in a straightforward and atom&#8208;economical manner. Here, we report a solvent&#8208;dependent divergent cyclization of BCBs that provides highly diastereospecific decorated cyclobutanes and oxygen&#8208;containing bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHeps), which serve as bioisosteres of meta&#8208;substituted arenes. Additionally, an unprecedented 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction mode for BCBs was explored, thus expanding the chemical space of arene bioisosteres and highly functionalized cyclobutanes.

         <title>Manipulating p&#8208;&#960; Resonance through Methoxy Group Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks for an Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By strategically modulating the position and quantity of &#8722;OMe units, we can precisely manipulate the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, resulting in enhanced charge carrier kinetics and mitigated mass transfer resistance in COF&#8208;OMe&#8208;3 with para&#8208;dimethoxy substitution. Consequently, these modifications lead to a significant improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction efficiency.







Abstract
Kinetic factors frequently emerge as the primary constraints in photocatalysis, exerting a critical influence on the efficacy of polymeric photocatalysts. The diverse conjugation systems within covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can significantly impact photon absorption, energy level structures, charge separation and migration kinetics. Consequently, these limitations often manifest as unsatisfactory kinetic behavior, which adversely affects the photocatalytic activity of COFs. To address these challenges, we propose a methoxy (&#8722;OMe) molecular engineering strategy designed to enhance charge carrier kinetics and mitigate mass transfer resistance. Through strategic modulation of the position and quantity of &#8722;OMe units, we can effectively manipulate the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation, thereby enhancing charge separation and migration. Moreover, COFs enriched with &#8722;OMe moieties exhibit enhanced mass transfer dynamics due to the hydrophilic nature of methoxy groups, which facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products within the porous structure. This approach is hypothesized to drive an efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing 2D Anion&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Low&#8208;Temperature Water Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing halogen anions as connecting nodes, new 2D reticulate honeycomb anion&#8208;organic frameworks were synthesized through a simple, green in situ protonation and crystallization method using pyridine&#8208;functionalized triphenylamine derivatives. These frameworks feature well&#8208;defined hexagonal channels and exhibit excellent self&#8208;healing properties, high water uptake, and low water release onset temperatures.







Abstract
Molecular frameworks have recently shown a great potential in atmospheric water harvesting, in which the water release at low temperatures is challenging. Anion&#8208;organic frameworks based on anion&#8208;coordination chemistry are presented herein to meet this challenge. These frameworks are prepared as tubular single crystals in pure water from the in situ protonation and crystallization of pyridine&#8208;terminated triphenylamine derivatives with hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid. They possess a 2D honeycombed porous structure and carry halogen anions confined within 1D hexagonal nanochannels with a modular size of 1.7&#8211;2.3&#8197;nm. They exhibit a high water uptake of up to 0.87&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a water release onset temperature as low as &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C. The water uptake and release induce significant changes in the crystal morphology and absorption and emission properties of these framework crystals, providing a visual indication of their hydration states over a wide temperature range. The kinetics of dehydration at subglacial temperatures is successfully determined by emission spectral shifts. These framework crystals show a high water&#8208;stability and can be used for repeated water capture and release thanks to a rapid and robust self&#8208;healing capability.

     alt="Self-Healing 2D Anion-Organic Frameworks for Low-Temperature Water Release"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By utilizing halogen anions as connecting nodes, new 2D reticulate honeycomb anion-organic frameworks were synthesized through a simple, green in situ protonation and crystallization method using pyridine-functionalized triphenylamine derivatives. These frameworks feature well-defined hexagonal channels and exhibit excellent self-healing properties, high water uptake, and low water release onset temperatures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular frameworks have recently shown a great potential in atmospheric water harvesting, in which the water release at low temperatures is challenging. Anion-organic frameworks based on anion-coordination chemistry are presented herein to meet this challenge. These frameworks are prepared as tubular single crystals in pure water from the in situ protonation and crystallization of pyridine-terminated triphenylamine derivatives with hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid. They possess a 2D honeycombed porous structure and carry halogen anions confined within 1D hexagonal nanochannels with a modular size of 1.7&#8211;2.3&#8197;nm. They exhibit a high water uptake of up to 0.87&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a water release onset temperature as low as &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C. The water uptake and release induce significant changes in the crystal morphology and absorption and emission properties of these framework crystals, providing a visual indication of their hydration states over a wide temperature range. The kinetics of dehydration at subglacial temperatures is successfully determined by emission spectral shifts. These framework crystals show a high water-stability and can be used for repeated water capture and release thanks to a rapid and robust self-healing capability. This discovery opens opportunities for the design and synthesis of flexible and self-healing frameworks for porosity-related applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Photocatalytic Overall Nitrogen Fixation via an Enzymatic Pathway on a Distorted CoP4 Configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with a C&#8208;defect&#8208;evoked CoP4 distorted configuration was fabricated. The N2 adsorption pattern on the Co&#8208;SAC switched from an &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode, notably decreasing the N2 adsorption/activation energy barrier. In the absence of sacrificial agents, the Co SAC achieved excellent photocatalytic overall N2 fixation performance via an enzymatic pathway.







Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrogen (N2) fixation over semiconductors has always suffered from poor conversion efficiency owing to weak N2 adsorption and the difficulty of N&#8801;N triple bond dissociation. Herein, a Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) model with a C&#8208;defect&#8208;evoked CoP4 distorted configuration was fabricated using a selective phosphidation strategy, wherein P&#8208;doping and C defects co&#8208;regulate the local electronic structure of Co sites. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the distorted CoP4 configuration caused a strong charge redistribution between the Co atoms and adjacent C atoms, minimizing their electronegativity difference. Consequently, the N2 adsorption pattern switched from an &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode with a high N2 adsorption energy of &#8722;1.40&#8197;eV and an elongated N&#8722;N bond length of 1.20&#8197;&#197;, notably decreasing the N2 adsorption/activation energy barrier. In the absence of sacrificial agents, the Co SAC achieved excellent photocatalytic overall N2 fixation performance via an enzymatic pathway. The NH3 yielding rate peaked at 1249.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 3.51&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm. Moreover, the selective phosphidation strategy has universality for synthesizing other SACs, such as those containing Ni and Fe. This study offers new insight into co&#8208;regulating the electronic structure of SACs for efficient photocatalytic overall N2 fixation.

         <title>Ultrafast Tailoring Amorphous Zn0.25V2O5 with Precision&#8208;Engineered Artificial Atomic&#8208;Layer 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 Cathode Electrolyte Interphase for Advanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 cathode, with an atomic&#8208;layer 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 coating, is ultrafast and efficiently synthesized through a colloidal chemical strategy to achieve superior AZIB performance. The amorphous structure of a&#8208;ZVO and MoS2 artificial interphase synergistically provide more isotropic pathways and active sites for Zn2+, significantly enhancing the Zn2+ diffusion kinetics while effectively suppressing structural degradation and V&#8208;dissolution during charge&#8211;discharge processes.







Abstract
Vanadium (V)&#8208;based oxides as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) still encounter challenges such as sluggish Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and V&#8208;dissolution, thus leading to severe capacity fading and limited life span. Here, we designed an ultrafast and facile colloidal chemical synthesis strategy based on crystalline Zn0.25V2O5 (c&#8208;ZVO) to successfully prepare a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 core@shell heterostructures, where atomic&#8208;layer MoS2 uniformly coats on the surface of amorphous a&#8208;ZVO. The tailored amorphous structure of a&#8208;ZVO provides more isotropic pathways and active sites for Zn2+, thus significantly enhancing the Zn2+ diffusion kinetics during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Meanwhile, as an efficient artificial cathode electrolyte interphase, the precision&#8208;engineered atomic&#8208;layer MoS2 with semi&#8208;metallic 1T&#8242; phase not only contributes to improved electron transport but also effectively inhibits the V&#8208;dissolution of a&#8208;ZVO. Therefore, the prepared a&#8208;ZVO@MoS2 and conceptually validated a&#8208;V2O5@MoS2 derived from commercial c&#8208;V2O5 exhibit excellent cycling stability at an ultralow current density (0.05&#8197;A g&#8722;1) while maintaining good rate capability and capacity retention. This research achievement provides a new effective strategy for various amorphous cathode designs for AZIBs with superior performance.

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of Anhydrotuberosin as a STING Antagonist for Treating Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a high&#8208;throughput screening, natural product anhydrotuberosin (ATS) was identified as a novel STING antagonist. A concise and scalable total synthesis was accomplished in 6&#8197;steps based on an efficient acid&#8208;promoted tandem deprotection/cyclization reaction to build the pentacyclic structure. Enabled by total synthesis, the therapeutic potential of ATS was elucidated, which lays the foundation for developing an STING antagonist as an effective therapy for autoimmune diseases.







Abstract
Excessive activation of the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway has been identified as a significant contributor to various autoimmune diseases, such as STING&#8208;associated vasculopathy with infantile&#8208;onset (SAVI) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, discovering effective STING antagonists for treating STING&#8208;mediated autoimmune disorders remains challenging. Herein, we identified the natural product anhydrotuberosin (ATS) as a potent STING antagonist by a high&#8208;throughput chemical screen and follow&#8208;up biological validations. However, the limited supply from natural product isolation impeded the pharmacological evaluations of ATS. Accordingly, we developed a concise and scalable total synthesis of ATS in 6&#8197;steps. Enabled by total synthesis, we further extensively investigated ATS's mode of action and evaluated its therapeutic potential. Remarkably, ATS inhibits STING signaling in PBMCs derived from three SAVI patients. ATS showed decent pharmacokinetic parameters and strongly alleviated tissue inflammation in DSS&#8208;induced IBD colitis and Trex1&#8208;/&#8208; autoimmune animal models with low toxicity. Collectively, this research lays the foundation for developing novel STING antagonists as an effective therapy for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Internal Electron&#8208;Donation Allocation Design for Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules is enhanced by the introduction of electron donors, which makes it easier to coordinate with Li+. This greatly weakens the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in the ester&#8208;based electrolyte to more than 0.5&#8197;M. The Li|| LiFePO4 batteries with such electrolyte exhibit superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have become a hot topic in the research of next&#8208;generation advanced battery technology due to their high specific energy. However, the high reaction activity between lithium metal and electrolyte is considered one of the key bottlenecks limiting large&#8208;scale applications of LMBs. As a classic electrolyte additive, lithium nitrate (LiNO3) significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, its solubility in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes widely used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is extremely low, causing limited protective capability on lithium metal, which has become a key obstacle to the commercial application of lithium metal batteries. Here, we enhanced the local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules by introducing electron donors, making it easier for them to coordinate with Li+, thereby weakening the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, and significantly increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in ester electrolytes. The modified ester solvent promotes the derivatization and decomposition of salt anions, leading to the formation of a dense SEI layer rich in LiF and LiNxOy. This significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ester&#8208;based electrolytes. The assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows excellent cycling performance of over 4000&#8197;hours.

&lt;p&gt;The local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules is enhanced by the introduction of electron donors, which makes it easier to coordinate with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This greatly weakens the interaction between Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, increasing the solubility of LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the ester-based electrolyte to more than 0.5&#8197;M. The Li|| LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with such electrolyte exhibit superior electrochemical performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have become a hot topic in the research of next-generation advanced battery technology due to their high specific energy. However, the high reaction activity between lithium metal and electrolyte is considered one of the key bottlenecks limiting large-scale applications of LMBs. As a classic electrolyte additive, lithium nitrate (LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ether-based electrolytes. However, its solubility in carbonate-based electrolytes widely used in lithium-ion batteries is extremely low, causing limited protective capability on lithium metal, which has become a key obstacle to the commercial application of lithium metal batteries. Here, we enhanced the local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules by introducing electron donors, making it easier for them to coordinate with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby weakening the interaction between Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and significantly increasing the solubility of LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in ester electrolytes. The modified ester solvent promotes the derivatization and decomposition of salt anions, leading to the formation of a dense SEI layer rich in LiF and LiN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;. This significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ester-based electrolytes. The assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows excellent cycling performance of over 4000&#8197;hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designable Electrochemiluminescence Patterning for Renewable and Enhanced Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designable electrochemiluminescence patterning is achieved by focusing a 730&#8197;nm laser beam on the electrode surface. Through an in situ photothermal effect generated by the laser, which removes oxides formed by anodization, this approach enables enhanced bioimaging, highly sensitive immunoassays, and reversible luminescence&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting and encryption.







Abstract
Electrochemical imaging enables an in&#8208;depth analysis of the interface heterogeneity and reaction kinetics of single entities. However, electrode passivation during electrochemical reactions decreases the active sites and harms the long&#8208;term stability. Here, we introduce a method using laser&#8208;induced photothermal effects to restore the electrochemical activity, which is particularly displayed as enhanced micrometric patterns in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy. By co&#8208;localization characterization and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the mechanism of active site regeneration is validated as the removal of the oxide film for restoring the local surface ECL reactivity under laser irradiation. The surface&#8208;confined and voltage&#8208;dependent features of ECL allows for easy pattern erasure and rewriting, and it shows good reversibility and anti&#8208;counterfeiting potential. This approach overcomes the passivation processes, evidently improves the image quality of single biological entities including Shewanella bacteria and cells, and makes the subtle contour structures more distinct. The renewable electrode interface also enhances the ECL signal of model bead&#8208;based bioassays. This approach not only showcases precise control in fabricating micron patterns but also holds promise for enhancing the sensitivity in electrochemical immunoassays and bioimaging.

         <title>Thermally Assisted Microfluidics to Produce Chemically Equivalent Microgels with Tunable Network Morphologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally assisted microfluidics is utilized to produce thermoresponsive microgels with different network structures and morphologies. Monomers or star&#8208;polymers are used as microgel precursors at different temperatures. Microgels with different network structures and morphologies but of chemical equivalence offer a new platform of microgel building blocks with the ability to undergo phase transition at physiological temperatures.







Abstract
Although micron&#8208;sized microgels have become important building blocks in regenerative materials, offering decisive interactions with living matter, their chemical composition mostly significantly varies when their network morphology is tuned. Since cell behavior is simultaneously affected by the physical, chemical, and structural properties of the gel network, microgels with variable morphology but chemical equivalence are of interest. This work describes a new method to produce thermoresponsive microgels with defined mechanical properties, surface morphologies, and volume phase transition temperatures. A wide variety of microgels is synthesized by crosslinking monomers or star polymers at different temperatures using thermally assisted microfluidics. The diversification of microgels with different network structures and morphologies but of chemical equivalence offers a new platform of microgel building blocks with the ability to undergo phase transition at physiological temperatures. The method holds high potential to create soft and dynamic materials while maintaining the chemical composition for a wide variety of applications in biomedicine.

         <title>Antioxidative Therapy of Alcoholic Liver Injury by Amorphous Two&#8208;Dimensional Cobalt Hydroxide Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanocatalytic antioxidation approach is proposed for alcoholic liver injury therapy by developing amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets with a desirable hepatic passive targeting ability, as well as a high catalytic antioxidative activity, resulting in an efficient and sustainable ROS&#8208;scavenging effect in the liver.







Abstract
The intake of excessive ethanol will activate an alternative ethanol metabolic pathway in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further leads to alcoholic liver injury (ALI). Although several molecular antioxidants have been utilized in clinics for treating ALI, their efficacies are still less satisfactory. In this work, a nanocatalytic antioxidation therapeutic strategy is proposed for ALI treatment by constructing amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets with catalytic antioxidative property. The bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIICoII dinuclear active sites of Co(OH)2 nanosheets are capable of coordinating with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with significantly reduced thermodynamic barrier to form a dihydroxyl adduct bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIII(OH)CoIII(OH) favorable for catalytic H2O2 disproportionation, while amorphous and ultrathin structure further facilitates the reaction, resulting in a high catalytic efficiency (Km=59.31&#8197;mM). Thanks to the inherent hepatic passive targeting ability of nanomaterials, the antioxidative nanosheets can accumulate in liver region efficiently after intravenous administration (35.5&#8201;% ID/g accumulation efficiency), enabling efficient catalytic antioxidation in the liver to mitigate hepatic oxidative stress, protect hepatocytes from apoptosis/ferroptosis. This study provides a new methodology of nanocatalytic antioxidation for treating ALI and other hepatic diseases related to oxidative stress.

         <title>Curvature&#8208;Induced Electron Spin Catalysis with Carbon Spheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid carbon spheres, synthesized by using molecular hexabromocyclopentadiene as a precursor molecule in a radical coupling reaction, exhibit curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis. Inverse Laplace transform of pulse&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance spectra show that the curvature spin of the carbon is an overlapping state of &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;radicals.







Abstract
Here, we report curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis by using solid carbon spheres as catalysts, which were synthesized using positive curvature molecular hexabromocyclopentadiene as a precursor molecule, following a radical coupling mechanism. The curvature spin of carbon is regarded as an overlapping state of &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;radical, which is identified by the inverse Laplace transform of pulse&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance. The growth mechanism of carbon spheres abiding by Kroto's model, is supported by the density functional theory study of thermodynamics and kinetics calculations. The solid carbon spheres present excellent catalytic behaviour of oxidation coupling of amines to form corresponding imines with the conversion of &gt;99&#8201;%, selectivity of 98.7&#8201;%, and yield of 97.7&#8201;%, which is attributed to the predominantly curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis of carbon, supported by the calculation of oxygen adsorption energy. This work proposes a view of curvature&#8208;induced spin catalysis of carbon, which opens up a research direction for curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis.

         <title>Helmholtz Plane Regulation Empowers PF6&#8722; Permselectivity Towards High Coulombic Efficiency Dual Ion Battery of 5.5&#8197;V</title>

         <dc:description>
Hexafluoroglutaric anhydride (HFGA) was developed as a functional electrolyte additive to improve high&#8208;voltage dual ion battery (DIB) performance. HFGA can positively regulate anion solvation behaviors and participate in forming a CF2&#8208;rich CEI layer with excellent PF6&#8722; permselectivity near the graphite electrode surface. Such strengths enable a 5.5&#8197;V DIB with 92&#8201;% capacity retention and &gt;99&#8201;% average Coulombic efficiency within 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage dual ion battery (DIB) is promising for stationary energy storage applications owing to its cost&#8208;effectiveness, which has been a hot topic of research in rechargeable battery fields. However, it still suffers from rapid battery failure caused by the severe solvent co&#8208;intercalation and electrolyte oxidation. To address these bottlenecks, herein a functional electrolyte additive hexafluoroglutaric anhydride (HFGA) is presented based on a Helmholtz plane regulation strategy. It is demonstrated that the HFGA can precisely enter into the Helmholtz plane and positively regulate anion solvation behaviors near the graphite electrode surface owing to its considerable H&#8722;F affinity with ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), thus alleviating EMC&#8208;related co&#8208;intercalation and oxidation decomposition during DIB charging. Meanwhile, HFGA can copolymerize with the presence of PF5 at the Helmholtz plane to participate in forming a CF2&#8208;rich CEI layer with excellent PF6&#8722; permselectivity, conducive to achieving PF6&#8722; de&#8208;solvation and simultaneously suppressing electrolyte oxidation decomposition. By virtue of such beneficial effects, the graphite cathode enables a 5.5&#8197;V DIB with a prominent capacity retention of 92&#8201;% and a high average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99&#8201;% within 2000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C, demonstrating significantly enhanced electrochemical reversibility. The Helmholtz plane regulation strategy marks a milestone in advancing DIB technologies.

         <title>Polyelectrolyte Additive&#8208;Modulated Interfacial Microenvironment Boosting CO2 Electrolysis in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing polystyrene sulfonate into acidic electrolytes induces a local high concentrations of potassium ions at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface through electrostatic attraction, promoting the efficient electrolysis of CO2. Hydrogen&#8211;bonds formed between sulfonic acid groups and hydrated protons reshape the interfacial hydrogen&#8211;bond network, weakening proton transfer kinetics and further inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Acidic CO2 electrolysis offers a promising strategy to achieve high carbon utilization and high energy efficiency. However, challenges still remain in suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improving product selectivity. Although high concentrations of potassium ions (K+) can suppress HER and accelerate CO2 reduction, they still inevitably suffer from salt precipitation problems. In this study, we demonstrate that the sulfonate&#8208;based polyelectrolyte, polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), enables to reconstruct the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to significantly enhance the acidic CO2 electrolysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that PSS induces high local K+ concentrations through the electrostatic interaction between PSS anions and K+. In situ spectroscopy reveals that PSS reshapes the interfacial hydrogen&#8211;bond (H&#8208;bond) network, which is attributed to the H&#8208;bonds between PSS anions and hydrated proton, as well as the steric hindrance of the additive molecules. This greatly weakens proton transfer kinetics and leads to the suppression of undesirable HER. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 93.9&#8201;% for CO can be achieved at 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, simultaneous with a high single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 72.2&#8201;% on commercial Ag catalysts in acid. This study highlights the important role of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface induced by polyelectrolyte additives in promoting electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photodetection by Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Indium&#8208;Halide with Minimal Structural Distortion and Reduced Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photovoltaic challenges of 0D hybrid halides are addressed by tetragonal C24H72N8In2Br14, featuring closely spaced [InBr6]3&#8722; octahedra and [InBr4]&#8722; tetrahedra linked by anion bridging and vacancies, facilitating a reduced direct band gap with enhanced carrier mobility, enabling visible light photodetection with responsivity of ~10&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 under 3&#8197;V at 485&#8197;nm wavelength, and ~81.2&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 with ~7&#215;109 Jones detectivity in self&#8208;powered mode.







Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;inspired zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid halides exhibit impressive light emission properties; however, their potential in photovoltaics is hindered by the absence of interconnection between the inorganic polyhedra, leading to acute radiative recombination and insufficient charge separation. We demonstrate that incorporating closely&#8208;spaced dissimilar polyhedral units with minimal structural distortion leads to a remarkable enhancement in visible&#8208;light photodetection capability. We designed 0D C24H72N8In2Br14 (HIB) with a tetragonal crystal system, replacing the Cs+ of Cs2InBr5.H2O (CIB) with 1,6&#8208;hexanediammonium (HDA) cation. HIB comprises [InBr6]3&#8722; octahedra, and [InBr4]&#8722; tetrahedra units spaced 3.9&#8197;&#197; apart by the HDA linker. The [InBr4]&#8722; unit is additionally linked to HDA via intercalated bromine through hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions, respectively. This structural arrangement lowers the dielectric confinement, thereby enhancing carrier density and mobility, and increasing the diffusion coefficient compared to CIB. With 3.6&#8201;% bromine vacancy within the [InBr4]&#8722; block, mid&#8208;gap states are created, reducing the direct band gap to 2.19&#8197;eV. HIB demonstrates an unprecedently high responsivity of 9975.9&#177;201.6&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 under 3&#8197;V potential bias at 485&#8197;nm wavelength, among low&#8208;dimensional hybrid halides. In the absence of potential bias, the self&#8208;powered photodetection parameters are 81.2&#177;3.0&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 and (6.98&#177;0.21)&#215;109 Jones.

         <title>Thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine: Attractive scaffold for highly selective inhibitors of underexplored protein kinases with variable binding mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weak interaction of thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine with the kinase hinge region allows for design of highly selective inhibitors of underexplored kinases with variable binding modes. The newly identified chemical biology probe MU1920 targets the kinase Haspin with exquisite kinome&#8208;wide selectivity. Our observations suggest that the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine scaffold can be used also for identification of inhibitors of other &#8220;non&#8208;routine&#8221; protein kinases, e.g. CDKLs.







Abstract
Protein kinases are key regulators of numerous biological processes and aberrant kinase activity can cause various diseases, particularly cancer. Herein, we report the identification of new series of highly selective kinase inhibitors based on the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine scaffold. The weak interaction of the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine core with the kinase hinge region allows for profoundly different binding modes all of which maintain high kinome&#8208;wide selectivity, as illustrated by the isomers MU1464 and MU1668. Thus, this core structure provides a template of ATP&#8208;competitive but not ATP&#8208;mimetic inhibitors that are anchored at the kinase back pocket. Mapping the chemical space around the central thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine pharmacophore afforded highly selective inhibitors of the kinase Haspin, exemplified by the compound MU1920 that fulfils criteria for a quality chemical probe and is suitable for use in in vivo applications. However, despite the role of Haspin in mitosis, the inhibition of Haspin alone was not sufficient to elicit cytotoxic effect in cancer cells. The thieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyridine scaffold can be used in a broader context, as a basis of inhibitors targeting other underexplored protein kinases, such as CDKLs.

The newly identified chemical biology probe &lt;b&gt;MU1920&lt;/b&gt; targets the kinase Haspin with exquisite kinome-wide selectivity. Our observations suggest that the thieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine scaffold can be used also for identification of inhibitors of other &#8220;non-routine&#8221; protein kinases, e.g. CDKLs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein kinases are key regulators of numerous biological processes and aberrant kinase activity can cause various diseases, particularly cancer. Herein, we report the identification of new series of highly selective kinase inhibitors based on the thieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine scaffold. The weak interaction of the thieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine core with the kinase hinge region allows for profoundly different binding modes all of which maintain high kinome-wide selectivity, as illustrated by the isomers &lt;b&gt;MU1464&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;MU1668&lt;/b&gt;. Thus, this core structure provides a template of ATP-competitive but not ATP-mimetic inhibitors that are anchored at the kinase back pocket. Mapping the chemical space around the central thieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine pharmacophore afforded highly selective inhibitors of the kinase Haspin, exemplified by the compound &lt;b&gt;MU1920&lt;/b&gt; that fulfils criteria for a quality chemical probe and is suitable for use in in vivo applications. However, despite the role of Haspin in mitosis, the inhibition of Haspin alone was not sufficient to elicit cytotoxic effect in cancer cells. The thieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]pyridine scaffold can be used in a broader context, as a basis of inhibitors targeting other underexplored protein kinases, such as CDKLs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photomodulation of Charge Transfer through Excited&#8208;State Processes: Directing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Binding Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible binding of donor&#8208;acceptor pairs in solid state materials by light&#8208;manipulated charge transfer and electron transfer has been achieved, accompanied by visual color switching and fluorescence on&#8208;off as output signals.







Abstract
Modulating charge transfer (CT) interactions between donor and acceptor molecules may give rise to unique dynamic changes in physicochemical properties, exhibiting great importance in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work, we demonstrate the first instance of reversible photomodulation of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) CT interaction in the solid state. Pyridinium&#8208;based chromophore featuring &#960;&#8208;conjugated D&#8722;A structures can not only function as a good electron acceptor to undergo photoinduced electron transfer (ET) or engage in intermolecular CT interaction, but also exhibit unique dual emission depending on the excitation wavelengths. The rotatable C&#8722;C single bonds within D&#8722;A pairs enhance the tunability of molecular structure. Through the synergy of a photoinduced ET and an excited&#8208;state conformational change, the intermolecular CT interaction can be switched on and off by alternate light irradiation to enable reversibly modulation of the affinity between donor and acceptor molecules, accompanied by visual color switching and fluorescence on&#8208;off as feedback signals.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Scale Hierarchical Organic Photocatalytic Platform for Self&#8208;Suspending Sacrificial Hydrogen Production from Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary system at the molecular scale facilitates efficient charge transfer and enhanced photocatalytic activity. The super&#8208;wetted micro&#8208;nanoscale hierarchical interfaces of the platform enable it to repeatedly capture light and self&#8208;suspend below the water surface, simultaneously improving light utilization efficiency and reducing the adverse effects of salt deposition.







Abstract
The widespread application of photocatalysis for converting solar energy and seawater into hydrogen is generally hindered by limited catalyst activity and the lack of sustainable large&#8208;scale platforms. Here, a multi&#8208;scale hierarchical organic photocatalytic platform was developed, combining a photosensitive molecular heterojunction with a molecular&#8208;scale gradient energy level alignment and micro&#8208;nanoscale hierarchical pore structures. The ternary system facilitates efficient charge transfer and enhances photocatalytic activity compared to conventional donor&#8208;acceptor pairs. Meanwhile, the super&#8208;wetted hierarchical interfaces of the platform endow it with the ability to repeatedly capture light and self&#8208;suspend below the water surface, which simultaneously improves the light utilization efficiency, and reduces the adverse effects of salt deposition. Under a Xe lamp illumination, the hydrogen evolution rate of this organic platform utilizing a sacrificial agent can reach 165.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, exceeding that of mostly inorganic systems as reported. And upon constructing a scalable system, the platform produced 80.6&#8197;ml&#8201;m&#8722;2 of hydrogen from seawater within five hours at noon. More importantly, the outcomes suggest an innovative multi&#8208;scale approach that bridges disciplines, advancing the frontier of sustainable seawater hydrogen production driven by solar energy.

         <title>A Highly Tumor&#8208;Permeating DNA Nanoplatform for Efficient Remodeling of Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA nanostructures have been widely employed as smart drug delivery systems. Now a tailored DNA structure&#8208;based nanoplatform with striking tumor&#8208;penetrating capability has been constructed to precisely load chemo&#8208;immunomodulators and photosensitizers for targeted remodeling of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This structurally and chemically well&#8208;defined DNA nanoplaform enabled pronounced tumor therapy in vivo.







Abstract
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and limited intratumoral permeation have largely constrained the outcome of tumor therapy. Herein, we report a tailored DNA structure&#8208;based nanoplatform with striking tumor&#8208;penetrating capability for targeted remodeling of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in vivo. In our design, chemo&#8208;immunomodulator (gemcitabine) can be precisely grafted on DNA sequences through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive linker. After self&#8208;assembly, the gemcitabine&#8208;grafted DNA structure can site&#8208;specifically organize legumain&#8208;activatable melittin pro&#8208;peptide (promelittin) on each vertex for intratumoral delivery and further function as the template to load photosensitizers (methylene blue) for ROS production. The tailored DNA nanoplatform can achieve targeted accumulation, highly improved intratumoral permeation, and efficient immunogenic cell death of tumor cells by laser irradiation. Finally, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment can be successfully remodeled by reducing multi&#8208;type immunosuppressive cells and enhancing the infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes in the tumor. This rationally developed multifunctional DNA nanoplatform provides a new avenue for the development of tumor therapy.

         <title>Modulating the Leverage Relationship in Nitrogen Fixation Through Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom molecular catalyst with asymmetric O/N coordination forms hydrogen bonds with H2O to regulate proton transfer, simultaneously achieving superior NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency, and modulating the leverage relationship between activity and selectivity in nitrogen reduction reaction.







Abstract
In the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), a leverage relationship exists between NH3&#8208;producing activity and selectivity because of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which means that high activity with strong protons adsorption causes low product selectivity. Herein, we design a novel metal&#8208;organic hydrogen bonding framework (MOHBF) material to modulate this leverage relationship by a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;regulated proton transfer pathway. The MOHBF material was composited with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to form a Ni&#8208;N2O2 molecular catalyst (Ni&#8208;N2O2/rGO). The unique structure of O atoms in Ni&#8208;O&#8208;C and N&#8208;O&#8208;H could form hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules to interfere with protons being directly adsorbed onto Ni active sites, thus regulating the proton transfer mechanism and slowing the HER kinetics, thereby modulating the leverage relationship. Moreover, this catalyst has abundant Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom sites enriched with Ni&#8208;N/O coordination, conducive to the adsorption and activation of N2. The Ni&#8208;N2O2/rGO exhibits simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity of NH3 production with a maximum NH3 yield rate of 209.7&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 45.7&#8201;%, outperforming other reported single&#8208;atom NRR catalysts.

         <title>Manufacturing Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalysts for Selective CO2 Hydrogenation via Refinement of Isolated&#8208;Alloy&#8208;Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new &#8216;islanding effect&#8217; strategy for high metal loading single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) synthesis by refining alloyed nanoparticles is introduced here for CO2 hydrogenation, achieving 100% CO selectivity and over 55 times reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) rate than the alloys with Ru cluster sites. In addition, the SAA catalysts by the &#8216;islanding effect&#8217; strategy exhibited a 3&#8208;4 times higher RWGS rate than the SAA synthesized with the dilution method.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts exhibit huge potential in heterogeneous catalysis. Manufacturing SAAs requires complex and expensive synthesis methods to precisely control the atomic scale dispersion to form diluted alloys with less active sites and easy sintering of host metal, which is still in the early stages of development. Here, we address these limitations with a straightforward strategy from a brand&#8208;new perspective involving the &#8216;islanding effect&#8217; for manufacturing SAAs without dilution: homogeneous RuNi alloys were continuously refined to highly dispersed alloy&#8208;islands (~1&#8197;nm) with completely single&#8208;atom sites where the relative metal loading was as high as 40&#8201;%. Characterized by advanced atomic&#8208;resolution techniques, single Ru atoms were bonded with Ni as SAAs with extraordinary long&#8208;term stability and no sintering of the host metal. The SAAs exhibited 100&#8201;% CO selectivity, over 55 times reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) rate than the alloys with Ru cluster sites, and over 3&#8211;4 times higher than SAAs by the dilution strategy. This study reports a one&#8208;step manufacturing strategy for SAA's using the wetness impregnation method with durable high atomic efficiency and holds promise for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated Cyclic Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte with Quasi&#8208;Conjugate Effect for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (MODOL) solvent is proposed by introducing electron&#8208;donated methoxy group onto 1,3&#8208;dioxolane to generate quasi&#8208;conjugate effect, weakening the coordinated ability of the solvent. Attributed to the anion&#8208;dominant solvation structure and inorganic&#8208;rich interface, the MODOL&#8208;based electrolyte has demonstrated exceptional electrochemical performance and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability in lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Fluorinated ether&#8208;based electrolytes are commonly employed in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) to attenuate the coordination ability of ether solvents with Li+ and induce inorganic&#8208;rich interphase, whereas fluorination inevitably introduces exorbitant production expenses and environmental anxieties. Herein, a non&#8208;fluorinated molecular design strategy has been conceptualized by incorporating methoxy as an electron&#8208;donating group to generate a quasi&#8208;conjugate effect for tuning the affinity of Li+&#8208;solvent, thereby enabling the cyclic ether solvent 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane with weak solvation ability and exceptional Li metal&#8208;compatibility. Accordingly, the optimized electrolyte exhibits anion&#8208;dominant solvation structure for inorganic&#8208;rich interphase and fulfills an impressive Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.6&#8201;%. As&#8208;fabricated Li||LiFePO4 full cells with limited Li (N/P=2.5) showcase a high capacity retention of 83&#8201;% after 150&#8197;cycles, indicating excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the full LMBs demonstrate exceptional tolerance towards a wide temperature range from &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C, displaying a remarkable capacity retention of 90&#8201;% after 110&#8197;cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Such a molecular design strategy offers a promising avenue for electrolyte engineering beyond fluorination in order to cultivate high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Nacre&#8208;Inspired Structure Enables Ultrahigh &#8216;Strong&#8208;Tough&#8217; Design of Phosphorus Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical cracking thickness of alloy&#8208;type anodes is typically suboptimal due to the inverse relationship between mass loading and intrinsic toughness. This issue is addressed by the development of a nacre&#8208;like structure, which contributes fast ionic/electronic migration and ultrahigh &#8216;strength&#8208;toughness&#8217;. Such structure design contributes to the enhancement of mass loading and long&#8208;life cycle stability of alloy&#8208;type anodes with high specific capacity.







Abstract
Red phosphorus anode, attributed to its high specific capacity of 2596&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, is expected to improve the energy density of Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, the P anode currently is unsatisfactory for practical usage due to the large volume expansion beyond 300&#8201;%, which brings out uncontrolled brittle failure. To address this challenge, we here design a nacre&#8208;like phosphorus anode by resilient graphene oxide staggered together. The staggered structure simultaneously offers mechanical strength and interwoven toughness. Finite element modeling reveals that the sodiation stress from P nanoparticles will be transferred into interlayer pillars as the elastic medium to release sodiation stress. The prepared anode achieves an ultrahigh areal capacity of 13&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a mass loading of 5.8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Notably, the volume change of the anode is limited to approximately 8.1&#8201;% at full sodiation, significantly lower than that of the traditional phosphorus electrodes.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks Based on Linear and Trigonal Linkers for High&#8208;Performance H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks based on low&#8208;connectivity linear and trigonal linkers were constructed by the steric hindrance. The efficiency of the photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide was markedly enhanced by regulating of the skeleton from two&#8208;dimensional to three&#8208;dimensional configuration.







Abstract
The design of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) using linear and trigonal linkers remains challenging due to the difficulty in achieving a specific non&#8208;planar spatial arrangement with low&#8208;connectivity building units. Here, we report the novel 3D COFs with linear and trigonal linkers, termed TMB&#8208;COFs, exhibiting srs topology. The steric hindrance provides an additional force to alter the torsion angles of peripheral triangular units, guiding the linear unit to connect with the trigonal unit into 3D srs frameworks, rather than the more commonly observed two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hcb structures. Furthermore, we comprehensively examined the hydrogen peroxide photocatalytic production capacity of the TMB&#8208;COFs in comparison with analogous 2D COFs. The experimental results and DFT calculations demonstrate a significant enhancement in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production efficacy through framework regulation. This work emphasizes the steric configuration using low connectivity building units, offering a fresh perspective on the design and application of 3D COFs.

         <title>Regulating Non&#8208;Equilibrium Solvation Structure in Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

We propose a concept of a non&#8208;equilibrium solvation structure, incorporating chloroalkane diluents into the solvation structure of Li+ ions to evaluate the impact of diluents on Li+ ion transportation and the oxidative stability of electrolyte under external electric field.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) encounters significant challenges due to aggressive electrode chemistry. Recently, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs) have garnered attention for their exceptional stability with both Li anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. However, there remains a limited understanding of how diluents in LCILEs affect the thermodynamic stability of the solvation structure and transportation dynamics of Li+ ions. Herein, we propose a wide&#8208;temperature LCILEs with 1,3&#8208;dichloropropane (DCP13) diluent to construct a non&#8208;equilibrium solvation structure under external electric field, wherein the DCP13 diluent enters the Li+ ion solvation sheath to enhance Li+ ion transport and suppress oxidative side reactions at high&#8208;nickel cathode (LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2, NCM90). Consequently, a Li/NCM90&#8197;cell utilizing this LCILE achieves a high capacity retention of 94&#8201;% after 240 cycles at 4.3&#8201;V, also operates stably at high cut&#8208;off voltages from 4.4&#8201;V to 4.6&#8201;V and over a wide temperature range from &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with this LCILE simultaneously achieves high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and stable cycling, manifesting the practical feasibility. This work redefines the role of diluents in LCILEs, providing inspiration for electrolyte design in developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Molecular Iridium Catalyzed Electrochemical Formic Acid Oxidation: Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined molecular&#8208;like iridium catalyst (Ir&#8722;N4&#8722;C) reveals key insights into the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) mechanism. In situ spectroscopy uncovers a direct dehydrogenation pathway, preventing catalyst poisoning. The study identifies pH and potential&#8208;sensitive steps, explaining observed kinetics. This research advances our understanding of complex oxidation reactions, paving the way for next&#8208;generation catalyst design.







Abstract
Electrochemical formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) is a pivotal model for understanding organic fuel oxidation and advancing sustainable energy technologies. Here, we present mechanistic insights into a novel molecular&#8208;like iridium catalyst (Ir&#8722;N4&#8722;C) for FAOR. Our studies reveal that isolated sites facilitate a preferential dehydrogenation pathway, circumventing catalyst poisoning and exhibiting high inherent activity. In situ spectroscopic analyses elucidate that weakly adsorbed intermediates mediate the FAOR and are dynamically regulated by potential&#8208;dependent redox transitions. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate a parallel mechanism involving two key intermediates with distinct pH and potential sensitivities. The rate&#8208;determining step is identified as the adsorption of formate via coupled or sequential proton&#8208;electron transfer, which aligns well with the observed kinetic properties, pH dependence, and hydrogen/deuterium isotope effects in experiments. These findings provide valuable insights into the reaction mechanism of FAOR, advancing our understanding at the molecular level and potentially guiding the design of efficient catalysts for fuel cells and electrolyzers.

         <title>Cleavage of Homonuclear Chalcogen&#8208;Chalcogen Bonds in a Hybrid Platform in Response to X&#8208;Ray Radiation Potentiates Tumor Radiochemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;directed generation of chalcogens (S, Se, Te) in response to external ionizing radiation to enable drug decaging in target lesions remains a huge challenge. Hybrid monodisperse organosilicon nanoprodrugs containing homonuclear chalcogen&#8211;chalcogen single bonds have now been developed as a versatile X&#8208;ray&#8208;ultraresponsive nanoplatform for tumor radiochemotherapy.







Abstract
Chalcogens are used as sensitive redox&#8208;responsive reagents in tumor therapy. However, chalcogen bonds triggered by external ionizing radiation, rather than by internal environmental stimuli, enable site&#8208;directed and real&#8208;time drug degradation in target lesions. This approach helps to bypass chemoresistance and global systemic toxicity, presenting a significant advancement over traditional chemoradiotherapy. In this study, we fabricated a hybrid monodisperse organosilica nanoprodrug based on homonuclear single bonds (disulfide bonds (S&#8722;S, approximately 240&#8197;kJ/mol), diselenium bonds (Se&#8722;Se, approximately 172&#8197;kJ/mol), and tellurium bonds (Te&#8722;Te, 126&#8197;kJ/mol)), including ditelluride&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs (DTeMSNs), diselenide&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs (DSeMSNs) and disulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs (DSMSNs). The results demonstrated that differences in electronegativities and atomic radii influenced their oxidation sensitivities and reactivities. Tellurium, with the lowest electronegativity, showed the highest sensitivity, followed by selenium and sulfur. DTeMSNs exhibited highly responsive cleavage upon exposure to X&#8208;rays, resulting in oxidation to TeO32&#8722;. Furthermore, chalcogen&#8208;hybridized organosilica was loaded with manganese ions (Mn2+) to enhance the release of Mn2+ during radiotherapy, thereby activating the the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and enhancing the tumor immune response to inhibit tumor growth. This investigation of hybrid organosilica deepens our understanding of chalcogens response characteristics to radiotherapy and enriches the design principles for nanomedicine based on prodrugs.

         <title>Modulating the Inner Helmholtz Plane towards Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions for High&#8208;Performance Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, achieved by engineering the current collectors with electron&#8208;deficient aromatic layers that possess high permanent quadrupole moment, can fundamentally regulate the inner Helmholtz plane structure and lithium (Li)&#8208;ion solvation chemistry to construct stable anion&#8208;derived inorganic solid electrolyte interphase layer, thus achieving unprecedented Li plating/stripping performance and long lifespan for anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries with thick cathodes.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries (AFLBs) featured high energy density are viewed as the viable future energy storage technology. However, the irregular Li deposition and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode current collectors reduce their cycling performance. Here, we propose a concept of anion&#8208;recognition electrodes enabled by anion&#8208;&#960; interactions to regulate the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and electrolyte solvation chemistry for high&#8208;performance AFLBs. By engineering the electrodes with electron&#8208;deficient aromatic&#8208;&#960; systems that possess high permanent quadrupole moment (Qzz), the anion&#8208;&#960; interactions can be generated to concentrate the anions on the electrode surface and tune the IHP structure to construct a stable anion&#8208;derived SEI layer, thus achieving highly reversible Li plating/stripping process. Through designing various current collectors with different Qzz values, the intimate correlations among the surface charge of the electrode, competitive adsorption of the IHP, and SEI structures are demonstrated. Particularly, the modified carbon cloth current collector with a high Qzz value (+35.1) delivers a high average Li stripping/plating Coulombic efficiency of 99.1&#8201;% over 230 cycles in the carbonated electrolyte, enabling a long lifespan and high capacity retention of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#8208;based AFLBs with a commercial&#8208;level areal capacity (4.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

This study examines the synthesis of tetra&#8208; and octa&#8208;O&#8208;fused porphyrinoids via an oxidative O&#8208;annulation approach through C&#8722;H activation. By synthesizing on Au(111) surfaces under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions, challenges like overoxidation and instability were addressed. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy show the formation of pyran moieties through C&#8722;O bond formation and self&#8208;assembly via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions, which reduce the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap through HOMO rising as more O&#8208;atoms are added.







Abstract
This study investigates the synthesis of tetra&#8208; and octa&#8208;O&#8208;fused porphyrinoids employing an oxidative O&#8208;annulation approach through C&#8722;H activation. Despite encountering challenges such as overoxidation and instability in conventional solution protocols, successful synthesis was achieved on Au(111) surfaces under ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy elucidated the preferential formation of pyran moieties via C&#8722;O bond formation and subsequent self&#8208;assembly driven by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. Furthermore, the O&#8208;annulation process was found to reduce the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap by lifting the HOMO energy level, with the effect rising upon increasing the number of embedded O&#8208;atoms.

         <title>A Modular Approach for Accessing 3D Heterocycles via 1,2&#8208;Dicyanation of Planar N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dearomative functionalization approach of abundant N&#8208;heteroarenes has been developed to harvest valued 3D N&#8208;heterocyclic skeletons. This robust method is enabled by the in situ generation of highly reactive non&#8208;symmetric iodane from bench&#8208;stable hypervalent iodane, PhI(OAc)2, and BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 A wide range of N&#8208;heteroarenes were transformed into their corresponding 3D analog via the installation of a highly versatile cyano group as a new vector.







Abstract
The rapid construction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) heterocyclic frameworks is a key challenge in contemporary medicinal chemistry. The molecules with three&#8208;dimensional complexity hold a greater probability to improve clinical outcomes, solubility, selectivity for target proteins, and metabolic stability. However, the prevalence of flat molecules persists among new drug candidates, primarily owing to the multitude of chemical methods available for their synthesis. In principle, the dearomative functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarene allows for the conversion of readily available planar molecules into partially or fully saturated nitrogen heterocycles, which are most significant structural motifs of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Unfortunately, these reactions are very rare because of the inherent challenge imposed by heteroarenes&#8217; poor reactivity, rendering the process thermodynamically unfavorable. Herein, we report a modular approach for accessing 3D chemical space in translating planar heteroarenes into valuable 3D heterocycles via the installation of a highly versatile cyano group as a new vector. This approach is enabled by the in situ generation of reactive, non&#8208;symmetric iodane by combining cyanide anion and bench&#8208;stable PhI(OAc)2. This reaction represents a rare example of 1,2&#8208;dicyanation of N&#8208;heteroarenes that meets the numerous requirements for broad implementation in drug and agrochemical discovery. The transformation is highly selective and amenable to a wide range of N&#8208;heteroarenes and late&#8208;stage partial saturation of drugs and agrochemicals.

         <title>Rational Design of 7&#8208;Azaindole&#8208;Based Robust Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Gas Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A preorganized tetrapodal building block, incorporating &#945;&#8208;carboline units, self&#8208;assembles to form a 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF). The expanded hydrogen bonding between the heteroaromatic substructures, along with intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, spontaneously build up an interpenetrated architecture that bestows an extraordinary robustness to the microporous crystalline material, showing a good selectivity for CO2 adsorption.







Abstract
7&#8208;Azaindole has been integrated as building block with complementary N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonding sites for the synthesis of a tetrahedral molecular tecton, namely tetra(&#945;&#8208;carbolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl)methane, TACM. The self&#8208;assembly of this molecule results in a 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF). This supramolecular structure constitutes a crystalline microporous material with an extraordinary thermal and chemical robustness. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals how the five&#8208;fold catenation of diamonoid systems, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, form an interpenetrated network with monodimensional channels. The structural features of the crystalline material are also observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, the microporosity of the activated TACM&#8208;HOF is characterized by gas sorption (N2, CO2, CH4 and H2) experiments performed at different pressures. A selective adsorption is observed for CO2 uptake and TACM&#8208;HOF also presents a good adsorption capacity for H2 among supramolecular organic frameworks.

         <title>Revitalizing Dead Zinc with Ferrocene/Ferrocenium Redox Chemistry for Deep&#8208;Cycle Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dissolve oxygen&#8208;initiated revitalization strategy is proposed to reactivate dead Zn via ferrocene redox chemistry, which differs from the widely concerned dendrite suppression strategies. Ferrocene scaffold can be spontaneously oxidized to ferricenium cations by dissolved oxygen and the generated ferricenium cations can rejuvenate electrically isolated dead Zn into electroactive Zn2+ ions to compensate the zinc loss.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries are highly desirable for sustainable and large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage technologies. However, the ceaseless dendrite growth and the derived dead Zn are principally responsible for the capacity decay and insufficient lifespan. Here, we propose a dissolved oxygen&#8208;initiated revitalization strategy to reactivate dead Zn via ferrocene redox chemistry, which can be realized by incorporating a trace amount of poly(ethylene glycol) as a solubilizer to improve the solubility of water&#8208;insoluble ferrocene derivatives. Ferrocene scaffold can be spontaneously oxidized to ferricenium cations by dissolved oxygen, which eradicates the dissolved oxygen&#8208;involved Zn corrosion and insulating by&#8208;product generation. Subsequently, the generated ferricenium cations as the scavenger can rejuvenate electrically isolated dead Zn into electroactive Zn2+ ions to compensate the zinc loss. Through this design, the symmetric cell exhibited improved cycle life of 3700&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and 220&#8197;h under a high depth of discharge of 80&#8201;%. Importantly, the Zn||NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O full cells demonstrated the impressive cycling stability over 1500&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 3.0. This work presents an innovative solution for the revitalization of dead Zn to extend the lifespan of deep&#8208;cycling metal batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical and genomic studies of the arenicolide family macrolides discovered eight new congeners, assigned the previously undetermined absolute configuration, and identified their type&#8197;I polyketide biosynthetic pathway. Biological evaluation revealed that arenicolide A inhibits drug&#8208;resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as an effective bactericidal agent by depleting ATP and disrupting Mtb cell wall, thus providing a new therapeutic lead.







Abstract
The emergence of multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) and extensively drug&#8208;resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) poses a significant threat to health globally. During searching for new chemical entities regulating MDR&#8208; and XDR&#8208;Mtb, chemical investigation of the black oil beetle gut bacterium Micromonospora sp. GR10 led to the discovery of eight new members of arenicolides along with the identification of arenicolide A (Ar&#8722;A, 1), which was a previously reported macrolide with incomplete configuration. Genomic analysis of the bacterial strain GR10 revealed their putative biosynthetic pathway. Quantum mechanics&#8208;based computation, chemical derivatizations, and bioinformatic analysis established the absolute stereochemistry of Ar&#8722;A and arenicolides D&#8722;K (Ar&#8722;D&#8722;K, 2&#8211;9) completely for the first time. Biological studies of 1&#8211;9 revealed their antimicrobial activity against MDR and XDR strains of Mtb. Ar&#8722;A had the most potent in vitro antimicrobial efficacy against MDR&#8208; and XDR&#8208;Mtb. Mechanistically, Ar&#8722;A induced ATP depletion and destabilized Mtb cell wall, thereby inhibiting growth. Notably, Ar&#8722;A exerted a significant antimicrobial effect against Mtb in macrophages, was effective in the treatment of Mtb infections, and showed a synergistic effect with amikacin (AMK) in a mouse model of MDR&#8208;Mtb lung infection. Collectively, our findings indicate Ar&#8722;A to be a promising drug lead for drug&#8208;resistant tuberculosis.

         <title>Highly Selective Synthesis of Acetic Acid from Hydroxyl&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of Methane at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a hydroxyl&#8208;mediated route for methane oxidation to acetic acid with high selectivity using O2 and CO over Au&#8722;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5. A high acetic acid selectivity of 92&#8201;% was achieved at the yield of 5.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 3.0&#8197;h. Au nanoparticles catalyzed hydroxyl species formation from CO, O2, and H2O, while atomically dispersed Fe species promoted the C&#8722;C coupling of CH4 and CO to produce acetic acid.







Abstract
Direct methane conversion and, in particular, the aerobic oxidation to acetic acid, remain an eminent challenge. Here, we reported a zeolite&#8208;supported Au&#8722;Fe catalyst (Au&#8722;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5) that converted methane to acetic acid with molecular oxygen as an oxidant in the presence of CO. Specifically, Au nanoparticles catalyzed the formation of hydroxyl species from the reaction of CO, O2, and H2O, meanwhile ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;supported atomically dispersed Fe species were responsible for the hydroxyl&#8208;mediated coupling of CH4 and CO to generate acetic acid. The reaction over 50&#8197;mg of Au&#8722;Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 under 62&#8197;bar (CH4&#8201;:&#8201;CO&#8201;:&#8201;O2=14&#8201;:&#8201;14&#8201;:&#8201;3) at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 3.0&#8197;h yielded 5.7 millimoles of acetic acid per gram of the catalyst (mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1) with the selectivity of 92&#8201;%, outperformed most of reported catalysts. Significantly, the catalyst remained active even at 60&#8201;&#176;C. We anticipate that this hydroxyl&#8208;mediated route may guide the design of optimized catalysts for the direct methane functionalization at low temperatures.

         <title>A Rationally Designed Azobenzene Photoswitch for DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Regulation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We highlight the use of a molecular photoswitch capable of quantitative isomerization triggered by visible light. This approach enables the photoregulation of G&#8208;quadruplex structures (G4s) within live cells. The interaction mode of the photoswitch with the G4 template&#8212;from external binding to intercalation&#8212;can be dynamically adjusted through light exposure, facilitating the controlled regulation of the G4 state.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures are increasingly acknowledged as promising targets in cancer research, and the development of G4&#8208;specific stabilizing compounds may lay a fundamental foundation in precision medicine for cancer treatment. Here, we propose a light&#8208;responsive G4&#8208;binder for precise modulation of drug activation, providing dynamic and spatiotemporal control over G4&#8208;associated biological processes contributing to cancer cell death. We developed a specialized fluorinated azobenzene (AB) switch equipped with a quinoline unit and a positively charged carboxamide side chain, Q&#8208;Azo4F&#8208;C, designed for targeted binding to G4 structures within cells. Biophysical studies, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, provide insights into the unique coordination modes of the photoswitchable ligand in its trans and cis configurations when interacting with G4s. The observed variations in complexation processes between the two isomeric states in different cancer cell lines manifest in more than 25&#8208;fold reversible cytotoxic activity. Immunostaining conducted with the structure&#8208;specific G4 antibody (BG4), establishes a direct correlation between cytotoxicity and the varying extent of G4 induction regulated by the two isoforms. Finally, we demonstrate the photo&#8208;driven reversible regulation of G4 structures in lung cancer cells by Q&#8208;Azo4F&#8208;C. Our findings highlight the potential of light&#8208;responsive G4&#8208;binders in advancing precision cancer therapy through dynamic control of G4&#8208;mediated pathways.

         <title>Switching CO2 Electroreduction Pathways between Ethylene and Ethanol via Tuning Microenvironment of the Coating on Copper Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superhydrophobic surface facilitates CO2 diffusion and weakens the hydrogen bonding interactions between interfacial H2O, ensuring a high ratio of CO2 to H2O. This directs the reaction pathway from ethylene towards ethanol in CO2RR.







Abstract
Engineering the microenvironment of electrode surface is one of the effective means to tune the reaction pathways in CO2RR. In this work, we prepared copper nanofibers with conductive polypyrrole coating by polymerization of pyrrole using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as template. As a result, the obtained copper nanofibers Cu/Cu2+1O/SHNC, exhibited a superhydrophobic surface, which demonstrated very high selectivity for ethanol with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 66.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in flow cell. However, the catalyst Cu/Cu2+1O/NC, which was prepared under the same conditions but without PVP, possessed a hydrophobic surface and exhibited high selectivity towards ethylene at the given potentials. The mechanism for switch of reaction pathways from ethylene to ethanol in CO2RR was studied. Incorporating pyrrolidone groups into the polymer coating results in the formation of a superhydrophobic surface. This surface weakens the hydrogen bonding interaction between interfacial water molecules and facilitates the transfer of CO2, thereby enhancing the local CO2/H2O ratio. The high coverage of *CO promotes the coupling of *CO and *CHO to form C2 intermediates, and reduces the reaction energy for the formation of *CHCHOH (ethanol path) at the interface. This ensures that the reaction pathway is directed towards ethanol.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Induces Halogen/Hydrogen Atom Transfer (XAT/HAT) for Allylic C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective allylic C&#8722;H amination has been established via lead halide perovskite nanocrystals as the photocatalyst. The CsPbBr3 catalyst exhibits remarkable halogen vacancies that exploit halogenated solvents as mild oxidants for C&#8722;H amination. A cooperative halogen/hydrogen atom transfer reaction mechanism has been interrogated and concludes the observed high selectivity and broad scope of such allylic C&#8722;H functionalization products, ranging from natural products to drug derivatives.







Abstract
Allylic C&#8722;H amination has emerged as a powerful tool to construct allylamines, common motifs in molecular therapeutics. Such reaction implies an oxidative path for C&#8722;H activation but furnishes reductive amines, inferring mild oxidants&#8217; inactivity for C&#8722;H oxidation but strong oxidants&#8217; detriment to products. Herein we report a heterogeneous catalytic approach that manipulates halogen&#8208;vacancies of perovskite photocatalyst and exploits halogenated&#8208;solvents (i.e. CH2Cl2, CH2Br2) as mild oxidants for selective C&#8722;H allyl amination with 19,376&#8197;turnovers. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals induce cooperative hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT, C&#8722;H oxidation, and halogen&#8208;vacancy CsPbBr3&#8722;x formation) and halogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (XAT, CsPbBr3&#8722;x&#8208;induced solvent reduction) under a radical chain mechanism. Terminal/internal olefins are amenable to forge aromatic/aliphatic, cyclic/acyclic, secondary/tertiary allylamines (70&#8197;examples), including drugs or their derivatives.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Gas Three&#8208;Phase Indirect Electrolysis Enabled by Affinity Auxiliary Imparted Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas three&#8208;phase indirect electrolysis system has been developed based on a covalent organic framework (Dha&#8722;COF&#8722;Cu) as heterogeneous redox mediator for S&#8722;S coupling reaction.







Abstract
The design of efficient heterogeneous redox mediators with favorable affinity to substrate and electrolyte are much desired yet still challenging for the development of indirect electrolysis system. Herein, for the first time, we have developed a solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas three&#8208;phase indirect electrolysis system based on a covalent organic framework (Dha&#8722;COF&#8722;Cu) as heterogeneous redox mediator for S&#8722;S coupling reaction. Dha&#8722;COF&#8722;Cu with the integration of high porosity, nanorod morphology, abundant hydroxyl groups and active Cu sites is much beneficial for the adsorption/activation of thiols, uniform dispersion and high wettability in electrolyte, and efficient interfacial electron transfer. Notably, Dha&#8722;COF&#8722;Cu as solid&#8208;phase redox mediator exhibits excellent electrocatalytic efficiency for the formation of value&#8208;added liquid&#8208;phase S&#8722;S bond product (yields up to 99&#8201;%) coupling with the generation of gas&#8208;phase product of H2 (~1.40&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), resulting in a powerful three&#8208;phase indirect electrolysis system. This is the first work about COFs that can be applied in three&#8208;phase indirect electrolysis system, which might promote the development of porous crystalline materials in this field.

         <title>Coordination Induced Spin State Transition Switches the Reactivity of Nickel (II) Porphyrin in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores the impact of coordination&#8208;induced spin&#8208;state switching on hydrogen evolution reaction activity of nickel(II) porphyrin, revealing that low&#8208;spin Ni(II) porphyrin favors hydrogen evolution while high&#8208;spin counterpart facilitates &#946;&#8208;hydrogenation of porphyrin periphery. Our finding highlights the pivotal role of spin transition in regulating the reactivity and selectivity of metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
Electron spin plays a critical role in chemical processes, particularly in reactions involving metal complexes with unpaired electrons. However, more definitive state&#8208;to&#8208;state experiments are needed to better elucidate the role of electronic spin. Herein, we chose nickel (II) 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin 1 as a catalyst, which allows switching from a low spin to a high spin state of Ni (II) center through an axial pyridine coordination, for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). When pyridine is present, we observed &#946;&#8208;hydrogenation of porphyrin through electron transfer followed by proton transfer. In contrast, hydrogen evolution mainly occurs via the concerted proton&#8208;coupling electron transfer without pyridine coordination. Similar distinct spin&#8208;dependent selectivity was also observed in chemical reduction of 1 by CoCp2 with subsequent addition of pyridinium p&#8208;toluenesulfonate. Computational calculations using density functional theory demonstrated that the transition from low spin to high spin state enriches the ligand's electron density after one&#8208;electron reduction, leading to preferential protonation of &#946;&#8208;periphery rather than meso&#8208;position or metal center.

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Polymer Membrane with High Stability and Enhanced Ion&#8208;Sieving Effect for Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through in situ polymerization based on nucleophilic substitution, the self&#8208;standing covalent organic polymer membrane (TAPT&#8208;CC) was successfully prepared. This membrane exhibits a persistent ultramicropores structure and exceptional chemical stability, facilitating efficient ion sieving and rapid proton transport.

Abstract
Fabrication of ion&#8208;conducting membranes with continuous sub&#8208;nanometer channels holds fundamental importance for flow batteries in achieving safe integration of renewable energy into grids. Self&#8208;standing covalent organic polymer (COP) membranes provide feasibility due to their rapid and selective ion transport. However, the development of a scale&#8208;up possible, mechanically robust and chemically stable membranes remains a significant challenge. Herein, using irreversible strong secondary amine linkage, we propose a self&#8208;standing COP membrane with sub&#8208;nanometer pores ranging from 4.5 to 6.4&#8197;&#197;, by a simple and efficient in situ polymerization approach. This membrane exhibits enhanced selectivity for proton and vanadium ions, especially excellent electrochemical stability, delivering an energy efficiency of over 80&#8201;% at the current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 1000&#8197;cycles for an all&#8208;vanadium redox flow battery (VFB). This study provides novel insights for COP&#8208;based ion&#8208;sieving membranes in sustainable energy fields.

         <title>A Multiresponsive Ferrocene&#8208;Based Chiral Overcrowded Alkene Twisting Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dimer (FcD) based on an enantiopure planar chiral ferrocene&#8208;indanone. FcD exhibits thermal/photochemical E/Z isomerization and is redox&#8208;switchable, which significantly alters its chiral expression and optical properties. As a chiral dopant in cholesteric liquid crystals, FcD enables redox&#8208;tuning of the liquid crystal reflection color by up to 84&#8197;nm, showcasing its potential in functional materials.







Abstract
The reversible modulation of chirality has gained significant attention not only for fundamental stereochemical studies but also for numerous applications ranging from liquid crystals (LCs) to molecular motors and machines. This requires the construction of switchable molecules with (multiple) chiral elements in a highly enantioselective manner, which is often a significant synthetic challenge. Here, we show that the dimerization of an easily accessible enantiopure planar chiral ferrocene&#8208;indanone building block affords a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dimer (FcD) with pre&#8208;determined double bond geometry, helical chirality, and relative orientation of the two ferrocene motifs in high yield. This intrinsically planar chiral switch can not only undergo thermal or photochemical E/Z isomerization but can also be reversibly and quantitatively oxidized to both a monocationic and a dicationic state which is associated with significant changes in its (chir)optical properties. Specifically, FcD acts as a chiral dopant for cholesteric LCs with a helical twisting power (HTP) of 13&#8197;&#956;m&#8722;1 which, upon oxidation, drops to near zero, resulting in an unprecedently large redox&#8208;tuning of the LC reflection color by up to 84&#8197;nm. Due to the straightforward stereoselective synthesis, FcD, and related chiral switches, are envisioned to be powerful building blocks for multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular machines and in LC&#8208;based materials.

&lt;p&gt;We present a multi-stimuli-responsive dimer (FcD) based on an enantiopure planar chiral ferrocene-indanone. FcD exhibits thermal/photochemical E/Z isomerization and is redox-switchable, which significantly alters its chiral expression and optical properties. As a chiral dopant in cholesteric liquid crystals, FcD enables redox-tuning of the liquid crystal reflection color by up to 84&#8197;nm, showcasing its potential in functional materials.

         <title>Thermoelectric Performance in Triplet&#8208;Ground&#8208;State Polymer Intrinsically Boosted by Enhanced Proquinoidal Characteristic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the simultaneous incorporation of strong proquinoidal donor and acceptor units, copolymer PBBT&#8208;TT exhibits a highly stable triplet ground state, an ultra&#8208;narrow band gap, and strong spin interactions between the polymer chain terminals. These unique properties enable PBBT&#8208;TT to achieve a high power factor of up to 26.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 with extraordinary ambient stability, which is currently the best performed doping&#8208;free organic thermoelectric material.







Abstract
Over the past decade, polymer thermoelectric materials featuring flexibility, lightness, and bio&#8208;friendliness have been paid increasing attention as promising candidates for waste heat recovery and energy generation. For a long time, the dominant approach to optimizing the thermoelectric performance of most organic materials is chemical doping, which, however, is not always ideal for practical applications due to its tendency to involve intricate processing procedure and trigger material and device instability. Currently, the pursuit of single&#8208;component neutral thermoelectric materials without exogenous doping presents a compelling alternative. In this work, we designed and synthesized a high&#8208;spin polymer material, PBBT&#8208;TT, by simultaneously employing thieno[3,4&#8208;b]thiophene (TbT) and benzo[1,2&#8208;c&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBT) units with pronounced proquinoidal characteristics, its analogue, PBBT&#8208;T to demonstrate the effect of the TbT unit was also synthesized. The results indicate that because of the enhanced quinoidal resonance, increased spin density and strong intermolecular antiferromagnetic coupling, PBBT&#8208;TT exhibits high intrinsic electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, which showcases an outstanding power factor of 26.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 without doping. This achievement surpasses other neutral organic conjugated polymer and radical conductors, and is even comparable to some typical early&#8208;stage doped polymers. Notably, PBBT&#8208;TT exhibits remarkable ambient stability, retaining its initial thermoelectric performance over a 120&#8208;day period. Our finding demonstrates that modulating the intermolecular spin interactions in open&#8208;shell polymers through the introduction of strong proquinoidal units is an effective strategy for the development of doping&#8208;free, intrinsically high&#8208;performance polymer thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Li2ZnCu3 Modified Cu Current Collector to Regulate Li Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the good lithiophilicity, low work function, Li+ ion concentration regulation, and strong anion interaction, of Li2ZnCu3 alloy, the surface modified&#8208;Cu can endow homogeneous initial Li deposition, thereby achieving a low&#8208;porosity and smooth Li deposition even at an ultrahigh Li loading of 12&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as the high energy density of the 407.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 when coupled with a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity cathode.







Abstract
Rationally designing a current collector that can maintain low lithium (Li) porosity and smooth morphology while enduring high&#8208;loading Li deposition is crucial for realizing the high energy density of Li metal batteries, but it is still challengeable. Herein, a Li2ZnCu3 alloy&#8208;modified Cu foil is reported as a stable current collector to fulfill the stable high&#8208;loading Li deposition. Benefiting from the in situ alloying, the generated numerous Li2ZnCu3@Cu heterojunctions induce a homogeneous Li nucleation and dense growth even at an ultrahigh capacity of 12&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Such a spatial structure endows the overall Li2ZnCu3@Cu electrode with the manipulated steric hindrance and outmost surface electric potential to suppress the side reactions during Li stripping and plating. The resultant Li||Li2ZnCu3@Cu asymmetric cell preserves an ultrahigh average Coulombic efficiency of 99.2&#8201;% at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 200 cycles. Moreover, the Li&#8208;Li2ZnCu3@Cu||LiFePO4 cell maintains a cycling stability of 87.5&#8201;% after 300 cycles. After coupling with the LiCoO2 cathode (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), the cell exhibits a high energy density of 407.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with remarkable cycling reversibility at an N/P ratio of 3. All these findings present a doable way to realize the high&#8208;capacity, dendrite&#8208;free, and dense Li deposition for high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

         <title>Synthesis of Multifunctional Organic Molecules via Michael Addition Reaction to Manage Perovskite Crystallization and Defect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and synthesize a multifunctional organic small molecule additive in a targeted manner, successfully controlling the crystallization and defects in perovskite films, effectively releasing the residual strain in the perovskite film and reducing the hysteresis phenomenon. The power conversion efficiency of the PSCs exceeds 25.7&#8201;% based on this strategy.







Abstract
Additive engineering plays a pivotal role in achieving high&#8208;quality light&#8208;absorbing layers for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Various functional groups within the additives exert distinct regulatory effects on the perovskite layer. However, few additive molecules can synergistically fulfill the dual functions of regulating crystallization and passivating defects. Here, we custom&#8208;synthesized 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4&#8208;pyrimidone (UPy) organic small molecules with diverse functional groups as additives to modulate crystallization and defects in perovskite films via the Michael addition reaction. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that the &#8722;OH groups in UPy exhibit significant effects in fixing uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, passivation of lead&#8208;iodide antisite defects, alleviating hysteresis, and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination. Furthermore, the enhanced C=O and &#8722;NH2 motifs interact with the A&#8208;site cation via hydrogen bonding, which relieves residual strain and adjusts crystal orientation. This strategy effectively controls perovskite crystallization and passivates defects, ultimately enhancing the quality of perovskite films. Consequently, the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the UPy&#8208;based p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs reaches 1.20&#8197;V, and the fill factor surpasses 84&#8201;%. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency of 25.75&#8201;%. Remarkably, the unencapsulated device maintained 96.9&#8201;% and 94.5&#8201;% of its initial efficiency following 3,360&#8197;hours of dark storage and 1,866&#8197;hours of 1&#8208;sun illumination, respectively.

         <title>Heterogeneous Nucleation Regulation Amends Unfavorable Crystallization Orientation and Defect Features of Antimony Selenosulfide Film for High&#8208;Efficient Planar Solar Cells</title>

In this study, we utilize BaBr2 to innovatively regulate the heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of Sb2(S,Se)3 film synthesized via hydrothermal deposition approach. This strategy optimizes the crystalline orientation and defect features, suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. Thus, the champion device presents a PCE of 10.12&#8201;%.







Abstract
Antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) has obtained widespread concern for photovoltaic applications as a light absorber due to superior photoelectric features. Accordingly, various deposition technologies have been developed in recent years, especially hydrothermal deposition method, which has achieved a great success. However, device performances are limited with severe carrier recombination, relating to the quality of absorber and interfaces. Herein, bulk and interface defects are simultaneously suppressed by regulating heterogeneous nucleation kinetics with barium dibromide (BaBr2) introduction. In details, the Br adsorbs and dopes on the polar planes of cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, promoting the exposure of nonpolar planes of CdS, which facilitates the favorable growth of [hk1]&#8208;Sb2(S,Se)3 films possessing superior crystallinity and small interface defects. Additionally, the Se/S ratio is increased due to the replacement of Se by Br, causing a downshift of the Fermi levels with a benign band alignment and a shallow&#8208;level defect. Moreover, Ba2+ is located at grain boundaries by coordination with S and Se ions, passivating grain boundary defects. Consequently, the efficiency is increased from 7.70&#8201;% to 10.12&#8201;%. This work opens an avenue towards regulating the heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of Sb2(S,Se)3 film deposited via hydrothermal deposition approach to optimize its crystalline orientation and defect features.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Insertion Strategy for Constructing 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Large Pore Size for Electrochemical Analytics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous 2D conjugated MOF was synthesized through a novel ligand insertion strategy. By inserting a linear ligand, 2,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzoquinone, into the metal node of Cu3(HHTP)2 (HHTP=hexahydrotriphenylene), the pore size of the MOF was expanded from 1.8 to 3.2&#8197;nm. The increased pore size in this MOF facilitates the diffusion of redox species, thereby improving the sensitivity for electrochemical detection of various analytes.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have shown great promise in various electrochemical applications due to their intrinsic electrical conductivity. A large pore aperture is a favorable feature of this type of material because it facilitates the mass transport of chemical species and electrolytes. In this work, we propose a ligand insertion strategy in which a linear ligand is inserted into the linkage between multitopic ligands, extending the metal ion into a linear unit of &#8208;M&#8208;ligand&#8208;M&#8208;, for the construction of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with large pore apertures, utilizing only small ligands. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept trial of this strategy, a 2D c&#8208;MOF with mesopores of 3.2&#8197;nm was synthesized using commercially available ligands hexahydrotriphenylene and 2,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzoquinone. The facilitation of the diffusion of redox species by the large pore size of this MOF was demonstrated through a series of probes. With this feature, it showed superior performance in the electrochemical analysis of a variety of biological species.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Single&#8208;Molecule Tracking in Living Cells using Weak&#8208;Affinity Protein Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;labeling protein tag in combination with exchangeable fluorophore ligands bypasses photobleaching and enables long&#8208;term single&#8208;molecule imaging in living cells. This extends observation times in single cells and enables direct monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor activation in living cells.







Abstract
Single&#8208;particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in living cells. However, permanent labeling strategies for SPT suffer from photobleaching as a major limitation, restricting observation times, and obstructing the study of long&#8208;term cellular processes within single living cells. Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;apply labeling approach for live&#8208;cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of individual living cells of up to 30&#8197;minutes. Using the xHTL/HaloTag7 labeling system, we measure the ligand&#8208;induced activation kinetics of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in single living cells. We generate spatial maps of receptor diffusion in cells, report non&#8208;uniform distributions of receptor mobility, and the formation of spatially confined &#8216;hot spots&#8217; of EGFR activation. Furthermore, we measured the mobility of an ER&#8208;luminal protein in living cells and found diffusion coefficients that correlated with the ER nano&#8208;structure. This approach represents a general strategy to monitor protein mobility in a functional context and for extended observation times in single living cells.

         <title>Nebulized Immunotherapy of Orthotopic Lung Cancer by Mild Magnetothermal&#8211;Based Innate Immunity Activations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel nebulized magnetothermal immunotherapy strategy to treat orthotopic lung cancer by using magnetothermal nanomaterial (Zn&#8722;CoFe2O4@Zn&#8722;MnFe2O4&#8722;PEG, named ZCMP), which is capable of releasing iron ions via acid/thermal reaction to maximize the use of lung&#8216;s immune environment through cascade activations of AMs and NK cells. The novel strategy shows excellent therapeutic results against orthotopic lung cancer.







Abstract
Advances in adaptive immunity have greatly contributed to the development of cancer immunotherapy. However, its over&#8208;low efficacy and insufficient invasion of immune cells in the tumor tissue, and safety problems caused by cytokine storm, have seriously impeded further clinical application for solid tumor immunotherapy. Notably, the immune microenvironment of the lungs is naturally enriched with alveolar macrophages (AMs). Herein, we introduce a novel nebulized magnetothermal immunotherapy strategy to treat orthotopic lung cancer by using magnetothermal nanomaterial (Zn&#8722;CoFe2O4@Zn&#8722;MnFe2O4&#8722;PEG, named ZCMP), which can release iron ions via an acid/thermal&#8208;catalytic reaction to maximize the use of lung&#8216;s immune environment through the cascade activations of AMs and natural killer (NK) cells. Nebulized administration greatly enhance drug bioavailability by localized drug accumulation at the lesion site. Upon mild magnetic hyperthermia, the released iron ions catalyze endogenous H2O2 decomposition to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggers the M1 polarization of AMs, and the resultant inflammatory cytokine IFN&#8208;&#946;, IL&#8208;1&#946; and IL&#8208;15 releases to activate c&#8208;Jun, STAT5 and GZMB related signaling pathways, promoting NK cells proliferation and activation. This innovative strategy optimally utilizes the lung&#8216;s immune environment and shows excellent immunotherapeutic outcomes against orthotopic lung cancer.

Polyethylene degraded through an unreported reaction pathway, with water activation involved, resulting in shorter&#8208;chain alkanes, alkenes, alcohols and ketones (Cn, n&#8818;50). The reaction was driven by ball milling, avoiding high temperature and pressurization. No noble&#8208;metal or complex catalysts were used. Only earth&#8208;abundant Al2O3 was milled with reactants.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most prevalent type of plastic waste and also the most challenging to depolymerize because of its inert carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds.[1] High temperature and noble metals are usually required for depolymerization.[2] To avoid using noble metals, costly reagents and harsh reaction conditions, it is worthwhile but challenging to explore new reaction pathways.[3] We report an unprecedented mechanochemical reaction of PE and water to result in shorter&#8208;chain alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, and ketones (Cn, where n&#8818;50), with above 80&#8201;% of starting carbon converted into these products, which could be a valuable feedstock for re&#8208;entering chemical value chains. This reaction is driven solely by ball milling, without heating and pressurizing. No costly catalysts are used. Instead, only earth&#8208;abundant Al2O3 was milled with reactants.

         <title>The Swiss Army Knife of Electrodes: Pillar[6]arene&#8208;Modified Electrodes for Molecular Electrocatalysis Over a Wide pH Range</title>

         <dc:description>
Pillar[6]arene&#8208;functionalised indium tin oxide electrodes can be modified with electrocatalytically active ruthenium complexes through host&#8211;guest interactions. These versatile electrodes exhibit activity for reactions across a broad pH range (2.4&#8211;10.8) and can be reused after reabsorption of the desorbed catalyst. Different electrocatalytic transformations can be conducted under varying conditions utilising the same electrode.







Abstract
Molecularly&#8208;modified electrode materials that maintain stability over a broad pH range are rare. Typically, each electrochemical transformation necessitates a specifically tuned system to achieve strong binding and high activity of the catalyst. Here, we report the functionalisation of mesoporous indium tin oxide (mITO) electrodes with the macrocyclic host molecule pillar[6]arene (PA[6]). These electrodes are stable within the pH range of 2.4&#8211;10.8 and can be equipped with electrochemically active ruthenium complexes through host&#8211;guest interactions to perform various oxidation reactions. Benzyl alcohol oxidation serves as a model reaction in acidic media, while ammonia oxidation is conducted to assess the systems performance under basic conditions. PA[6]&#8208;modified electrodes demonstrate catalytic activity for both reactions when complexed to different guest molecules and can be reused by reabsorption of the catalyst after its degradation. Furthermore, the system can be employed to perform subsequent reactions in electrolyte with varying pH, enabling the same electrode to be utilised in multiple different electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Highly Luminescent Cu(I) Metallacycles toward New Luminescent Thermic Tracers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TADF luminescent Cu(I) metallacycle B carrying unusual semi&#8208;bridging aqua ligands has been prepared in a one&#8208;step high&#8208;yield reaction. When B is heated markedly above room temperature, a solid&#8208;state reaction affords a new metallacycle C displaying TADF luminescence different from that of B. The removal of the aqua ligands and the formation of cuprophilic interactions makes this transition an innovative example of a solid&#8208;state photoactive tracer.







Abstract
A new luminescent Cu(I) tetrametallic metallacycle B is reported that features very rare semi&#8208;bridging aqua ligands. When heated markedly above room temperature, this compound undergoes a post&#8208;synthetic transformation in the solid&#8208;state, affording the new luminescent metallacycle C. Thermogravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal that this alteration preserves the gross tetrametallic macrocycle structure, but is caused by the release of the coordinated water molecules with the concomitant formation of cuprophilic interactions. This transition induces a shift from eye&#8208;perceived green (B) to blue (C) room&#8208;temperature luminescence for these molecular solids. Photophysical measurements and time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory calculations have been conducted to identify the origins of the emission properties lying in these structurally related assemblies, and suggest that thermally activated delayed fluorescence dominates the radiative relaxation pathways. This study highlights the innovative feature of Cu(I) derivatives, offering access to stimuli&#8208;sensitive materials that can witness, a posteriori, the exceeding of critical temperatures in their environment.

         <title>Accelerated Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer via Engineering Palladium Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters for Scalable Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>

An engineered palladium sub&#8208;nanoclusters on nickel ditelluride accelerated water dissociation kinetics to promote the protonation of OOH* intermediate, and hence significantly enhanced performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of H2O2 from oxygen reduction reaction via a two&#8208;electron pathway is vital as an alternative for the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. However, this process is largely hindered in neutral and alkaline conditions due to sluggish kinetics associated with the transformation of intermediate O2* into OOH* via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer sourced from slow water dissociation. Herein, we developed Pd sub&#8208;nanoclusters on the nickel ditelluride nanosheets (Pd SNCs/NiTe2) to enhance the performance of H2O2 electrosynthesis. The newly&#8208;developed Pd SNCs/NiTe2 exhibited a H2O2 selectivity of as high as 99&#8201;% and a positive shift of onset potential up to 0.81&#8197;V. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental studies (e.g., X&#8208;ray absorption and attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectra measurements) revealed that the Pd sub&#8208;nanoclusters supported by NiTe2 nanosheets efficiently reduced the energy barrier of water dissociation to generate more protons, facilitating the proton feeding kinetics. When used in a flow cell, Pd SNCs/NiTe2 cathode efficiently produced H2O2 with a maximum yield rate of 1.75&#8197;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a current efficiency of 95&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Further, an accumulated H2O2 concentration of 1.43&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 was reached after 10&#8197;hours of continuous electrolysis, showing the potential for practical H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Based Enantioconvergent Reductive Couplings of Racemic Allenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoredox/Cr/Co triple catalytic radical enantioconvergent reductive coupling of racemic allenes with aldehydes is developed. This method is applicable to various allenyl sulfones and allenyl esters, providing a versatile and robust platform for the construction of synthetically valuable homoallylic alcohols bearing an internal carbon&#8208;carbon double bond with excellent efficiency, selectivity, and functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;based enantioconvergent reactions have become a powerful strategy to synthesize enantiopure compounds from racemic starting materials. However, existing methods primarily address precursors with central chirality, neglecting those with axial chirality. Herein, we describe the enantioconvergent reductive coupling of racemic allenes with aldehydes, facilitated by a photoredox, chromium, and cobalt triple catalysis system. This method selectively affords one product from sixteen possible regio&#8208; and stereoisomers. The protocol leverages CoIII&#8722;H mediated hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and Cr&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;polar crossover for efficient stereoablation of axial chirality and asymmetric addition, respectively. Supported by mechanistic insights from control experiments, deuterium labeling, and DFT calculations, our approach offers synthetic chemists a valuable tool for creating enantioenriched chiral homoallylic alcohols, promising to advance radical&#8208;based strategies for synthesizing complex chiral molecules.

This method is applicable to various allenyl sulfones and allenyl esters, providing a versatile and robust platform for the construction of synthetically valuable homoallylic alcohols bearing an internal carbon-carbon double bond with excellent efficiency, selectivity, and functional group tolerance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal-catalyzed radical-based enantioconvergent reactions have become a powerful strategy to synthesize enantiopure compounds from racemic starting materials. However, existing methods primarily address precursors with central chirality, neglecting those with axial chirality. Herein, we describe the enantioconvergent reductive coupling of racemic allenes with aldehydes, facilitated by a photoredox, chromium, and cobalt triple catalysis system. This method selectively affords one product from sixteen possible regio- and stereoisomers. The protocol leverages Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H mediated hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and Cr-catalyzed radical-polar crossover for efficient stereoablation of axial chirality and asymmetric addition, respectively. Supported by mechanistic insights from control experiments, deuterium labeling, and DFT calculations, our approach offers synthetic chemists a valuable tool for creating enantioenriched chiral homoallylic alcohols, promising to advance radical-based strategies for synthesizing complex chiral molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting K+&#8208;Ionic Conductivity of Layered Oxides via Regulating P2/P3 Heterogeneity and Reciprocity for Room&#8208;Temperature Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Potassium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;faceted strategy is deployed to overcome the K+&#8208;ion transport resistance of a layered solid electrolyte, P2/P3&#8208;K0.62Mg0.54Sb0.46O2, at both atomic and macro scales. As a result, a record&#8208;high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity up to 1.6&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is achieved. Moreover, the modified solid electrolyte enables durable potassium metal batteries, outperforming organic liquid electrolyte.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries are promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, high energy density and inherent safety. However, solid state K&#8208;ion conductors struggle with poor ionic conductivity due to the large ionic radius of K+&#8208;ions. Herein, we report precise regulation of phase heterogeneity and reciprocity of the P2/P3&#8208;symbiosis K0.62Mg0.54Sb0.46O2 solid electrolyte (SE) for boosting a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The bulk ionic conducting mechanism is explored by elucidating the effect of atomic stacking mode within the layered framework on K+&#8208;ion migration barriers. For ion diffusion at grain boundaries, the P2/P3 biphasic symbiosis property assists in tunning the SE microstructure, which crystallizes in rod&#8208;like particles with lengths of tens of micrometers facilitating long&#8208;distance ion transport and significantly decreasing grain boundary resistance. Potassium metal symmetric cells using the modified SE deliver excellent cycling life over 300&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high critical current density of 0.68&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries (QSSKBs) coupled with two kinds of layered oxide cathodes demonstrate remarkable stability over 300&#8197;cycles, outperforming the liquid electrolyte counterparts. The QSSKB system provides a promising strategy for high&#8208;efficiency, safe, and durable large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>As Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Meets with Noncovalent Conformational Locks: Subtly Regulating NIR&#8208;II Molecules for Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Navigated Synergistic Therapies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ingenious integration of NoCLs into AIE&#8208;active molecular architecture endows the constructed molecule TEEITQ with superior absorption capacity, bright NIR&#8208;II emission and prominent photothermal effect simultaneously. Those features enable them to perform well in the NIR&#8208;II FLI/PAI/PTI trimodal imaging&#8208;guided chemo&#8208;photothermal synergistic therapy towards cancer.







Abstract
Phototheranostics is growing into a sparking frontier in disease treatment. Developing single molecular species synchronously featured by powerful absorption capacity, superior second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence and prominent photothermal conversion ability is highly desirable for phototheranostics, yet remains formidably challenging. In this work, we propose a molecular design philosophy that the integration of noncovalent conformational locks (NoCLs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in a single formulation is able to boost multiple photophysical properties for efficient phototheranostics. The introduction of NoCLs skeleton with conformation&#8208;locking feature in the center of molecular architecture indeed elevates the structural planarity and rigidity, which simultaneously promotes the absorption capacity and bathochromic&#8208;shifts the emission wavelength centered in NIR&#8208;II region. Meanwhile, the AIE tendency mainly originated from flexibly propeller&#8208;like geometry at the ends of molecular architecture eventually endows the molecule with satisfactory emission intensity and photothermal conversion in aggregates. Consequently, by utilizing the optimized molecule, unprecedented performance on NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photothermal&#8208;chemo synergistic therapy is demonstrated by the precise tumor diagnosis and complete tumor ablation.

         <title>Probing Twist&#8208;Induced Endocytotic Membrane Fission using Anisotropic Gold Homodimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dumbbell&#8208;shaped gold homodimers (AuHD) were developed as an anisotropic probe to real&#8208;time monitoring of live endocytic vesicles under DFM for the kinetic study of dynamin&#8208;induced lipid remodeling underlying membrane fission.







Abstract
Membrane fission involves a crucial step of lipid remodeling, in which the dynamin collar constricts and severs the tubulated lipid membrane at the neck of budding vesicles. Nevertheless, the difficulty in accurately determining the rotational dynamics of live endocytotic vesicles poses a limit on the elucidation of dynamin&#8208;induced membrane remodeling for endocytotic vesicle scission. Herein, we designed a DNA&#8208;modified gold homodimer (AuHD)&#8208;based anisotropic plasmonic probe with uniform surface chemistry, minimizing orientational fluctuation within vesicle encapsulation. Using AuHDs as cargos to image the dynamics of cargo&#8208;containing vesicles during endocytosis, we showed that, prior to detachment from plasma membrane, the cargo&#8208;containing vesicles underwent multiple intermittent twists of ~4&#176; angular orientation relative to plasma membrane with a ~0.2&#8197;s dwell time. These findings suggest that the membrane torques resulting from dynamin actions in vivo constitute the pathway to membrane fission, potentially shedding light on how dynamin&#8208;mediated lipid remodeling orchestrates membrane fission.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Boron Amino Acid for Positron Emission Tomography and Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

BBPA is a boramino acid derived from the rational design of BPA, serving as a theranostic agent for both PET imaging and BNCT. It shares the same chemical structure, differing only in isotopic composition, which allows [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET to be seamlessly integrated with BBPA&#8208;BNCT, offering a boron delivery capacity that surpasses that of BPA.







Abstract
Trifluoroborate boronophenylalanine (BBPA) is a boron amino acid analog of 4&#8208;boronophenylalanine (BPA) but with a trifluoroborate group (&#8722;BF3&#8722;) instead of a carboxyl group (&#8722;COOH). Clinical studies have shown that 18F&#8722;labeled BBPA ([18F]BBPA) can produce high&#8208;contrast tumor images in positron emission tomography (PET). Beyond PET imaging, BBPA is a theranostic agent for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Because BBPA possesses an identical chemical structure to BNCT and PET, it can potentially predict the boron concentration for BNCT using [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET. The synthesis of BBPA was achieved by selectively fluorinating the &#945;&#8208;aminoborate compound, taking advantage of the varying rates of solvolysis of the B&#8722;F bond. The study showcased the high&#8208;contrast [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET imaging in various tumor models, highlighting its broad applicability for both [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET and BBPA&#8208;BNCT. [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET tumor uptake remains consistent across various doses, including those used in BNCT. This enables accurate estimation of the boron concentration in tumors using [18F]BBPA&#8208;PET. With its dual boron structure, BBPA increases boron concentration in tumor cells and tumor tissues compared to BPA. Thus, less boron carrier is needed. This study introduces a new theranostic boron carrier that enhances boron accumulation in tumors, predicts boron concentration, and enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of BNCT.

The study showcased the high-contrast [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]BBPA-PET imaging in various tumor models, highlighting its broad applicability for both [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]BBPA-PET and BBPA-BNCT. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]BBPA-PET tumor uptake remains consistent across various doses, including those used in BNCT. This enables accurate estimation of the boron concentration in tumors using [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]BBPA-PET. With its dual boron structure, BBPA increases boron concentration in tumor cells and tumor tissues compared to BPA. Thus, less boron carrier is needed. This study introduces a new theranostic boron carrier that enhances boron accumulation in tumors, predicts boron concentration, and enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of BNCT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This study developed an efficient heterogeneous Pauson&#8211;Khand polymerization method for the controlled synthesis of main&#8208;chain poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s containing &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam functionalities using readily available internal alkynes and imines. The molecular weights can be precisely controlled by adjusting the ratio of phenyl formate and nickel. These polymers demonstrate rapid and sensitive dual responsiveness to light and acid stimuli.







Abstract
Polymers containing lactam structures play a crucial role in both natural biological systems and human life, and their synthesis, functions and applications are of utmost importance for biomimetics and the creation of new materials. In this study, we developed an efficient heterogeneous Pauson&#8211;Khand polymerization (h&#8208;PKP) method for the controlled synthesis of main&#8208;chain poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s containing &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam functionalities using readily available internal alkynes and imines. The molecular weights of the resulting poly(N&#8722;Ts/&#947;&#8208;lactam)s can be precisely controlled by adjusting the ratio of phenyl formate and nickel. These polymers exhibit high solid&#8208;state luminescence and demonstrate rapid and sensitive dual responsiveness to light and acid stimuli. They further demonstrate strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capability. The unique dual&#8208;emission peaks observed in poly(N&#8722;H/&#947;&#8208;lactam)s obtained through post&#8208;treatment under acidic conditions demonstrate a mechanism of aggregation&#8208;induced intermolecular excited&#8208;state proton transfer specific to lactam structures. The efficient one&#8208;pot synthetic method for poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam) provides a novel strategy for constructing polymers with &#947;&#8208;lactam structures in the main chain and the simple and efficient post&#8208;modification method offer a versatile toolbox for functionalizing poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s to expand their potential applications.

         <title>Planar Chiral Charge&#8208;Transfer Cyclophanes: Convenient Synthesis, Circularly Polarized Light&#8208;Responsive Photothermal Conversion and Supramolecular Chiral Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering charge transfer(CT) and planar chirality by judicious choice of donor unit is achieved in enforced densely &#960;&#8208;stacking D/A Cyclophanes. CT absorption band can be tuned from visible to near&#8208;infrared region. As for the two planar chiral CT cyclophanes, one shows chiral selectivity for incident circularly polarized(CP) light for photothermal conversion, while another can stack into helical structure to amplify molecular planar chirality.







Abstract
We report herein a series of macrocycles in which the densely &#960;&#8208;stacked charge&#8208;transfer (CT) donor/acceptor with naphthalenediimides (NDIs) or perylene diimide (PDI) as acceptor moiety pairing various donor moieties are locked by covalent bond. The X&#8208;ray crystallography of C8BDT&#8208;NDI reveals a short intramolecular &#960;&#8208;stacking distance around 3.4&#8197;&#197; and the existence of intermolecular donor/acceptor &#960;&#8208;stacking (3.7&#8197;&#197;). The intramolecular CT is highly dependent on the electron&#8208;donating ability of donor moiety and replacing carbazole (C8KZ) with benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (C8BDT) or dihydroindolo[3,2&#8208;b]indole (C8DN) redshift CT absorption into NIR region. Notably, both C8BDT&#8208;NDI and C8DN&#8208;NDI demonstrate excellent photothermal performance, which is a result of the active non&#8208;radiative pathways. Interestingly, the different molecular symmetry between donor and acceptor moiety in cyclophanes endow C8BDT&#8208;NDI and C8DN&#8208;NDI with intrinsic planar chirality. The enantiomeric C8BDT&#8208;NDI shows chiral selectivity for incident light, i.e., when irradiated by left&#8208;circularly polarized light, (R)&#8208;C8BDT&#8208;NDI is more sensitive and a higher maximum stable temperature is achieved. While, enantiomeric C8DN&#8208;NDI pack with different orientations forming M&#8208; and P&#8208;handedness helix, respectively, demonstrating molecular planar chirality being transferred and amplified through molecular assembly. These results provide insight into the intramolecular charge transfer in enforced D/A &#960;&#8208;stacks in which CT interactions and planar chirality would be engineered through structural control.

         <title>Highly Stable Propane Dehydrogenation on a Self&#8208;Supporting Single&#8208;Component Zn2SiO4 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals are studied to serve as a self&#8208;supporting single&#8208;component catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), in&#8197;which the coordinately unsaturated ZnOx sites derived from ZnO4 tetrahedra on the Zn2SiO4 surface function as catalytic centers. Due to its single&#8208;component crystalline nature and the presence of Zn&#8722;O&#8722;Si bonds, Zn2SiO4 exhibits superior durability for PDH compared to the supported ZnO catalysts.







Abstract
Current industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes predominantly use either toxic Cr&#8208;based or expensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts, necessitating urgent exploration for alternatives. Herein, we present Zn2SiO4, an easily prepared, cost&#8208;effective material, as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for PDH. Uniquely, Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals do not require dispersion on support materials, commonly needed for catalytic active oxide clusters, but function as a self&#8208;supporting catalyst instead. During the reaction&#8216;s induction period, surface Zn species on the Zn2SiO4 crystal reduce to coordinately unsaturated ZnOx single sites, serving as highly active catalytic centers. The Zn2SiO4 catalyst demonstrates a stable performance over 200&#8201;hours of PDH operation at 550&#8201;&#176;C. We further find that introducing a minuscule amount of CO2 into the propane feed significantly extends the catalyst lifespan to over 2000&#8201;hours. This enhancement arises from the special role of CO2 in facilitating the removal of strongly adsorbed H*, preventing the complete reduction of ZnOx. After prolonged reaction, the activity of Zn2SiO4 can be fully restored by etching the surface layer to expose fresh Zn species, available throughout the crystals. The combination of CO2introduction and catalytic site regeneration strategies is expected to enable a year&#8208;long PDH operation using a single batch of Zn2SiO4 catalyst.

         <title>Engineering Spacer Conjugation for Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of highly conjugated spacers has led to the development of efficient and stable 2D/3D PSCs. These organic spacers enhance charge transport and improve resistance to moisture and ion migration, resulting in enhanced PCE of 21.0&#8201;% in 24.8&#8208;cm2 modules. Furthermore, the devices maintained over 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 3000&#8197;hours of operation under MPP tracking, establishing them as one of the most stable 2D/3D PSCs to date.







Abstract
Incorporating two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite in 3D perovskite absorber holds great potential to improve the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the bulky&#8208;cation&#8208;based 2D structures often exhibit poor charge transport and are prone to formation of charge&#8208;extraction barrier that impedes efficient device operation. We address these issues by introducing aromatic spacers with molecular conjugation into 2D perovskites locating between 3D perovskites and electron charge transport layers. Among our tested aromatic spacers, the pyrenylbutanamine (PyBA) spacer was shown to endow 2D perovskites with superior charge transport properties and efficient charge extraction from the bulk perovskite in 2D/3D PSCs, due to the highest degree of conjugation. As a result, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.3&#8201;% in a 0.16&#8208;cm2 single cell and 21.0&#8201;% in a 24.8&#8208;cm2 module. Moreover, the incorporated PyBA substantially raised the resistance of 2D/3D PSCs against moisture and ion migration, resulting in enhanced environmental, thermal, and operational stability. Notably, the PyBA&#8208;based devices retained over 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 2000&#8197;hours at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;% relative humidity, or 1000&#8197;hours at 85&#8201;&#176;C and 85&#8201;% humidity, or 3000&#8197;hours of operation under continuous 1&#8208;Sun illumination at 40&#8201;&#176;C, showcasing their exceptionally high stability compared to previously reported 2D/3D PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of highly conjugated spacers has led to the development of efficient and stable 2D/3D PSCs. These organic spacers enhance charge transport and improve resistance to moisture and ion migration, resulting in enhanced PCE of 21.0&#8201;% in 24.8-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; modules. Furthermore, the devices maintained over 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 3000&#8197;hours of operation under MPP tracking, establishing them as one of the most stable 2D/3D PSCs to date.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation of Alkynes with CO2: En Route to Axially Chiral Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic atroposelective carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkynes with CO2 is reported. A variety of valuable axially chiral carboxylic acids are obtained with good yields and high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, Z/E and enantio&#8208;selectivities. An unexpected anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208;carboxylation is observed in the sp2&#8208;hybrid carbo&#8208;electrophile&#8208;initiated reductive carboxylation of alkynes.







Abstract
Precise synthesis of carboxylic acids via catalytic carboxylation with CO2 is highly appealing. Although considerable advancements have been achieved in difunctionalizing carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, the asymmetric variants are conspicuously underdeveloped, particularly in addressing axially chiral alkenes. Herein, we report the first catalytic atroposelective carboxylation of alkynes with CO2. A variety of valuable axially chiral carboxylic acids are obtained with good yields and high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, Z/E and enantio&#8208;selectivities. Notably, an unexpected anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208;carboxylation is observed in the sp2&#8208;hybrid carbo&#8208;electrophile&#8208;initiated reductive carboxylation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies including DFT calculation elucidate the origin of chiral induction and anti&#8208;selectivity in vinyl&#8208;carboxylation of alkynes.

         <title>Designing Cooperative Ion Transport Pathway in Ultra&#8208;Thin Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes toward Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy was proposed to confine PVDF&#8722;HFP inside pores of fluorinated covalent organic frameworks (CF3&#8722;COF) to synergistically enhance ion transport within polymer matrices. The long&#8208;ordered ion transfer pathway can effective enhance ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The insights gained from this research could pave the way for the development of more efficient and stable solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries toward practicalization.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries due to their decent flexibility, safety, and interfacial stability. However, their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and limited conductivity, leading to inferior electrochemical performance. Herein, we proposed to design ultra&#8208;thin solid&#8208;state electrolyte with long&#8208;range cooperative ion transport pathway to effectively increase the ionic conductivity and stability. The impregnation of PVDF&#8722;HFP inside pores of fluorinated covalent organic framework (CF3&#8722;COF) can disrupt its symmetry, rendering rapid ion transportation and inhibited anion immigration. The functional groups of CF3&#8722;COF can interact with PVDF&#8722;HFP to form fast Li+ transport channels, which enables the uniform and confined Li+ conduction within the electrolyte. The introduction of CF3&#8722;COF also enhances the mechanical strength and flexibility of SPEs, as well as ensures homogeneous Li deposition and inhibited dendrite growth. Hence, a remarkably high conductivity of 1.21&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 can be achieved. Finally, the ultra&#8208;thin SPEs with an extremely long cycle life exceed 9000&#8197;h can be obtained while the NCM523/Li pouch cell demonstrates a high capacity of 760&#8197;mAh and 96&#8201;% capacity retention after cycling, holding great promises to be utilized for practical solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

Novel equations based on the mass&#8208;balance model were applied to analyze 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest systems for achiral and chiral host molecules with left&#8208; and right&#8208;twisted conformations (HM and HP) and chiral and achiral guest molecules (GX). Theoretical analysis for the variable temperature circular dichroism (VT&#8722;CD) experiments resulted in the successful determination of the thermodynamic parameters, equilibrium constants (K), and molar CD values.







Abstract
An efficient strategy for high&#8208;performance chiral materials is to design and synthesize host molecules with left&#8208; and right&#8208; (M&#8208; and P&#8208;)twisted conformations and to control their twisted conformations. For this, a quantitative analysis is required to describe the chiroptical inversion, chiral transfer, and chiral recognition in the host&#8208;guest systems, which is generally performed using circular dichroism (CD) and/or proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H&#8197;NMR) spectroscopies. However, the mass&#8208;balance model that considers the M&#8208; and P&#8208;twisted conformations has not yet been established. In this study, we derived the novel equations based on the mass&#8208;balance model for the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest systems. Then, we further applied them to analyze the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest systems for the achiral calixarene&#8208;based capsule molecule, achiral dimeric zinc porphyrin tweezer molecule, and chiral pillar[5]arene with the chiral and/or achiral guest molecules by using the data obtained from the CD titration, variable temperature CD (VT&#8722;CD), and 1H&#8197;NMR experiments. The thermodynamic parameters (&#916;H and &#916;S), equilibrium constants (K), and molar CD (&#916;&#1013;) in the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest systems could be successfully determined by the theoretical analyses using the derived equations.

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Mediated Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Efficient Partial Oxidation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer between the water and polydopamine interfaces under ultrasonic stimulation effectively enables the activation of oxygen under mild conditions, leading to the oxidation of methane by derived reactive oxygen species, a process that can be intensified if the catalyst suspension is pre&#8208;illuminated for a period in an oxygenated atmosphere.







Abstract
The direct conversion and efficient utilization of methane pose a critical scientific challenge. Indirect activation via reactive oxygen species (ROS) offers a high probability of contact with methane and conversion efficiency under mild conditions. However, reported product yields are suboptimal due to challenges in activating oxygen and facilitating mass transfer in suspension systems. We propose the use of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC), employing polydopamine (PDA) as a catalyst that undergoes electron transfer with oxygen under ultrasound, generating ROS that drives the partial oxidation of methane (POM). Corresponding experimental results indicate that CH3OH and most HCHO are produced directly from CH4. Furthermore, through in situ characterizations, we have shown that light pretreatment of the catalysts in an oxygenated atmosphere facilitates the forming of more C=O functional groups with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, thereby significantly enhancing overall product yields, particularly for CH3OH. Within two hours, product yields reach 1.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 for HCHO and 0.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 for CH3OH. This work introduces a novel approach for efficient POM, while highlighting the distinctive catalytic properties of PDA.

         <title>Surface Cladding Engineering via Oxygen Sulfur Distribution for Stable Electrocatalytic Oxygen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This word developed a surface&#8208;cladding strategy in oxygen&#8208;sulfur interface to mitigate Ni dissolution and stabilize lattice oxygen in OER. Multiple in situ characterization technologies and density functional theory calculations reveal that that the stable interfacial O&#8722;Ni&#8722;S arrangement can facilitate the accumulation of electrons on surficial NiO side and weaken its Ni&#8722;O covalency. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the balance between activity and stability and thus enhances the electrochemical performance by controlling coating interface.







Abstract
Inevitable leaching and corrosion under anodic oxidative environment greatly restrict the lifespan of most catalysts with excellent primitive activity for oxygen production. Here, based on Fick&#8217; s Law, we present a surface cladding strategy to mitigate Ni dissolution and stabilize lattice oxygen triggering by directional flow of interfacial electrons and strong electronic interactions via constructing elaborately cladding&#8208;type NiO/NiS heterostructure with controlled surface thickness. Multiple in situ characterization technologies indicated that this strategy can effectively prevent the irreversible Ni ions leaching and inhibit lattice oxygen from participating in anodic reaction. Combined with density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the stable interfacial O&#8722;Ni&#8722;S arrangement can facilitate the accumulation of electrons on surficial NiO side and weaken its Ni&#8722;O covalency. This would suppress the overoxidation of Ni and simultaneously fixing the lattice oxygen, thus enabling catalysts with boosted corrosion resistance without sacrificing its activity. Consequently, this cladding&#8208;type NiO/NiS heterostructure exhibits excellent performance with a low overpotential of 256&#8197;mV after 500&#8197;h. Based on Fick's law, this work demonstrates the positive effect of surface modification through precisely adjusting of the oxygen&#8208;sulfur exchange process, which has paved an innovative and effective way to solve the instability problem of anodic oxidation.

         <title>Glycosylated AIE&#8208;active Red Light&#8208;triggered Photocage with Precisely Tumor Targeting Capability for Synergistic Type I Photodynamic Therapy and CPT Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a lactosylated photocage prodrug that self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles BT&#8208;LRCs for type I photodynamic therapy and camptothecin (CPT) chemotherapy. Under the regulation of lactose units, BT&#8208;LRCs exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior and remarkable superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;&#8901;) generation efficiency, and CPT was subsequently released upon light irradiation. This strategy collaboratively amplified the therapeutic effect in HepG2 cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
Photocaging is an emerging protocol for precisely manipulating spatial and temporal behaviors over biological activity. However, the red/near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;triggered photolysis process of current photocage is largely singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;dependent and lack of compatibility with other reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated techniques, which has proven to be the major bottleneck in achieving efficient and precise treatment. Herein, we reported a lactosylated photocage BT&#8208;LRC by covalently incorporating camptothecin (CPT) into hybrid BODIPY&#8208;TPE fluorophore via the superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;&#8901;)&#8208;cleavable thioketal bond for type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) and anticancer drug release. Amphiphilic BT&#8208;LRC could be self&#8208;assembled into aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanoparticles (BT&#8208;LRCs) owing to the regulation of carbohydrate&#8208;carbohydrate interactions (CCIs) among neighboring lactose units in the nanoaggregates. BT&#8208;LRCs could simultaneously generate abundant O2&#8722;&#8901; through the aggregation modulated by lactose interactions, and DNA&#8208;damaging agent CPT was subsequently and effectively released. Notably, the type I PDT and CPT chemotherapy collaboratively amplified the therapeutic efficacy in HepG2 cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Furthermore, the inherent AIE property of BT&#8208;LRCs endowed the photocaged prodrug with superior bioimaging capability, which provided a powerful tool for real&#8208;time tracking and finely tuning the PDT and photoactivated drug release behavior in tumor therapy.

         <title>Electrochemical C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N Arylation using Alternating Polarity in flow for Compound Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel platform for automated electrochemical synthesis of compound libraries in flow enabled the C&#8722;X arylation of&gt;30 aryl halide scaffolds in the presence of diverse amines (including sulfonamides, sulfoximines, amides, and anilines) and alcohols (including serine residues within peptides). The unprecedented application of potentiostatic alternating polarity in flow is essential to avoid electrode passivation.







Abstract
Etherification and amination of aryl halide scaffolds are commonly used reactions in parallel medicinal chemistry to rapidly scan structure&#8211;activity relationships with abundant building blocks. Electrochemical methods for aryl etherification and amination demonstrate broad functional group tolerance and extended nucleophile scope compared to traditional methods. Nevertheless, there is a need for robust and scale&#8208;transferable workflows for electrochemical compound library synthesis. Herein we describe a platform for automated electrochemical synthesis of C&#8722;X arylation (X=NH, OH) in flow to access compound libraries. A comprehensive Design of Experiment (DoE) study identifies an optimal protocol which generates high yields across&gt;30 aryl halide scaffolds, diverse amines (including electron&#8208;deficient sulfonamides, sulfoximines, amides, and anilines) and alcohols (including serine residues within peptides). Reaction sequences are automated on commercially available equipment to generate libraries of anilines and aryl ethers. The unprecedented application of potentiostatic alternating polarity in flow is essential to avoid accumulating electrode passivation. Moreover, it enables reactions to be performed in air, without supporting electrolyte and with high reproducibility over consecutive runs. Our method represents a powerful means to rapidly generate nucleophile independent C&#8722;X arylation compound libraries using flow electrochemistry.

         <title>Parallel and High Throughput Reaction Monitoring with Computer Vision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel computer vision&#8208;based method for monitoring parallel and high throughput experimentation (HTE) is presented. Unlike previous methods, this approach captures the kinetics of multiple reactions in a single video. Case studies demonstrate its applicability in diverse chemical processes, offering insights into reaction discovery, mechanistic understanding, and optimization, with potential benefits for machine learning&#8208;driven chemical exploration.







Abstract
We report the development and applications of a computer vision based reaction monitoring method for parallel and high throughput experimentation (HTE).

     alt="Parallel and High Throughput Reaction Monitoring with Computer Vision"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel computer vision-based method for monitoring parallel and high throughput experimentation (HTE) is presented. Unlike previous methods, this approach captures the kinetics of multiple reactions in a single video. Case studies demonstrate its applicability in diverse chemical processes, offering insights into reaction discovery, mechanistic understanding, and optimization, with potential benefits for machine learning-driven chemical exploration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the development and applications of a computer vision based reaction monitoring method for parallel and high throughput experimentation (HTE). Whereas previous efforts reported methods to extract bulk kinetics of one reaction from one video, this new approach enables one video to capture bulk kinetics of multiple reactions running in parallel. Case studies, in and beyond well-plate high throughput settings, are described. Analysis of parallel dye-quenching hydroxylations, DMAP-catalysed esterification, solid-liquid sedimentation dynamics, metal catalyst degradation, and biologically-relevant sugar-mediated nitro reduction reactions have each provided insight into the scope and limitations of camera-enabled high throughput kinetics as a means of widening known analytical bottlenecks in HTE for reaction discovery, mechanistic understanding, and optimisation. It is envisaged that the nature of the multi-reaction time-resolved datasets made available by this analytical approach will later serve a broad range of downstream efforts in machine learning approaches to exploring chemical space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Monoborylation of Methane by a Mono Bipyridyl&#8208;Nickel(II) Hydride Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework confined mono bipyridyl&#8208;nickel(II) dihydride species is highly efficient for selective monoborylation of methane via shape&#8208;selective catalysis. This heterogeneous and recyclable single&#8208;site nickel catalyst selectively borylates methane at 200&#8201;&#176;C using pinacolborane to afford methylboronic acid pinacol ester (CH3Bpin) in 98&#8201;% selectivity with a turnover number up to 1388.







Abstract
We report the development of an earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst for methane C&#8722;H borylation. The post&#8208;synthetic metalation of bipyridine&#8208;functionalized zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with NiBr2, followed by treatment with NaEt3BH affords MOF&#8208;supported monomeric bipyridyl&#8208;nickel(II) dihydride species via active site isolation. The heterogeneous and recyclable nickel catalyst selectively borylates methane at 200&#8201;&#176;C using pinacolborane (HBpin) to afford CH3Bpin in 61&#8201;% yield with a turnover number (TON) up to 1388. The confinement of the active NiH2&#8208;species within the uniformly porous MOF allows selective monoborylation of methane via shape&#8208;selective catalysis by preventing the formation of sterically encumbered overborylated products. Unlike MOF&#8722;Ni catalyst, its homogeneous control is almost inactive in methane borylation due to its intermolecular decomposition. Our mechanistic investigation, including spectroscopic, kinetic, and control experiments, as well as DFT calculations, revealed that stabilizing mononuclear bipyridyl&#8208;nickel dihydride and diboryl species by MOF is crucial for achieving efficient methane borylation via turnover&#8208;limiting &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. This work shows promise in designing MOF&#8208;based abundant metal catalysts for the chemoselective functionalization of methane and other inert molecules into valuable chemicals.

         <title>Nanohoops Favour Light&#8208;Induced Energy Transfer over Charge Separation in Porphyrin/[10]CPP/Fullerene Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two different nanohoops in elaborate porphyrin/(aza)[10]CPP/fullerene [2]rotaxanes (CPP: cycloparaphenylene) have been shown to act as &#8220;supramolecular shields&#8221; and completely prevent through&#8208;space electron transfer between the electron&#8208;donating porphyrin and electron&#8208;accepting fullerene. These findings shed light on some previously unexplained results and open the door for future strategic uses of strained carbon nanohoops.







Abstract
[2]Rotaxanes offer unique opportunities for studying and modulating charge separation and energy transfer, because the mechanical bond allows the robust, yet spatially dynamic tethering of photoactive groups. In this work, we synthesized [2]rotaxane triads comprising a central (aza)[10]CPP&#8835;C60 bis&#8208;adduct complex and two zinc porphyrin stoppers to address how the movable nanohoop affects light&#8208;induced charge separation and energy transfer between the rotaxane subcomponents. We found that neither the parent nanohoop [10]CPP nor its electron&#8208;deficient analogue aza[10]CPP actively participate in charge separation. In contrast, the nanohoops completely prevented through&#8208;space charge separation. This result is likely due to supramolecular &#8220;shielding&#8221;, because charge separation was observed in the thread that acted as reference dyad. On the other hand, the suppression of electron transfer allowed the observation of energy transfer from the porphyrin triplet to the fullerene triplet state with a lifetime of ca. 25&#8197;&#956;s. The presence of the interlocked nanohoops therefore leads to a dramatic switch between charge separation and energy transfer. We suggest that our results explain observations made by others in photovoltaic devices comprising nanohoops and may pave the way toward strategic uses of mechanically interlocked architectures in devices that feature (triplet) energy transfer.

         <title>A Supramolecular&#8208;Nanocage&#8208;Based Framework Stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking Interactions with Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular&#8208;nanocage&#8208;based &#960; framework was firstly reported, which can serve as an efficient photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in the absence of any additional photosensitizers. The H2 evolution rate reaches as high as 524012&#8197;&#956;mol/gPt/h.







Abstract
&#960; frameworks, defined as a type of porous supramolecular materials weaved from conjugated molecular units by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, provide a new direction in photocatalysis. However, such examples are rarely reported. Herein, we report a supramolecular&#8208;nanocage&#8208;based &#960; framework constructed from a photoactive Cu(I) complex unit. Structurally, 24 Cu(I) complex units stack together through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, forming a truncated octahedral nanocage with sodalite topology. The inner diameter of the nanocage is 2.8&#8197;nm. By sharing four open faces, each nanocage connects with four equivalent ones, forming a 3D porous &#960; framework (&#960;&#8208;2). &#960;&#8208;2 shows good thermal and chemical stability, which can adsorb CO2, iodine, and methyl orange molecules. More importantly, &#960;&#8208;2 can serve as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. With ultrafine Pt subnanometer particles (0.9&#177;0.1&#8197;nm) incorporated into the nanocages as a co&#8208;catalyst, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches a record&#8208;high value of 524012&#8197;&#956;mol/gPt/h in the absence of any additional photosensitizers. The high photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the ultrafine size of the Pt particles, as well as the fast electron transfer from &#960;&#8208;2 to the highly active Pt upon illumination. &#960;&#8208;2 represents the unique stable supramolecular&#8208;cage&#8208;based &#960; framework with excellent photocatalytic activity.

         <title>A CaI2&#8208;Based Electrolyte Enabled by Borate Ester Anion Receptors for Reversible Ca&#8722;Organic and Ca&#8722;Se Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that CaI2/dimethoxyethane electrolyte supports reversible Ca metal anodes via forming CaI2&#8208;involved solid electrolyte interphase with a low Ca2+ diffusion barrier, expanding the Ca electrolyte chemistry and demonstrating the potential of inorganic phases for Ca2+ diffusion. Ca reversibility is further boosted by introducing tris(2H&#8208;hexafluoroisopropyl) borate anion receptors, enabling reversible Ca&#8722;Se full cells.







Abstract
Passivating solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in Ca metal anodes constitute a long&#8208;standing challenge, as they block Ca2+ transport and inhibit reversible Ca deposition/stripping. Current solutions focus primarily on boron/aluminum&#8208;based electrolytes to mitigate such interfacial issues by producing Ca2+&#8208;conductive species, yet the complex synthetic procedure of these salts restricts the widespread application. Moreover, whether any inorganic phases possess decent Ca2+ conductivity within SEIs remains ambiguous. Herein, we report that a commercially available CaI2&#8208;dimethoxyethane electrolyte supports reversible Ca/Ca2+ redox reactions via forming CaI2&#8208;involved SEI, inspired by our density functional theory calculations where CaI2 species is predicted to possess the lowest Ca2+ diffusion barrier among a range of inorganic phases. We further materialize this finding by introducing a serial of borate ester anion receptors, resulting in the formation of CaI2/borides hybrid SEIs with an enhanced Ca2+ conductivity. Consequently, the resultant electrolytes realize a 7&#8208;fold reduction in deposition/stripping overpotential compared to anion receptor&#8208;free one, allowing for the construction of reversible Ca&#8208;metal full cells with high&#8208;capacity selenium and organic cathodes.

&lt;p&gt;We report that CaI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/dimethoxyethane electrolyte supports reversible Ca metal anodes via forming CaI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-involved solid electrolyte interphase with a low Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion barrier, expanding the Ca electrolyte chemistry and demonstrating the potential of inorganic phases for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion. Ca reversibility is further boosted by introducing tris(2H-hexafluoroisopropyl) borate anion receptors, enabling reversible Ca&#8722;Se full cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passivating solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in Ca metal anodes constitute a long-standing challenge, as they block Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and inhibit reversible Ca deposition/stripping. Current solutions focus primarily on boron/aluminum-based electrolytes to mitigate such interfacial issues by producing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-conductive species, yet the complex synthetic procedure of these salts restricts the widespread application. Moreover, whether any inorganic phases possess decent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity within SEIs remains ambiguous. Herein, we report that a commercially available CaI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dimethoxyethane electrolyte supports reversible Ca/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; redox reactions via forming CaI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-involved SEI, inspired by our density functional theory calculations where CaI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species is predicted to possess the lowest Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion barrier among a range of inorganic phases. We further materialize this finding by introducing a serial of borate ester anion receptors, resulting in the formation of CaI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/borides hybrid SEIs with an enhanced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity. Consequently, the resultant electrolytes realize a 7-fold reduction in deposition/stripping overpotential compared to anion receptor-free one, allowing for the construction of reversible Ca-metal full cells with high-capacity selenium and organic cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Induces Hydrogen Spillover and Platinum Utilization in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

With the substitution of carbon black by WS2, a strong hydrogen binding strength is observed for Pt; thereby, the hydrogen spillover is occurred during HER catalysis; moreover, WS2 slightly affects the Pt in different layers and more Pt atoms involve in HER; thus, the electronic metal&#8208;support interaction for boosted HER performance is revealed.







Abstract
The substantial promotion of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic performance relies on the breakup of the Sabatier principle, which can be achieved by the alternation of the support and electronic metal support interaction (EMSI) is noticed. Due to the utilization of tungsten disulfides as support for platinum (Pt@WS2), surprisingly, Pt@WS2 demands only 31&#8197;mV overpotential to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic HER test, corresponding to a 2.5&#8208;fold higher mass activity than benchmarked Pt/C. The pH dependent electrochemical measurements associated with H2&#8208;TPD and in situ Raman spectroscopy indicate a hydrogen spillover involved HER mechanism is confirmed. The WS2 support triggers a higher hydrogen binding strength for Pt leading to the increment in hydrogen concentration at Pt sites proved by upshifted d band center as well as lower Gibbs free energy of hydrogen, favourable for hydrogen spillover. Besides, the WS2 shows a comparably lower effect on Gibbs free energy for different Pt layers (&#8722;0.50&#8197;eV layer&#8722;1) than carbon black (&#8722;0.88&#8197;eV layer&#8722;1) contributing to a better Pt utilization. Also, the theoretical calculation suggests the hydrogen spillover occurs on the 3rd Pt layer in Pt@WS2; moreover, the energy barrier is lowered with increment in hydrogen coverage on Pt. Therefore, the boosted HER activity attributes to the EMSI effect caused hydrogen spillover and enhancement in Pt utilization efficiency.

         <title>Selectivity Modulation of Multistep Reduction Reactions by Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size effect of Au could influence the selectivity of the nitrobenzene reduction reaction. The supported Au nanoclusters exhibited stronger adsorption to the azoxybenzene intermediate, thus inhibiting further reduction and achieving high azoxybenzene selectivity, whereas the supported Au nanoparticles converted nitrobenzene to the further reduced product azobenzene. This work provides a new insight into the establishment of structure&#8208;reactivity relationships.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of valuable azo&#8208; and azoxyaromatic chemicals via transfer coupling of nitroaromatic compounds has been achieved by fine&#8208;tuning the catalyst structure. Here, a direct method to modulate nitrobenzene reduction and selectively alter the product from azobenzene to azoxybenzene by employing the size effect of Au is reported. Au nanoclusters (NCs) with smaller sizes embedded in ZIF&#8208;8 controllably converted nitrobenzene into azoxybenzene, while supported Au nanoparticles (NPs) selectively catalyzed nitrobenzene reduction to azobenzene. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy on CO adsorption (CO&#8208;DRIFTS) of Au NC/ZIF&#8208;8 revealed a higher valence state and a lower electron density of Au than that of Au NP/ZIF&#8208;8, combined with the desorption of azoxybenzene from the Au NC and Au NP surface, suggesting that the Au NCs with lower electron density exhibit stronger adsorption. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and charge density difference maps indicated that azoxybenzene bonded to Au NC/ZIF&#8208;8 with greater adsorption energy, resulting in more electron transfer between azoxybenzene and the generated Au sites, which inhibited further reduction of azoxybenzene and resulted in high azoxybenzene selectivity. The application of the size effect of Au particles to regulate nitrobenzene transfer coupling provided new insights into the structure&#8208;selectivity relationships.

A regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation reaction of 1,3&#8208;enynes, allenes and conjugated dienes with modified masked phosphinylating reagent is established via synergistic Pd/Co catalysis. The stereodivergent protocol is also described to achieve all four stereoisomers of corresponding motifs.







Abstract
Different from the reported work focusing on the construction of single P&#8208; or C&#8208;stereocenter via hydrophosphinylation of unsaturated carbon bonds, the highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation reaction of allenes, conjugated enynes and 1,3&#8208;dienes is achieved via a designed Pd/Co dual catalysis and newly modified masked phosphinylating reagent. A series of allyl motifs bearing both a tertiary C&#8208; and P&#8208;stereocenter are prepared in generally good yields, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;rr and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee. The unprecedented diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes is established to generate skeletons containing both a P&#8208;stereocenter and a nonadjacent chiral axis. The first stereodivergent hydrophosphinylation reaction is also developed to achieve all four P&#8208;containing stereoisomers. The present protocol features the use of only 3&#8208;minutes reaction time and 0.1&#8201;% catalyst, and with the observation of up to 730 TON. A set of mechanistic studies reveal the necessity and roles of two metal catalysts and corroborate the designed synergistic process.

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Like Contraction Enables the Fabrication of High&#8208;Purity Selenium Films for Efficient Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective oxidation strategy based on the strong antioxidative property of Se arising from the lanthanide&#8208;like contraction achieve both the purification of Se and the deposition of Se film simultaneously. Photovoltaic devices constructed using these Se films exhibit an efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination and demonstrate minimal efficiency degradation after 20,000&#8197;hours of storage in an ambient atmosphere.







Abstract
The lanthanide contraction involves a reduction in atomic radius among f&#8208;block elements below the expected level. A similar contraction is observed in group&#8208;16 elements. The atomic radius of Se (117&#8197;pm) is slightly larger than that of S (104&#8197;pm) arising from the presence of d electrons, compared to the significant increase in atomic radius from O (73&#8197;pm) to S. This lanthanide&#8208;like contraction contributes to Se's robust oxidative resistance. Here we report a selective oxidation strategy utilizing Se's strong antioxidative property to remove coexisting narrow&#8208;band gap Te impurities from Se feedstocks. This strategy selectively oxidizes volatile Te impurities into involatile TeO2 that remains in the evaporation source, while only volatile Se deposits onto the substrate during the thermal&#8208;evaporation deposition process. This enables the fabrication of high&#8208;purity Se films possessing a wide band gap of 1.88&#8197;eV, ideally suited to the optimal band gap for indoor photovoltaics (IPVs). The resulting Se photovoltaics exhibit an efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% under 1000&#8208;lux indoor illumination, outperforming market&#8208;dominant amorphous silicon and all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs. Unencapsulated Se devices show no efficiency degradation after 20,000&#8197;hours of storage in ambient atmosphere.

The atomic radius of Se (117&#8197;pm) is slightly larger than that of S (104&#8197;pm) arising from the presence of d electrons, compared to the significant increase in atomic radius from O (73&#8197;pm) to S. This lanthanide-like contraction contributes to Se's robust oxidative resistance. Here we report a selective oxidation strategy utilizing Se's strong antioxidative property to remove coexisting narrow-band gap Te impurities from Se feedstocks. This strategy selectively oxidizes volatile Te impurities into involatile TeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that remains in the evaporation source, while only volatile Se deposits onto the substrate during the thermal-evaporation deposition process. This enables the fabrication of high-purity Se films possessing a wide band gap of 1.88&#8197;eV, ideally suited to the optimal band gap for indoor photovoltaics (IPVs). The resulting Se photovoltaics exhibit an efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% under 1000-lux indoor illumination, outperforming market-dominant amorphous silicon and all types of lead-free perovskite IPVs. Unencapsulated Se devices show no efficiency degradation after 20,000&#8197;hours of storage in ambient atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organometallic Polymer Constructed by Active Fe&#8722;C12N8 Centers for Boosting Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organometallic polymer constructed by Fe&#8722;C12N8 active centers was prepared and employed as a high&#8208;performance electrode material for sodium&#8208;ions batteries. Benefitting from the unique &#960;&#8208;d conjugation and metallic&#8208;carbon (M&#8722;C) bonds, organic&#8208;iron polymer with microsphere morphology exhibits large reversible capacity and excellent cycling stability.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;metal coordination materials with rich structural diversity are considered as promising electrode materials for rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the electrochemical performance can be constrained by the limited number of active sites and structural instability under the discharge/charge process. Herein, organometallic polymer microspheres (Fe&#8208;PDA&#8208;220) with a unique d&#8208;&#960; conjugated structure was designed and successfully constructed through a simple synchronous polymerization and coordination reactions. Polymerization of phenylenediamine was initiated by Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions generated synchronously during the polymerization integrated with poly&#8208;aminoquinone chains to form Fe&#8722;C12N8 active centers. Used as electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the distinctive Fe&#8722;C bond significantly boosts the structural stability, and the &#960;&#8208;d conjugation system could facilitate electron transfer. A high reversible capacity of 345&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 was delivered at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a capacity of 106&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 was maintained even after discharged/charged at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 5000&#8197;cycles, outperforming most reported coordination materials. Spectroscopic and electronic analyses revealed that a two&#8208;electron reaction occurred per active unit, accompanied by the reversible redox evolution of the C=N groups and Fe ions during the sodiation/desodiation. This work provides a promising and efficient strategy for boosting the electrochemical performance of organic electrode materials by the design of organometallic polymers.

         <title>Evaluation of Active Oxygen Species Derived from Water Splitting for Electrocatalytic Organic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active oxygen species (specially OH*), derived from water electrolysis are essential for the electrooxidation of organic compounds, whereas the relationship between them remains ambiguous. This work investigates the volcanic relationship between the activation of glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation over Au&#8208;based alloys and the coordination metal composition of OH*, as well as their effects on the selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products.







Abstract
Active oxygen species (OH*/O*) derived from water electrolysis are essential for the electrooxidation of organic compounds into high&#8208;value chemicals, which can determine activity and selectivity, whereas the relationship between them remains unclear. Herein, using glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation as a model reaction, we systematically investigated the relationship between GLY oxidation activity and the formation energy of OH* (&#916;GOH*). We first identified that OH* on Au demonstrates the highest activity for GLY electrooxidation among various pure metals, based on experiments and density functional theory, and revealed that &#916;GOH* on Au&#8208;based alloys is influenced by the metallic composition of OH* coordination sites. Moreover, we observed a linear correlation between the adsorption energy of GLY (Eads) and the d&#8208;band center of Au&#8208;based alloys. Comprehensive microkinetic analysis further reveals a volcano relationship between GLY oxidation activity, the &#916;GOH* and the adsorption free energy of GLY (&#916;Gads). Notably, Au3Pd and Au3Ag alloys, positioned near the peak of the volcano plot, show excellent activity, attributed to their moderate &#916;GOH* and &#916;Gads, striking a balance that is neither too high nor too low. This research provides theoretical insights into modulating active oxygen species from water electrolysis to enhance organic electrooxidation reactions.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonds Enable Efficient Photoreduction of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using ab initio molecular dynamics and excited&#8208;state calculations we demonstrate that the formation of chalcogen bonds between hydrosulfide anions and an organic heteroaromatic chromophore containing a sulfur atom enables efficient photoinduced electron transfer and photoreduction.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding interactions have attracted significant attention in a broad chemistry community, with a particular focus on their ability to stabilise the key transition states in various organic synthetic routes. In this work, we demonstrate that they can also be harnessed in selective photoredox reactions, which cannot be otherwise achieved with alternative approaches to photoreduction. We demonstrate this concept through the photoreduction of the sulfur&#8208;containing DNA nucleoside precursor thioanhydrouridine to 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;thiouridine, revealing the previously unrecognized role of bisulfide in this process. Based on quantum chemical simulations, we identify a stable chalcogen&#8208;bonding complex of the hydrosulfide anion and thionhydrouridine (HS&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S contacts), which enables directional photoinduced electron transfer, resulting in the formation of non&#8208;canonical DNA nucleoside. We also disprove the possibility that photoreduction of thioanhydronucleosides could be initiated by hydrated electrons generated from irradiated bisulfide anions which do not interact with the chromophore. Finally, we show that selective photoreduction mediated by chalcogen bonds can only occur for chromophores, which exhibit sufficiently long excited&#8208;state lifetimes in the locally&#8208;excited states to undergo transition to the productive charge transfer state. These findings can be further used in the design of similar photoredox reactions which can employ the potential of chalcogen bonding interactions.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Cold&#8208;Pressed Garnet Composite Electrolytes with Enhanced Li+ Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing Li+ conduction in cold&#8208;pressed Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (Ta&#8722;LZ) is achieved through the incorporation of Li6PS5Cl (LPSC). The formation of a Li&#8208;containing Ta&#8722;Cl structure effectively integrates Ta&#8722;LZ with LPSC, facilitating interparticle Li+ transport. Moreover, Li dendrites and self&#8208;discharge are suppressed owing to the low electronic conductivity of Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC.







Abstract
Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) hold promise for realizing next&#8208;generation lithium metal batteries with high energy density. However, the high stiffness of high&#8208;temperature sintered LLZO makes it brittle and susceptible to strain during the fabrication of solid&#8208;state batteries. Cold&#8208;pressed LLZO exhibits improved ductility but suffers from insufficient Li+ conductivity. Here, we report cold&#8208;pressed Ta&#8208;doped LLZO (Ta&#8722;LZ) particles integrated with ductile Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) via a Li+ conductive Li&#8208;containing Ta&#8722;Cl structure. This configuration creates a continuous Li+ conduction network by enhancing the Li+ exchange at the Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC interface. The resulting Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC SSE exhibits Li+ conductivity of 4.42&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.31&#8197;eV. Li symmetric cells with Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC SSE demonstrate excellent Li dendrite suppression ability, with an improved critical current density of 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a prolonged cycle life exceeding 600&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our finding provides valuable insights into developing cold&#8208;pressed ceramic powder electrolytes for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Garnet Li&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (LLZO)-based solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) hold promise for realizing next-generation lithium metal batteries with high energy density. However, the high stiffness of high-temperature sintered LLZO makes it brittle and susceptible to strain during the fabrication of solid-state batteries. Cold-pressed LLZO exhibits improved ductility but suffers from insufficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity. Here, we report cold-pressed Ta-doped LLZO (Ta&#8722;LZ) particles integrated with ductile Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (LPSC) via a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductive Li-containing Ta&#8722;Cl structure. This configuration creates a continuous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction network by enhancing the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exchange at the Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC interface. The resulting Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC SSE exhibits Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity of 4.42&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a low activation energy of 0.31&#8197;eV. Li symmetric cells with Ta&#8722;LZ/LPSC SSE demonstrate excellent Li dendrite suppression ability, with an improved critical current density of 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a prolonged cycle life exceeding 600&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our finding provides valuable insights into developing cold-pressed ceramic powder electrolytes for high-performance all-solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Diboration of Unactivated Alkenes with (pin)B&#8722;B(dan)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208; and enantioselective Pt&#8208;catalyzed diboration of unactivated alkenes with (pin)B&#8722;B(dan) has been achieved. A variety of structurally diverse differentiable 1,2&#8208;bis(boron) compounds are generated in useful yields with high levels of regio&#8208; and enantiocontrol. Computational studies suggest that the regioselectivity was governed by &#963;&#8208;donor abilities of the boryl ligands.







Abstract
Asymmetric diboration of terminal alkenes is well established, and subsequent selective functionalization of the less hindered primary boronic ester is commonly achieved. Conversely, selective functionalization of the sterically less accessible secondary boronic ester remains challenging. An alternative way to control chemoselective functionalization of bis(boron) compounds is by engendering different Lewis acidity to the two boryl moieties, since reactivity would then be dictated by Lewis acidity instead of sterics. We report herein the regio&#8208; and enantioselective Pt&#8208;catalyzed diboration of unactivated alkenes with (pin)B&#8722;B(dan). A broad range of terminal and cyclic alkenes undergo diboration to furnish the differentiable 1,2&#8208;bis(boron) compounds with high levels of regio&#8208; and enantiocontrol, giving access to a wide variety of novel building blocks from a common intermediate. The reaction places the less Lewis acidic B(dan) group at the less hindered position and the resulting 1,2&#8208;bisboryl alkanes undergo selective transformations of the B(pin) group located at the more hindered position. The regioselectivity of the diboration has been studied by DFT calculations and is believed to originate from the trans influence, which lowers the activation barrier for formation of the regioisomer that places the weaker electron donor [B(pin) vs B(dan)] opposite the strong electron donor (alkyl group) in the platinum complex.

         <title>Polyanionic Receptors for Carboxylates in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylate anions are important but challenging substrates for recognition in aqueous solution. These divalent receptors employ charge&#8208;neutral binding sites to bind simple carboxylates in water with no cosolvent, despite the presence of multiply anionic solubilising groups.







Abstract
Receptors for carboxylate anions have many possible biomedical applications, including mimicry of the vancomycin group of antibiotics. However, binding carboxylates in water, the biological solvent, is highly challenging due to the hydrophilicity of these polar anions. Here we report, for the first time, the recognition of simple carboxylates such as acetate and formate in water by synthetic receptors with charge&#8208;neutral binding sites. The receptors are solubilised by polyanionic side&#8208;chains which, remarkably, do not preclude anion binding. The tricyclic structures feature two identical binding sites linked by polyaromatic bridges, capable of folding into closed, twisted conformations. This folding is hypothesised to preorganise the structures for anion recognition, mimicking the process which generates many protein binding sites. The architecture is suitable for elaboration into enclosed structures with potential for selective recognition of biologically relevant carboxylates.

         <title>Quantification of Synergistic Two&#8208;Color Covalent Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic two&#8208;color photochemistry is a powerful tool for controlling chemical reactivity. We introduce a system of photoswitches that in their on&#8208;state efficiently react to from a stable photoadduct in the presence of two colors of light and introduce a parameter that quantifies the degree of photochemical synergy of photochemical reactions: The synergistic ratio.







Abstract
The emergence of highly wavelength resolved reactivity information for complex photochemical reaction processes allows the establishment of multi&#8208;color reaction modes. One particularly powerful mode is the synergistic two&#8208;color reaction, where two colors of light have to be present in the same volume element to either enable or enhance photochemical reactivity that leads to a specific photoproduct. Herein, we introduce a two&#8208;color synergistic photochemical reaction system based on a diaryl indenone epoxide (DIO) photoswitch and the cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization of a bridged ring&#8208;strained azobenzene (SA), which respond to ultraviolet (365&#8197;nm) and visible light (430&#8197;nm), respectively, with different rates, forming a well&#8208;defined heterocyclic photoadduct, DIOSA, that we structurally confirm via single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). To quantitatively capture the effectiveness of the dual&#8208;color irradiation as a function of the reaction conditions such as light intensity and starting material ratio as a function of product yield, we introduce a parameter, the photochemical synergistic ratio

         <title>Rectifying Heterointerface Facilitated C&#8722;N Coupling Dynamics Enables Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis Under Ultralow Potentials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ electroreduction obtained Cu/Cu2O Mott&#8211;Schottky catalyst with rectifying heterointerfaces modulates the adsorption behavior of *CO intermediate to enhance its combination with *NOH for subsequent C&#8722;N coupling dynamics, which achieves a novel and advanced pathway for C&#8722;N coupling, resulting in the outstanding Faradaic efficiency and substantial yields across a broad range of ultralow applied potentials.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling for urea synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional Bosch&#8208;Meiser method. However, the complexity of intermediates in co&#8208;reduction hampers simultaneous improvement in urea yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, we developed a Cu/Cu2O Mott&#8211;Schottky catalyst with nanoscale rectifying heterointerfaces through precise controllable in situ electroreduction of Cu2O nanowires, achieving notable FE (32.6&#8211;47.0&#8201;%) and substantial yields (6.08&#8211;30.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2) across a broad range of ultralow applied potentials (0 to &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE). Operando synchrotron radiation&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SR&#8208;FTIR) confirmed the formation of *CO intermediates and C&#8722;N bonds, subsequently density functional theory (DFT) calculations deciphered that the Cu/Cu2O rectifying heterointerface modulated *CO adsorption, significantly enhancing subsequent C&#8722;N coupling dynamics between *CO and *NOH intermediates. This work not only provides a groundbreaking and advanced pathway for C&#8722;N coupling, but also offers deep insights into copper&#8208;based heterointerface catalysts for urea synthesis.

         <title>Inhibiting Ion Migration and Stabilizing Crystal&#8208;Phase in Halide Perovskite via Directly Incorporated Fluoride Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride anion (F&#8722;) with extremely high electronegativity was directly inserted in lead halide perovskite lattice by overcoming the insolubility of PbF2 via the introduced pyridinium halide as a novel volatile solubilizing ligand, which strongly suppressed ion migration and stabilized crystal&#8208;phase, leading to an advantageous device performance and operational stability.







Abstract
Fluoride anion (F&#8722;) with extremely high electronegativity has been under intensive investigation in perovskite solar cells due to its remarkable defect suppression and great improvement of device performance. Nevertheless, these researches only focus on the surface, grain boundaries, or interface modification, the direct insertion of F&#8722; into the crystal lattice of regular lead halide perovskite films is still unrevealed. Herein, F&#8722; was successfully incorporated into the perovskite lattice by overcoming the insolubility of PbF2 via the introduced pyridinium halide as a novel volatile solubilizing ligand. The strong electronegativity of F&#8722; can strongly increase the binding energy of all the ions in CsPbI2Br and inhibit their defect formations. A trace amount of F&#8722; incorporation not only enhanced the optoelectronic properties but also effectively mitigated the ion migration and phase separation simultaneously. The photovoltaic performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells were significantly improved with a champion efficiency of 17.78&#8201;% (38.01&#8201;%) under AM 1.5G (1000 lux indoor light). Moreover, F&#8722; can also be directly inserted into the hybrid perovskite lattice and greatly stabilized crystal&#8208;phase, enabling efficient fully MA&#8208;free FAPbI3 devices with 25.10&#8201;% efficiency. Our strategy sheds light on F&#8208;containing perovskites and provides a promising way to tackle ion migration and stabilize the crystal phase in halide perovskites.

         <title>Constructing Targeted Strong Nb4d&#8722;O2p&#8722;Li2s Configurations to Obtain Excellent Energy Density and Long Life for Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel micro&#8208;nano cathode material is constructed by using niobium pentoxide as an inducer, in which the strong Nb4d&#8722;O2p&#8722;Li2s bonds are formed in the C2/m and the refined primary particles are stacked radially. As a result, the modified cathode material exhibits excellent electrochemical properties.







Abstract
The Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials (LMRs) deliver excellent energy density and exhibit low cost, which are considered as the most promising cathode materials for the next generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the irreversible redox reaction of the oxygen atoms directly leads to release oxygen and intensifies phase transformation. Besides, the local stress and strain will be generated due to the unit&#8208;cell volume difference between R&#8208;3m and C2/m phases, which continuously aggravates the collapse of secondary particles. Herein, the strong Nb4d&#8722;O2p&#8722;Li2s configurations at the Li1 sites of the TM&#8208;layer in the C2/m phase and secondary particles with the radial arrangement of refined primary particles are designed to inhibit oxygen release and relieve lattice stress by Nb2O5 treatment. Meanwhile, the preferential growth of the active {010} planes is presented to obtain an excellent transmission rate of Li+. As a result, the designed LMR delivers remarkable electrochemical properties with high discharge capacity and initial coulomb efficiency of 276&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 85&#8201;% at 0.1&#8197;C, outstanding cycling retention rate of 81&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles. This novel crystal structure combining oxygen coordination regulation and micro&#8208;nano scale design provides inspiration for the design of high&#8208;performance LMRs.

         <title>Multimodal Molecular Motion in the Rotaxanes and Catenanes Incorporating Flexible Calix[n]phyrin Stations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of [2]rotaxanes stoppered with dipyrromethane has opened a route to rotaxanes and catenanes incorporating calix[4]phyrin units. A new type of molecular motion, termed fluttering, has been observed and simple chemical transformations such as methylation and (de)protonation of the [3]rotaxane and [2]catenane enables controllable transformations within the conformationally flexible mechanically interlocked compounds.







Abstract
The synthesis of [2]rotaxanes stoppered with one or two dipyrromethane groups has opened a route for the construction of mechanically interlocked molecules incorporating various porphyrinoid stations. The exploitation of those precursors allowed the creation of [3]rotaxanes and [2]catenanes based on the calix[4]phyrin motif, presenting intriguing molecular dynamics. The intrinsic flexibility of the porphyrinoid allowed the introduction of a new type of molecular motion within the rotaxanes, termed fluttering. The latter involved a bending of the axle, interconverting two angular&#8208;shaped stereoisomers of the rotaxane through a planarised transition state. Simple chemical transformations, i.e. methylation and (de)protonation of the [3]rotaxane and [2]catenane allowed controllable transformations within the conformationally flexible calix[4]phyrin&#8208;incorporated mechanically interlocked porphyrinoids.

         <title>A&#8208;Site Engineering with Thiophene&#8208;Based Ammonium for High&#8208;Efficiency 2D/3D Tin Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Thiophene&#8208;based cations are introduced in tin halide perovskites to form 2D/3D heterojunctions, in which 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (3&#8208;TEA) leads to the most compact crystal packing of [SnI6]4&#8722; octahedral layers with the lowest hole effective mass and formation energy in the resultant 2D phase. This effect facilitates charge transfer in the tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells and improves the device efficiency and stability.







Abstract
Tin halide perovskites are the most promising candidate materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) thanks to their low toxicity and ideal band gap energies. The introduction of 2D/3D mixed perovskite phases in tin&#8208;based PSCs (TPSCs) has proven to be the most effective approach to improving device efficiency and stability. However, a 2D perovskite phase normally shows relatively low carrier mobility, which will be unfavorable for carrier transfer in the devices. In this work, we used a thiophene&#8208;based cation 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (3&#8208;TEA) as a spacer to form a novel 2D perovskite phase in TPSCs, which shows the most promising effect on the performance enhancement in comparison with other cations like 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (2&#8208;TEA) and benzene&#8208;based 2&#8208;phenylethan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium (PEA). Theoretical calculations reveal that 3&#8208;TEA enables the most compact crystal packing of [SnI6]4&#8722; octahedral layers, resulting in the lowest hole effective mass and formation energy in the 2D phase. This effect significantly enhances device efficiency and stability by facilitating more efficient carrier transfer within the 2D phase. These findings indicate that thiophene&#8208;based 2D perovskites are well&#8208;suited for high&#8208;performance TPSCs.

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Oxidation of 5&#8208;Methylcytosine in DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a photocatalytic method to selectively oxidise 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mC) to 5&#8208;formylcytosine under mild, aqueous conditions. At the single&#8208;nucleotide level, this C&#8722;H oxidation is highly selective for 5mC while leaving T and G intact. At the oligonucleotide level, some off&#8208;target oxidation was observed. Base&#8208;resolution proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept sequencing of 5mC was demonstrated on a synthetic oligonucleotide.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;H activation on complex biological macromolecules is a key goal in the field of organic chemistry. It requires thermodynamically challenging chemical transformations to be delivered under mild, aqueous conditions. 5&#8208;Methylcytosine (5mC) is a fundamentally important epigenetic modification in DNA that has major implications for biology and has emerged as a vital biomarker. Selective functionalisation of 5mC would enable new chemical approaches to tag, detect and map DNA methylation to enhance the study and exploitation of this epigenetic feature. We demonstrate the first example of direct and selective chemical oxidation of 5mC to 5&#8208;formylcytosine (5fC) in DNA, employing a photocatalytic system. This transformation was used to selectively tag 5mC. We also provide proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for deploying this chemistry for single&#8208;base resolution sequencing of 5mC and genetic bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T) in DNA on a next&#8208;generation sequencing system. This work exemplifies how photocatalysis has the potential to transform the analysis of DNA.

         <title>High&#8208;Selectivity Tandem Photocatalytic Methanation of CO2 by Lacunary Polyoxometalates&#8208;Stabilized *CO Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating saturated and lacunary phosphotungstates (PWx, x=9,11,12) with g&#8208;C3N4 tailors the CO2 reduction pathway to yield CH4 with high yield and selectivity. As the lacuna increases, PWx acquires less photogenerated electrons to capture and activate *CO, leading to higher CH4 yield and selectivity. PW9/g&#8208;C3N4 exhibits a superior CH4 selectivity of 80&#8201;% and an outstanding evolution rate of 40.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Stabilizing specific intermediates to produce CH4 remains a main challenge in solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Herein, g&#8208;C3N4 is modified with saturated and lacunary phosphotungstates (PWx, x=12, 11, 9) to tailor the CO2 reduction pathway to yield CH4 in high selectivity. Increased lacuna of phosphotungstates leads to higher CH4 yield and selectivity, with a superior CH4 selectivity of 80&#8201;% and 40.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 evolution rate for PW9/g&#8208;C3N4. Conversely, g&#8208;C3N4 and PWx alone show negligible CH4 production. The conversion of CO2 to CH4 follows a tandem catalytic process. CO2 is initially activated on g&#8208;C3N4 to form *CO intermediates, meanwhile photogenerated electrons derived from g&#8208;C3N4 transfer to PWx. Then the reduced PWx captures *CO, which is subsquently hydrogenated to CH4. With the injection of two photogenerated electrons, PW9 is capable of adsorbing and activating *CO. However, the reduced PW12 and PW11 are incapable of adsorbing *CO due to the small energy of occupied molecular orbitals, which is the reason for the poorer activity of PWx/g&#8208;C3N4 (x=12, 11) compared with that of PW9/g&#8208;C3N4. This work provides new insights to regulate highly selective CO2 photoreduction to CH4 by utilizing lacuna of polyoxometalates to enhance the interaction of metals in polyoxometalates with key intermediates.

         <title>The Photodynamic Agent Designed by Involvement of Hydrogen Atom Transfer for Enhancing Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

We report a design strategy for Type&#8208;I photosensitizers (PSs) involving hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to enhance photodynamic therapy. As proof of concept, a HAT&#8208;based Type&#8208;I PS was developed, which produces carbon&#8208;centered radicals to oxidize NADH and generates superoxide radicals under light&#8208;irradiation. This PS exhibits strong photocytotoxicity under hypoxic conditions and excellent in vivo antitumor efficacy in HeLa tumor&#8208;bearing mice.







Abstract
Although Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy has attracted increasingly growing interest due to its reduced dependence on oxygen, the design of effective Type&#8208;I photosensitizers remains a challenge. In this work, we report a design strategy for Type&#8208;I photosensitizers by the involvement of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). As a proof of concept, a HAT&#8208;involved Type&#8208;I PS, which simultaneously generates superoxide and carbon&#8208;centered radicals under light&#8208;irradiation, was synthesized. This photosensitizer is comprised of a fluorene&#8208;substituted BODIPY unit as an electron acceptor covalently linked with a triphenylamine moiety as an electron donor. Under light&#8208;irradiation, photo&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer occurs to generate the BODIPY anion radical and triphenylamine cation radical. The former transfers electrons to oxygen to generate O2&#8722;&#8901;, while the latter loses a proton to produce a benzyl carbon&#8208;centered radical which is well characterized. The resulting carbon&#8208;centered radicals efficiently oxidize NADH by HAT reaction. This photosensitizer demonstrates remarkable photocytotoxicity even under hypoxic conditions, along with outstanding in vivo antitumor efficacy in mouse models bearing HeLa tumors. This work offers a novel strategy for the design of Type&#8208;I photosensitizers by involvement of HAT.

The control of enantioselectivity in radical cation reactions presents long&#8208;standing challenges. Here, we described a novel strategy of asymmetric counteranion&#8208;directed electrocatalysis to solve the enantioselectivity in radical cation chemistry. Examples of asymmetrical dehydrogenative indole&#8208;phenol [3+2] coupling and an atroposelective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H coupling reactions with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities demonstrated the great success of this strategy.







Abstract
The control of enantioselectivity in radical cation reactions presents long&#8208;standing challenges, despite a few successful examples. We introduce a novel strategy of asymmetric counteranion&#8208;directed electrocatalysis to address enantioselectivity in radical cation chemistry. This concept has been successfully demonstrated in two reactions: an asymmetric dehydrogenative indole&#8208;phenol [3+2] coupling and an atroposelective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H dehydrogenative coupling. These reactions have enabled the synthesis of benzofuroindolines and C&#8722;N axially chiral indoles with high yields and excellent enantiomeric excesses. Detailed mechanistic studies confirmed a radical&#8208;radical coupling mechanism. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the indole radical cation as the pivotal intermediate, rather than a neutral indolyl radical, shedding new light on the underlying processes driving these reactions.

         <title>Nonconventional Fluorescent Non&#8208;Isocyanate Polyurethane Foams for Multipurpose Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isocyanate&#8208;free polyurethane foams prepared by the facile, upscalable water&#8208;induced self&#8208;foaming technology present a nonconventional fluorescent behaviour with a multicolor emission. This clusteroluminescence is exploited for sensing and quantifying gaseous formaldehyde (an emblematic indoor air pollutant), metal ions (Fe2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+) and antibiotics.







Abstract
Fluorescent foams with interconnected pores are attractive for the detection and quantification of various products. However, many fluorescent probes are suffering from aggregation&#8208;caused fluorescence quenching in their solid/aggregated state, are costly, and/or not straightforward to incorporate in foams, limiting their utility for this application. Herein, non&#8208;isocyanate polyurethane foams, prepared by the simple water&#8208;induced self&#8208;blowing process, present a nonconventional fluorescence behaviour, i.e. they are intrinsically fluorescent with a multicolor emission without requiring ex situ traditional fluorescent probes. These foams demonstrate utility for capturing&#8208;sensing gaseous formaldehyde (an emblematic indoor air pollutant), as well as for detecting and quantifying various metal ions (Fe2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Hg2+). They are also able to selectively sense tetracycline antibiotic in a ratiometric way with a high sensitivity. By exploiting the unique multicolor photoluminescent foam properties, a smartphone&#8208;compatible device is used for the facile antibiotic quantification. This nonconventional fluorescence behaviour is discussed experimentally and theoretically, and is mainly based on clusteroluminescence originating from multiple hydrogen bonding and hetero&#8208;atomic sub&#8208;luminophores, thus from aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens that are naturally present in the foams. This work illustrates that easily accessible non&#8208;conventional fluorescent NIPU foams characterized by a modular emission wavelength have an enormous potential for multiple substrates detection and quantification.

         <title>Electronic Response and Charge Inversion at Polarized Gold Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new first&#8208;principles&#8208;based simulation method to model the electrified metal&#8208;electrolyte interface has been developed and applied to both Au(100) and Au(111) surfaces in NaCl solution. It reveals that the electronic response of Au electrode contributes significantly to the experimental reported high capacitance and the unexpected instantaneous adsorption of Cl ions at anodic polarized Au (100) (instead at PZC) can lead to a charge inversion.







Abstract
We have studied polarized Au(100) and Au(111) electrodes immersed in electrolyte solution by implementing finite&#8208;field methods in density functional theory&#8208;based molecular dynamics simulations. This allows us to directly compute the Helmholtz capacitance of electric double layer by including both electronic and ionic degrees of freedom, and the results turn out to be in excellent agreement with experiments. It is found that the electronic response of Au electrode makes a crucial contribution to the high Helmholtz capacitance and the instantaneous adsorption of Cl can lead to a charge inversion on the anodic polarized Au(100) surface. These findings point out ways to improve popular semi&#8208;classical models for simulating electrified solid&#8211;liquid interfaces and to identify the nature of surface charges therein which are difficult to access in experiments.

         <title>Intermolecular Anionic Mixed&#8208;Valence and &#960;&#8208;Dimer Complexes of ortho&#8208;Pentannulated Bisazacoronene Diimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical reduction of ortho&#8208;pentannulated bisazacoronene diimides in a non&#8208;aqueous solvent has led to the serendipitous discovery of intermolecular anionic mixed&#8208;valence and &#960;&#8208;dimer species. The observation of this phenomenon provides insights into the fundamental behaviour of supramolecular organic semiconductors, thereby paving the way for the development of novel electronic devices and electron&#8208;deficient materials.







Abstract
This study reports the serendipitous discovery of intermolecular anionic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) and &#960;&#8208;dimer species in ortho&#8208;pentannulated BisAzaCoroneneDiimides (BACDs) during their electrochemical reduction in a non&#8208;aqueous solvent. A library of nitrogen&#8208;containing extended PDIs was synthesized via an aza&#8208;benzannulation reaction followed by a Pd&#8208;catalysed ortho&#8208;pentannulation reaction. Ortho&#8208;pentannulated BACDs revealed strong aggregation abilities in solution. Concentration&#8208;dependent UV/Vis absorption spectra, variable temperature 1H NMR experiments, and atomic force microscopy coupled to molecular dynamics support their self&#8208;assembly into columnar aggregates. Cyclic voltammetry experiments in dichloromethane reveal prominent splitting of the first reduction wave, attributed to the formation of unprecedented intermolecular anionic MV and &#960;&#8208;dimers in organic solvent. These species were thoroughly characterized by real&#8208;time spectroelectrochemistry, electrochemical simulations and theoretical calculations. Remarkably, this work underscores the tuneable nature of AzaBenzannulatedPerylene Diimides (AzaBPDIs) and BACDs, emphasizing their potential as a promising scaffold for designing supramolecular materials with long&#8208;range radical anion delocalization. The observation of this phenomenon provides insights into the fundamental behaviour of supramolecular organic semiconductors, thereby paving the way for the development of novel electronic devices and electron&#8208;deficient materials.

         <title>Spontaneous Formation of Polymeric Nanoribbons in Water Driven by &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

Diving into the nanoscale! We present a simple method to obtain polymeric nanoribbons in water using a tailored perylene diimide as a supramolecular structure directing unit. We study their formation over time and their temperature sensitivity.







Abstract
A simple method was developed to produce polymeric nanoribbons and other nanostructures in water. This approach incorporates a perylene diimide (PDI) functionalized by triethylene glycol (TEG) as a hydrophobic supramolecular structure directing unit (SSDU) into the core of hydrophilic poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAc) chains using RAFT polymerization. All PDI&#8208;functional polymers dissolved spontaneously in water, forming different nanostructures depending on the degree of polymerization (DPn): nanoribbons and nanocylinders for DPn=14 and 22, and spheres for DPn&gt;50 as determined by cryo&#8208;TEM and SAXS analyses. UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy was used to monitor the evolution of the PDI absorption signal upon dissolution. In solid form, all polymers show a H&#8208;aggregate absorption signature, but upon dissolution in water, the shortest DPn forming nanoribbons evolved to show HJ&#8208;aggregate absorption signals. Over time, the J&#8208;aggregate band increased in intensity, while cryo&#8208;TEM monitoring evidenced an increase in the nanoribbon's width. Heating the nanoribbons above 60&#8201;&#176;C, triggered a morphological transition from nanoribbons to nanocylinders, due to the disappearance of J&#8208;aggregates, while H&#8208;aggregates were maintained. The study shows that the TEG&#8208;PDI is a powerful SSDU to promote 2D or 1D self&#8208;assembly of polymers depending on DPn through simple dissolution in water.

         <title>Light&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Controlled Hybridization, Chiral Induction and Handedness of Helical Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the single or multiple helical state as well as the chirality of helical foldamers is currently in the limelight. In this context, this work demonstrates to which extent grafting a photo&#8208;responsive unidirectional motor on foldamer skeletons is relevant to tackle these challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this work constitutes the first example of photoswitchable handedness of foldamer&#8208;based double helices.

Helical foldamers have attracted much attention over the last decades given their resemblance to certain biomacromolecules and their potential in domains as different as pharmaceutics, catalysis and photonics. Various research groups have successfully controlled the right&#8208; or left&#8208; handedness of these oligomers by introducing stereogenic centers through covalent or non&#8208;covalent chemistry. However, developing helical structures whose handedness can be reversibly switched remains a major challenge for chemists. To date, such an achievement has been reported with light&#8208;responsive single&#8208;stranded foldamers only. Herein, we demonstrate that grafting a unidirectional motor onto foldamer strands constitutes a relevant strategy to i) control the single or double helical state of a foldamer, ii) switch on the chiral induction process from the motor to the helical strands and iii) select the handedness of double helical structures through photochemical and thermal stimulations.

&lt;p&gt;Controlling the single or multiple helical state as well as the chirality of helical foldamers is currently in the limelight. In this context, this work demonstrates to which extent grafting a photo-responsive unidirectional motor on foldamer skeletons is relevant to tackle these challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this work constitutes the first example of photoswitchable handedness of foldamer-based double helices.

&lt;p&gt;Helical foldamers have attracted much attention over the last decades given their resemblance to certain biomacromolecules and their potential in domains as different as pharmaceutics, catalysis and photonics. Various research groups have successfully controlled the right- or left- handedness of these oligomers by introducing stereogenic centers through covalent or non-covalent chemistry. However, developing helical structures whose handedness can be reversibly switched remains a major challenge for chemists.

         <title>Molecular Photoswitching Unlocks Glucose Oxidase for Synergistically Reinforcing Fenton Reactions for Antitumor Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe(III)&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based nanoparticles capable of generating strong oxidative stress for eradicating tumors with spatial precision is developed based on the phototriggered cascade enzymatic reaction&#8208;Fenton reaction. The photoswitching of spiropyran (SP) unlocks the enzymatic activity of glucose oxidase (GOx) and light triggers Fe(III)&#8208;to&#8208;Fe(II) photoreduction, which jointly reinforce Fenton reactions by providing the triple enabling factors therein.







Abstract
We have developed a new type of nanoparticles with potent antitumor activity photoactivatable via the combination of molecular photoswitching of spiropyran (SP) and enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidase (GOx). As two key processes involved therein, Fe(III)&#8208;to&#8208;Fe(II) photoreduction in Fe(III) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) brings about the release of free Fe2+/Fe3+ while the photoswitching of SP to merocyanine (MC) unlocks the enzymatic activity of GOx that was pre&#8208;passivated by SP. The release of free Fe3+ boosts its hydrolysis and therefore enables the acidification of microenvironment, which is further reinforced by one of the products of the GOx&#8208;mediated glucose oxidation reaction, gluconic acid (GlcA). Based on the generation of Fe2+ and acidic milieu together with another product of the oxidation reaction, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), these two processes jointly present triple enabling factors for generating lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) species via Fenton reactions and therefore oxidative stress capable of inhibiting tumor. The antitumor potency of such nanoparticle is verified in tumor&#8208;bearing model mice in vivo, proclaiming its potential as a potent and safe agent based on the unique mechanism of optically manipulating enzyme activity for synergistic antitumor therapeutics with high spatial precision, enhanced efficacy and minimized side effects.

         <title>Selective Activation of Peptide&#8208;Thioester Precursors for Templated Native Chemical Ligations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A traceless multi&#8208;segment templated native chemical ligation (NCL) method is described. Undesired cross&#8208;ligation and cyclization are minimized by selective activation of peptide&#8208;thioester precursors and sequential peptide conjugations. This one&#8208;pot approach, Controlled Activation of Peptides for Templated NCL (CAPTN), is anticipated to expedite the synthesis of valuable proteins that are difficult to access using traditional intramolecular NCL.







Abstract
Chemical protein synthesis enables access to proteins that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain with traditional means such as recombinant expression. Chemoselective ligations provide the ability to join peptide segments prepared by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. While native chemical ligation (NCL) is widely used, it is limited by the need for C&#8208;terminal thioesters with suitable reaction kinetics, properly placed native Cys or thiolated derivatives, and peptide segment solubility at low mM concentrations. Moreover, repetitive purifications to isolate ligated products are often yield&#8208;sapping, hampering efficiency and progress. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Controlled Activation of Peptides for Templated NCL (CAPTN). This traceless multi&#8208;segment templated NCL approach permits the one&#8208;pot synthesis of proteins by harnessing selective thioester activation and orthogonal conjugation chemistries to favor formation of the full&#8208;length ligated product while minimizing side reactions. Importantly, CAPTN provides kinetic enhancements allowing ligations at sterically hindered junctions and low peptide concentrations. Additionally, this one&#8208;pot approach removes the need for intermediate purification. We report the synthesis of two E. coli ribosomal subunits S16 and S17 enabled by the chemical tools described herein. We anticipate that CAPTN will expedite the synthesis of valuable proteins and expand on templated approaches for chemical protein synthesis.

         <title>Promotion of RNF168&#8208;Mediated Nucleosomal H2A Ubiquitylation by Structurally Defined K63&#8208;Polyubiquitylated Linker Histone H1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical strategy termed CAEPL (Cysteine Aminoethylation coupled with Enzymatic Protein Ligation) was developed to prepare K63&#8208;polyubiquitylated linker histone H1, which was used to investigate the PTM crosstalk between H1 ubiquitylation and H2A ubiquitylation by RNF168. It was revealed that K63&#8208;polyubiquitylated H1 can directly promote RNF168 ubiquitylation activity towards H2A by enhancing the affinity between RNF168 and the chromatosome.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of histones with homogeneous modifications is a powerful approach for quantitatively deciphering the functional crosstalk between different post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs). In this study, we developed an expedient site&#8208;specific (poly)ubiquitylation strategy (CAEPL, Cysteine Aminoethylation coupled with Enzymatic Protein Ligation), which integrates the Cys&#8208;aminoethylation reaction with the process of ubiquitin&#8208;activating enzyme UBA1&#8208;assisted native chemical ligation. Using this strategy, we successfully prepared monoubiquitylated and K63&#8208;linked di&#8208; and tri&#8208;ubiquitylated linker histone H1.0 proteins, which were incorporated into individual chromatosomes. Quantitative biochemical analysis of different RNF168 constructs on H1 ubiquitylated chromatosomes with different ubiquitin chain lengths demonstrated that K63&#8208;linked polyubiquitylated H1.0 could directly stimulate RNF168 ubiquitylation activity by enhancing the affinity between RNF168 and the chromatosome. Subsequent cryo&#8208;EM structural analysis of the RNF168/UbcH5c&#8211;Ub/H1.0&#8208;K63&#8208;Ub3 chromatosome complex revealed the potential recruitment orientation between RNF168 UDM1 domain and K63&#8208;linked ubiquitin chain on H1.0. Finally, we explored the impact of H1.0 ubiquitylation on RNF168 activity in the context of asymmetric H1.0&#8211;K63&#8208;Ub3 di&#8208;nucleosome substrate, revealing a comparable stimulation effect of both the inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;nucleosomal crosstalk. Overall, our study highlights the significance of access to structurally defined polyubiquitylated H1.0 by the CAEPL strategy, enabling in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations of in&#8208;trans PTM crosstalk between linker histone H1.0 and core histone H2A ubiquitylation.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Modulated Short&#8208;Chain Cathode for Low&#8208;Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short&#8208;chain molecule cathode is designed by modulating local entropy to enhance low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;S batteries (ASSLSBs). The shortened reaction pathways and mismatched lithiation lattice enhance the reaction kinetics and low&#8208;temperature charge/discharge reversibility. Thus, the designed short&#8208;chain cathode exhibits high cathode utilization (99.4&#8201;%) and excellent low&#8208;temperature reversible capacity (579.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;S batteries (ASSLSBs) due to high theoretical energy density and exceptional safety are highly desirable for electric aircraft. However, as the flight altitude rises, the low&#8208;temperature performance is hampered by inadequate practical capacity. Here, we discover that low&#8208;temperature sulfur utilization is constrained by the multi&#8208;step endothermic conversion reaction.

&lt;p&gt;A short-chain molecule cathode is designed by modulating local entropy to enhance low-temperature electrochemical performance for all-solid-state Li&#8722;S batteries (ASSLSBs). The shortened reaction pathways and mismatched lithiation lattice enhance the reaction kinetics and low-temperature charge/discharge reversibility. Thus, the designed short-chain cathode exhibits high cathode utilization (99.4&#8201;%) and excellent low-temperature reversible capacity (579.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state Li&#8722;S batteries (ASSLSBs) due to high theoretical energy density and exceptional safety are highly desirable for electric aircraft. However, as the flight altitude rises, the low-temperature performance is hampered by inadequate practical capacity. Here, we discover that low-temperature sulfur utilization is constrained by the multi-step endothermic conversion reaction. By introducing multi-chalcogen to modulate the local entropy, a short-chain molecule cathode is designed to shorten the reduction pathways and enhance low-temperature discharge capacity. Furthermore, the mismatched lithiation lattice of the short-chain cathode reduces the decomposition energy barriers, thus enhancing low-temperature charge/discharge reversibility. The designed short-chain cathode exhibits high cathode utilization (99.4&#8201;%) and cycling stability (400 cycles, 92.2&#8201;% retention) at room temperature, as well as delivers excellent discharge capacity (579.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C) and cycling performance (100 cycles, 98.4&#8201;% retention, 394.9&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;1electrode, &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C) at low temperature. This study presents new opportunities to stimulate the development of low-temperature ASSLSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Discovery of Copper(I)&#8208;Iodide Cluster Scintillators for Efficient X&#8208;ray Luminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes a machine learning&#8208;guided approach with fused features to discover superior copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster scintillators, achieving a determination coefficient of 0.88. Copper iodide&#8208;(1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium)2, discovered through this method exhibits radioluminescence that is 56 times higher than PbWO4. It enables detection limits of 19.6&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 in X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 and demonstrating significant potential for dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Developing efficient scintillators with environmentally friendly compositions, adaptable band gaps, and robust chemical stability is crucial for modern X&#8208;ray radiography. While copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster crystals show promise, the vast design space of inorganic cores and organic ligands poses challenges for conventional approaches. In this study, we present machine learning&#8208;guided discovery of copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster scintillators for efficient X&#8208;ray luminescence imaging. Our findings reveal that combining base learning models with fused features enhances model generalization, achieving an impressive determination coefficient of 0.88. By leveraging this approach, we obtain a high&#8208;performance Cu(I)&#8208;I cluster scintillator, named copper iodide&#8208;(1&#8208;Butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium)2, which exhibit radioluminescence 56 times stronger than that of PbWO4, and enables a detection limit for X&#8208;rays of 19.6&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these scintillators by incorporating them as microfillers in the fabrication of flexible composite scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 and demonstrating promising performance for dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Molecular Evidence for the Axial Coordination Effect of Atomic Iodine on Fe&#8208;N4 Sites in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The axial coordination effect of atomic iodine on Fe&#8208;N4 sites in oxygen reduction reaction is deciphered at the molecular scale. The electronic structure of the 3d orbital of Fe centers and the binding of the reactant/intermediate species on active sites are modulated exquisitely by the adequate interactions between Fe&#8208;N4 moiety and axial iodine, which is determined as an important factor for the improved performance.







Abstract
We present a molecular&#8208;scale investigation of the axial coordination effect of atomic iodine on Fe&#8208;N4 sites in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM). A well&#8208;defined model catalytic system with explicit and uniform iodine&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8208;N4 sites was constructed facilely by the self&#8208;assembly of iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc) on an I&#8208;modified Au(111) surface. The electrocatalytic activity of FePc for the ORR shows notable enhancement with axial iodine ligands. The modulation of the electronic structure of Fe sites to evoke a higher spin configuration by axial iodine was evidenced. The interaction strength between oxygen&#8208;containing species and active centers becomes weaker due to the presence of iodine ligands, and the reaction is thermodynamically preferable. Furthermore, the reaction dynamics of FePc on I/Au(111) were explicitly determined via in situ ECSTM potential pulse experiments. In contrast, axial atomic iodine was found inefficacious for improving the activity of Co&#8208;N4 sites, and electron rearrangement was found to be marginal, demonstrating that adequate interactions between axial ligands and metal sites for optimizing electronic structures and catalytic behaviors are prerequisites for the impactful role of axial ligands.

         <title>Construction of Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks Through a Linker Decomposition Chiral Induction Strategy for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linker decomposition chiral induction (LDCI) strategy was developed to construct chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Even with fully decomposed chiral linkers, the homochirality of the COFs were well preserved. The integrated chiral COF&#8208;based photodetectors showed promising recognition performances toward circularly polarized light detection.







Abstract
Exploring new strategies for construction of chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is of paramount importance yet remains a challenge. Herein, we report the rational design and construction of chiral COFs through a linker decomposition chiral induction (LDCI) strategy. Three pairs of azine&#8208;linked chiral COFs are successfully synthesized by the condensation reactions of C3&#8208;symmetric 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzaldehyde (Tz) with flexible chiral dihydrazide linkers derived from malic acid, aspartic acid and tartaric acid, respectively. Remarkably, upon complete or partial decomposition from flexible chiral dihydrazides to hydrazine during COF synthesis, the homochirality of these COFs, originating from the single&#8208;handedness conformation of propeller&#8208;like Tz cores, is well preserved. Such a stereoselective chiral memory realized via the LDCI strategy is confirmed by time&#8208;dependent powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) and diffuse reflectance circular dichroism (DRCD). Moreover, the resultant azine&#8208;linked chiral COFs are used as the active materials to fabricate photodetectors to directly distinguish circularly polarized light (CPL), showing impressive recognition performances on the identification of left&#8208;handed circularly (LHC) and right&#8208;handed circularly (RHC) polarized lights. Notably, the residual undecomposed flexible chiral linkers within the COFs are found to be conducive to improving the polarization discrimination ratio. This work highlights LDCI as a new and effective strategy for constructing homochiral COFs with promising future in chiral optical application.

         <dc:description>
An efficient anion exchange membrane (AEM) and judicious choices of ionomers, catalyst, and porous transport layer enable an AEM water electrolysizer (AEMWE) to operate at an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2.3&#8197;V. The optimized AEMWE demonstrates an operational lifetime of more than 800&#8197;hours, a 5&#8208;order magnetite improvement over a benchmark.







Abstract
Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is a potentially cost&#8208;effective technology for green hydrogen production. Although the normal current densities of AEMWEs are below 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, operating them at higher current densities represents an efficient, but little&#8208;explored approach to decrease the total cost of hydrogen production. We show here that a benchmark AEMWE has an operational lifetime of only seconds at an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. By using a more conductive and robust AEM, and judicious choices of ionomers, catalyst, and porous transport layer, we have developed AEMWEs that stably operate at 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with extended lifetimes. The optimized AEMWE has an operational lifetime of more than 800&#8197;hours, a 5&#8208;order magnetite improvement over the current benchmark. The cell voltage is only 2.3&#8197;V at 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, comparable to those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices operating at current densities lower than 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the potential of ultrahigh current density AEMWEs.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient anion exchange membrane (AEM) and judicious choices of ionomers, catalyst, and porous transport layer enable an AEM water electrolysizer (AEMWE) to operate at an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 2.3&#8197;V.

         <title>Oriented Titanium&#8208;MOF Membrane for Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through precise orientation control, b&#8208;oriented MIP&#8208;177&#8208;LT membranes exhibit superior performances towards hydrogen purification relying on the 0.3&#8197;nm&#8208;sized window aligned vertical to the substrate. At the same time, due to the synergistic effect of 1&#8197;nm&#8208;sized MOF channel, this spectacular selectivity is combined with a high H2 permeability.







Abstract
Precise hydrogen sorting from purge gas (H2/N2) and coke gas (H2/CH4), commonly carried out by cryogenic distillation, still suffers from low separation efficiency, high energy consumption, and considerable capital cost. Though still in its infancy, membrane technology offers a potential to achieve more efficient hydrogen purification. In this study, an optimum separation of hydrogen towards both methane and nitrogen via a kinetically&#8208;driven mechanism is realized through preferred orientation control of a MOF membrane. Relying on the 0.3&#8197;nm&#8208;sized window aligned vertical to the substrate, b&#8208;oriented Ti&#8208;MOF membrane exhibits ultra&#8208;high hydrogen selectivity, surpassing the upper bound limit of separating H2/N2 and H2/CH4 gas pairs attained so far by inorganic membranes. This spectacular selectivity is combined with a high H2 permeability owing to the synergistic effect of the 1&#8197;nm&#8208;sized MOF channel.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Electrochemical Skeletal Rearrangement of Non&#8208;Biased Alkyl Cyclopropanes/Butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven reactions represent a powerful strategy to access a diverse array of chemical scaffolds. The direct activation of alkyl non&#8208;biased cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes through electrochemical oxidation facilitates the formation of a wide range of oxazoline and oxazine derivatives, offering crucial insights into the oxidation of small cycloalkane rings.







Abstract
Capitalizing the inherent strain energy within molecules, strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven reactions have been widely employed in organic synthesis. Small cycloalkanes like cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes, with their moderate ring strain, typically require dense functionalization to induce bias or distal activation of (hetero) aromatic rings via single&#8208;electron oxidation for relieving the tension. In this study, we present a pioneering direct activation of alkyl cyclopropanes/butanes through electrochemical oxidation. This approach not only showcases the potential for ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropane/butane under electrochemical conditions but also streamlines the synthesis of diverse oxazolines and oxazines. The applicability of our method is exemplified by its broad substrate scopes. Notably, the products derived from cyclobutanes undergo a formal ring contraction to cyclopropanes, introducing an intriguing aspect to our discoveries. These discoveries mark a significant advancement in strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven skeletal rearrangement reactions of moderately strained rings, offering sustainable and efficient synthetic pathways for future endeavours.

         <title>MXene Triggered Free Radical Polymerization in Minutes Toward All&#8208;Printed Zn&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal, scalable, fast yet controllable polymerization approach to quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes enabled by the unique MXene triggering chemistry is proposed. The seamless electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface originated from the thorough infiltration of low&#8208;viscosity precursors in the electrode percolative network, followed by the rapid polymerization, allows all&#8208;printing of energy storage devices beyond zinc&#8208;in hybrid capacitors.







Abstract
Additive manufacturing of (quasi&#8722;) solid&#8208;state (QSS) electrochemical energy storage devices (EES) highlights the significance of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) design. Creating well&#8208;bonded electrode&#8208;GPEs interfaces in the electrode percolative network via printing leads to large&#8208;scale production of customized EES with boosted electrochemical performance but has proven to be quite challenging. Herein, we report on a versatile, universal and scalable approach to engineer a controllable, seamless electrode&#8208;GPEs interface via free radical polymerization (FRP) triggered by MXene at room temperature. Importantly, MXene reduces the dissociation enthalpy of persulfate initiators and significantly shortens the induction period accelerated by SO4&#8722;, enabling the completion of FRP within minutes. The as&#8208;formed well&#8208;bonded electrode&#8208;GPEs interface homogenizes the electrical and concentration fields (i.e., Zn2+), therefore suppressing the dendrites formation, which translates to long&#8208;term cycling (50,000&#8197;times), high energy density (105.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and power density (9231&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1) coupled with excellent stability upon deformation in the zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (ZHCs). Moreover, the critical switch of the rheological behaviours of the polymer electrolyte (as aqueous inks in still state and become solids once triggered by MXene) perfectly ensures the direct all&#8208;printing of electrodes and GPEs with well&#8208;bonded interface in between, opening vast possibilities for all&#8208;printed QSS EES beyond ZHCs.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Perovskite Quantum Dot Photoresist for Direct Photolithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy is proposed for the direct synthesis of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) photoresist, where the isobornyl acrylate (IBOA) acts as both the solution for the synthesis and dispersion of PQDs and the monomer resin for PQDs photoresist. The application of the PQDs photoresist in direct photolithography is confirmed.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) photoresists are promising building blocks for photolithographically patterned devices. However, their complex synthesis and combination processes limit their optical properties and potential patterning applications. Here, we present an exceptionally simple strategy for the synthesis of PQDs photoresist. Unlike traditional approaches that involve centrifugation, separation, and combination processes, our direct synthesis technique using polymerizable acrylic monomer as solvent to fabricate PQDs photoresists without complex post&#8208;synthesis process. We demonstrate that the change in solubility of the precursors is the main reason for the formation of PQDs in the polymerizable monomer. By direct photolithography, colorful PQD patterns with high photoluminescence quantum yields and high thickness are successfully demonstrated. This work opens a new avenue for the direct synthesis of PQDs photoresist, expanding their applications in various integrated applications, such as photonic, energy harvesting, and optoelectronic devices.

We demonstrate that the change in solubility of the precursors is the main reason for the formation of PQDs in the polymerizable monomer. By direct photolithography, colorful PQD patterns with high photoluminescence quantum yields and high thickness are successfully demonstrated. This work opens a new avenue for the direct synthesis of PQDs photoresist, expanding their applications in various integrated applications, such as photonic, energy harvesting, and optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amplification and Attenuation of Asymmetry via Kinetically Controlled Seed&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we introduce a novel strategy to both amplify and attenuate asymmetry in supramolecular assemblies using a seed&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization strategy under kinetic conditions&#8212;an unprecedented observation in the field.







Abstract
The amplification of asymmetry in supramolecular polymers has recently garnered significant attention. While asymmetry amplification has predominantly been explored under thermodynamic conditions, the kinetic aspect of this process unveils intriguing observations, yet is scarcely reported in the literature. Herein, drawing inspiration from macromolecular systems, we propose a novel strategy for enhancing asymmetry in supramolecular polymers through a seed&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization approach under kinetic conditions, employing a naphthalene diimide&#8208;derived monomer (ANSG) for template&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization, utilizing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and pyrophosphate (PPi) as templates. A chiral seed comprising [ANSG&#8208;ATP]S effectively amplifies the overall supramolecular asymmetry when exposed to a mixture of achiral templates (PPi) and monomers (ANSG), owing to its efficient seeding characteristics under kinetic conditions. As a result of efficient co&#8208;operativity, conversely, employing an achiral seed [ANSG&#8208;PPi]S in a mixture of chiral templates (ATP) and monomers (ANSG) results in the attenuation of asymmetry, highlighting the effective modulation achievable through the seeding approach, an unprecedented observation in the field. Exploiting the efficient aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) of the resultant supramolecular polymers further extends the amplification and attenuation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) as a potential function.

         <title>Rational Design of Diatomic Active Sites for Elucidating Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance Trends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heteronuclear transition&#8208;noble metal DAC (MT&#8208;MN DAC) was synthesized from macrocyclic precursor constrained strategy, of which the OER performance followed in the order of Cu&#8722;MN&lt;Mn&#8722;MN&lt;Fe&#8722;MN&lt;MN&lt;Co&#8722;MN&lt;Ni&#8722;MN. The effect of the MT atoms on the OER performances could possibly originate from the distinct adsorption/desorption behaviors of key intermediates, and the &#916;G*OOH&#8211;&#916;G*OH could be used as the effective performance descriptor.







Abstract
Diatomic catalysts, especially those with heteronuclear active sites, have recently attracted significant attention for their advantages over single&#8208;atom catalysts in reactions with relatively high energy barrier, e.g. oxygen evolution reaction. Rational design and synthesis of heteronuclear diatomic catalysts are of immense significance but have so far been plagued by the lack of a definitive correlation between structure and catalytic properties. Here, we report macrocyclic precursor constrained strategy to fabricate series of transition metal (MT, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, or Cu)&#8208;noble (MN, Ir or Ru) centers in carbon material. One notable performance trend is observed in the order of Cu&#8722;MN&lt;Mn&#8722;MN&lt;Fe&#8722;MN&lt;MN&lt;Co&#8722;MN&lt;Ni&#8722;MN. Meanwhile, the pathway has been not altered, still following the traditional adsorption reaction mechanism. The effect of the MT atoms on the performances could possibly originate from the distinct adsorption/desorption behaviors of key intermediates (i.e. *OH, *O and/or *OOH), strongly implying that &#916;G*OOH&#8211;&#916;G*OH could be used as the performance descriptor. We believe that our work provides useful strategy for synthesis of diatomic active sites with sole coordination configuration and varied composition, and in&#8208;depth insight to their catalytic mechanism, which could be used for further optimization of diatomic catalysts towards oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>Synergize Strong and Reactive Metal&#8208;Support Interactions to Construct Sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm Metal Phosphide Cluster for Enhanced Selective Hydrogenation Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SMSI and RMSI mechanisms are harmoniously integrated to achieve simultaneously stabilize and optimize sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm sites. Owning to the adaptive coordination and electronic structure optimization triggered by the two kinds of MSIs, the obtained Ni2Pn site possessed optimal substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption kinetics and thus greatly enhancing catalytic performance towards the selective hydrogenations.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) are crucial for stabilizing sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm metal sites, e.g. single atom (M1) or cluster (Mn). However, further optimizing sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm sites to break the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off due to excessive interactions remains significant challenges. Accordingly, for the first time, we propose synergizing SMSI with reactive metal&#8208;support interactions (RMSI). Comprehensive characterization confirms that the SMSI stabilizes the metal and regulates the aggregation of Ni1 into Nin site within sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm. Meanwhile, RMSI modulates Nin through sufficiently activating P in the support and eventually generates sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm metal phosphide Ni2P cluster (Ni2Pn). The synergetic metal&#8208;support interactions triggered the adaptive coordination and electronic structure optimization of Ni2Pn, leading to the desired substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption kinetics. Consequently, the activity of Ni2Pn site greatly enhanced towards the selective hydrogenations of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene and alkynyl alcohol. The formation rates of target products are up to 20.2 and 3.0&#8197;times greater than that of Ni1 and Nin site, respectively. This work may open a new direction for metal&#8208;support interactions and promote innovation and application of active sites below 2&#8197;nm.

         <title>Manganese Carbodiimide (MnNCN): A New Heterogeneous Mn Catalyst for the Selective Synthesis of Nitriles from Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MnNCN nanoparticles were first discovered to be robust for the ammoxidation of alcohols into nitriles, while the extensively studied MnOx produced amides under identical conditions. Besides the high activity and selectivity, MnNCN demonstrated wide substrate scope including primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, phenyl substituted aliphatic alcohols, as well as diols.







Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant manganese oxides (MnOx) were competitive candidates when screening catalysts for ammoxidation of alcohols into nitriles due to their redox property. However, over&#8208;oxidation and possible acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of nitriles into amides still limited the application of MnOx in nitrile synthesis. In this work, manganese carbodiimide (MnNCN) was first reported to be robust for the ammoxidation of alcohols into nitriles, avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and the hydrolysis. Besides the high activity and selectivity, MnNCN demonstrated wide substrate scope including the ammoxidation of primary alcohols into nitriles, the oxidative C&#8722;C bonds cleavage and ammoxidation of secondary alcohols, phenyl substituted aliphatic alcohols, and diols into nitriles. Controlled experiments and DFT calculation results revealed that the excellent catalytic performance of MnNCN originated from its high ability in the activation of O2 molecules, and favorable oxidative dehydrogenation of C=N bonds in the aldimine intermediates (RCH=NH) into nitriles, inhibiting the competitive side reaction of the oxidation of aldehydes into carboxylic acids, followed to amide byproducts. Moreover, the hydrolysis of nitriles was also inhibited over MnNCN for its weak acidity as compared with MnOx. This study provided new insights into Mn&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidations as a highly important complement to manganese oxides.

Controlled experiments and DFT calculation results revealed that the excellent catalytic performance of MnNCN originated from its high ability in the activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, and favorable oxidative dehydrogenation of C=N bonds in the aldimine intermediates (RCH=NH) into nitriles, inhibiting the competitive side reaction of the oxidation of aldehydes into carboxylic acids, followed to amide byproducts. Moreover, the hydrolysis of nitriles was also inhibited over MnNCN for its weak acidity as compared with MnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. This study provided new insights into Mn-catalyzed aerobic oxidations as a highly important complement to manganese oxides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating Molecular Motions in Ternary Cocrystals for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the ternary cocrystal composed of tetracyanoquinodimethane as an electron acceptor, triphenylene as an electron acceptor, and pyrene, the latter exhibits rotational motion, resulting in enhanced photothermal ability in the NIR&#8208;II window. The molecular motions are characterized directly by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography. Pyrene also functions as a blocker to protect the organic radical from quenchers such as oxygen and water molecules.







Abstract
Organic photothermal conversion materials hold immense promise for various applications owing to their structural flexibility. Recent research has focused on enhancing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and mitigating radiative transition processes. In this study, we have developed a viable approach to the design of photothermal conversion materials through the construction of ternary organic cocrystals, by introducing a third component as a molecular blocker and motion unit into a binary donor&#8211;acceptor system. Superstructural and photophysical properties of the ternary cocrystals were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. The role of the molecular blocker in radical stabilization and photothermal conversion was demonstrated. Intriguingly, the motions of the entire pyrene molecules in the cocrystal have been observed by the results of variable temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The excellent performance of the ternary cocrystal as a photothermal material was validated through efficient NIR&#8208;II photothermal and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation experiments. The efficiency of water evaporation reached 88.7&#8201;%, with a corresponding evaporation rate of 1.29&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, representing excellent performance among pure organic small molecular photothermal conversion materials. Our research underscores the introduction of molecular blockers and motion units to stabilize radicals and produce outstanding photothermal conversion materials, offering new pathways for developing efficient and stable photothermal conversion materials.

         <title>A Photo&#8208;Switchable Peptide Fibril Esterase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selection of a photo&#8208;switchable amphiphilic peptide catalyst is achieved by screening a small library of isomeric peptides containing light responsive and catalytic groups. The selected peptide shows efficient and enantioselective esterase&#8208;like activity that can be multiple times manipulated by light.







Abstract
Recent attempts to mimic enzyme catalysis using simple, short peptides have been successful in enhancing various reactions, but the on&#8208;demand, temporal or spatial regulation of such processes by external triggers remains a great challenge. Light irradiation is an ideal trigger for regulating molecular functionality, since it can be precisely manipulated in time and space, and because most reaction mediums do not react to light. We herein report the selection of a photo&#8208;switchable amphiphilic peptide catalyst from a small library of isomeric peptides, each containing an azobenzene&#8208;based light responsive group and a catalytic histidine residue. In its native fibrillar form, the selected peptide is efficiently and enantio&#8208;selectively active for ester hydrolysis, but after irradiation by UV light inducing trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis azobenzene isomerization, the fibrils disassemble to amorphous aggregates that are much less catalytically active. Significantly, this esterase&#8208;like activity can be manipulated multiple times, as the fibrillar peptide assembly is reversibly reduced and restored upon alternate irradiation by UV and visible light, respectively. We propose that this research may shine light on the origin of complex functions in early chemical evolution. Furthermore, it paves the way to regulate additional functions for peptide nanotechnology, such as replication, charge transfer, and delivery.

         <title>&#8220;One&#8208;Stone, Two&#8208;Birds&#8221;: Zinc&#8208;Rich Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Precursors for High&#8208;Entropy Zn&#8208;Air Battery Electrocatalysts with Hierarchical Pore Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the low boiling point of Zn, a single&#8208;phase high&#8208;entropy alloy with hierarchical pore structure was obtained by high&#8208;temperature calcination of Zn&#8208;rich precursors. The volatilization of Zn was proven to be crucial for achieving the mesoporous structure and preventing metal agglomeration. This material exhibits high electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction and can be applied in zinc&#8208;air batteries. The research approach and preparation method can be extended to the production of more high&#8208;entropy alloys and various application fields.







Abstract
The active sites of inexpensive transition metal electrocatalysts are sparse and singular, thus high&#8208;entropy alloys composed of non&#8208;precious metals have attracted considerable attention due to their multi&#8208;component synergistic effects. However, the facile synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy composites remains a challenge. Herein, we report a &#8220;one&#8208;stone, two&#8208;birds&#8221; method utilizing zinc (Zn)&#8208;rich metal&#8211;organic frameworks as precursors, by virtue of the low boiling point of Zn (907&#8201;&#176;C) and its high volatility in alloys, high&#8208;entropy alloy carbon nanocomposite with a layered pore structure was ultimately synthesized. The experimental results demonstrate that the volatilization of zinc can prevent metal agglomeration and contribute to the formation of uniformly dispersed high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles at slower pyrolysis and cooling rates. Simultaneously, the volatilization of Zn plays a crucial role in creating the hierarchically porous structure. Compared to the zinc&#8208;free HEA/NC&#8208;1, the HEA/NC&#8208;5 derived from the precursor containing 0.8 Zn exhibit massive micropores and mesopores. The resulting nanocomposites represent a synergistic effect between highly dispersed metal catalytic centers and hierarchical adsorption sites, thus achieving excellent electrocatalytic oxygen reduction performance with low catalyst loading compared to commercial Pt/C. This convenient zinc&#8208;rich precursor method can be extended to the production of more high&#8208;entropy alloys and various application fields.

         <title>Single&#8208;Luminophore Molecular Engineering for Rapidly Phototunable Solid&#8208;State Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;luminophore molecular engineering strategy for rapidly photoregulatable solid&#8208;state luminescence was developed. The key factors of the strategy emphasize the enhanced conformational freedom by the isolated arrangement of ionic persulfurated arenes assisted by weak intermolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction, as well as the facilitated photoexcitation&#8208;induced conformational change of persulfurated arenes.







Abstract
Smart materials enabling emission intensity or wavelength tuning by light stimulus have attracted attention in cutting&#8208;edge fields. However, due to the general limitation of the dense molecular stacking (in solid states, especially in crystals) on photoresponsivity, constructing rapidly phototunable solid&#8208;state luminescent systems remains challenging. Herein, we present a new luminophore that serves as both a photoresponsive and a luminous group with enhanced conformational freedom to attain this goal, namely, relying on photoexcitation&#8208;induced molecular conformational change of an ionized persulfurated arene based on weak intermolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. Together with the phosphorescence characteristic of the molecule itself, rapidly enhanced phosphorescence upon irradiation can be observed in a series of phase states, like solution state, crystal, and amorphous state, especially with a high photoresponsive rate of 0.033&#8197;s&#8722;1 in crystal state that is superior to the relevant reported cases. Moreover, a rapidly phototunable afterglow effect is achieved by extending this molecule into some polymer&#8208;based doping systems, endowing the system with unique dynamic imaging and fast photopatterning capabilities. This single&#8208;luminophore molecular engineering and underlying mechanism have implications for building other condensed functional materials, principally for those with stimuli responses in solid states.

         <title>Mesostructure&#8208;Specific Configuration of *CO Adsorption for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobic ordered CuO mesostructures, specifically mesoporous m&#8208;CuO and cylindrical c&#8208;CuO, were rationally designed by templated routes, which exhibited favored adsorption for *CObridge and *COtop intermediates, respectively. Remarkably, the preferred *CObridge adsorption on the m&#8208;CuO catalyst promoted the selective generation of C2+ alcohols, whereas the *COtop intermediate on the c&#8208;CuO catalysts accelerated CO2 electroreduction to C2H4.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols produced by electrochemical CO2 reduction, such as ethanol and n&#8208;propanol, are considered as indispensable liquid energy carriers. In most C&#8722;C coupling cases, however, the concomitant gaseous C2H4 product results in the low selectivity of C2+ alcohols. Here, we report rational construction of mesostructured CuO electrocatalysts, specifically mesoporous CuO (m&#8208;CuO) and cylindrical CuO (c&#8208;CuO), enables selective distribution of C2+ products. The m&#8208;CuO and c&#8208;CuO show similar selectivity towards total C2+ products (&#8805;76&#8201;%), but the corresponding predominant products are C2+ alcohols (55&#8201;%) and C2H4 (52&#8201;%), respectively. The ordered mesostructure not only induces the surface hydrophobicity, but selectively tailors the adsorption configuration of *CO intermediate: m&#8208;CuO prefers bridged adsorption, whereas c&#8208;CuO favors top adsorption as revealed by in situ spectroscopies. Computational calculations unravel that bridged *CO adsorbate is prone to deep protonation into *OCH3 intermediate, thus accelerating the coupling of *CO and *OCH3 intermediates to generate C2+ alcohols; by contrast, top *CO adsorbate is apt to undergo conventional C&#8722;C coupling process to produce C2H4. This work illustrates selective C2+ products distribution via mesostructure manipulation, and paves a new path into the design of efficient electrocatalysts with tunable adsorption configuration of key intermediates for targeted products.

         <title>Loading Lewis Acid/Base Pair on Metal Nanocluster for Catalytic Ugi Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal nanocluster Au35Cd2(PNP)(SAdm)18Cl with both Lewis acid and Lewis base sites has been synthesized and characterized. It was developed as an efficient catalyst for the Ugi reaction, exhibiting high TOF, mild conditions, broad substrate scope and exceptional catalyst recyclability. Synergistic effect of the Lewis acid/Lewis base pair on the metal nanocluster has been verified as contributing to its high catalytic activity.







Abstract
Constructing structurally robust and catalytically active metal nanoclusters for catalyzing multi&#8208;component reactions is an interesting while challenging task. Inspired by Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysis, we realized the combination of both Lewis acid and Lewis base sites on the surface of a stable gold nanocluster Au35Cd2. The catalytic potential of Au35Cd2 in four&#8208;component Ugi reaction was explored, demonstrating high activity and exceptional recyclability. In&#8208;depth mechanism studies indicate that the catalytic synergy of the Lewis acid/base pair is crucial for the high efficiency of Au35Cd2&#8208;catalyzed Ugi reaction. Bearing the stable structure, multiple activation sites and hierarchical chirality, Au35Cd2 is expected to display further interesting catalytic performance such as asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Perfect Is Perfect: Nickel Prussian Blue Analogue as A High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general solvent exchange induced reconstruction strategy is developed for the synthesis of unusual NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructures as a high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8208;ORR electrocatalyst. The perfect stoichiometric composition with saturated lattice water and {210} dominated facet exposure of NiNi&#8208;PBA collaborately lead to a high 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity of 100&#8201;% and H2O2 yield of 5.7&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are a large family of functional materials with diverse applications such as in electrochemical fields. However, their use in the emerging two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction for clean production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is lagging. Herein, a general solvent exchange induced reconstruction strategy is demonstrated, through which an abnormal NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructure is synthesized as a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for H2O2 generation. The resultant NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructure has a stoichiometric composition with saturated lattice water, and a leaf&#8208;like morphology composed of interconnected small&#8208;size nanosheets with identical orientation and predominate {210} side surface exposure. Our studies show that the Ni&#8722;N centers on {210} facets are the active sites, and the saturated lattice H2O favors a six&#8208;coordinated environment that results in high selectivity. The &#8220;perfect&#8221; structure including stoichiometric composition and ideal facet exposure leads to a high selectivity of ~100&#8201;% and H2O2 yield of 5.7&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, superior to the reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts and most other electrocatalysts.

         <title>The Electron&#8208;Density Distribution of UCl4 and Its Topology from X&#8208;ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discuss the unprecedented sensitivity of X&#8208;ray diffraction to 5&#8201;f electrons in actinide materials. This was made possible by recent advances in the experimental setup as well as data reduction strategy, and, crucially, by comparison with accurate quantum&#8208;mechanical simulations. The electron density of UCl4 crystals has been analysed. Several indicators have been discussed that reveal the participation of 5&#8201;f electrons to chemical bonds.







Abstract
The chemistry of

 electrons in actinide complexes and materials is still poorly understood and represents a serious challenge and opportunity for experiment and theory. The study of the electron density distribution of the ground state of such systems through X&#8208;ray diffraction represents a unique opportunity to quantitatively investigate different chemical bonding interactions at once, but was considered &#8220;almost impossible&#8221; on heavy&#8208;atom systems, until very recently. Here, we present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the electron density distribution in UCl_4 crystals and comparison with the previously reported spin density distribution from polarized neutron diffraction. All approaches provide a consistent picture in terms of electron and spin density distribution, and chemical bond characterization.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Cyclization/Amidation and Amination of 1,6&#8208;Enynes and 1,7&#8208;Enynes</title>

We demonstrate a Ni&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive cyclization/amidation and amination of 1,6&#8208;enynes and 1,7&#8208;enynes using dioxazolones or anthranils as nitrene&#8208;transfer reagents. This mild, modular, and practical protocol provides rapid access to a variety of enantioenriched 2&#8208;pyrrolidone and 2&#8208;piperidone derivatives bearing an aminomethylene group at the 4&#8208;position in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of unsaturated hydrocarbons is an appealing synthetic tool for the construction of high value&#8208;added chiral amines. Despite significant progress in the asymmetric hydroamination of alkenes, allenes, and 1,3&#8208;dienes, asymmetric hydroamination of 1,6&#8208;enynes or 1,7&#8208;enynes remains rather limited due to the enormous challenges in controlling the chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity of the reaction. Herein, we report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive cyclization/amidation and amination of 1,6&#8208;enynes and 1,7&#8208;enynes using dioxazolones or anthranils as nitrene&#8208;transfer reagents. This mild, modular, and practical protocol provides rapid access to a variety of enantioenriched 2&#8208;pyrrolidone and 2&#8208;piperidone derivatives bearing an aminomethylene group at the 4&#8208;position in good yields (up to 83&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (46&#8197;examples, up to 99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that the reaction is initiated by hydronickelation of alkynes followed by migratory insertion into alkenes, rather than by a [2+2+1] oxidative addition process of nickel to alkenes and alkynes.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Photo&#8208;Assisted Phase Switching of Antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;Ferroelectric Orders in an I3&#8722;&#8208;Intercalated 2D Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a new I3&#8722;&#8208;intercalated 2D perovskite antiferroelectric with an ultra&#8208;narrow band gap (~1.65&#8197;eV), of which AFE&#8208;to&#8208;FE phase switching is easily obtained upon visible light, due to the reduction of phase switching barrier caused by light&#8208;sensitive I3&#8722; anion. This work paves a pathway to develop future photoelectroactive materials with potential applications.







Abstract
Antiferroelectric (AFE) has emerged as a promising branch of electroactive materials, due to intriguing physical attributes stemming from the electric field&#8208;induced antipolar&#8208;to&#8208;polar phase transformation. However, the requirement of extremely high electric field strength to switch adjacent sublattice polarization poses great challenges for exploiting new molecular AFE system. Although photoirradiation is striking as a noncontact and nondestructive manipulation tool to optimize physical properties, optical control of antiferroelectricity still remains unexplored. Here, by adopting light&#8208;sensitive I3&#8722; anion into 2D perovskite family, we design a new I3&#8722;&#8208;intercalated molecular AFE of (t&#8208;ACH)2EA2Pb3I10(I3)0.5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;((H3O)(H2O))0.5 (1, t&#8208;ACH=trans&#8208;4&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclohexanecarboxylate, EA=ethylammonium). The I3&#8722;&#8208;intercalating gives an ultra&#8208;narrow band gap of 1.65&#8197;eV with strong absorption. In term of AFE structure, the anti&#8208;parallel alignment of electric dipoles results in a large spontaneous polarization of 4.3&#8197;&#956;C/cm2. Strikingly, 1 merely shows AFE behaviour in the dark even under ultrahigh voltage, while the field&#8208;induced ferroelectric state can be facilely obtained upon visible illumination. Such unprecedented visible&#8208;photo&#8208;assisted phase switching ascribes to the incorporation of photoactive I3&#8722; anions that reduces AFE&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric switching barrier. This pioneering work on the photo&#8208;assisting transformation of ferroic orders paves a way to develop future photoactive materials with potential applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Modulation for Selective Mechanochemical Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical strategy used for the iron&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation of aromatic and aliphatic olefins is developed. This combined catalytic system through the integration of Fe(III)/porphyrin and cyclodextrins under the optimal ball&#8208;milling conditions enables a collaborative oxidation process and provides a wide range of Markovnikov&#8208;selective ketone products with markedly enhanced catalytic efficiency compared to conventional batch procedures.







Abstract
The development of a mechanochemical Fe&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation of olefins with a sustainable and benign procedure holds significant promise for industrial applications. However, navigating the intricate interactions inherent in ball&#8208;milling conditions to fine&#8208;tune reaction selectivity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, leveraging the dispersive and/or trapping properties of cyclodextrins, an innovative mechanochemical approach is developed through the integration of cyclodextrins into a Fe&#8208;catalyzed system, enabling a streamlined Wacker oxidation process from simple and/or commercially available alkenes. Our efforts have yielded optimized mechanochemical conditions demonstrating exceptional reactivity and selectivity in generating a diverse array of ketone products, markedly enhancing catalytic efficiency compared to conventional batch methods. Mechanistic investigations have revealed a predominantly Markovnikov&#8208;selective catalytic cycle, effectively minimizing undesired alcohol formation, hydrogenation, and the other competing pathways, boosting both reaction yield and selectivity.

         <title>Stapled Peptides as Inhibitors of mRNA Deadenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;based design approach led to a stapled peptide that inhibits the deadenylation activity of the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex. The stapled peptide exhibited excellent cell permeability and high binding affinity to the target protein. The peptide was able to stabilize RNA containing poly(A) tail by inhibiting the activity of the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex both in vitro and at the cellular level.







Abstract
Therapeutic intervention targeting mRNA typically aims at reducing the levels of disease&#8208;causing sequences. Achieving the opposite effect of blocking the destruction of beneficial mRNA remains underexplored. The degradation of mRNA starts with the removal of poly(A) tails, reducing their stability and translational activity, which is mainly regulated by the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex. The subunit NOT9 binds various RNA binding proteins, that recruit mRNA in a sequence&#8208;specific manner to the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex to promote their deadenylation. These RNA binding proteins interact with NOT9 through a helical NOT9 binding motif, which we used as a starting point for development of the hydrocarbon stapled peptide NIP&#8208;2. The peptide (KD=60.4&#8197;nM) was able to inhibit RNA&#8208;binding (IC50=333&#8197;nM) as well as the deadenylation activity of the CCR4&#8208;NOT complex in vitro while being cell&#8208;permeable (cell&#8208;permeability EC50=2.44&#8197;&#956;M). A co&#8208;crystal structure of NIP&#8208;2 bound to NOT9 allowed further optimization of the peptide through point mutation leading to NIP&#8208;2&#8208;H27A&#8208;N3 (KD=122&#8197;nM) with high cell permeability (cell&#8208;permeability EC50=0.34&#8197;&#956;M). The optimized peptide was able to inhibit deadenylation of target mRNAs when used in HeLa cells at a concentration of 100&#8197;&#956;M, demonstrating the feasibility of increasing mRNA stability.

         <title>The Key Descriptors for Predicting the Exciton Binding Energy of Organic Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two key descriptors associated with molecular and aggregation properties are identified for predicting the exciton binding energy in solid state and an unprecedented prediction accuracy is achieved from data&#8208;driven machine learning, which will enable fast and precise screening of efficient organic photovoltaic materials with low exciton binding energy.







Abstract
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is a key parameter to determine the mechanism and performance of organic optoelectronic devices. Small Eb benefits to reduce the interfacial energy offset and the energy loss of organic solar cells. However, quantum&#8208;chemical calculations of the Eb in solid state with considering electronic polarization effects are extremely time&#8208;consuming. Furthermore, current studies lack critical descriptors. Here, we use data&#8208;driven machine learning (ML) to accelerate the computation and identify the key descriptors most relevant to the solid&#8208;state Eb. The results verify two key descriptors associated with molecular and aggregation&#8208;state properties for efficient prediction of the solid&#8208;state Eb. Moreover, a very high accuracy is achieved by using the extreme gradient boosting algorithm, with the Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.92. Finally, we use this ML model to predict the Eb of thin films, which is difficult to achieve using the current quantum&#8208;chemical calculations due to the large structural disorder. Remarkably, the predicted thin&#8208;film Eb values are fully consistent with the results of temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra. Therefore, our work provides an accurate and efficient approach to predict the solid&#8208;state Eb and would be helpful to accelerate the exploitation of novel promising organic photovoltaic materials.

         <title>Origin of Enhanced Oxygen Evolution in Restructured Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrooxidation strategy was employed for the controllable reconstruction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOFs), elucidating the functionality of Fe and defect in NiO6 via in situ tracking and theoretical calculations, thereby enhancing metal&#8208;oxygen hybridization and oxygen evolution activity. The anion exchange membrane water electrolysis featuring Ni(Fe) MOF as the anode demonstrates industrial&#8208;level current density and outstanding durability.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), praised for structural flexibility and tunability, are prominent catalyst prototypes for exploring oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Yet, their intricate transformations under OER, especially in industrial high&#8208;current environments, pose significant challenges in accurately elucidating their structure&#8211;activity correlation. Here, we harnessed an electrooxidation process for controllable MOF reconstruction, discovering that Fe doping expedites Ni(Fe) MOF structural evolution, accompanied by the elongation of Ni&#8722;O bonds, monitored by in situ Raman and UV/Visible spectroscopy. Theoretical modeling further reveals that Fe doping and defect&#8208;induced tensile strain in the NiO6 octahedra augments the metal ds&#8208;O p hybridization, optimizing their adsorption behavior and augmenting OER activity. The reconstructed Ni(Fe) MOF, serving as the anode in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, achieves a noteworthy current density of 3300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2.2&#8197;V while maintaining equally stable operation 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 300&#8197;h and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 170&#8197;h. This undertaking elevates our comprehension of OER catalyst reconstruction, furnishing promising avenues for designing highly efficacious catalysts across electrochemical platforms.

         <title>Artificial Electron Channels Enable Contact Prelithiation of Li&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes with Ultrahigh Li&#8208;Source Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Li&#8722;Ag alloy&#8208;based artificial electron channels (AECs) are inserted into the Li source/anode interface for a high&#8208;efficiency contact prelithiation process. The AECs with shielding effect could restrict the dry&#8208;state interfacial corrosion, ensuring unimpeded electron transport throughout the prelithiation. Therefore, the Li source could convert deeply, showcasing a high Li&#8208;source utilization (90.7&#8201;%) and a dead&#8208;Li&#8208;free morphology.







Abstract
Contact prelithiation is widely used to compensate for the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the low utilization of the Li source, which suffers from the deteriorated contact interfaces, results in cycling degeneration. Herein, Li&#8722;Ag alloy&#8208;based artificial electron channels (AECs) are established in Li source/graphite anode contact interfaces to promote Li&#8208;source conversion. Due to the shielding effect of the Li&#8722;Ag alloy (50 at. % Li) on Li&#8208;ion diffusion, the dry&#8208;state interfacial corrosion is restricted. The unblocked electronic conduction across the AEC&#8208;involved interface not only facilitates the Li&#8208;source conversion but also accelerates the prelithiation kinetics during the wet&#8208;state process, resulting in an ultrahigh Li&#8208;source utilization (90.7&#8201;%). Implementing AEC&#8208;assisted prelithiation in a LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cell yields a 35.8&#8201;% increase in energy density and stable cycling over 600 cycles. This finding affords significant insights into the construction of an efficient prelithiation technology for the development of high&#8208;energy LIBs.

         <title>Tuning Reaction Kinetics of Fluorinated Molecules to Construct Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphases on SiOx Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the impact of electrolyte additive decomposition kinetics on SEI properties in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, diethyl fluoromalonate (F1DEM) and diethyl 2,2&#8208;difluoromalonate (F2DEM) were designed and employed in SiOx anodes. The locally polar &#8722;CHF&#8722; group demonstrates superior decomposition kinetics compared to the symmetric &#8722;CF2&lt;M&#8722;&gt; group, quickly forming a LiF&#8208;rich passivation layer on the anode surface during the initial stages of SEI formation, thereby effectively suppressing side reactions.







Abstract
Introducing fluorinated electrolyte additives to construct LiF&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Si&#8208;based anodes is proven an effective strategy for coping with its massive volume changes during cycling. However, most current research on fluorine&#8208;containing additives focuses on their thermodynamics of decomposition, lacking studies on the correlation between the molecular structure of additives and their decomposition kinetics. Herein, two fluorinated ester additives, diethyl fluoromalonate (F1DEM) and diethyl 2,2&#8208;difluoromalonate (F2DEM) were designed and synthesized. Through combining a wealth of characterizations and simulations, it is revealed that despite the similar reduction thermodynamics, the favorable reduction kinetics of single&#8208;fluorinated F1DEM facilitate a LiF&#8208;rich layer during the early stage of SEI formation, contributing to the formation of a more robust SEI on SiOx anode compared to the difluorinated F2DEM. Consequently, the proposed additive achieves excellent cycling stability (84&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000 cycles) for 5&#8197;Ah 21700 cylindrical batteries under practical testing conditions. By unveiling the role of reaction kinetics, a long&#8208;overlooked aspect for the study of electrolyte additives, this work sheds light on how to construct a stable SEI on Si&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Harnessing the Unconventional Cubic Phase in 2D LaNiO3 Perovskite for Highly Efficient Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel microwave shock method has been developed to facilitate the rapid synthesis of 2D LaNiO3 in common hexagonal, unconventional cubic, and trigonal crystal phases, preventing high&#8208;temperature stacking. This groundbreaking approach reveals the superior catalytic activity of the unconventional cubic phase, significantly advancing the phase engineering&#8208;dependent UOR mechanisms in 2D materials.







Abstract
Phase engineering is a critical strategy in electrocatalysis, as it allows for the modulation of electronic, geometric, and chemical properties to directly influence the catalytic performance. Despite its potential, phase engineering remains particularly challenging in thermodynamically stable perovskites, especially in a 2D structure constraint. Herein, we report phase engineering in 2D LaNiO3 perovskite using the strongly non&#8208;equilibrium microwave shock method. This approach enables the synthesis of conventional hexagonal and unconventional trigonal and cubic phases in LaNiO3 by inducing selective phase transitions at designed temperatures, followed by rapid quenching to allow precise phase control while preserving the 2D porous structure. These phase transitions induce structural distortions in the [LaO]+ layers and the hybridization between Ni 3d and O 2p states, modifying local charge distribution and enhancing electron transport during the six&#8208;electron urea oxidation process (UOR). The cubic LaNiO3 offers optimal electron transport and active site accessibility due to its high structural symmetry and open interlayer spacing, resulting in a low onset potential of 1.27&#8197;V and a Tafel slope of 33.1&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 for UOR, outperforming most current catalysts. Our strategy features high designability in phase engineering, enabling various electrocatalysts to harness the power of unconventional phases.

         <title>Rigid Ligand Confined Synthesis of Carbon Supported Dimeric Fe Sites with High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Dimeric Fe sites on carbon blacks (DiFe&#8208;N/CBs) are prepared by a rigid ligand confinement strategy, and shows excellent performance for oxygen reduction reaction. The active site of Fe dimers, which favors the adsorption of OOH* with Yeager&#8208;type binding, is advantageous over single&#8208;atom site in promoting reaction process. DiFe&#8208;N/CBs&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air battery achieves small charge/discharge voltage gaps during charge/discharge test.







Abstract
Dimeric metal sites (DiMSs) in carbon&#8208;based single atom catalysts (SACs) offer distinct advantages in optimizing the adsorption energies of the catalytic intermediates and reaction pathways over single atom sites, which inspires the investigations on the rational design of DiMSs&#8208;based SACs and the accurate discernment of catalytic mechanisms. Here, dimeric Fe sites on carbon blacks (DiFe&#8208;N/CBs) are prepared using the precursor of metal&#8208;organic complex with a controlled structure, and the rigid ligand confinement secures the preservation of dimeric Fe sites during the thermal treatment. DiFe&#8208;N/CBs shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.917&#8197;V, and excellent durability with negligible activity decay. Theoretical studies reveal that the dimeric Fe sites have an optimal adsorption of OOH* with the Yeager&#8208;type binding, illustrating the advantages of DiMSs over SAs in catalyzing ORR. The rechargeable aqueous and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air batteries assembled using DiFe&#8208;N/CBs&#8208;based air cathodes achieve small voltage gaps after long term charge/discharge test, showing great promises for practical applications. This synthetic strategy serves a novel platform to produce a scope of catalysts incorporating multimeric metal sites, and studies on the catalytic mechanism lay the foundation for establishing cooperative effect for multidentate adsorption reactions.

         <title>Diphenylacetylene&#8208;Incorporating Octaphyrin: A Rigid Macrocycle with Readily Separable Conformational Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded porphyrins with diphenylacetylene as a key building block have been prepared. Owing to the rigidity of the resulting macrocycle, conformational isomers can be isolated, unlike known, flexible expanded porphyrins. The irreversible conformational inversion, coupled with the distinct spectral and color features of the isomers, allowed us to fabricate a new accumulated thermal sensor capable of indicating exposure to high temperatures.







Abstract
An expanded carbaporphyrinoid analogue, octaphyrin(2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1), containing two rigid diphenylacetylene moieties is reported. In contrast to traditional pyrrolic macrocycles where flexible conformers coexist in dynamic equilibrium, this macrocycle exists as two separable, conformationally stable stereoisomers, denoted as 1A and 1B. The conformational effect of both conformers, as well as their protonated forms, were thoroughly studied using NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Importantly, heating conformer 1B leads to its irreversible conversion to 1A, whereas in its protonated form, 1A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MSA undergoes irreversible transformation to 1B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MSA at lower temperatures. These temperature&#8208;dependent features establish a foundation for developing new accumulated heat sensors, as demonstrated by the use of the present octaphyrins as a customized thermochromic indicator in steam sterilization. The present study thus underscores how the conformational rigidity of these new polypyrrolic macrocycles imparts properties that are distinct from historically flexible expanded porphyrinoids.

         <title>Reversible Structural Phase Transitions in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Cu(I)&#8208;Based Metal Halides for Dynamically Tunable Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two zero&#8208;dimensional Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides exhibit reversible phase transitions accompanied by a fluorescence shift from cyan to yellow&#8208;orange. Their luminescence and phase transition mechanisms are elucidated by experiments combined with density functional theory calculations. By harnessing their reversible phase transitions, a dynamic tunable multicolor emission anti&#8208;counterfeiting application with high security and unforgeability is demonstrated.







Abstract
Exploring structural phase transitions and luminescence mechanisms in zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halides poses significant challenges, that are crucial for unlocking the full potential of tunable optical properties and diversifying their functional capabilities. Herein, we have designed two inter&#8208;transformable 0D Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides, namely (C19H18P)2CuI3 and (C19H18P)2Cu4I6, through distinct synthesis conditions utilizing identical reactants. Their optical properties and luminescence mechanisms were systematically elucidated by experiments combined with density functional theory calculations. The bright cyan&#8208;fluorescent (C19H18P)2CuI3 with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 77&#8201;% is attributed to the self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. Differently, the broad yellow&#8208;orange fluorescence of (C19H18P)2Cu4I6 displays a remarkable PLQY of 83&#8201;%. Its luminescence mechanism is mainly attributed to the combined effects of metal/halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer and cluster&#8208;centered charge transfer, which effects stem from the strong Cu&#8722;Cu bonding interactions in the (Cu4I6)2&#8722; clusters. Moreover, (C19H18P)2CuI3 and (C19H18P)2Cu4I6 exhibit reversible structural phase transitions. The elucidation of the phase transitions mechanism has paved the way for an unforgeable anti&#8208;counterfeiting system. This system dynamically shifts between cyan and yellow&#8208;orange fluorescence, triggered by the phase transitions, bolstering security and authenticity. This work enriches the luminescence theory of 0D metal halides, offering novel strategies for optical property modulation and fostering optical applications.

         <title>Dye Induced Luminescence Properties of Gold(I) Complexes with near Unity Quantum Efficiency</title>

Improving the glow of gold complexes. Herein, we report a facile synthetic strategy to introduce a dye, namely, 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin, as a ligand to access luminescent gold complexes of different nuclearity. Introduction of the dye enables the isolation of gold complexes with rich photophysical properties such as high emission quantum yields.







Abstract
To study the effect of a dye on the photoluminescence (PL) properties of metal complexes, a series of gold(I) complexes were synthesized, containing a 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin luminophore. The complexes are comprised of a coumarin moiety featuring different ancillary ligands, specifically N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, triphenylphosphine, and diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylphosphine. The synthesized gold(I) complexes are luminescent both in solution and the solid state at room temperature and 77&#8197;K. Complexes of different nuclearity, i.e., mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trinuclear compounds were synthesized. A clear trend between the nuclearity and the quantum yields can be seen. The coumarin dye not only improves the PL properties, but also enhances the luminescence of trinuclear clusters, which are otherwise known to be weak emitters in solution. The optical absorption properties were investigated in detail by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Chiral Helicene&#8208;Indenido ansa&#8208; and Half&#8208;Sandwich Metal Complexes and Their Use in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereocontrolled syntheses of chiral (oxa)helicene&#8208;indenido half&#8208;sandwich (Rh) or ansa&#8208;metallocene (Fe) complexes were developed. The enantio&#8208; and diastereopure half&#8208;sandwich Rh(III) complexes were used as catalysts in enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation to form axially chiral biaryls in up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 er, and an unusual sequence of efficient central&#8208;to&#8208;helical&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer was described.







Abstract
Despite recent tremendous progress in the synthesis of nonplanar chiral aromatics, and helicenes in particular, their conversion to half&#8208;sandwich or sandwich transition metal complexes still lags behind, although they represent an attractive family of modular and underexplored chiral architectures with a potential catalytic use. In this work, starting from various chiral helicene&#8208;indene proligands, we prepared the enantio&#8208; and diastereopure oxa[6]&#8208; and oxa[7]helicene&#8208;indenido half&#8208;sandwich RhI and RhIII complexes and oxa[7]helicene&#8208;bisindenido ansa&#8208;metallocene FeII complex. To document their use, oxahelicene&#8208;indenido half&#8208;sandwich RhIII complexes were employed as chiral catalysts in enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation of benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones to afford a series of axially chiral biaryls in mostly good to high yields and in up to 96&#8201;:&#8201;4 er. Thus, we developed stereocontrolled synthesis of chiral helicene&#8208;indenido ansa&#8208; and half&#8208;sandwich metal complexes, successfully demonstrated the first use of such helicene Cp&#8208;related metal complexes in enantioselective catalysis, and described an unusual sequence of efficient central&#8208;to&#8208;helical&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.

         <title>Mechanochemical &#8220;Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF&#8221; Strategy for Enhancing Gas Adsorption and Separation through Aperture Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of MOF@PCC composites was prepared by linking porous coordination cages (PCCs) onto the surface of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles by mechanochemical reactions. The surface cages optimize the pores of the composites, and polar functional groups interact with gas molecules. The combinations of PCCs and MOFs with aligned aperture sizes give enhanced gas adsorption capacities for binary gas separation and other applications.







Abstract
Post&#8208;modification of porous materials with molecular modulators has emerged as a well&#8208;established strategy for improving gas adsorption and separation. However, a notable challenge lies in maintaining porosity and the limited applicability of the current method. In this study, we employed the mechanochemical &#8220;Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF&#8221; strategy, utilizing porous coordination cages (PCCs) with intrinsic pores and apertures as surface modulators to improve the gas adsorption and separation properties of the parent MOFs. We demonstrated the fast and facile preparation of 28 distinct MOF@PCC composites by combining 7 MOFs with 4 PCCs with varying aperture sizes and exposed functional groups through a mechanochemical reaction in 5 mins. Only the combinations of PCCs and MOFs with closely matched aperture sizes exhibited enhanced gas adsorption and separation performance. Specifically, MOF&#8208;808@PCC&#8208;4 exhibited a significantly increased C2H2 uptake (+64&#8201;%) and a longer CO2/C2H2 separation retention time (+40&#8201;%). MIL&#8208;101@PCC&#8208;4 achieved a substantial C2H2 adsorption capacity of 6.11&#8197;mmol/g. This work not only highlights the broad applicability of the mechanochemical &#8220;Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF&#8221; strategy for the functionalization of a wide range of MOFs but also establishes potential design principles for the development of hybrid porous materials with enhanced gas adsorption and separation capabilities, along with promising applications in catalysis and intracellular delivery.

         <title>Lighting Up Bispyrene&#8208;Functionalized Chiral Molecular Muscles with Switchable Circularly Polarized Excimer Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of both the unique structural and chiral features of molecular [c2]daisy chain, the first circularly polarized luminescence switch based on chiral molecular muscle has been successfully constructed, not only successfully widening the application scopes of molecular muscles, but also providing a promising platform for the construction of novel smart chiral luminescent materials for practical applications.







Abstract
Aiming at the further extension of the application scope of traditional molecular muscles, a novel bispyrene&#8208;functionalized chiral molecular [c2]daisy chain was designed and synthesized. Taking advantage of the unique dimeric interlocked structure of molecular [c2]daisy chain, the resultant chiral molecular muscle emits strong circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) attributed to the pyrene excimer with a high dissymmetry factor (glum) value of 0.010. More importantly, along with the solvent&#8208; or anion&#8208; induced motions of the chiral molecular muscle, the precise regulation of the pyrene stacking within its skeleton results in the switching towards either &#8220;inversed&#8221; state with sign inversion and larger glum values or &#8220;down&#8221; state with maintained handedness and smaller glum values, making it a novel multistate CPL switch. As the first example of chiral molecular muscle&#8208;based CPL switch, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study not only successfully widens the application scopes of molecular muscles, but also provides a promising platform for the construction of novel smart chiral luminescent materials for practical applications.

Violent H2 and O2 bubbling production with rates as high as 4.41 and 2.20&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;gcat.&#8722;1 respectively is achieved in photocatalytic overall splitting of pure H2O in a porous microreactor (PP12). PP12 promotes charge separation and formation of catalytic active sites, thus leading to the greatly enhanced H2 and O2 bubbling productions in PP12. This opens a new way to enhance photocatalytic overall splitting of pure H2O.







Abstract
Photocatalytic overall splitting of pure water (H2O) without sacrificial reagent to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) holds a great potential for achieving carbon neutrality. Herein, by anchoring cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) as cocatalyst and cadmium sulfide (CdS) as light absorber to channel wall of a porous polymer microreactor (PP12), continuous violent H2 and O2 bubbling productions from photocatalytic overall splitting of pure H2O without sacrificial reagent is achieved, with H2 and O2 production rates as high as 4.41 and 2.20&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;gcat.&#8722;1 respectively. These are significantly enhanced than those in the widely used stirred tank&#8208;type reactor in which no O2 is produced and H2 production rate is only 0.004&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;gcat.&#8722;1. Besides improved charge separation and interaction of H2O with photocatalyst in PP12, bonding interaction of Co9S8 with PP12 creates abundant catalytic active sites for simultaneous productions of H2 and O2, thus leading to the significantly enhanced H2 and O2 bubbling productions in PP12. This offers a new strategy to enhance photocatalytic overall splitting of pure H2O without sacrificial reagent.

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells through Solution&#8208;Processed and Structurally Ordered Fullerene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fullerene derivative (BTPC60) has been developed, which inhibits self&#8208;aggregation of C60 cages and promotes the formation of uniform and structurally ordered film. Inverted perovskite solar cells based on solution&#8208;processed BTPC60 delivered an impressive efficiency of 25.3&#8201;% and maintain an efficiency of 24.8&#8201;% even with an electron transporting layer thickness of up to 200&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The electron transporting layer (ETL) used in high performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is typically composed of C60, which requires time&#8208;consuming and costly thermal evaporation deposition, posing a significant challenge for large&#8208;scale production. To address this challenge, herein, we present a novel design of solution&#8208;processible electron transporting material (ETM) by grafting a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor fragment onto C60. The synthesized BTPC60 exhibits an exceptional solution processability and well&#8208;organized molecular stacking pattern, enabling the formation of uniform and structurally ordered film with high electron mobility. When applied as ETL in inverted PSCs, BTPC60 not only exhibits excellent interfacial contact with the perovskite layer, resulting in enhanced electron extraction and transfer efficiency, but also effectively passivates the interfacial defects to suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination. Resultant BTPC60&#8208;based inverted PSCs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.3&#8201;% and retain almost 90&#8201;% of the initial values after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1500&#8197;hours in N2. More encouragingly, the solution&#8208;processed BTPC60 ETL demonstrates remarkable film thickness tolerance, and enables a high PCE up to 24.8&#8201;% with the ETL thickness of 200&#8197;nm. Our results highlight BTPC60 as a promising solution&#8208;processed fullerene&#8208;based ETM, opening an avenue for improving the scalability of efficient and stable inverted PSCs.

         <title>A Dynamically Ion&#8208;Sieved Electrolyte towards Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly conductive and dynamically ion&#8208;sieved electrolyte was developed to simultaneously enhance the Zn metal reversibility and suppress the cathode dissolution of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The experiment characterizations and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the dynamic ion screen is achieved at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which can selectively facilitate the plating/stripping and insertion/extraction process of desolvated/solvated Zn2+ on the anode and cathode surfaces.







Abstract
The practical deployment of Zn&#8208;ion batteries faces challenges such as dendrite growth, side reactions and cathode dissolution in traditional electrolytes. Here, we develop a highly conductive and dynamically ion&#8208;sieved electrolyte to simultaneously enhance the Zn metal reversibility and suppress the cathode dissolution. The dynamic ion screen at the electrode/electrolyte interface is achieved by numerous pyrane rings with a radius of 3.69&#8197;&#197;, which can selectively facilitate the plating/stripping and insertion/extraction process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ and Zn2+ on the anode and cathode surfaces. As a proof of concept, Zn//Zn symmetric cells deliver exceptional cyclic stability for over 6,800&#8197;h and ultrahigh cumulative plated capacity of 1.95&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Zn//Na2Mn3O7 cells exhibit satisfactory cycling performance with capacity retention of 82.7&#8201;% after 4,000&#8197;cycles, and the assembled pouch cells achieve excellent stability and durability. This work provides valuable insights into the development of electrolytes aimed at enhancing the interface stability of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Regulating Intermolecular Interactions and Film Formation Kinetics for Record Efficiency in Difluorobenzothiadizole&#8208;Based Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT)&#8208;based copolymers, PffBT&#8208;2T and PffBT&#8208;4T, were synthesized to assess their impact on device performance. PffBT&#8208;4T demonstrated lower miscibility with L8&#8208;BO, leading to improved phase separation and enhanced molecular packing in the active layer. This optimized morphology, along with a prolonged nucleation and crystal growth process, resulted in a record efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% for ffBT&#8208;based photovoltaic polymers.







Abstract
The difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT) unit is one of the most classic electron&#8208;accepting building blocks used to construct D&#8208;A copolymers for applications in organic solar cells (OSCs). Historically, ffBT&#8208;based polymers have achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in fullerene&#8208;based OSCs owing to their strong temperature&#8208;dependent aggregation (TDA) characteristics. However, their excessive miscibility and rapid aggregation kinetics during film formation have hindered their performance with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Herein, we synthesized two ffBT&#8208;based copolymers, PffBT&#8208;2T and PffBT&#8208;4T, incorporating different &#960;&#8208;bridges to modulate intermolecular interactions and aggregation tendencies. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that PffBT&#8208;4T exhibits reduced electrostatic potential differences and miscibility with L8&#8208;BO compared to PffBT&#8208;2T. This facilitates improved phase separation in the active layer, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Moreover, PffBT&#8208;4T demonstrated a prolonged nucleation and crystal growth process, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Consequently, PffBT&#8208;4T&#8208;based devices achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.5&#8201;%, setting a new record for ffBT&#8208;based photovoltaic polymers. Our findings underscore the importance of conjugate backbone modulation in controlling aggregation behavior and film formation kinetics, providing valuable insights for the design of high&#8208;performance polymer donors in organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Highly Efficient Red/Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence from Doped Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the thionation products of phthalimide into its matrix leads to highly efficient red/near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence with boosted quantum yields of up to ~33&#8201;%. Newly generated emissive clusters and the external heavy atom effect are two key factors to the red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence, while the high efficiency arises from the enhanced exciton generation efficiency and energy transfer process upon doping.







Abstract
Organic red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with low toxicity and facile synthesis are highly sought after, particularly for applications in biotechnology and encryption. However, achieving efficient red/NIR RTP emitters has been challenging due to the weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling of organics and the rapid nonradiative decay imposed by the energy gap law. Here we demonstrate highly efficient red/NIR RTP with boosted quantum yields (&#934;ps) of up to 32.96&#8201;% through doping the thionated derivatives of phthalimide (PAI) (MTPAI and DTPAI) into PAI crystals. The red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence (PL) stems from a combination of the external heavy atom effect and the formation of emissive clusters centered around electron&#8208;rich sulfur atoms. Furthermore, the dopants enhance exciton generation efficiency and facilitate energy transfer from smaller PAI units to larger aggregates, leading to dramatically increased &#934;p. This strategy proves universal, opening possibilities for acquiring long&#8208;wavelength RTP with tunable photophysical properties. The doped crystals exhibit promising applications in optical waveguides and encryption paper/ink. This research provides a practical approach to obtaining long&#8208;wavelength RTP materials and offers valuable insights into the mechanisms governing host&#8208;guest systems.

         <title>Asymmetrified Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Solid Additives Enable All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

Two electron&#8208;deficient isomers, 4,5&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;1) and 5,6&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;2), were designed as solid additives to optimize the properties of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT blend. Compared to the as&#8208;cast device, SF&#8208;1&#8208; and SF&#8208;2&#8208;treated devices displayed regulated fibrillar donor&#8208;acceptor network, improved exciton diffusion length, and thus enhanced power conversion efficiencies approaching 19&#8201;%, which is one of rare solid additives for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells.







Abstract
Disordered polymer chain entanglements within all&#8208;polymer blends limit the formation of optimal donor&#8208;acceptor phase separation. Therefore, developing effective methods to regulate morphology evolution is crucial for achieving optimal morphological features in all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (APSCs). In this study, two isomers, 4,5&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;1) and 5,6&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;2), were designed as solid additives based on the widely&#8208;used electron&#8208;deficient benzothiadiazole unit in nonfullerene acceptors. The incorporation of SF&#8208;1 or SF&#8208;2 into PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT blend induces stronger molecular packing via molecular interaction, leading to the formation of continuous interpenetrated networks with suitable phase&#8208;separation and vertical distribution. Furthermore, after treatment with SF&#8208;1 and SF&#8208;2, the exciton diffusion lengths for PY&#8208;DT films are extended to over 40&#8197;nm, favoring exciton diffusion and charge transport. The asymmetrical SF&#8208;2, characterized by an enhanced dipole moment, increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT&#8208;based device to 18.83&#8201;% due to stronger electrostatic interactions. Moreover, a ternary device strategy boosts the PCE of SF&#8208;2&#8208;treated APSC to over 19&#8201;%. This work not only demonstrates one of the best performances of APSCs but also offers an effective approach to manipulate the morphology of all&#8208;polymer blends using rational&#8208;designed solid additives.

         <title>Unveiling Ionized Interfacial Water&#8208;Induced Localized H* Enrichment for Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen atoms, especially Cl in atomically precise copper halide clusters [Cu2X2(BINAP)2 (X=Cl, Br, I)], can significantly affect the distance of alkali metal&#8208;ionized water on the catalyst surface, which can promote the water dissociation to enhance the localized H* enrichment for the continues hydrogenation of nitrate to ammonia.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a process that requires the participation of eight electrons and nine protons. The regulation of active hydrogen (H*) supply and a deep understanding of related processes are necessary for improving the ammonia yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, we synthesized a series of atomically precise copper&#8208;halide clusters Cu2X2(BINAP)2 (X=Cl, Br, I), among which the Cu2Cl2(BINAP)2 cluster shows the optimal ammonia FE of 94.0&#8201;% and an ammonia yield rate of 373&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that halogen atoms, especially Cl in Cu2Cl2(BIANP)2, can significantly affect the distance of alkali metal&#8208;ionized water on the catalyst surface, which can promote the water dissociation to enhance the localized H* enrichment for the continues hydrogenation of nitrate to ammonia. This work explains the role of H* in the hydrogenation process of NO3RR and the importance of localized H* enrichment strategy for improving the FEs.

         <title>Experimental Insights into the Formation, Reactivity, and Crosstalk of Thionitrite (SNO&#8722;) and Perthionitrite (SSNO&#8722;)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

We report that the H2S/NO crosstalk species SNO&#8722; can generate SSNO&#8722; through a proton&#8208;mediated mechanisms. We also demonstrate new reactions with other small sulfur&#8208;containing biomolecules, including COS.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and nitric oxide (NO) are important gaseous biological signaling molecules that are involved in complex cellular pathways. A number of physiological processes require both H2S and NO, which has led to the proposal that different H2S/NO&#8901; crosstalk species, including thionitrite (SNO&#8722;) and perthionitrite (SSNO&#8722;), are responsible for this observed codependence. Despite the importance of these S/N hybrid species, the reported properties and characterization, as well as the fundamental pathways of formation and subsequent reactivity, remain poorly understood. Herein we report new experimental insights into the fundamental reaction chemistry of pathways to form SNO&#8722; and SSNO&#8722;, including mechanisms for proton&#8208;mediated interconversion. In addition, we demonstrate new modes of reactivity with other sulfur&#8208;containing potential crosstalk species, including carbonyl sulfide (COS).

         <title>Thienyltriazine Triamides: Thickness Insensitive Interlayer Materials Featuring Fine&#8208;Tuned Optoelectronic and Aggregation Characters for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Every component counts: the optoelectronic properties and aggregation behaviors of thienyltriazine triamides (TTTAs) are precisely regulated through simultaneous core unit, aromatic arm, and pendant polar group engineering. Consequently, the TTTA TT&#8722;N&#8722;M emerges as a universal cathode interlayer (CIL) material for highly efficient organic solar cells with record&#8208;breaking thickness tolerance, ranking it among the top CIL materials ever identified.







Abstract
A novel class of thienyltriazine triamides (TTTAs) was facile synthesized and firstly used as cathode interlayers (CILs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). By utilizing different aromatic arms and pendant polar groups, their optoelectronic properties and aggregation behaviors were effectively modulated. The combination of thienyltriazine (TT) core, naphthylamide arm and imidazole pendant group endows TT&#8722;N&#8722;M with suitable energy levels, intensified work function tunability, higher conductivity, and well&#8208;balanced crystallinity and film&#8208;forming ability, boosting both the performance and stability of OSCs significantly. Remarkably, the solar cell efficiency remains stable at around 90&#8201;% of the optimal efficiency even as the interlayer thickness varied from 5 to 95&#8197;nm, demonstrating its insensitivity to thickness. Moreover, TT&#8722;N&#8722;M exhibits compatibility with various active layer systems, achieving a maximum efficiency of 19.60&#8201;% for single&#8208;junction solar cell. Its exceptional tolerance to thickness fluctuations and performance establishes a new benchmark for multi&#8208;armed CIL&#8208;based OSCs, also positioning them among the most high&#8208;performing CIL materials documented thus far. This work not only broadens the scope of CIL materials for OSCs but also offers deep insights into design strategies and structure&#8208;properties relationships, being beneficial for the future development of more efficient CIL materials for organic optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Sublimation Transformation Synthesis of Dual&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we present a straightforward sublimation transformation strategy for the controllable synthesis of a dual&#8208;atom Fe catalyst (Fe2/NC), overcoming the randomness and complexity of previous synthesis strategies. Experimental evidence and microkinetic analysis demonstrated that the adjacent Fe sites and optimal Fe&#8722;Fe distance in Fe2/NC were vital for the adsorption of O2 on catalytic sites and facilitating the subsequent protonation process.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have garnered significant interest due to their remarkable catalytic reactivity. However, achieving atomically precise control in the fabrication of DACs remains a major challenge. Herein, we developed a straightforward and direct sublimation transformation synthesis strategy for dual&#8208;atom Fe catalysts (Fe2/NC) by utilizing in situ generated Fe2Cl6(g) dimers from FeCl3(s). The structure of Fe2/NC was investigated by aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. As&#8208;obtained Fe2/NC, with a Fe&#8722;Fe distance of 0.3&#8197;nm inherited from Fe2Cl6, displayed superior oxygen reduction performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#8197;V (vs. RHE), surpassing commercial Pt/C catalysts, Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe1/NC), and its counterpart with a common and shorter Fe&#8722;Fe distance of ~0.25&#8197;nm (Fe2/NC&#8208;S). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic analysis revealed the extended Fe&#8722;Fe distance in Fe2/NC is crucial for the O2 adsorption on catalytic sites and facilitating the subsequent protonation process, thereby boosting catalytic performance. This work not only introduces a new approach for fabricating atomically precise DACs, but also offers a deeper understanding of the intermetallic distance effect on dual&#8208;site catalysis.

         <title>Boosting Reactive Oxygen Species Generation via Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis with FeIII&#8208;Initiated Self&#8208;cycled Fenton System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an FeIII&#8208;initiated self&#8208;cycling Fenton system (SF&#8208;CEC), where the synergistic effects of O2 activation and FeIII&#8208;activated H2O2 further enhance 1O2 generation. In this SF&#8208;CEC system, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can degrade protonated azo dyes by nearly 99&#8201;% within 10&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Contact Electro&#8208;Catalysis (CEC) using commercial dielectric materials in contact&#8208;separation cycles with water can trigger interfacial electron transfer and induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the inherent hydrophobicity of commercial dielectric materials limits the effective reaction sites, and the generated ROS inevitably undergo self&#8208;combination to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In typical CEC systems, H2O2 does not further decompose into ROS, leading to suboptimal reaction rates. Addressing the generation and activation of H2O2 is therefore crucial for advancing CEC. Here, we synthesized a catalyst by loading the dielectric material polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) onto ZSM&#8208;5 (PTFE/ZSM&#8208;5, PZ for short), achieving uniform dispersion of the catalyst in water for the first time. The introduction of an FeIII&#8208;initiated self&#8208;cycling Fenton system (SF&#8208;CEC), with the synergistic effects of O2 activation and FeIII&#8208;activated H2O2, further enhanced ROS generation. In the FeIII&#8208;initiated SF&#8208;CEC system, the synergistic effects of ROS and protonated azo dyes enabled nearly 99&#8201;% degradation of azo dyes within 10&#8197;minutes, a sixfold improvement compared to the CEC system. This represents the fastest degradation rate of methyl orange dye induced by ultrasound to date. Without extra oxidants, this system enabled stable dissolution of precious metals in weakly acidic solutions at room temperature, achieving 80&#8201;% gold dissolution within 2&#8197;hours, 2.5&#8197;times faster than similar CEC systems. This study also corrects the unfavorable perception of CEC applications under acidic conditions, providing new insights for the fields of dye degradation and precious metal recovery.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Oxygen Regeneration of NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide Enhances Oxygen Evolution Catalysis Durability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural collapse and the metal dissolution have limited the durability of NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) during the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The oxygen pump strategy can efficiently restrain the collapse. The oxygen pump Ni4Mo provides electrons and oxygenous species for NiFe&#8208;LDH, boosting the evolution and regeneration of lattice oxygen, so as to enhance the durability.







Abstract
The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) endows NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, yet the frequent evolution and sluggish regeneration of lattice oxygen intensify the dissolution of active species. Herein, we overcome this challenge by constructing the NiFe hydroxide/Ni4Mo alloy (NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni4Mo) heterojunction electrocatalyst, featuring the Ni4Mo alloy as the oxygen pump to provide oxygenous intermediates and electrons for NiFe&#8208;LDH. The released lattice oxygen can be timely offset by the oxygenous species during the LOM process, balancing the regeneration of lattice oxygen and assuring the enhancement of the durability. In consequence, the durability of NiFe&#8208;LDH is significantly enhanced after the modification of Ni4Mo with an impressive durability for over 60&#8197;h, much longer than that of NiFe&#8208;LDH counterpart with only 10&#8197;h. In situ spectra and first&#8208;principle simulations reveal that the adsorption of OH&#8722; is significantly strengthened owing to the introduction of Ni4Mo, ensuring the rapid regeneration of lattice oxygen. Moreover, NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni4Mo&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) presents an impressive durability for over 150&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The oxygen pump strategy opens opportunities to balance the evolution and regeneration of lattice oxygen, enhancing the durability of efficient OER catalysts.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer in Photoelectrochemical Alcohol Oxidation Enhanced by Nickel&#8208;Based Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction was improved by depositing Ni&#8208;based co&#8208;catalyst on the Fe2O3 photoanode. Compared to alcohol, Ni&#8208;based co&#8208;catalyst has a higher bond dissociation free energy, which ensures the transfer of &#945;&#8208;H from the alcohol molecule to the co&#8208;catalyst through proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process.







Abstract
Using biomass oxidation reactions instead of water oxidation reactions is optimal for accomplishing biomass conversion and effective hydrogen generation. Here, we report that &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanodes with a NiOOH cocatalyst exhibit excellent performance for photoelectrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The conversion efficiency for HMF reaches 98.5&#8201;%, while the selectivity for FDCA is 94.2&#8201;%. We revealed that HMF is oxidized through a spontaneous proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process with the high&#8208;valent phase of the Ni&#8208;based catalyst. The dangling oxygen and bridging oxygen of the high&#8208;valent phase species serve as proton&#8208;accepting sites. Furthermore, we pointed out that the deprotonated bond dissociation free energy difference between the catalysts and alcohols is the thermodynamic trigger for the PCET process. This study provides a reasonable explanation for the alcohol oxidation reaction, which is beneficial for designing biomass conversion systems.

         <title>Regulating Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling by Solid Additive for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

The SA1 additive with a planar structure can enhance molecular order and packing of active layer. In this way, the phonon scattering is suppressed in the SA1&#8208;assisted blend film, leading to a remarkable PCE of 20&#8201;% for the ternary device.







Abstract
Strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling can hinder exciton transport and induce undesirable non&#8208;radiative recombination, resulting in a shortened exciton diffusion distance and constrained exciton dissociation in organic solar cells (OSCs). Therefore, suppressing electron&#8208;phonon coupling is crucially important for achieveing high&#8208;performance OSCs. Here, we employ the solid additive to regulating electron&#8208;phonon coupling in OSCs. The planar configuration of SA1 confers a significant advantage in suppressing lattice vibrations in the active layers, reducing the scattering of excitons by phonons. Consequently, a slow but sustained hole transfer process is identified in the SA1&#8208;assisted film, indicating an enhancement in hole transfer efficiency. Prolonged exciton diffusion length and exciton lifetime are achieved in the blend film processed with SA1, attributed to a low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate and low energetic disorder for charge carrier transport. As a result, a high efficiency of 20&#8201;% was achieved for ternary device with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current. This work highlights the important role of suppressing electron&#8208;phonon coupling in improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <title>Unveiling the Structure and Dissociation of Interfacial Water on RuO2 for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing a series of p&#8208;block metal elements (Ga, In, and Sn) doped RuO2 catalysts, the critical role of interfacial water molecules on regulating the acidic OER activity was investigated. The structurally ordered interfacial water molecules facilitate high&#8208;efficiency proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer across the interface, leading to reduced energy barrier of the follow&#8208;up dissociation process and enhanced kinetics of acidic OER.







Abstract
Understanding the structure and dynamic process of interfacial water molecules at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface on acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics is highly desirable for the development of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Herein, we construct a series of p&#8208;block metal elements (Ga, In, Sn) doped RuO2 catalysts with manipulated electronic structure and Ru&#8722;O covalency to investigate the effect of electrochemical interfacial engineering on the improvement of acidic OER activity. Associated with operando attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements and theoretical analysis, we uncover the free&#8208;H2O enriched local environment and dynamic evolution from 4&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water and 2&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water to free&#8208;H2O on the surface of Ga&#8722;RuO2, are responsible for the optimized connectivity of hydrogen bonding network in the electrical double layer by promoting solvent reorganization. In addition, the structurally ordered interfacial water molecules facilitate high&#8208;efficiency proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer across the interface, leading to reduced energy barrier of the follow&#8208;up dissociation process and enhanced acidic OER performance. This work highlights the key role of structure and dynamic process of interfacial water for acidic OER, and demonstrates the electrochemical interfacial engineering as an efficient strategy to design high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Inducible Radiomimetic Photosensitizers Selectively Suppress Cancer Cell Proliferation by Damaging DNA through Radical Cation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;inducible radiomimetic photosensitizers have been developed to damage DNA through radical cation chemistry. They exhibit selective and redox&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and demonstrate significant potential in combination therapy. This innovative approach not only provides an alternative strategy for phototherapy but also establishes a novel cellular platform for studying the direct effects of radiotherapy.







Abstract
Radiotherapy leverages ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells through direct and indirect effects, and direct effects are considered to play an equal or greater role. Several photosensitizers have been developed to mimic the direct effects of radiotherapy, generating radical cations in DNA models, but none has been applied in cellular studies. Here, we design a radiomimetic photosensitizer, producing DNA radical cations in cells for the first time. To reduce adverse effects, several redox&#8208;inducible precursors are prepared as cancer cells have elevated levels of GSH and H2O2. These precursors respond to GSH or H2O2, releasing the active photosensitizer that captures DNA abasic (AP) sites and generates DNA radical cations upon photolysis, without disrupting the redox state of cells. DNA radical cations migrate freely and are eventually trapped by H2O and O2 to yield DNA lesions, thus triggering DNA damage response. Our study suggests that direct effects of radiotherapy suppress cancer cell proliferation mainly by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, rather than promoting apoptosis. Synergistic effects of the precursor and chemotherapeutic agents are also observed in combination phototherapy. Beyond highlighting an alternative strategy for phototherapy, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study affords a facile cellular platform to study the direct effects of radiotherapy.

         <title>Tailoring Single&#8208;Atom Coordination Environments in Carbon Nanofibers via Flash Heating for Highly Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a surface atom adsorption&#8208;flash heating (FH) strategy that prevents collapse, and forms single atoms with tetra&#8208; or penta&#8208;nitrogen coordination environments. This ensures fully exposed Co&#8208;N5 sites and high atomic utilization. The turnover frequency (65.33&#8197;s&#8722;1) is 47.4 times higher than 20&#8201;% Pt/C under alkaline conditions.







Abstract
The rational design of carbon&#8208;supported transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts necessitates precise atomic positioning within the precursor. However, structural collapse during pyrolysis can occlude single atoms, posing significant challenges in controlling both their utilization and coordination environment. Herein, we present a surface atom adsorption&#8208;flash heating (FH) strategy, which ensures that the pre&#8208;designed carbon nanofiber structure remains intact during heating, preventing unforeseen collapse effects and enabling the formation of metal atoms in nano&#8208;environments with either tetra&#8208;nitrogen or penta&#8208;nitrogen coordination at different flash heating temperatures. Theoretical calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal that penta&#8208;nitrogen coordinated cobalt atoms (Co&#8208;N5) promote a lower energy pathway for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions compared to the commonly formed Co&#8208;N4 sites. This strategy ensures that Co&#8208;N5 sites are fully exposed on the surface, achieving exceptionally high atomic utilization. The turnover frequency (65.33&#8197;s&#8722;1) is 47.4 times higher than that of 20&#8201;% Pt/C under alkaline conditions. The porous, flexible carbon nanofibers significantly enhance zinc&#8208;air battery performance, with a high peak power density (273.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), large specific capacity (784.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 600&#8197;h. Additionally, the flexible fiber&#8208;shaped zinc&#8208;air battery can power wearable devices, demonstrating significant potential in flexible electronics applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We present a surface atom adsorption-flash heating (FH) strategy&lt;/b&gt; that prevents collapse, and forms single atoms with tetra- or penta-nitrogen coordination environments. This ensures fully exposed Co-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; sites and high atomic utilization. The turnover frequency (65.33&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is 47.4 times higher than 20&#8201;% Pt/C under alkaline conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rational design of carbon-supported transition metal single-atom catalysts necessitates precise atomic positioning within the precursor. However, structural collapse during pyrolysis can occlude single atoms, posing significant challenges in controlling both their utilization and coordination environment. Herein, we present a surface atom adsorption-flash heating (FH) strategy, which ensures that the pre-designed carbon nanofiber structure remains intact during heating, preventing unforeseen collapse effects and enabling the formation of metal atoms in nano-environments with either tetra-nitrogen or penta-nitrogen coordination at different flash heating temperatures. Theoretical calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal that penta-nitrogen coordinated cobalt atoms (Co-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) promote a lower energy pathway for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions compared to the commonly formed Co-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites. This strategy ensures that Co-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; sites are fully exposed on the surface, achieving exceptionally high atomic utilization. The turnover frequency (65.33&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is 47.4 times higher than that of 20&#8201;% Pt/C under alkaline conditions. The porous, flexible carbon nanofibers significantly enhance zinc-air battery performance, with a high peak power density (273.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), large specific capacity (784.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and long-term cycling stability over 600&#8197;h. Additionally, the flexible fiber-shaped zinc-air battery can power wearable devices, demonstrating significant potential in flexible electronics applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Vinylic C&#8722;H Addition via Metallaphotoredox Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallaphotoredox migration strategy has been developed to achieve stereodefined allylic alcohols through vinylic C&#8722;H activation with aldehydes. This innovative method employs a chiral nickel catalyst in conjunction with a photocatalyst to facilitate a 1,4&#8208;Ni migration, utilizing readily accessible 2&#8208;vinyl iodoarenes as starting materials.







Abstract
Geometrically defined allylic alcohols with SE, SZ, RE and RZ stereoisomers serve as valuable intermediates in synthetic chemistry, attributed to the stereoselective transformations enabled by the alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. When an ideal scenario presents itself with four distinct stereoisomers as potential products, the simultaneous control vicinal stereochemistry in a single step would offer a direct pathway to any desired stereoisomer. Here, we unveil a metallaphotoredox migration strategy to access stereodefined allylic alcohols through vinylic C&#8722;H activation with aldehydes. This method harnesses a chiral nickel catalyst in concert with a photocatalyst to enable a 1,4&#8208;Ni migration by using readily accessible 2&#8208;vinyl iodoarenes as starting materials. The efficacy of this methodology is highlighted by the precise construction of all stereoisomers of allylic alcohols bearing analogous substituents and the efficient synthesis of key intermediates en route to Myristinin family. Experimental and computational studies have shed light on pivotal aspects including the synergy of metal catalysis and photocatalysis, the driving forces behind the migration, and the determination of absolute configuration in the C&#8722;H addition process.

         <title>Effective Alkyl&#8208;Alkyl Cross&#8208;Coupling with an Iron&#8208;Xantphos Catalyst: Mechanistic and Structural Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>

In this study, a combination of 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray diffraction, and reactivity studies are utilized to identify the key organoiron intermediates and reaction pathways, including ligand effects on iron speciation, that enable effective iron&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
While iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;couplings have been widely studied and developed in the last decade, alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling systems with iron remain underdeveloped despite the importance of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in organic synthesis. A major challenge to the development of these reactions is the current lack of fundamental insight into ligand effects and organoiron intermediates that enable effective alkyl&#8208;alkyl couplings. The current study addresses this longstanding limitation using a combination of 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, SC&#8208;XRD (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) and reactivity studies of alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling with iron&#8208;Xantphos to define the in situ formed iron&#8208;Xantphos intermediates in catalysis. Combined with detailed reactivity studies, the nature of the key mechanistic pathways in catalysis and ligands effects to achieve effective alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling over competing &#946;&#8208;H elimination pathways are probed. Overall, these foundational studies provide a platform for future bespoke ligand and pre&#8208;catalyst design for alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling methods development with sustainable iron catalysis.

         <title>Structurally Compact Penta(N,N&#8208;diphenylamino)corannulene as Dopant&#8208;free Hole Transport Materials for Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
We develop a downsizing strategy by combining a dynamic bowl&#8208;shaped core with smaller DPA groups to fabricate structurally compact HTMs. The unique structure of the HTMs facilitates intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, efficient film formation, and charge transport, resulting in enhanced charge mobility and glass transition temperature. Consequently, the PSC employing the dopant&#8208;free HTM exhibits an impressive PCE of 24.01&#8201;% along with exceptional operational stability, retaining 96&#8201;% of its initial performance after 800&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) are essential for improving the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, we have designed and synthesized a novel organic small molecule HTM, cor&#8208;(DPA)5, characterized by a bowl&#8208;shaped core with symmetric five diphenylamine groups. Compared to already&#8208;known HTMs, the bowl&#8208;shaped and relatively compact structure of cor&#8208;(DPA)5 facilitates intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, promotes film formations, and enhances charge transport. Consequently, the cor&#8208;[DPA(2)]5 HTM exhibits high charge mobility, exceptional hydrophobicity, and a significantly elevated glass transition temperature. Superior to previously reported HTMs such as spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and cor&#8208;OMePTPA, our newly synthesized cor&#8208;(DPA)5 HTM is free from any ionic dopants. As a result, the dopant&#8208;free cor&#8208;[DPA(2)]5&#8208;based PSC demonstrates an impressive efficiency of 24.01&#8201;%, and exhibits outstanding operational stability. It retains 96&#8201;% after continuous exposure to 1 sun irradiation for 800&#8197;hours under MPP (maximum power point) tracking in ambient air. These findings present a structurally compact novel HTM and exemplify a new approach to the molecular design of HTM for the development of stable and effective PSCs.

         <title>The Operando Nature of Isobutene Adsorbed in Zeolite H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13 Unraveled by Machine Learning Potentials Beyond DFT Accuracy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transfer learning approach is proposed to perform enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations with arbitrary accuracy. We study the chemisorption of isobutene in the H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13 zeolite with RI&#8208;RPA and show that carbenium ions are not present in significant concentrations at reaction temperatures.







Abstract
Unraveling the nature of adsorbed olefins in zeolites is crucial to understand numerous zeolite&#8208;catalyzed processes. A well&#8208;grounded theoretical description critically depends on both an accurate determination of the potential energy surface (PES) and a reliable account of entropic effects at operating conditions. Herein, we propose a transfer learning approach to perform random phase approximation (RPA) quality enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, thereby approaching chemical accuracy on both the determination and exploration of the PES. The proposed methodology is used to investigate isobutene adsorption in H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13 as prototypical system to estimate the relative stability of physisorbed olefins, carbenium ions and surface alkoxide species (SAS) in Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acidic zeolites. We show that the tert&#8208;butyl carbenium ion formation is highly endothermic and no entropic stabilization is observed compared to the physisorbed complex within H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13. Hence, its predicted concentration and lifetime are negligible, making a direct experimental observation unlikely. Yet, it remains a shallow minimum on the free energy surface over the whole considered temperature range (273&#8211;873&#8197;K), being therefore a short&#8208;lived reaction intermediate rather than a transition state species.

     alt="The Operando Nature of Isobutene Adsorbed in Zeolite H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13 Unraveled by Machine Learning Potentials Beyond DFT Accuracy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transfer learning approach is proposed to perform enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations with arbitrary accuracy. We study the chemisorption of isobutene in the H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13 zeolite with RI-RPA and show that carbenium ions are not present in significant concentrations at reaction temperatures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unraveling the nature of adsorbed olefins in zeolites is crucial to understand numerous zeolite-catalyzed processes. A well-grounded theoretical description critically depends on both an accurate determination of the potential energy surface (PES) and a reliable account of entropic effects at operating conditions. Herein, we propose a transfer learning approach to perform random phase approximation (RPA) quality enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, thereby approaching chemical accuracy on both the determination and exploration of the PES. The proposed methodology is used to investigate isobutene adsorption in H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13 as prototypical system to estimate the relative stability of physisorbed olefins, carbenium ions and surface alkoxide species (SAS) in Br&#248;nsted-acidic zeolites. We show that the &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl carbenium ion formation is highly endothermic and no entropic stabilization is observed compared to the physisorbed complex within H&#8722;SSZ&#8722;13. Hence, its predicted concentration and lifetime are negligible, making a direct experimental observation unlikely. Yet, it remains a shallow minimum on the free energy surface over the whole considered temperature range (273&#8211;873&#8197;K), being therefore a short-lived reaction intermediate rather than a transition state species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoregular Poly(Phenyl Glycidyl Ethers): In Situ Formation of a Polyether Stereocomplex from a Racemic Monomer Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of bio&#8208;derived phenyl glycidyl ethers reveals the first in situ polyether stereocomplex formation without prior kinetic resolution of the enantiopure building blocks. Capitalizing on highly active bimetallic cobalt complexes, enantioselective ROP generates a single, enantiomeric polyether stereoisomer. Using isoselective ROP, a mixture of highly stereoregular, isotactic polyether chains of opposite chirality is generated. The substitution pattern of the phenyl glycidyl ethers not only has a dramatic impact on the thermal properties of these isotactic polyethers, but also controls the stereocomplexation of the resulting stereoisomer blends.







Abstract
Polymer stereocomplex formation represents a promising research area as it can improve thermal and mechanical properties of co&#8208;crystallized polymer strands of opposite chirality. Polymers that form stereocomplexes commonly feature high stereoregularity and usually require sourcing from enantiopure monomer building blocks. Herein, we report the in situ polyether stereocomplex formation from racemic epoxide monomers, i.e., substituted methyl phenyl glycidyl ethers. The bio&#8208;renewable glycidyl ethers were explored in both enantio&#8208; and isoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerizations (ROPs), resulting in isotactic poly(phenyl glycidyl ether). While the enantioselective ROP selectively resolves a single enantiomeric, isotactic polyether stereoisomer ([mm]P&#8805;78&#8201;%), the isoselective ROP leads to the concurrent formation of both isotactic (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;poly(phenyl glycidyl ether) stereoisomers ([mm]P&#8805;92&#8201;%) and thus results directly in a stereoisomer blend, which forms a stereocomplex. This is one of only a few polymer stereocomplexes generated directly during polymerization from a racemic monomer mixture. Stereocomplexes of the different poly(phenyl glycidyl ether)s show an increase in melting temperature of up to 76&#8201;&#176;C, relative to the enantiopure parent polymers. The position of the methyl group at the phenyl ring determines both stereocomplex formation and the thermal properties of the resulting materials.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Vanadium&#8208;Induced Ru&#8208;V Dual Active Sites Enable Exceptional Performance for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating atomically dispersed vanadium species, including O&#8208;bridged V dimers and V single atoms into RuO2 lattices, enable exceptional activity and stability for acidic water oxidation. The produced Ru&#8722;V dual active sites with optimized interatomic distance induce a switch from the traditional AEM to the OCM pathway, and the Ru&#8722;O&#8722;V local structures stabilize the surface Ru active sites, synergistically boosting the acidic OER performance.







Abstract
Regulating the catalytic reaction pathway to essentially break the activity/stability trade&#8208;off that limits RuO2 and thus achieves exceptional stability and activity for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is important yet challenging. Herein, we propose a novel strategy of incorporating atomically dispersed V species, including O&#8208;bridged V dimers and V single atoms, into RuO2 lattices to trigger direct O&#8722;O radical coupling to release O2 without the generation of *OOH intermediates. Vn&#8722;RuO2 showed high activity with a low overpotential of 227&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and outstanding stability during a 1050&#8197;h test in acidic electrolyte. Operando spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that compared with the V single atom&#8208;doping case, the introduction of the V dimer into RuO2 further decreases the Ru&#8208;V atomic distance and weakens the adsorption strength of the *O intermediate to the active V site, which supports the more energetically favorable oxygen radical coupling mechanism (OCM). Furthermore, the highly asymmetric Ru&#8722;O&#8722;V local structure stabilizes the surface Ru active center by lowering the valence state and increasing the resistance against overoxidation, which result in outstanding stability. This study provides insight into ways of increasing the intrinsic catalytic activity and stability of RuO2 by atomically dispersed species modification.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Enzyme Mimetic MoCu Dual&#8208;Atom Nanozyme Triggering Oxidative Stress Cascade Amplification for High&#8208;Efficiency Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;enzyme mimetic MoCu dual&#8208;atom nanozyme (MoCu DAzyme) with multiple catalytic active sites can generate various reactive oxygen species, deplete glutathione, and block glutathione regeneration by consuming NADPH, thereby triggering oxidative stress cascade amplification for collaborative catalytic therapy. The antitumor therapeutic effect is further enhanced when synergized with photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with ultrahigh atom utilization efficiency have been extensively applied in reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. However, the high energy barriers of reaction intermediates on single&#8208;atom sites and the overexpressed antioxidants in the tumor microenvironment restrict the amplification of tumor oxidative stress, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we report a multi&#8208;enzyme mimetic MoCu dual&#8208;atom nanozyme (MoCu DAzyme) with various catalytic active sites, which exhibits peroxidase, oxidase, glutathione (GSH) oxidase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase mimicking activities. Compared with Mo SAzyme, the introduction of Cu atoms, formation of dual&#8208;atom sites, and synergetic catalytic effects among various active sites enhance substrate adsorption and reduce the energy barrier, thereby endowing MoCu DAzyme with stronger catalytic activities. Benefiting from the above enzyme&#8208;like activities, MoCu DAzyme can not only generate multiple ROS, but also deplete GSH and block its regeneration to trigger the cascade amplification of oxidative stress. Additionally, the strong optical absorption in the near&#8208;infrared II bio&#8208;window endows MoCu DAzyme with remarkable photothermal conversion performance. Consequently, MoCu DAzyme achieves high&#8208;efficiency synergistic cancer treatment incorporating collaborative catalytic therapy and photothermal therapy. This work will advance the therapeutic applications of DAzymes and provide valuable insights for nanocatalytic cancer therapy.

         <title>Sulfate Derivatives with Heteroleptic Tetrahedra: New Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Birefringent Materials in which Weak Interactions Modulate Functional Module Ordering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed a strategy to design deep&#8208;ultraviolet birefringent materials in which weak interactions modulate functional module ordering. Following this strategy, new CN4H7SO3CF3 crystals show superior linear optical properties, including the shortest cutoff edge among reported guanidinium/aminoguanidinium&#8208;based compounds and the largest birefringence in the deep&#8208;ultraviolet region among reported sulfates and sulfate derivatives.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) birefringent materials are urgently needed to facilitate light polarization in deep&#8208;UV lithography. Maximizing anisotropy by regulating the alignment of functional modules is essential for improving the linear optical performance of birefringent materials. In this work, we proposed a strategy to design deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials that achieve functional module ordering via weak interactions. Following this strategy, four compounds CN4H7SO3CF3, CN4H7SO3CH3, C(NH2)3SO3CH3, and C(NH2)3SO3CF3 were identified as high&#8208;performance candidates for deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials. The millimeter&#8208;sized crystals of CN4H7SO3CF3, CN4H7SO3CH3, and C(NH2)3SO3CH3 were grown, and the transmittance spectra show that their cutoff edges are below 200&#8197;nm. CN4H7SO3CF3 exhibits the largest birefringence (0.149 @ 546&#8197;nm, 0.395 @ 200&#8197;nm) in the deep&#8208;UV region among reported sulfates and sulfate derivatives. It reveals that the hydrogen bond can modulate the module ordering of the heteroleptic tetrahedra and planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations, thus greatly enhancing the birefringence. Our study not only discovers new deep&#8208;UV birefringent materials but also provides an upgraded strategy for optimizing optical anisotropy to achieve efficient birefringence.

Following this strategy, new CN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals show superior linear optical properties, including the shortest cutoff edge among reported guanidinium/aminoguanidinium-based compounds and the largest birefringence in the deep-ultraviolet region among reported sulfates and sulfate derivatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep-ultraviolet (UV) birefringent materials are urgently needed to facilitate light polarization in deep-UV lithography. Maximizing anisotropy by regulating the alignment of functional modules is essential for improving the linear optical performance of birefringent materials. In this work, we proposed a strategy to design deep-UV birefringent materials that achieve functional module ordering via weak interactions. Following this strategy, four compounds CN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were identified as high-performance candidates for deep-UV birefringent materials. The millimeter-sized crystals of CN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were grown, and the transmittance spectra show that their cutoff edges are below 200&#8197;nm. CN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits the largest birefringence (0.149 @ 546&#8197;nm, 0.395 @ 200&#8197;nm) in the deep-UV region among reported sulfates and sulfate derivatives. It reveals that the hydrogen bond can modulate the module ordering of the heteroleptic tetrahedra and planar &#960;-conjugated cations, thus greatly enhancing the birefringence. Our study not only discovers new deep-UV birefringent materials but also provides an upgraded strategy for optimizing optical anisotropy to achieve efficient birefringence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Swelling Microporous Membrane for High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation&#8208;exchange membrane made from rigid polymers was developed for Zn&#8722;I2 batteries. It shows high ion selectivity, suppressing the I2 cathode shuttle effect. Abundant sulfonate groups in the membrane ensure uniform Zn2+ flux on the anode. Additionally, the membrane's microporosity allows pre&#8208;adsorption of active materials, boosting battery capacity to 287&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Overall, the battery exhibits high stability and capacity over 10,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries are gaining popularity due to cost&#8208;effectiveness and ease of manufacturing. However, challenges like polyiodide shuttle effect and Zn dendrite growth hinder their practical application. Here, we report a cation exchange membrane to simultaneously prevent the polyiodide shuttle effect and regulate Zn2+ deposition. Comprised of rigid polymers, this membrane shows superior swelling resistance and ion selectivity compared to commercial Nafion. The resulting Zn&#8722;I2 battery exhibits a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4&#8201;% and low self&#8208;discharge rate of 4.47&#8201;% after 48&#8197;h rest. By directing a uniform Zn2+ flux, the membrane promotes a homogeneous electric field, resulting in a dendrite&#8208;free Zn surface. Moreover, its microporous structure enables pre&#8208;adsorption of additional active materials prior to battery assembly, boosting battery capacity to 287&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. At 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the battery exhibits a steady running for 10,000&#8197;cycles with capacity retention up to 96.1&#8201;%, demonstrating high durability of the membrane. The practicality of the membrane is validated via a high&#8208;loading (35&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) pouch cell with impressive cycling stability, paving a way for membrane design towards advanced Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.

         <title>A Novel Anion Receptor Additive for &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C Sodium Metal Batteries by Anion/Cation Solvation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium metal batteries have garnered significant attention. Herein, a novel anion receptor additive, 4&#8208;aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester, is proposed to weaken the coupling between anions and cations. The additive alters the solvation structure of Na+, forming a stable and dense electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, ABAPE forms hydrogen bonds (&#8722;NH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O/F) with H2O/HF.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries, known for their high theoretical specific capacity, abundant reserves, and promising low&#8208;temperature performance, have garnered significant attention. However, the large ionic radius of Na+ and sluggish transport kinetics across the interfacial structure hinder their practical application. Previous reviews have rarely regulated electrolyte performance from the perspective of anions, as important components of the electrolyte, the regulation mechanism is not well understood. Herein, a novel anion receptor additive, 4&#8208;aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester (ABAPE), is proposed to weaken the coupling between anions and cations and accelerate Na+ transport kinetics. The results of theoretical calculations and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy with deep Ar&#8208;ion etching demonstrate that the introduction of this additive alters the solvation structure of Na+, reduces the desolvation barrier and forms a stable and dense electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, ABAPE forms hydrogen bonds (&#8722;NH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O/F) with H2O/HF, effectively preventing the hydrolysis of NaPF6 and stabilizing acidic species. Consequently, the Na||Na symmetric cell exhibits excellent long&#8208;cycle performance of 500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cell with the addition of ABAPE maintains a capacity retention of 84.29&#8201;% at 1&#8197;C after 1200&#8197;cycles and presents no capacity decay over 150&#8197;cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Synergistic Photoredox/Palladium Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Carboxylation of Racemic Heterobiaryl (Pseudo)Halides with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synergistic photoredox/palladium catalysis was developed to realize the enantioconvergent carboxylation of racemic heterobiaryl (pseudo)halides with CO2, affording a series of axially chiral esters in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Key to success was the utilization of an appropriate amount of alkyl bromide to trap the generated chiral carboxylic anion in situ towards the formation of conformationally stable ester.







Abstract
Herein, we report a synergistic photoredox/palladium catalytic system for the efficient enantioconvergent synthesis of axially chiral esters from racemic heterobiaryl (pseudo)halides (bromides/triflates) with CO2 and alkyl bromides under mild conditions. A wide range of axially chiral esters were obtained in good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Detailed mechanistic studies unveiled that the ratio of photocatalyst and palladium catalyst exhibited significant impact on the chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivities of the reaction. Kinetic studies and control experiments supported the proposed mechanism involving cascade asymmetric carboxylation followed by SN2 substitution. The achievement of high enantioselectivity relies not only on the choice of synergistic metallaphotoredox catalysts but also on the utilization of alkyl bromides, which trap the generated chiral carboxylic anions in situ, thus preventing their immediate racemization.

         <title>Nonflammable Fluorinated Electrolyte Realizing High Voltage Anode&#8208;Free Zn Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The problem of low working voltage and Zn corrosion in aqueous electrolyte has been solved by using fluorinated solvents&#8208;based electrolyte. The reduced solvation capacity of fluorinated solvents promotes the incorporation of TFSI&#8722; into Zn2+ solvation shell, resulting in forming ZnF2&#8208;rich SEI layer. Benefitting from the oxidation resistant fluorinated solvents and PFPN additive, Zn&#8208;graphite cell exhibits long lifetime and high working voltage.







Abstract
Due to the low decomposition potential of H2O and its corrosive effect to Zn foil, the Zn metal battery with aqueous electrolytes operates within a narrow electrochemical window and exhibits low anode utilization ratio. Fluorinated carbonate ester, exhibiting low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, is suitable for constructing high&#8208;voltage batteries, yet its application in Zn metal battery has been scarcely explored. Herein, we propose an electrolyte based on fluorinated solvents and ethoxy (pentafluoro) cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) additive, which exhibits a high decomposition voltage of 2.75&#8197;V in Zn batteries. The fluorinated carbonate esters possess non&#8208;flammability and exhibit reduced solvation capacity which in turn promotes the incorporation of anions into Zn2+ solvation shell. Consequently, an anion&#8208;derived interface layer is formed on Zn anode, aiding the compact and planar growth of deposited Zn. Therefore, the Zn//Zn cell exhibits an impressive Zn utilization of 91&#8201;% for 140&#8197;h, a level seldom reported previously. Benefitting from the oxidation resistant solvents and cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface layer formed by PFPN additive, the Zn//graphite dual&#8208;ions battery shows an extended cycling life of 1000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, an anode&#8208;free cell was constructed and stably operated for 100&#8197;cycles, with a notably high average discharge midpoint voltage of 1.84&#8197;V.

         <title>Karl Ziegler &#8211; Early Career of a Scientist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Karl Ziegler is still known today for his outstanding achievements in chemical research, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1963. But who was the person behind this brilliant scientist? This article outlines Ziegler's biography. It describes his youth and study years in Marburg, his postdoctoral period and especially his role in the Nazi era.







Abstract
Karl Ziegler is considered one of the most outstanding chemists of the 20th century. In particular, his work on organometallic mixed catalysts, which allows the polymerization of ethylene at normal pressure, led to a revolution in plastics production and changed the everyday life of all mankind. In 1963, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work, together with Giulio Natta. This article focuses on Ziegler's early career, which has received little attention to date. It describes his youth and study years in Marburg, which partly coincide with the First World War. Subsequently, his postdoctoral period is examined, which led him via Marburg and Frankfurt to his first associate professorship in Heidelberg. Special attention is paid to his relationship to National Socialism, which he opposed. As a result, Ziegler experienced professional difficulties in the 1930s, such as repeated rejection when filling various professorships. His appointment as a full professor in Halle and his subsequent directorship at the Max&#8208;Planck&#8208;Institut f&#252;r Kohlenforschung (Coal Research), where he finally achieved his greatest research achievement, are described in the following.

         <title>Reply to Correspondence on &#8220;Unlocking the Chain&#8208;Walking Process in Gold Catalysis&#8221;</title>

In response to the correspondence by Budzelaar et al. on the &#8220;gold&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking process,&#8221; a few control experiments were conducted. The results indicated that the formation of Heck&#8208;type products and cyclization products can not be solely rationalized based on the gold&#8208;catalyzed heteroarylation of alkenes followed by acid&#8208;mediated elimination/cyclization sequence.







Abstract
We recently reported the gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck and chain&#8208;walking reactions, which utilize migratory insertion, &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination steps in a catalytic fashion. Budzelaar et&#8197;al. in their correspondence state that these reactions proceed through gold&#8208;catalyzed alkene heteroarylation followed by acid&#8208;mediated elimination and cyclization sequence. In response to this correspondence, we have conducted some experiments which convinced us that the product formation solely can not be rationalized based on hetero&#8208;arylation of alkenes under ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) catalysis.

A series of MOF@PCC composites was synthesized through mechanochemical reactions, as reported by Hang Xing, Yu Fang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202416884). This strategic placement of PCCs on the MOF surface optimized the pore structure of the composites, while the incorporation of polar functional groups facilitated specific interactions with targeted gas molecules. By carefully aligning the aperture sizes of both PCCs and MOFs, a significant enhancement in gas adsorption capacities was obtained, leading to improved binary gas separation capabilities and expanding the potential applications of these composites.

         <dc:description>
A facile design strategy for exploring robust folded luminescent molecules using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole to bridge planar electron donors and acceptors is reported by Zujin Zhao et&#8197;al in their Research Article (e202414488). The generated molecules possess a regular sandwich&#8208;structured confirmation like a rigid folded mortise and tenon structure, and display prominent thermally activated delayed fluorescence. They can function efficiently as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

Piano stool rhodium complexes, which are derived from helicene&#8208;indene proligands, can catalyse enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation leading to axially chiral biaryls in mostly high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Stereocontrolled synthesis of such complexes and their use in catalysis expresses an unusual sequence of central&#8208;to&#8208;helical&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer, as reported by Tereza Edlov&#225;, Irena G.

         <title>Transmembrane Ion Channels: From Natural to Artificial Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion channels play a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes. Their importance is multifaceted and spans multiple disciplines, including biology, medicine, and pharmacology. In this Review, we introduce natural channel proteins and their structural features, gating properties, and physiological functions. We also discuss bioinspired ion channels and their fabricating strategies, dynamic regulation, and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Natural channel proteins allow the selective permeation of ions, water or other nutritious entities across bilayer membranes, facilitating various essential physiological functions in living systems. Inspired by nature, chemists endeavor to simulate the structural features and transport behaviors of channel proteins through biomimetic strategies. In this review, we start from introducing the inherent traits of channel proteins such as their crystal structures, functions and mechanisms. Subsequently, different kind of synthetic ion channels including their design principles, dynamic regulations and therapeutic applications were carefully reviewed. Finally, the potential challenges and opportunities in this research field were also carefully discussed. It is anticipated that this review could provide some inspiring ideas and future directions towards the construction of novel bionic ion channels with higher&#8208;level structures, properties, functions and practical applications.

         <title>Renaissance of Chlorine Evolution Reaction: Emerging Theory and Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine (Cl2) is an important commodity produced via the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) at the anodes of chlor&#8211;alkali electrolyzers, for which precious metal&#8208;based catalysts have been used for over half a century. The last decade has seen dramatic advances in both theory and the discovery of new catalysts for the CER. This minireview provides an overview of the emerging theories and catalytic materials for the CER and suggests future directions.







Abstract
Chlorine (Cl2) is one of the most important commodity chemicals that has found widespread utility in chemical industry. Most Cl2 is currently produced via the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) at the anode of chlor&#8211;alkali electrolyzers, for which platinum group&#8208;metal (PGM)&#8208;based mixed metal oxides (MMOs) have been used for more than half a century. However, MMOs suffer from the use of expensive and scarce PGMs and face selectivity problems due to the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction. Over the last decade, the field of CER catalysis has seen dramatic advances in both the theory and discovery of new catalysts. Theoretical approaches have enabled a fundamental understanding of CER mechanisms and provided catalyst design principles. The exploration of new materials has led to the discovery of CER catalysts other than MMOs, including non&#8208;PGM oxides, atomically dispersed single&#8208;site catalysts, and organic molecules, with some of which following novel reaction pathways. This minireview provides an overview of the recent advances in CER electrocatalyst research and suggests future directions for this revitalized field.

However, MMOs suffer from the use of expensive and scarce PGMs and face selectivity problems due to the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction. Over the last decade, the field of CER catalysis has seen dramatic advances in both the theory and discovery of new catalysts. Theoretical approaches have enabled a fundamental understanding of CER mechanisms and provided catalyst design principles. The exploration of new materials has led to the discovery of CER catalysts other than MMOs, including non-PGM oxides, atomically dispersed single-site catalysts, and organic molecules, with some of which following novel reaction pathways. This minireview provides an overview of the recent advances in CER electrocatalyst research and suggests future directions for this revitalized field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymer Mechanochemistry in Confined Spaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in polymer mechanochemistry within confined spaces, specifically with regard to the effects of confinement on the enhancement of mechanophore activation, is the focus of this Minireview. The physical and chemical conditions under spatial confinement differ significantly from those in the surrounding bulk environment, offering opportunities to facilitate mechanochemical activation and achieve new practical applications.







Abstract
With the development of mechanophores, polymer mechanochemistry has emerged as a powerful tool for creating force&#8208;responsive materials with a variety of desired functions, ranging from color change to molecular release. However, it remains challenging to improve the efficiency of mechanochemical activation, especially for mechanophores embedded within polymer networks, which has profound implications for translating mechanochemical responses into materials&#8208;centered applications. The physical and chemical conditions under spatial confinement differ significantly from those in the surrounding bulk environment, offering opportunities to facilitate mechanochemical activation. In this Minireview, we discuss and summarize recent progress in polymer mechanochemistry within confined spaces including surfaces/interfaces, polymer assemblies, and other nanostructures, specifically focusing on the effects of spatial confinement on the enhancement of mechanophore activation. We envision that combining confinement effects with advances in molecular and materials engineering will further improve the activation efficiency, capitalizing more fully on the potential of mechanophores toward practical applications.

         <title>Application of Hard and Soft Acid&#8208;base Theory to Construct Heterometallic Materials with Metal&#8208;oxo Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic materials are favored for their diverse structures and enhanced functionality compared to monometallic counterparts. However, their development is often impeded by complex metal coordination and structural unpredictability. This minireview showcases the application of Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory as a powerful tool to streamline the design and synthesis of heterometallic clusters and cluster&#8208;based frameworks. Additionally, it briefly explores the synergistic effects that these clusters impart on the properties of heterometallic materials, offering valuable insights for researchers seeking to harness their full potential.







Abstract
Heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials offer the potential to incorporate multiple functionalities, leveraging the aggregation effects of clusters and translating this heterogeneity and complexity into unexpected properties that are more than just the sum of their components. However, the rational construction of heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials remains challenging due to the complexity of metal cation coordination and structural unpredictability. This minireview provides insights into a general synthetic strategy based on Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory, summarizing its advantages in the designed synthesis of discrete heterometallic clusters (intracluster assembly) and infinite heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials (intercluster assembly). Furthermore, it emphasizes the potential to exploit the intrinsic properties of mixed components to achieve breakthroughs across a broad range of applications. The insights from this review are expected to drive the progress of heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials in a controllable and predictable manner.

         <title>Fundamentals and Challenges of Ligand Modification in Heterogeneous Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By systematically reviewing the ligand modification strategy from both the mechanistic and applicable scenarios towards heterogeneous electrocatalysis, this work aims to propose methodological guidance from the preparation of ligand&#8208;modified catalysts and the regulation of interfacial properties, thus providing a potential protocol for promoting in&#8208;depth research and further applications of ligand&#8208;modified catalytic systems.







Abstract
The development of efficient catalytic materials in the energy field could promote the structural transformation from traditional fossil fuels to sustainable energy. In heterogeneous catalytic reactions, ligand modification is an effective way to regulate both electronic and steric structures of catalytic sites, thus paving a prospective avenue to design the interfacial structures of heterogeneous catalysts for energy conversion. Although great achievements have been obtained for the study and applications of heterogeneous ligand&#8208;modified catalysts, the systematical refinements of ligand modification strategies are still lacking. Here, we reviewed the ligand modification strategy from both the mechanistic and applicable scenarios by focusing on heterogeneous electrocatalysis. We elucidated the ligand&#8208;modified catalysts in detail from the perspectives of basic concepts, preparation, regulation of physicochemical properties of catalytic sites, and applications in different electrocatalysis. Notably, we bridged the electrocatalytic performance with the electronic/steric effects induced by ligand modification to gain intrinsic structure&#8208;performance relations. We also discussed the challenges and future perspectives of ligand modification strategies in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Actuation Performance and Versatility of Photothermally Driven Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to photochemical reactions, which are the conventional mechanisms used to actuate photomechanical crystals, both the photothermal effect and natural vibration allow all crystals to absorb light at higher speeds over a wider range of light wavelengths, from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared. These two novel mechanisms could advance the research on photomechanical crystals from the field of fundamental chemistry to engineering and applied research.







Abstract
Photomechanical crystals exhibit mechanical motion upon light irradiation and may thus find applications as actuators. Over the last decades, many photomechanical organic crystals have been developed, commonly via photochemical reactions, particularly photoisomerization. However, photochemical crystal actuation is associated with several drawbacks, including a limited number of available crystals, slow actuation speed (&lt;5&#8197;Hz), and narrow wavelength range (&lt;550&#8197;nm). Such constraints have hindered the widespread use of crystals as actuation materials. In this minireview, we focus on crystal actuation by employing more universal physical phenomena (the photothermal effect and photothermally resonated natural vibration) and quantitatively evaluate actuation performance. Both mechanisms, particularly the latter, outperformed conventional photomechanical crystal activation in terms of both speed (maximum: 1,350&#8197;Hz) and the useful wavelength range (ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared). The oscillation frequencies of the crystals exceeded those of polymers, efficiently filling the gap between soft and hard materials. Both the photothermal effect and natural vibration can actuate any crystal that absorbs light. These two versatile physical actuation mechanisms could expand 40&#8197;years of research on photomechanical crystals&#8212;which had been based on photochemical reactions&#8212;from the realm of chemistry into engineering and lead to their practical applications in actuators and soft robots.

         <title>Resolving Structures of Paramagnetic Systems in Chemistry and Materials Science by Solid&#8208;State NMR: The Revolving Power of Ultra&#8208;Fast MAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) over 100&#8197;kHz has transformed solid&#8208;state NMR for biomolecules but struggled with paramagnetic powders due to rotor size and sensitivity issues. Advances now permit routine analysis of sensitive samples, enhancing spectral resolution and overcoming past limitations. This enables precise characterization of paramagnetic systems&#8242; structures and properties, crucial for catalysts and battery materials, demonstrated on various complex materials.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (100+kHz) has revolutionized solid&#8208;state NMR of biomolecular systems but has so far failed to gain ground for the analysis of paramagnetic organic and inorganic powders, despite the potential rewards from substantially improved spectral resolution. The principal blockages are that the smaller fast&#8208;spinning rotors present significant barriers for sample preparation, particularly for air/moisture&#8208;sensitive systems, and are associated with low sensitivity from the reduced sample volumes. Here, we demonstrate that the sensitivity penalty is less severe than expected for highly paramagnetic solids and is more than offset by the associated improved resolution. While previous approaches employing slower MAS are often unsuccessful in providing sufficient resolution, we show that ultra&#8208;fast 100+kHz MAS allows site&#8208;specific assignments of all resonances from complex paramagnetic solids. Combined with more reliable rotor materials and handling methods, this opens the way to the routine characterization of geometry and electronic structures of functional paramagnetic systems in chemistry, including catalysts and battery materials. We benchmark this approach on a hygroscopic luminescent Tb3+ complex, an air&#8208;sensitive homogeneous high&#8208;spin Fe2+ catalyst, and a series of mixed Fe2+/Mn2+/Mg2+ olivine&#8208;type cathode materials.

&lt;p&gt;Ultra-fast magic-angle spinning (100+kHz) has revolutionized solid-state NMR of biomolecular systems but has so far failed to gain ground for the analysis of paramagnetic organic and inorganic powders, despite the potential rewards from substantially improved spectral resolution. The principal blockages are that the smaller fast-spinning rotors present significant barriers for sample preparation, particularly for air/moisture-sensitive systems, and are associated with low sensitivity from the reduced sample volumes. Here, we demonstrate that the sensitivity penalty is less severe than expected for highly paramagnetic solids and is more than offset by the associated improved resolution. While previous approaches employing slower MAS are often unsuccessful in providing sufficient resolution, we show that ultra-fast 100+kHz MAS allows site-specific assignments of all resonances from complex paramagnetic solids. Combined with more reliable rotor materials and handling methods, this opens the way to the routine characterization of geometry and electronic structures of functional paramagnetic systems in chemistry, including catalysts and battery materials. We benchmark this approach on a hygroscopic luminescent Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complex, an air-sensitive homogeneous high-spin Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst, and a series of mixed Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; olivine-type cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Indolyl Ketosulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolyl sulfoxonium ylides are presented as a new type of monoaryl axially chiral framework. To access this intriguing scaffold, a chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed enantioselective iodoaminocyclization reaction of ortho&#8208;aminophenylethynyl sulfoxonium ylides was developed. The optically enriched atropoisomers can be transformed into diverse chiral structures.







Abstract
Despite recent advancements in the catalytic generation of axial chirality, reports on non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers remain limited because of the stringent steric requirements necessary to establish effective rotational brakes. Herein, we present a novel class of monoaryl atropisomers, indolyl ketosulfoxonium ylides, and describe an organocatalytic protocol for their synthesis. We discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) serves as an effective catalyst for the highly enantioselective iodination of ortho&#8208;aminophenylethynyl sulfoxonium ylides. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a strong preference for the intended iodination process over the competing protonation was observed. Subsequently, intramolecular amide cyclization enabled the formation of sterically congested indole fragments. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of the products was demonstrated by showcasing versatile transformations into other chiral scaffolds with complete retention of optical purity.

         <title>Atom&#8208;Efficient Synthesis of Trimethine Cyanines Using Formaldehyde as a Single&#8208;Carbon Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For Cy3 synthesis, single&#8208;carbon reagents have low atom efficiency owing to large molecular weights. A new atom&#8208;efficient method using formaldehyde, the simplest single&#8208;carbon reagent, is presented. In this method, symmetrical and unsymmetrical Cy3 derivatives could be synthesized by efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis.







Abstract
Herein, we present an innovative and atom&#8208;efficient synthesis of trimethine cyanines (Cy3) using formaldehyde (FA) as a single&#8208;carbon reagent. The widespread application of Cy3 dyes in bioimaging and genomics/proteomics is often limited by synthetic routes plagued by low atom economy and substantial side&#8208;product formation. Through systematic investigation, we have developed a practical and efficient synthetic pathway for both symmetrical and unsymmetrical Cy3 derivatives, significantly minimizing resource utilization. Notably, this approach yields water as the by&#8208;product, in alignment with sustainable chemistry principles. Moreover, the efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis facilitates the detection of intracellular FA levels, utilizing the fluorescence signal of Cy3 in live cells. It is also possible to detect endogenous FA in the intestinal tissues. We observed a significant decrease in FA in the small intestine of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mice as compared to healthy mice. This methodological advancement not only enhances the scope of fluorescent dye synthesis but also contributes to sustainable practices within chemical manufacturing, offering a significant leap forward in the development of environmentally friendly synthetic strategies.

         <title>Generation of Triplet States by Host&#8208;Stabilized Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for the Construction of Efficient Supramolecular Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation efficiency and lifetime of triplet state can be clearly promoted by the host&#8208;stabilized through&#8208;space conjugation, contributing to the fabrication of highly efficient photocatalytic system. The supramolecular photocatalyst exhibits excellent performance in catalytic oxidation of thioether and aromatic alcohol. It shows high catalytic performance in the photodegradation of lignin owing to the ultra&#8208;stable host&#8211;guest complexation.







Abstract
Promoting the generation of triplet states is essential for developing efficient photocatalytic systems. This research presents a novel approach of host&#8208;stabilized through&#8208;space conjugation via the combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent methods. The designed building block, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4(1,4)&#8208;dibenzene cyclohexaphane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl)bis(1&#8208;phenylpyridinium) chloride, features inherently stable through&#8208;space conjugation. When this block forms a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complex with cucurbit[8]uril, the through&#8208;space conjugation is further stabilized within the confined cavity. Both the generation and lifetime of triplet state are significantly increased, resulting from the host&#8208;stabilized through&#8208;space conjugation. Additionally, the ultrahigh binding constant of 6.58&#215;1014&#8197;M&#8722;1 ensures the persistence of host&#8208;stabilization effect. As a result, the host&#8211;guest complex acts as a highly efficient catalyst in the photocatalytic oxidation of thioether and aromatic alcohol. In the photodegradation of lignin, a complex natural product, the host&#8211;guest complex also exhibits high efficiency, demonstrating its robustness. This line of research is anticipated to enrich the toolbox of supramolecular photochemistry and provide a strategy for fabricating efficient supramolecular photocatalysts.

A new approach for highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes and aldehydes promoted by a readily available cobalt&#8208;based catalyst was developed. This protocol represents the first example of cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes and aldehydes in a 1,2&#8208;addition fashion, enabling simultaneous construction of central and axial stereogenicity as well as deuterated stereogenic centers.







Abstract
Catalytic regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes and aldehydes through regio&#8208; and enantioselective oxidative cyclization followed by regio&#8208; and diastereoselective protonation promoted by a chiral phosphine&#8208;cobalt complex is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis that enable selective transformation of the more substituted alkene in 1,3&#8208;dienes, affording a broad scope of bishomoallylic alcohols without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of sensitive organometallic reagents in up to 98&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 regioselectivity, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er.

Adjusting the length of rod&#8208;shaped dinucleobase molecules allows fine control on the pore diameter of self&#8208;assembled nanotubes, which are produced by coupling cooperative noncovalent processes of different hierarchy and acting in orthogonal directions: Watson&#8211;Crick H&#8208;bonding macrocyclization and supramolecular polymerization.







Abstract
Tubular self&#8208;assembled architectures are highly appealing supramolecular objects that participate in diverse essential biological processes. Controlling with precision their dimensions, and in particular their pore diameter, is a key objective to develop the full applied potential of these structures. Here, using a strategy that relies on the controlled supramolecular polymerization of Watson&#8211;Crick H&#8208;bonded macrocycles, we target the assembly of 3 sets of nanotubes in which pore diameter is finely controlled from 1.8, to 3.2 and to 4.3&#8197;nm. This is simply done by elongating the oligo(phenylene&#8208;ethynylene) block placed in between guanine and cytosine nucleobases in the monomer. Moreover, this structural change leads to a gradual reduction in the chelate cooperativity of the cyclization process and, at the same time, to an enhancement in the tendency of the macrocycles to stack, which critically influences the coupling between these consecutive supramolecular processes.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Characterization of 4&#960;&#8208;Electron M&#246;bius Aromatic System of a 1,2&#8208;Digermacyclobutadiene&#8224;</title>

         <dc:description>
Remarkable M&#246;bius aromatic character in the 4&#960;&#8208;electron cyclic conjugated system of an isolated 1,2&#8208;digermacyclobutadiene derivative was revealed by the experimental valence&#8208;electron&#8208;density&#8208;distribution (EDD) analysis and theoretical studies.







Abstract
We present the visualization of the experimental valence electron&#8208;density distribution (EDD) in the isolated 1,2&#8208;digermacyclobutadiene ring system, revealing the unique 4&#960; electron&#8208;delocalization on the four&#8208;membered Ge2C2 ring. A remarkably high M&#246;bius 4&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic character in the Ge2C2 ring can be suggested from theoretical calculations, in sharp contrast to the significant antiaromaticity of the all&#8208;carbon cyclobutadiene ring.

         <title>Photoinduced Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Sulfonylation of Allylic C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a photocatalytic approach that accommodates both cyclic and acyclic internal alkenes with diverse substitution patterns and electronic properties. Importantly, the obtained allylic sulfones can be readily diversified into a wide range of products, thus enabling formal alkene transposition and all&#8208;carbon quaternary center formation through the sequential C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Allylic sulfones are valuable motifs due to their medicinal and biological significance and their versatile chemical reactivities. While direct allylic C&#8722;H sulfonylation represents a straightforward and desirable approach, these methods are primarily restricted to terminal alkenes, leaving the engagement of the internal counterparts a formidable challenge.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Clusteroluminescence Enabled by Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for In Vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;Photon clusteroluminescence (with emission wavelength up to 688&#8197;nm) was achieved in small clusteroluminogens (CLgens) with only two isolated heteroatomic units through the efficient and n&#8208;electron&#8208;involved through&#8208;space conjugation, which promotes the in vivo bioimaging of CLgens with excellent biocompatibility.







Abstract
Clusteroluminescence (CL) materials without largely conjugated structures have gained significant attention due to their unique photophysical properties and potential in bioimaging. However, low luminescence efficiency and short emission wavelength limit their development. This work designs three luminogens with CL properties (CLgens) by introducing n&#8208;electron&#8208;involved through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) into diarylmethane. Apart from single&#8208;photon excited long&#8208;wavelength (686&#8197;nm) and high&#8208;efficiency (29&#8201;%) CL, two&#8208;photon clusteroluminescence (TPCL) is successfully achieved in such small luminogens with only two isolated heteroatomic units. TSC stabilized in the aggregate state has been proven to realize efficient spatial electron delocalization similar to conventionally conjugated compounds. Encouraged by the excellent TPCL properties, two&#8208;photon imaging of blood vessels in vivo and biocompatibility verification utilizing CLgens are also achieved. This work illustrates the essential role of TSC in promoting nonlinear optical properties of CLgens and may facilitate further design and development of the next generation of bioprobes with excellent biocompatibility.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with p&#8208;Block Metals Surpass Transition&#8208;Metal Counterparts in the Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the catalytic potential of p&#8208;block metal single&#8208;atom catalysts for oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide, highlighting their superior performance over transition metals. The findings underscore the role of optimized p&#8208;p hybridization in enhancing electron transfer and reducing energy barriers, offering promising sustainable alternatives in catalytic applications.







Abstract
Growing interest in p&#8208;block metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (PM&#8208;SACs) is driven by their low toxicity, economic viability, and transition metal&#8208;like catalytic properties. However, selection criteria for p&#8208;block single&#8208;atom species and catalytic mechanisms of PM&#8208;SACs remain unclear. This study explores the catalytic abilities of PM&#8208;SACs and their transition metal counterparts (TM&#8208;SACs) based on polymetric carbon nitride (PCN) for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Using thermodynamic barriers as a key descriptor, it was found that PM&#8208;SACs can surpass TM&#8208;SACs in H2O2 production due to a lower energy barrier for *OOH intermediate formation resulting from optimized p&#8208;p hybridization. Specifically, Sb&#8208;SAC based on PCN shows the highest apparent quantum yield of 35.3&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. This study offers a rationale for the utilization of p&#8208;block SACs in the context of sustainable chemical synthesis.

Cycloalkyl imidazole dimers have been used to generate biomimetic water channels through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions with superior water net permeability as well as ion rejection. This work will bring more possibilities for the design of artificial water channels with attached cycloalkyl components, and further may have applications in practical membrane support for water treatment.







Abstract
Artificial water channels (AWCs) have been extensively explored to mimic natural proteins, which enables to effectively transport water while blocking ions. As one of the first AWCs, self&#8208;assembled I&#8208;quartets (HCx) have showcased high water&#8208;permselectivity that can be enhanced by improving their distribution and stability within membrane. The use of long alkyl chains (n&gt;8) is constrained by their low solubility and aggregation. Herein, we considered cycloalkyl moieties, explored for the increase of the solubility favoring enhanced partition and/ for their self&#8208;assembly behaviors resulting the formation of effective stable water&#8208;channels with increased water permeability in bilayer membranes. This class of cycloalkyl&#8208;ureido&#8208;ethyl&#8208;imidazole amphiphilic (CxUH) channel could serve as a new reference for the effective design of self&#8208;assembled artificial water channels, it may give rise to the applications in desalination or in water treatment.

LAMP&#8208;MS integrates linear amplification with quantitative nucleic acid mass spectrometry. Using LAMP&#8208;MS, we could visually distinguish 5&#8197;mC stoichiometries in cfDNA samples from healthy individuals and CRC patients.







Abstract
Enhancing the effectiveness of utilizing circulating cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) for disease screening remains a challenge, necessitating improved sensitivity, specificity, cost&#8208;efficiency, and patient adherence. We present here LAMP&#8208;MS, an innovative technology that integrates linear amplification with single&#8208;base quantitative nucleic acid mass spectrometry on silicon chips. This approach overcomes several limitations in utilizing cfDNA 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) status for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. LAMP&#8208;MS enables unbiased amplification of as little as 1&#8197;ng of cfDNA, site&#8208;specifically quantify methylation levels of multiple 5&#8197;mC sites, thereby facilitating cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;resolution quantitative detection of cfDNA methylation markers. We have validated the accuracy of DNA methylation determination using DNA probes and cfDNA from patient plasma samples, confirmed by mass spectrometric peak areas. Additionally, we have further shown this Mass Array technology could be expanded to also quantify RNA m6A modification sites. Combining the ability to work with ultra&#8208;low input materials and a visually interpretable output, LAMP&#8208;MS stands out as a promising method for real&#8208;world applications in clinics and laboratories for nucleic acid methylation detection and quantification.

         <title>Promoting Water Dissociation and Weakening Active Hydrogen Adsorption to Boost the Hydrogen Transfer Reaction over a Cu&#8722;Ag Superlattice Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of H*(H2O)x as a mediator is proposed to deliver a hydrogen transfer reaction (HTR) pathway for overcoming the traditional scaling relationship for electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (EHRs) using H2O. A Cu&#8722;Ag alloy with a superlattice structure (sl&#8208;CuAg) site is then designed to enhance water dissociation while ensuring weak *H adsorption at the active site to enable the HTR mechanism. This material could be utilized in acetylene semihydrogenation to ethylene to simultaneously increase its activity and selectivity.







Abstract
The prerequisite for electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (EHRs) is H2O splitting to form surface hydrogen species (*H), which occupy catalytic sites and lead to mismatched coverage of *H and reactants, resulting in unsatisfactory activity and selectivity. Thus, modulating the splitting pathway of H2O is significant for optimizing the EHR process. Herein, a Cu&#8722;Ag alloy with a superlattice structure of staggered&#8208;ordered Cu and Ag is theoretically predicted and experimentally proven to undergo a pathway for H2O splitting called the hydrogen transfer reaction (HTR) in the water layer, which involves the formation of *H, the capture of *H by a water cluster to form H*(H2O)x and subsequent hydrogenation reactions by H*(H2O)x. Taking acetylene hydrogenation as a model case, the as&#8208;proposed HTR pathway could lead to a relaxation hydrogenation process to modulate the matching degree of C2H2 and *H, thus enabling a 91.2&#8201;% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency at a partial current density of 0.38&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, greatly outperforming its counterpart without a superlattice structure.

         <title>Red Blood Cell&#8208;Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles Inhibit Influenza Virus through Surface&#8208;Displayed Sialic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cell&#8208;derived small extracellular vesicles (RBC sEVs) inhibit influenza virus infection by binding to the viral hemagglutinin (HA) via surface&#8208;displayed sialic acids (SAs). Acting as nanodecoys, RBC sEVs prevent viral attachment to host cells, effectively blocking infection. Removal of SAs from RBC sEVs significantly reduces their antiviral efficacy, highlighting the importance of SA&#8208;HA binding.







Abstract
Disrupting the conserved multivalent binding of hemagglutinin (HA) on influenza A virus (IAV) to sialic acids (SAs) on the host cell membrane offers a robust strategy to block viral attachment and infection, irrespective of antigenic evolution or drug resistance. In this study, we exploit red blood cell&#8208;derived small extracellular vesicles (RBC sEVs) as nanodecoys by harnessing their high abundance of surface&#8208;displayed SAs to interact with IAV through multivalent HA&#8208;SA interactions. This high&#8208;avidity binding inhibits viral adhesion to the cell surface, effectively preventing both attachment and infection in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. Notably, enzymatic removal of SAs from RBC sEVs significantly diminishes their anti&#8208;IAV efficacy. Our findings indicate that RBC sEVs possess intrinsic anti&#8208;IAV properties due to their native multivalent SAs and hold considerable promise as antiviral therapeutics.

         <title>Catalytic N&#8208;Formylation of CO2 by Atomically Precise Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ Clusters into a Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report an atomically precise Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ cluster with a highly robust structure that can catalyze the CO2 hydrogenation coupled with o&#8208;phenylenediamine to synthesize benzimidazole and can further react with Zn(NO3)2 for the feasible synthesis of a new two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework.







Abstract
By highly efficient ligand&#8208;exchange strategy, atomically precise Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+ (PPh3=triphenylphosphine) cluster can be transformed into a Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ (DPPF=1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) cluster that can maintain the atomic&#8208;packing structure but overcome the lability of Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+. Catalytic evaluation for the CO2 hydrogenation coupled with o&#8208;phenylenediamine demonstrates that the Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ catalyst can remarkably enhance both activity and stability compared to the Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+ catalyst. More notably, the direct construction of a two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (2D MOF) can be elaborately accomplished in the formylation process of o&#8208;phenylenediamine, CO2 and H2 with zinc nitrate enabled by the Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ catalyst. The 2D MOF further enables the capture and transformation of CO2 to combine in the organic synthesis with epoxides under mild conditions. This work provides opportunities for creating highly active cluster sites for the chemical recycling of CO2.

&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (DPPF=1,1&#8242;-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) cluster that can maintain the atomic-packing structure but overcome the lability of Au&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Catalytic evaluation for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation coupled with o-phenylenediamine demonstrates that the Au&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(DPPF)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst can remarkably enhance both activity and stability compared to the Au&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst. More notably, the direct construction of a two-dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (2D MOF) can be elaborately accomplished in the formylation process of o-phenylenediamine, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with zinc nitrate enabled by the Au&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(DPPF)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst. The 2D MOF further enables the capture and transformation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to combine in the organic synthesis with epoxides under mild conditions. This work provides opportunities for creating highly active cluster sites for the chemical recycling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dinitrogen Reduction and Functionalization by a Siloxide Supported Thulium&#8208;Potassium Complex for the Formation of Ammonia or Hydrazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxide ligands promote dinitrogen (N2) reduction by Tm(II) ions yielding an N22&#8722; bridged complex that can be further reduced to yield a complex showing a rare triply reduced N23&#8722; radical bound by two Tm and three K cations, that facilitate N2 functionalization by electrophiles (H+, Me+) and N&#8722;C bond formation to yield an Me2N22&#8722; complex.







Abstract
The dinitrogen (N2) chemistry of lanthanides remains less developed compared to the d&#8208;block metals and lanthanide&#8208;promoted N2 functionalization chemistry in well&#8208;defined lanthanide complexes remains elusive. Here we report the synthesis and characterization (SQUID, EPR, DFT, X&#8208;Ray) of the siloxide supported heterobimetallic (Tm/K) complexes [{KTm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (1) and [K3{Tm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] (2). Complex 2 provides a rare example of a metal complex of the triply reduced N23&#8722; radical. The structure of 2 differs from the few previously reported N23&#8722; complexes as it presents two Tm and three K cations binding the N23&#8722; radical, facilitating N2 functionalization. Notably, the K3Tm2&#8208;bound N23&#8722; moiety reacts with excess H+ to form NH4Cl in 18&#8201;% yield, and with MeOTf at room temperature to yield the dimethyl hydrazido complex [K2{Tm(OSi(OtBu)3)3}2(&#956;&#8208;(CH3)NN(CH3))] (3). Protonolysis of 3 yields MeHN&#8722;NMeH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2HCl in 18&#8201;% yield.

         <title>High&#8208;Yielding Nanobelt Formation by Chirality&#8208;Assisted Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis is used to create chiral and enantiopure annulated nanobelts from their chiral precursors via a one&#8208;pot self&#8208;condensation process in 84&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;persistent conjugated nanobelts (CNBs) are fascinating synthetic targets. However, in most cases these are made in low overall yields by applying strategies of macrocyclization followed by (multiple) ring fusion reactions for nanobelt formation. Here, we describe the high yielding synthesis of enantiopure chiral nanobelts in 84&#8201;% yield by applying chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis (CAS). The chiral nanobelts were investigated by UV/Vis and CD spectroscopy. By DFT calculations the aromaticity of these structures is discussed.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Ray Driven Aqueous&#8208;Phase Methane Conversions into Complex Molecules up to Glycine</title>

         <dc:description>
&#947;&#8208;Ray is capable of driving an aqueous&#8208;phase CH4+H2O+O2 conversion selectively into CH3COOH via &#8901;CH3 and &#8901;OH radical intermediates, and driving an aqueous&#8208;phase CH3COOH+NH3 conversion into NH2CH2COOH via &#8901;CH2COOH and &#8901;NH2 radical intermediates. Such &#947;&#8208;ray driven aqueous&#8208;phase methane conversions probably play an important role in the formation network of complex organic molecules in the universe, and provides a strategy to convert abundant CH4 into value&#8208;added products at mild conditions.







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of initial evolutions of molecules in the universe is of great interest and importance. CH4 is one of the abundant simple molecules in the universe. Herein we report &#947;&#8208;ray, high&#8208;energy photons commonly existing in cosmic rays and unstable isotope decay, as an external energy to efficiently drives aqueous&#8208;phase CH4 conversions to various products with the presence of oxygen at room temperature. Glycine also forms with an additional introduction of ammonia. Both CH4 conversions and product distributions are modified by solid granules, and a CH3COOH selectivity as high as 82&#8201;% is obtained when SiO2 is added. Our results point to &#947;&#8208;ray driven aqueous&#8208;phase CH4 conversions as a likely formation network of initial complex organic compounds in the universe and offer an alternative strategy for efficiently utilizing CH4 as the carbon source to produce value&#8208;added products at mild conditions, a long&#8208;standing challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Unveiling the Aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C Single Atoms into Highly Efficient MOOH Nanoclusters during Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The activation and aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C (M=Ni, Fe, and Co) single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are demonstrated. In this process, both N and supported carbon are severely oxidized, leading to the destruction of M&#8722;N bonds. Through a dissolution&#8208;redeposition mechanism, the isolated M atoms finally aggregate to form MOOH nanoclusters. MOOH nanoclusters with a carbon support are responsible for the enhanced OER activity.







Abstract
M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;type single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are highly efficient for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

&lt;p&gt;The activation and aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C (M=Ni, Fe, and Co) single-atom electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are demonstrated. In this process, both N and supported carbon are severely oxidized, leading to the destruction of M&#8722;N bonds. Through a dissolution-redeposition mechanism, the isolated M atoms finally aggregate to form MOOH nanoclusters. MOOH nanoclusters with a carbon support are responsible for the enhanced OER activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M&#8722;N&#8722;C-type single-atom catalysts (SACs) are highly efficient for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). And the isolated metal atoms are usually considered real active sites.

         <title>Gold Coordination&#8208;Accelerated Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emission for Efficient Solution&#8208;Processible Ultrapure Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 1, January 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient solution&#8208;processed ultrapure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been achieved using non&#8208;sensitized multi&#8208;resonance emitters. The coordination with two gold&#8208;carbene moieties leads to significantly accelerated thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Meanwhile, the color purity and emission efficiencies of the parental B/N based polycyclic core are essentially unaffected by the gold coordination.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) type emitters have emerged as highly promising candidates for high&#8208;resolution organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emissions with simultaneous short excited state lifetimes and ultrapure blue color (a CIEy close to 0.046 and an emission peak &gt;440&#8197;nm) have rarely been obtained for MR emitters. Herein, we report a design of dual gold&#8208;coordinated MR molecules to achieve efficient and short&#8208;lived ultrapure blue TADF emission. The dinuclear Au(I) complex, namely iPrAuBN, shows a narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission with a peak maximum of 448&#8197;nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#8197;nm in doped film. The coordination with two Au atoms significantly shortens the delayed fluorescence lifetime to 7.8&#8197;&#956;s in comparison to 60.6&#8197;&#956;s for the parental organic analogue. Solution&#8208;processed OLED doped with iPrAuBN demonstrates an ultrapure blue electroluminescence with a peak maximum of 442&#8197;nm, a FWHM of 19&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates of (0.154, 0.036), and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 14.8&#8201;%.

         <title>Mechanochromic Displays Based on Photoswitchable Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>

Mechanochromic intricate pictures with striking structural colors are imprinted in cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers by using a chiral isosorbide molecular photoswitch.







Abstract
Stimuli responsive optical materials are attractive for many areas, from healthcare to art design. However, creating intricate color&#8208;changing patterns for visual information is still a challenge. This work describes the preparation of mechanochromic structural colored intricate pictures imprinted in cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers by using a chiral isosorbide molecular photoswitch. The photoswitch contains a photoisomerizable cinnamate moiety and was incorporated in a main chain liquid crystal oligomer with photopolymerizable acrylate end groups. After coating, the structural colored film was irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light in air causing E/Z isomerization of the cinnamate units leading to a redshift of the structural color of the film. A grayscale photomask was used to spatially control the photoisomerization reaction and imprint colorful pictures such as portraits and landscapes, in the cholesteric liquid crystal films with high resolution. Photopolymerization in a nitrogen atmosphere led to a mechanochromic cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer with striking structural colors that blueshift upon strain. The sharp details of the patterns were preserved even under deformation and the system returned to the initial state upon strain removal. Our work offers a simple photoswitch approach to prepare stimuli responsive optical polymers imprinted with color&#8208;changing pictures of unprecedented complexity.

         <dc:description>
Novel efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with regular folded sandwich configurations are constructed using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge, xanthone as acceptor, and dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran, 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;JK]carbazole as donors. They can function efficiently as emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, providing high electroluminescence efficiencies of up to 30.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
Constructing folded molecular structures is emerging as a promising strategy to develop efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Most folded TADF materials have V&#8208;shaped configurations formed by donors and acceptors linked on carbazole or fluorene bridges. In this work, a facile molecular design strategy is proposed for exploring sandwich&#8208;structured molecules, and a series of novel and robust TADF materials with regular U&#8208;shaped sandwich conformations are constructed by using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge, xanthone as acceptor, and dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran, 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;JK]carbazole as donors. They hold outstanding thermal stability with ultrahigh decomposition temperatures (556&#8211;563&#8201;&#176;C), and exhibit fast delayed fluorescence and excellent photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (86&#8201;%&#8211;97&#8201;%). The regular and close stacking of acceptor and donors results in rigidified molecular structures with efficient through&#8208;space interaction, which are conducive to suppressing intramolecular motion and reducing reorganized excited&#8208;state energy. The organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using them as emitters exhibit excellent electroluminescence performances, with maximum external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.6&#8201;%, which is a leading value for the OLEDs based on folded TADF emitters. These results demonstrate the proposed strategy of employing 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge for planar donors and acceptors to construct efficient folded TADF materials is applicable.

Despite over a century of synthetic efforts, direct alkylation and alkenylation at the C3&#8722;H position of a wide array of quinoline precursors remain challenging. This report outlines the first successful quinoline C3&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation reactions, exhibiting exceptional regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity under redox&#8208;neutral and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Conversion of quinoline C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8722;C bonds is essential for obtaining the enormous array of derivatives required for pharmaceutical and agrochemical development. Despite over a century of synthetic efforts, direct alkylation and alkenylation at C3&#8722;H positions in a wide array of quinoline precursors remain predominantly challenging and elusive. This report outlines the first successful quinoline C3&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation reactions, exhibiting exceptional regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, all achieved under redox&#8208;neutral and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The method involves a three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot or two&#8208;pot sequence, including 1,4&#8208;dearomative addition, functionalization at C3, and elimination or transalkylation to produce 3&#8208;alkylated/alkenylated quinolines. The presence of a carbonyl group in these products allows for further synthetic manipulations, enabling the production of cyanides, amides, amines, and simple alkyl derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;Conversion of quinoline C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8722;C bonds is essential for obtaining the enormous array of derivatives required for pharmaceutical and agrochemical development. Despite over a century of synthetic efforts, direct alkylation and alkenylation at C3&#8722;H positions in a wide array of quinoline precursors remain predominantly challenging and elusive. This report outlines the first successful quinoline C3&#8722;H alkylation and alkenylation reactions, exhibiting exceptional regio- and stereoselectivity, all achieved under redox-neutral and transition-metal-free conditions. The method involves a three-step, one-pot or two-pot sequence, including 1,4-dearomative addition, functionalization at C3, and elimination or transalkylation to produce 3-alkylated/alkenylated quinolines. The presence of a carbonyl group in these products allows for further synthetic manipulations, enabling the production of cyanides, amides, amines, and simple alkyl derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Herein, we report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H arylation of peptides directed by an amidoxime ether, which can be easily incorporated into peptides at any amide bond. Site&#8208; and stereoselective arylation of peptides has been achieved, including an unprecedented example of C&#8211;H arylation of an internal residue. Removal of the amidoxime ether was achieved to generate the parent amide and facilitate a traceless C&#8211;H functionalization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photomodulated Transient Catalytic Constitutional Dynamic Networks and Reaction Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method to photomodulate dynamically transient DNA&#8208;based reaction circuits and networks is introduced. The method relies on the integration of photoresponsive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;phosphate ester&#8208;caged DNA hairpin with a &#8220;mute&#8221; reaction module. Photodeprotection (&#955; = 365 nm) of the hairpin structure separates a fuel strand triggering the dynamic, transient, operation of the DNA circuit/network. By temporal photocleavage of the hairpin within the course of transient operation of the circuit, photomodulation of the systems are demonstrated. The modulation amplitude and rhythms are controlled by the time&#8208;interval and cycle numbers of photo&#8208;deprotecting the hairpin structure. The method is applied to transiently photomodulate the catalytic activities of a DNAzyme, enabling the photomodulation of the transient assembly of a constitutional dynamic network (CDN) and the transient reconfiguration of the CDN framework. The different systems are supported by computational kinetic models allowing to predict, and experimentally validate, the behavior of the systems under variable auxiliary conditions. Moreover, the photomodulated transient CDNs are implemented as functional frameworks guiding the thrombin&#8208;catalyzed coagulation of fibrinogen to fibrin (fibrinogenesis) and photomodulated operation of a biocatalytic cascade.</dc:description>

         <title>A Zero&#8208;gap Electrolyzer Enables Supporting Electrolyte&#8208;free Seawater Splitting for Energy&#8208;saving Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;assisted direct seawater splitting (DSS) technologies are actively studied as a promising route to produce green hydrogen (H2), whereas the indispensable use of supporting electrolytes that help to extract water and provide electrochemically&#8208;accelerated reaction media results in a severe energy penalty, consuming up to 12.5% of energy input when using a typical KOH electrolyte. We bypass this issue by designing a zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer configuration based on the integration of cation exchange membrane and bipolar membrane assemblies, which protects stable DSS operation against the precipitates and corrosion in the absence of additional supporting electrolytes. The heterolytic water dissociation function of the bipolar membrane in&#8208;situ creates an asymmetric acidic&#8208;alkaline environment, kinetically facilitating H2 and O2 evolution reactions. When working in natural seawater without any chemical inputs, this zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer sustains nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency toward H2 for 120 h at a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. With the high&#8208;integrity merit, our electrolyzer can be facilely scaled up into practical cell stacks with significantly increased active area and promising prospects for volume/space&#8208;sensitive application scenarios. This electrolyzer concept opens an underexplored design space for energy&#8208;saving H2 production from low&#8208;grade saline water sources, being complementary to, and potentially competitive with the pre&#8208;purification schemes.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Decoupling Strategy for Metal Oxide&#8208;Based Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries Free of Crosstalk Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crosstalk of transition metal ions between the metal oxide cathode and Zn anode restricts the practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Herein, we propose a decoupled electrolyte (DCE) consisting of a nonaqueous&#8208;phase (N&#8208;phase) anolyte and an aqueous&#8208;phase (A&#8208;phase) catholyte to prevent the crosstalk of Mn2+, thus extending the lifespan of MnO2&#8208;based ZIBs. Experimental measurements and theoretical modelling verify that trimethyl phosphate (TMP) not only synergistically works with NH4Cl in the N&#8208;phase anolyte to enable fast Zn2+ conduction while block Mn2+ diffusion toward anode, but also modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure to suppress the dendrite formation and corrosion on Zn anode. Meanwhile, the A&#8208;phase catholyte effectively accelerates the cathode reaction kinetics. The as&#8208;developed Zn|DCE|MnO2 cell&#160;delivers 80.13% capacity retention after 900 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8208;1.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The crosstalk of transition metal ions between the metal oxide cathode and Zn anode restricts the practical applications of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). Herein, we propose a decoupled electrolyte (DCE) consisting of a nonaqueous-phase (N-phase) anolyte and an aqueous-phase (A-phase) catholyte to prevent the crosstalk of Mn2+, thus extending the lifespan of MnO2-based ZIBs. Experimental measurements and theoretical modelling verify that trimethyl phosphate (TMP) not only synergistically works with NH4Cl in the N-phase anolyte to enable fast Zn2+ conduction while block Mn2+ diffusion toward anode, but also modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure to suppress the dendrite formation and corrosion on Zn anode. Meanwhile, the A-phase catholyte effectively accelerates the cathode reaction kinetics. The as-developed Zn|DCE|MnO2 cell&#160;delivers 80.13% capacity retention after 900 cycles at 0.5 A g-1. This approach is applicable for other metal oxide cathode-based ZIBs, thereby opening a new avenue for developing ultrastable ZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Secupyritines A&#8210;C, Three Natural Propellane Securinega Alkaloids: Structure Elucidation and Total Synthesis Based on Biogenetic Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Secupyritines A&#8210;C are unique polycyclic Securinega alkaloids isolated from medicinal plant Flueggea suffruticosa. They feature a distinctive 6/6/6/5/6 fused pentacyclic ring system with a highly strained 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;6&#8208;aza[4.4.3]propellane core. Their structures with absolute configurations were elucidated through a comprehensive approach involving nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and total synthesis. The total synthesis of secupyritines A&#8210;C was achieved in 14 or 16 steps, employing a synthesis strategy based on biogenetic building blocks. Key elements of the synthetic procedures include a vinylogous Mannich&#8208;type reaction to construct the sp3&#8210;sp2 attached&#8208;ring system, a Suzuki coupling reaction to build the piperidine ring, and an intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition reaction to establish the propellane skeleton. Formal asymmetric synthesis of secupyritines A&#8210;C was also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;driven Oxygen Vacancy Diffusion and Healing on TiO2(110) at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding how TiO2 interacts with CO2 at the molecular level is crucial in the CO2 reduction toward value&#8208;added energy sources. Here, we report in&#8208;situ observations of the CO2 activation process on the reduced TiO2(110) surface at room temperature using ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy. We found that oxygen vacancies (Vo) diffuse dynamically along the bridging oxygen (Obr) rows of the TiO2(110) surface under ambient CO2(g) environments. This physical phenomenon exclusively occurs when the oxygen abstracted upon CO2 dissociation instantly occupies the Vo sites of Obr rows on the TiO2(110), whereas the TiO2(110) surface without the Vo only allows CO2 physisorption on five&#8208;fold&#8208;coordinated Ti4+ sites. Synchrotron&#8208;based ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy also identifies the changes in surface oxidation states of TiO2(110) by the healing of Vo sites or the CO2 physisorption under ambient CO2(g) conditions. Density functional theory calculations propose a mechanism of the CO2&#8208;driven Vo diffusion and the physisorbed CO2 configurations. Our combined results unravel the critical role of defect sites on TiO2 in determining the elementary step of CO2 activation during chemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolated Neutral Organic Radical Unveiled Solvent&#8208;Radical Interaction in Highly Reducing Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diffusion&#8208;limited kinetics is a key mechanistic debate when consecutive photoelectron transfer (conPET) is discussed in photoredox catalysis. In&#8208;situ generated organic photoactive radicals can access catalytic systems as reducing as alkaline metals that can activate remarkably stable bonds. However, in many cases, the extremely short&#8208;lived transient nature of these doublet state open&#8208;shell species has led to debatable mechanistic studies, hindering adoption and development. Herein, we document the use of an isolated and stable neutral organic nPrDMQA radical as a highly photoreducing species. The isolated radical offers a unique platform to investigate the mechanism behind the photocatalytic activity of organic photocatalyst radicals. The involvement of reduced solvent is observed, formed by single electron transfer (SET) between the short&#8208;lived excited state nPrDMQA radical and the solvent. In our detailed mechanistic studies, spectroscopic and chemical affirmation of solvent reduction is strongly evident. Reduction of aryl halides, including difluoroarenes is presented as a model study of the conPET method. Further, the activation of N2O, a greenhouse gas that is yet to be activated by photoredox catalysis, is showcased in the absence of a transition metal.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pronounced nucleophilicity in combination with a distinct redox non&#8208;innocence is a unique feature of a coordinated ligand, which in the current case, leads to unprecedented carbon&#8208;centered reactivity patterns: A carbodiphosphorane&#8208;based (CDP) pincer&#8208;type rhodium complex allows to cleave two C&#8211;Cl&#8208;bonds of geminal dichlorides via two consecutive SN2&#8208;type oxidative additions resulting in the formation of a stabilized carbene fragment. In the presence of a suitable reductant the carbene fragment can even be converted into olefines or hydrodehalogenation products in a catalytic reaction. The developed method can also be used to convert chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) such as CH2ClF to fluoromethane and methane. The strong nucleophilic character of coordinated CDPs is also reflected in the low potential for oxidation, which favors radical reactivity and gives rise to an unique cationic C&#8208;centered radical CDP ligand, which is capable of a carbon&#8208;centered dihydrogen activation, following an unprecedented radical mechanism involving ligand&#8208;ligand&#8208;cooperativity (LLC).</dc:description>

         <title>Conformationally Restricted Macrocycles as Improved FKBP51 Inhibitors Enabled by Systematic Linker Derivatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles are increasingly considered as promising modalities to target challenging intracellular proteins. However, strategies for transitioning from active linear starting points to improved macrocycles are still underdeveloped. Here we explored the derivatization of linkers as an approach for macrocycle optimization. Using the FK506&#8208;binding protein 51 (FKBP51) as a model system we prepared &gt;140 macrocycles with systematically derivatized linkers. Two backbones were identified as promising frameworks for subsequent optimization. Surprisingly, co&#8208;crystal structure analyses revealed that these chemical templates represent an ensemble of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) conformations that can give rise to several distinct 3D&#8208;scaffolds. This resulted in a set of macrocycles with consistently improved affinity, plasma stability, and aqueous solubility compared to the linear precursors or the non&#8208;functionalized macrocycles. Our results highlight linkers as an opportunity for macrocyclic drug development, show how linker derivatization can improve the performance of macrocycles, and emphasizes the need to track macrocyclic scaffold evolution at a three&#8208;dimensional level.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Defects as Highly Active Sites for Gold Detection and Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of precious metals (PMs) in many areas, such as printed circuit boards, catalysts, and target drugs, is increasing due to their unique physical and chemical properties, but their recovery remains a great challenge in terms of zero&#8208;valent PMs as final product. We report a highly hydrophilic carbon dot (CD) as reductant (electron donor), the defects in CD served as efficient active sites for zero&#8208;valent PMs recovery with an electron&#8208;donating capacity is ~1.7 mmol g&#8722;1. The reduction of gold follows a two&#8208;step dynamic model characterized by the formation of nano&#8208;gold nuclei (initial rapid electron transfer process) followed by an Ostwald ripening process (subsequent slow process). Finite element method (FEM) simulation shows that the reaction efficiency and confinement effect of AuCl4&#8722; ions is positively correlated with defect density, indicating that the quantitative control of carbon defect density is the key to enhancing reduction activity. Combing with density functional theory (DFT) with XPS and FTIR technology, we found that the electron was transferred from CD to Au(III) via hydrogen bonding. This nano carbon material can be exploited to recover gold from e&#8208;waste water directly, with the characteristics of reducing energy consumption and avoiding environmental pollution.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Plasticity and Binding Affinity Enhancement Controlled by Linker Derivatization in Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles are abundantly used by nature to enable cell&#8208;permeable bioactive molecules. Synthetic non&#8208;peptidic macrocycles are also increasingly considered as modalities for difficult&#8208;to&#8208;bind proteins but guidelines for macrocyclization are only beginning to emerge. Macrocycles are thought to constrain the available conformations but also to allow for residual flexibility, the latter being poorly understood. Here we show that even medium&#8208;sized macrocycles display an unexpected high conformational plasticity, even when bound to their protein target. Minor modification of the linker region of macrocycles can shift the conformational ensemble to distinct conformational subclasses, each constituting distinct three&#8208;dimensional scaffolds for further optimization. This led to several new ligands with improved affinity and beneficial physicochemical parameters for the FK506&#8208;binding protein 51, a promising target for depression, obesity and chronic pain. Importantly, none of the beneficial modifications could have been identified by classical medicinal chemistry as they only work in the macrocyclic context.
Our results show that macrocyclization can do more than keeping loose ends together but rather provide a platform for multiple series of macrocycles with distinct binding modes.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Isomeric Fulleropyrrolidines Enable Controlled Stacking of Perovskite Colloids for High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) has been severely hindered by the poor controllability of perovskite crystal growth and the energy level mismatch between the perovskite and fullerene&#8208;based electron transport layer (ETL). Here, we synthesized three cis&#8208;configured pyridyl&#8208;substituted fulleropyrrolidines (PPF), specifically 2&#8208;pyridyl (PPF2), 3&#8208;pyridyl (PPF3), and 4&#8208;pyridyl (PPF4), and utilized them as precursor additives to regulate the crystallization kinetics during film formation. The spatial distance between the two pyridine groups in PPF2, PPF3, and PPF4 increases sequentially, enabling PPF4 to interact with more perovskite colloidal particles. These interactions effectively enlarge the precursor colloid size and decelerate the crystallization rate of the perovskite, resulting in high&#8208;quality PPF4&#8208;based perovskite films with reduced defect density and lower exciton binding energy. Additionally, we incorporated a well&#8208;defined fullerene bis&#8208;adduct, C60BB, as an interlayer between the perovskite and PCBM layers to optimize energy level alignment. Through the synergistic effects of PPF4 and C60BB, our champion device achieved an efficiency of 16.05% (certified: 15.86%), surpassing the 16% efficiency bottleneck and setting a new benchmark for TPSCs. Moreover, the devices exhibited outstanding stability, retaining 99% of their initial efficiency after 600 hours of maximum power point tracking under 1 sun condition.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Supramolecular Nanoarchitectonics for Simultaneous Enhanced Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis in a Co&#8208;Assembly by a Biomimetic Isolation&#8208;Conduction Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two mutually exclusive physicochemical processes of photoluminescence and photocatalysis have been achieved simultaneously in a co&#8208;assembly by a biomimetic isolation&#8208;conduction strategy based on arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (A&#8722;P) interactions. The resultant co&#8208;assembly has been exploited to build a sequential fluoric wastewater reuse system for real&#8208;time fluorescence detection/removal of perfluorooctanoic acids (PFOA) and photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
Limited by the two mutually exclusive physicochemical processes of separation and recombination of photogenerated carriers, achieving photoluminescence and photocatalysis simultaneously is extremely challenging but essential for ever&#8208;growing complex issues and specialized scenarios. Here we proposed a biomimetic isolation&#8208;conduction strategy induced by an arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (A&#8722;P) interaction for enabling photoluminescence and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in the co&#8208;assembly of aromatic monomers and octafluoronapthalene (OFN). Inspired by the isolation&#8208;conduction effect of periodic isolation of myelin sheaths on the axons of vertebrate nerve fibers by node of Ranvier, we use OFN as a molecular isolator embedded in the aromatic monomers array to block the singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet pathway, while the enlarged intermolecular dipoles resulting from the A&#8722;P interactions facilitate the conduction of photogenerated carriers in the isolated regions. The resultant co&#8208;assembly exhibits an enhanced monomeric green emission compared to the corresponding monocomponent self&#8208;assembly with weak red emission. Meanwhile, it also has an enhanced photocatalytic HER performance with a rate of 2.45&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 15.2&#8197;times more than the self&#8208;assembled one. On this basis, a sequential fluoric wastewater reuse system that includes real&#8208;time fluorescence detection/removal of perfluorooctanoic acids and photocatalytic HER device is constructed.

         <title>Decoupling H2 and O2 Release in Particulate Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Using a Reversible O2 Binder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co(5&#8201;%)&#8208;HPCN/(rGO/Pt) consisting of photoresponsive chip (HPCN), H2 evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O2 ([Co(II)N4(H2O)2]2+) is constructed to achieve the decoupling of particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. Under UV irradiation, the photogenerated holes oxidize [Co(II)N4(H2O)2]2+ into [Co(III)N4(O2&#8722;)]2+ and H+, while the photogenerated electrons transfer to Pt through rGO for reduction of H+ to H2. Under visible irradiation, [Co(III)N4(O2&#8722;)]2+ is photolyzed back to [Co(II)N4(H2O)2]2+ along with O2 evolution.







Abstract
H2 and O2 evolutions occur simultaneously for conventional particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting (PPOWS), leading to a significant backward reaction and the formation of an explosive H2/O2 gas mixture. This is an issue that must be addressed prior to industrialization of PPOWS. Here, a convenient, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable concept is introduced to uncouple hydrogen and oxygen production for PPOWS. Based on this idea, a three&#8208;component photocatalyst, Co(5&#8201;%)&#8208;HPCN/(rGO/Pt), is constructed, consisting of a photoresponsive chip (HPCN), a H2 evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and a cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O2 (Co), to achieve the decoupling of PPOWS under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. The asynchronous O2 and H2 evolution strategy have considerable flexibility regarding the photocatalyst structure and light sources suitable for PPOWS.

         <title>P&#8208;Dopant with Spherical Anion for Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;TFSI/t&#8208;BP is the most widely utilized p&#8208;dopant for hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, its nonuniformity of doping, along with the hygroscopicity and migration of dopants, results in the devices that exhibit limited stability and performance. This study reports the use of a spherical anion of the p&#8208;dopant, regulated by its radius and shape, as an alternative to the linear TFSI&#8722; anion. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that the spherical anion significantly increases the doping of HTMs due to an enhanced electron transfer from larger dipoles. The enhanced transfer leads to a shift in the Pb&#8208;6p defect orbitals, resulting in the shallower trap states.&#160; The linear structure of the TFSI&#8722; anion, the p&#8208;dopant anion with a larger van der Waals radius and spherical shape offers increased hydrophobicity and migration barriers protecting the perovskite. The use of sodium tetrakis(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoro methyl)phenyl)borate results in enhanced thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The devices fabricated with the shape&#8208; and radius&#8208;regulated p&#8208;dopant achieve remarkable efficiencies of 24.49% and 24.31% for CJ&#8208;01 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, respectively, representing the highest efficiency values for organic dopants to date. This study underscores the ingenious design of spherical anions as p&#8208;dopants.</dc:description>

The enhanced transfer leads to a shift in the Pb-6p defect orbitals, resulting in the shallower trap states.&#160; The linear structure of the TFSI&#8722; anion, the p-dopant anion with a larger van der Waals radius and spherical shape offers increased hydrophobicity and migration barriers protecting the perovskite. The use of sodium tetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoro methyl)phenyl)borate results in enhanced thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The devices fabricated with the shape- and radius-regulated p-dopant achieve remarkable efficiencies of 24.49% and 24.31% for CJ-01 and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, representing the highest efficiency values for organic dopants to date. This study underscores the ingenious design of spherical anions as p-dopants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking the Stability&#8208;Activity Trade&#8208;off of Oxygen Electrocatalyst by Gallium Bilateral&#8208;Regulation for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An atomic&#8208;level bilateral regulation strategy was developed to optimize the electronic environment of Mn&#8722;O and Ru&#8722;O in Ga/MnRuO2 by doping Ga to overcome the activity&#8208;stability restriction of bifunctional electrocatalysts and thus achieving the high bifunctional performance for ORR/OER and zinc&#8208;air battery.







Abstract
The rational design of metal oxide catalysts with enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is crucial for the practical application of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (a&#8208;r&#8208;ZABs). Precisely regulating the electronic environment of metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8722;O) active species is critical yet challenging for improving their activity and stability toward OER and ORR. Herein, we propose an atomic&#8208;level bilateral regulation strategy by introducing atomically dispersed Ga for continuously tuning the electronic environment of Ru&#8722;O and Mn&#8722;O in the Ga/MnRuO2 catalyst. The Ga/MnRuO2 catalyst breaks the stability&#8208;activity restriction, showing remarkable bifunctional performance with a low potential gap (&#916;E) of 0.605&#8197;V and super durability with negligible performance degradation (300,000 ORR cycles or 30,000 OER cycles). The theoretical calculations revealed that the strong coupling electron interactions between Ga and Ru&#8722;O/Mn&#8722;O tuned the valence state distribution of the metal center, effectively modulating the adsorption behavior of *O/*OH, thus optimizing the reaction pathways and reducing the reaction barriers. The a&#8208;r&#8208;ZABs based on Ga/MnRuO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance with a wide working temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C and a long lifetime of 2308&#8197;hours (i.e., 13,848&#8197;cycles) under a current density of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Engineering of HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 Active Sites in Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for Enhanced (Photo)Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective ligand removal strategy was developed to engineer active catalytic sites of unsaturated HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, which significantly accelerate the hydrogen evolution reaction by reducing the overpotential water adsorption from 0.31&#8197;V to 0.07&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Currently, lack of ways to engineer specific and well&#8208;defined active sites in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) limits our fundamental knowledge with respect to the mechanistic details for (photo)electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we introduce the open metal sites into ZIFs through the selective ligand removal (SeLiRe) strategy, comprehensively characterize the altered structural and electronic features, and evaluate their role in HER. In situ electrochemical analysis and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the formation of high&#8208;valence HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 sites through the binding of Zn&#8722;N2 with electrolyte hydroxide. The optimal OMS&#8208;ZIF exhibits a low overpotential of 0.41&#8197;V to achieve an ampere&#8208;level 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 120&#8208;hour stability. Theoretical simulations indicate that these active sites accelerate the water molecules activation kinetics, consequently enhancing the efficiency of the Volmer step. This work demonstrates a versatile strategy to introduce highly active catalytic sites in ZIFs, providing new insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism in alkaline media.

         <title>Anionic Doping in Layered Transition Metal Chalcogenides for Robust Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of vacancies and lattice distortion induced by ionic doping in layered transition metal chalcogenides is elucidated as a key factor in enhancing charge transfer during the Li&#8722;S reaction, providing valuable insights for designing advanced cathode materials for next&#8208;generation sulfur&#8208;based batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are among the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. However, a slow Li&#8722;S reaction kinetics at the LSB cathode limit their energy and power densities. To address these challenges, this study introduces an anionic&#8208;doped transition metal chalcogenide as an effective catalyst to accelerate the Li&#8722;S reaction. Specifically, a tellurium&#8208;doped, carbon&#8208;supported bismuth selenide with Se vacancies (Te&#8722;Bi2Se3&#8211;x@C) is prepared and tested as a sulfur host in LSB cathodes. X&#8208;ray absorption and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that Te doping induces lattice distortions and modulates the local coordination environment and electronic structure of Bi atoms to promote the catalytic activity toward the conversion of polysulfides. Additionally, the generated Se vacancies alter the electronic structure around atomic defect sites, increase the carrier concentration, and activate unpaired cations to effectively trap polysulfides. As a result, LSBs based on Te&#8722;Bi2Se3&#8211;x@C/S cathodes demonstrate outstanding specific capacities of 1508&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, excellent rate performance with 655&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C, and near&#8208;integral cycle stability over 1000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, under high sulfur loading of 6.4&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a cathode capacity exceeding 8&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is sustained at 0.1&#8197;C current rate, with 6.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 retained after 300&#8197;cycles under lean electrolyte conditions (6.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1).

         <title>Self&#8208;Immolative Polymers Derived from Renewable Resources via Thiol&#8211;Ene Chemistry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green thiol&#8208;ene: A thiol&#8208;ene reaction was employed to synthesize functionalizable self&#8208;immolative polymers from monomers derived from renewable aldehydes. Depolymerization occurred through an alternating 1,6&#8208;elimination and cyclization cascade after specific cleavage of responsive end&#8208;caps. The methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde&#8208;derived polymer were critical in providing efficient depolymerization yet high background stability.







Abstract
The development of polymers from renewable resources is a promising approach to reduce reliance on petrochemicals. In addition, depolymerization is attracting significant attention for the breakdown of polymers at their end&#8208;of&#8208;life or to achieve specific stimuli&#8208;responsive functions. However, the design of polymers incorporating both of these features remains a challenge. Herein, we report a new class of self&#8208;immolative polymers based on lignin&#8208;derived aldehydes via a simple thiol&#8208;ene polymerization. These self&#8208;immolative polymers undergo cascade degradation in response to specific stimuli through alternating 1,6&#8208;elimination and cyclization reactions. The two methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde monomer accelerated the desired depolymerization reaction, while enhancing stability against undesired backbone hydrolysis. Moreover, diverse responsive end&#8208;caps could be introduced through post&#8208;polymerization functionalization from a single polymer precursor.

Moreover, diverse responsive end-caps could be introduced through post-polymerization functionalization from a single polymer precursor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Enzyme&#8208;Electrocatalyst Cascade Modified Gas&#8208;Diffusion Electrodes for Methanol Formation from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards the development of technologies for the conversion of excess atmospheric CO2, a hybrid electrocatalytic/bioelectrocatalytic system combining an inorganic catalyst with a bienzymatic cascade for CO2 electroreduction to methanol is presented. The Ag&#8208;Bi2O3 electrocatalyst enables the selective conversion of CO2 to formate. The generated formate is subsequently converted in a two&#8208;step process catalyzed by the two NADH&#8208;dependent enzymes, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, via formaldehyde to methanol. NADH regeneration is ensured by diaphorase wired to the electrode by a redox polymer.







Abstract
We propose a hybrid electrocatalytic&#8208;bioelectrocatalytic reaction cascade integrated on a gas diffusion electrode for CO2 reduction under selective formation of methanol. Ag&#8208;Bi2O3 selectively reduces gaseous CO2 to formate at neutral pH conditions. A subsequent enzymatic cascade comprising formaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, which are both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)&#8208;dependent, further reduce formate sequentially to formaldehyde and methanol. The enzymatically oxidized redox cofactor NAD+ is regenerated through the enzyme diaphorase which is electrochemically coupled to the electrode by embedding it into a cobaltocene&#8208;based low&#8208;potential redox polymer. Methanol formation is confirmed using a highly selective biosensor based on alcohol oxidase in combination with horseradish peroxidase integrated into a specifically adapted redox polymer. The proposed hybrid electrocatalytic&#8208;bioelectrocatalytic cascade is an example for a general strategy for enhancing the selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions and/or to replace bioelectrochemically challenging steps such as the synthesis of formate from CO2 using highly oxygen&#8208;sensitive formate dehydrogenases by more robust inorganic electrocatalysts.

         <title>Efficient Direct Air Capture in Industrial Cooling Towers Mediated by Electrochemical CO2 Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach to direct air capture. Widespread industrial cooling towers are demonstrated to be effective for direct CO2 capture from air using a buffered absorbent solution. The captured CO2 can be efficiently released at high purity via electrolysis in a three&#8208;chamber electrolyzer operating at room temperature. The system exhibits stable performance over multiple cycles, highlighting its great potential for atmospheric CO2 removal.







Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) is a promising technology for mitigating global climate change but suffers from low efficiency, small scale, and high cost due to the dilute atmospheric CO2, limited size of air contactors, and heat&#8208;driven CO2 release. Here, we propose combining DAC with widely used industrial cooling towers to extract CO2 from the air and using electrolysis to release the captured CO2 at room temperature. We first prepare a buffered absorbent solution consisting of sodium glycinate, glycine, and sodium chloride for effective CO2 capture from the air, solving the incompatibility problem of the cooling towers with conventional absorbents. Next, we employ a three&#8208;chamber electrolyzer for efficient release (&#8805;95&#8201;%) of the captured CO2 with high purity (&#8805;98&#8201;%) by constant current electrolysis at room temperature, bypassing the conventional energy&#8208;intensive heating process. The entire DAC system can operate stably for multiple cycles, and the mechanism for consecutive CO2 capture and release is uncovered. This work reveals the great potential of running DAC in industrial cooling towers coupled with electrochemically&#8208;driven CO2 release, opening up new avenues for curbing the increasingly severe climate change.

         <title>Lattice Modulation on Singlet&#8208;Triplet Splitting of Silver Cluster Boosting Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TADF&#8208;active silver cluster exhibiting near&#8208;unity PLQY has been achieved through lattice modulation involving cation exchange followed by desolvation. The removal of the guest solvent via thermal activation in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) transformation fashion effectively controls the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting and surpasses both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay of the clusters, thereby boosting the PLQY from 12% to near&#8208;unity.







Abstract
Developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active silver clusters with near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency is of practical importance in cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic devices, but remains a tremendous challenge due to the difficulty of de novo synthesis and uncertainty of properties. Herein, we demonstrate a lattice modulation on parent TADF&#8208; active silver cluster, achieving TADF&#8208;driven photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 12&#8201;% to near&#8208;unity. Systematic experimental and calculated results reveal that the lattice modulation effectively lowers the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;EST) from 718 to 549&#8197;cm&#8208;1, thereby facilitating thermally activated reverse intersystem crossing: T5&#8594;S5, leading to extremely efficient TADF by surpassing both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay, thus boosting the near&#8208;unity PLQY. Such high PLQY is extremely rare in the TADF&#8208;active silver clusters and even in the whole noble&#8208;metal clusters. This research showcases an unparalleled example of lattice modulation to realize near unity PLQY of TADF&#8208;active silver clusters.

         <title>Towards Highly Stable Sn2+ Electrolyte for Aqueous Tin Batteries Using Hydroquinone Antioxidant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adding antioxidant (hydroquinone) additives to acidic Sn2+ electrolyte, Sn2+ oxidation was suppressed due to the fact that hydroquinone is able to react with dissolved oxygen. Meanwhile, hydroquinone molecules tend to adsorb on electrode surface, resulted in refined deposition Sn particles and inhibition on dendrite growth. Finally, high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% for Sn electrode can be obtained. This work can provide guidance for high stable Sn2+ electrolyte with high reversibility.







Abstract
Sn redox chemistry in aqueous acidic electrolyte was characterized with high reversibility and kinetics, which is considered as competitive anode material for aqueous batteries. Unfortunately, divalent Sn2+ is unstable in aqueous electrolyte. It was revealed that Sn2+ is easy to be oxidized to tetravalent Sn4+ by dissolved oxygen and then forms precipitate through hydrolysis process, leading to serious performance decay. Here, hydroquinone (HQ) was employed as antioxidant to prevent Sn2+ oxidation. With addition of HQ, Sn2+ electrolyte can maintain transparent and colorless after long&#8208;time exposure under air atmosphere, while large amounts of sediment were observed in the electrolyte without HQ. Moreover, HQ can adsorb on electrode surface to regulate Sn deposition and suppress Sn dendrite formation. With the difunctional HQ additive, Sn anode shows a stable cycling performance more than 1500 cycles with a high average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.9&#8201;%. And the organic||Sn cell shows high cycling stability for 10,000 cycles with 71&#8201;% capacity retention. The hydroquinone antioxidant strategy provides a facile and cost&#8208;effective way to develop highly stable Sn2+&#8208;based electrolyte.

         <title>Conditional Relay Activation of Theranostic Prodrug by Pretargeting Bioorthogonal Trigger and Fluorescence&#8208;Guided Visible Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We devise a click&#8208;photo&#8208;activatable theranostic prodrug platform exemplified by tetrazine&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;conjugated SN&#8208;38 prodrug 1 with masked fluorescence, low cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an IEDDA reaction between the tetrazine unit on the prodrug and a biotinylated trans&#8208;cyclooctene (biotin&#8208;TCO) on the tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell&#8208;selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation to liberate the caged drug SN&#8208;38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells.







Abstract
Bioorthogonalized light&#8208;responsive click&#8208;and&#8208;uncage platform has enabled precise cell surface engineering and timed payload release, but most of such photoactivatable prodrugs have &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; photoactivity leading to the dark toxicity. On the other hand, the conditionally activatable photocage is limited to the application of fluorogenic probe/photosensitizer liberation. Herein, we devise a conditionally activatable theranostic platform based on the tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) construct, in which tetrazine serves as a quencher motif to disable both the fluorescence and photoresponsivity of BODIPY.

&lt;p&gt;We devise a click-photo-activatable theranostic prodrug platform exemplified by tetrazine-BODIPY-conjugated SN-38 prodrug &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with masked fluorescence, low cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an IEDDA reaction between the tetrazine unit on the prodrug and a biotinylated &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclooctene (biotin-TCO) on the tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell-selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation to liberate the caged drug SN-38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioorthogonalized light-responsive click-and-uncage platform has enabled precise cell surface engineering and timed payload release, but most of such photoactivatable prodrugs have &#8220;always-on&#8221; photoactivity leading to the dark toxicity. On the other hand, the conditionally activatable photocage is limited to the application of fluorogenic probe/photosensitizer liberation. Herein, we devise a conditionally activatable theranostic platform based on the tetrazine (Tz)-boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) construct, in which tetrazine serves as a quencher motif to disable both the fluorescence and photoresponsivity of BODIPY. The uncaged BODIPY upon the bioorthogonal transformation of the tetrazine reinstates fluorescence on-target to guide the subsequent visible light irradiation thereby releasing the therapeutic payload &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;. The proof of concept for such &#8220;light where is lit up&#8221;-activated theranostics was demonstrated by the tetrazine-BODIPY conjugated SN-38 (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with masked fluorescence, up to 70&#8197;times-reduced cytotoxicity, and good photostability. Upon an inverse electron-demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction between tetrazine unit on &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and a biotinylated &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclooctene (biotin-TCO) as a pretargeted trigger on tumor cell surface, the green fluorescence from BODIPY was fully restored for cell-selective imaging, which guided the green light irradiation (500&#8211;520&#8197;nm) to activate the caged drug SN-38 exerting potent cytotoxicity against tumor cells, offering high spatiotemporal precision of disease diagnosis and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrodriven ATP Synthesis via a Reconstructed Thylakoid Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve electrodriven ATP synthesis, we designed an ATP synthesis module by coupling electrochemical &#916;pH establishment with planar thylakoid membranes (pTMs). The &#916;pH drove the rotation of ATPase at the pTMs to synthesis ATP. This model provides a paradigm to ATP synthesis from electricity, thus bring opportunity in electricity&#8208;powered in vitro biotransformation systems.







Abstract
Nature produces ATP, the energy currency, by converting solar energy (photophosphorylation) and chemical energy (substrate&#8208;level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation). Green electricity, as a significant and sustainable energy carrier, plays a crucial role in achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral society. In this work, we established and verified a novel electrodriven phosphorylation method. Spinach thylakoid membranes (TMs), enriched with ATPases, were isolated and constructed into planar TMs (pTMs) on a proton exchange membrane (PEM), effectively imparting the traditional PEM with the biological function of ATP regeneration. Following the optimization of TMs concentration and incubation time, the biological PEM was integrated into a two&#8208;compartment electrochemical cell, where ATP was successfully synthesized by ATPase of pTMs, triggered by the proton gradient potential generated during electrochemical water splitting. When a constant voltage of 3&#8197;V was applied to the electrochemical cells, ATP was synthesized at a rate of 3.16&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;min&#8722;1&#956;gChl&#8722;1, approximately twice the rate of &#916;pH&#8208;driven ATP synthesis. This design offers substantial potential for green energy applications in in vitro biotransformation (ivBT) systems.

         <title>Semiconductive Coordination Polymer with Multi&#8208;Channel Charge Transfer for High&#8208;Performance Direct X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of linker mediated electronic&#8208;state regulation was proposed to construct a CP with multi&#8208;channel charge transfer. This strategy reduced carrier losses resulting from recombination or quenching, enhanced the efficiency of charge separation and transfer. The semiconductive detector achieves the high mobility&#8208;lifetime product and the low detectable X&#8208;ray dose rate, which makes the record for CPs&#8208;based direct radiation detection.







Abstract
Coordination polymers (CPs) are promising for direct X&#8208;ray detection and imaging owing to higher designability and outstanding stability, however, it remains a challenge to achieve highly X&#8208;ray detection performance, particularly both high sensitivity and low detection limit at the same operating voltage. Herein, we construct a new conjugated CP {[Co(BPTTz)(DIPA)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMA}n (1, BPTTz=2,5&#8208;bis(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole, H2DIPA=2,5&#8208;diiodoterephthalic acid, DMA=N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylacetamide), with multi&#8208;channel charge transfer by regulating the linker mediated electronic&#8208;state, which reduces carrier losses resulting from recombination or quenching, enhances the efficiency of charge separation and transfer, thus further optimizes X&#8208;ray detection performance. The semiconductor prepared based on this strategy achieves record values including the highest mobility&#8208;lifetime product (&#956;&#964;, 8.05&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1) and the lowest detectable X&#8208;ray dose rate (128&#8197;nGyair&#8201;S&#8722;1, 35&#8197;V) among CP&#8208;based direct radiation detectors, as well as a high sensitivity (172&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 35&#8197;V) at the same operating voltage. This detector shows excellent long&#8208;time air stability under ambient conditions for over three months and operational stability. These findings demonstrate a rational structural design method to enhance the photoelectronic efficiency and stability of semiconductive CPs.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells by Introducing a Multifunctional Surface Modulator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we report an effective &#8220; three birds with one stone &#8221; strategy by utilizing sodium 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenebis(oxy))bis(butane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate) (ZR3) containing sulfonic acid groups (SO3&#8722;) and Na+ ions as a multifunctional surface treatment modulator to address the iodide and Pb&#8208;related defects, and Li+ ions migration suppression simultaneously. Consequently, highly efficient and stable PSCs are achieved.







Abstract
Simultaneously passivating the perovskite surface defects and suppressing Li+ ions diffusion of hole transport layer (HTL) are still challenging issues. Herein, we report an effective &#8220; three birds with one stone &#8221; strategy by utilizing sodium 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenebis(oxy))bis(butane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate) (ZR3) containing sulfonic acid groups (SO3&#8722;) and Na+ ions as a multifunctional surface treatment modulator to simultaneously address the above issues. It is found that ZR3 is not only capable of passivating the Pb&#8208;related defects at the surface of perovskite by the SO3&#8722; group, but also possesses the remarkable ability to passivate the halide defects with Na+ ions. Meanwhile, ZR3 treatment enables the enhanced exciton dissociation of perovskite, better energy level alignment with hole transport layer (HTL), improved hole extraction/transfer from perovskite layer into HTL, and reduced charge carrier recombination in device. Therefore, it results in the enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34&#8201;% in ZR3&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p device from 22.97&#8201;% for the control device. Specifically, p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with ZR3 also achieves an improved PCE of 25.96&#8201;% with respect to the pristine one (23.99&#8201;%), proving the universality of ZR3 for PSCs. Moreover, the stabilities of ZR3&#8208;treated devices are significantly enhanced owing to Li+ ions migration suppressing and perovskite defects reduction.

         <dc:description>
Based on the suppression principle, PD with both electron and proton affinity can simultaneously suppress H2O activity and enhance interface stability. Specifically, the proton affinity could break H2O&#8208;rich hydrogen bond network to terminate proton transport in bulk electrolyte, and electron affinity guaranteed the competitive chemistry with H2O molecules to enable stable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface for aqueous zinc metal battery.







Abstract
Continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;network in aqueous electrolytes can lead to uncontrollable hydrogen transfer, and combining the interfacial parasitic electron consumption cause the side reaction in aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Herein, hydrogen/electron amphiphilic bi&#8208;functional 1,5&#8208;Pentanediol (PD) molecule was introduced to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. Stronger proton affinity of &#8208;OH in PD can break bulk&#8208;H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;network to inhibit the activity of water, and electron affinity can enhance electron acceptation capability, which ensures that PD is preferentially bound to electrode material over H2O. Besides, the participation of PD in the Zn2+ solvation structure reduces water content at the solid&#8211;liquid interface and promotes uniform deposition process by optimizing Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation energy. Accordingly, dense and vertical zinc texture based on intrinsic steric hindrance effect of PD and formed SEI protective layer to induce stable Zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, an organic&#8211;inorganic shielding water layer was formed at the cathode side to suppress vanadium dissolution in vanadium Oxide. Consequently, Zn//Zn symmetric cell could cycle for more than 5600&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2@1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (more than 250&#8197;hours at 50&#8201;&#176;C). Besides, the VO2 and I2 cathode all achieved stable cycling performance and former pouch cell could reach average capacity of 0.13 Ah.

&lt;p&gt;Based on the suppression principle, PD with both electron and proton affinity can simultaneously suppress H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O activity and enhance interface stability. Specifically, the proton affinity could break H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-rich hydrogen bond network to terminate proton transport in bulk electrolyte, and electron affinity guaranteed the competitive chemistry with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules to enable stable electrolyte-electrode interface for aqueous zinc metal battery.

         <title>Cleavage and Reassembly of 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyls with Enaminones to Synthesize Highly Functionalized Naphthols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem assembly of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls and enaminones into highly functionalized naphthols has been developed in a process that stands out for the readily accessible raw materials, simple operation in the atmosphere, and excellent substrate compatibility. The products can easily be converted into drug scaffolds.







Abstract
The cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and their subsequent reassembly into highly functionalized and useful molecules in an atom&#8208;efficient manner has always been a central focus in the realm of organic synthesis. In this report, we describe the construction of highly functionalized naphthol esters via a tandem reassembly process, driven by Ullmann&#8208;type coupling of enaminones and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. Mechanistic investigations suggest the involvement of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) coupling, cyclization, two acyl migrations, aromatization, and additional transformations within this tandem sequence. This methodology offers several notable advantages, such as the use of inexpensive and easily accessible starting materials, the elimination of the need for expensive transition metal catalysis, simple operation in the atmosphere, exceptional compatibility with a wide range of substrates, and ease of conversion into drug scaffolds.

         <title>Partially Interstitial Silicon&#8208;Implanted Ruthenium as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The partially interstitial silicon implanted ruthenium not only converts the Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. In addition, the spontaneously generated built&#8208;in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption property of the Ru sites, further significantly lowering the thermodynamic energy barrier for the alkaline HER.







Abstract
To enhance the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it is crucial, yet challenging, to fundamentally understand and rationally modulate potential catalytic sites. In this study, we confirm that despite calculating a low water dissociation energy barrier and an appropriate H adsorption free energy (&#916;G*H) at Ru&#8208;top sites, metallic Ru exhibits a relatively inferior activity for the alkaline HER. This is primarily because the Ru&#8208;top sites, which are potential H adsorption sites, are recessive catalytic sites, compared with the adjacent Ru&#8208;hollow sites that have a strong &#916;G*H. To promote the transformation of Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites, interstitial Si atoms are implanted into the hollow sites. However, complete interstitial implantation leads to a high water dissociation energy barrier at the RuSi intermetallic surface. Thus, we present a partial interstitial incorporation strategy to form a Ru&#8722;RuSi heterostructure that not only converts the Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. Moreover, the spontaneously formed built&#8208;in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption ability of the Ru sites, thereby greatly reducing the thermodynamic energy barrier and enhancing the alkaline HER.

         <title>Boosting the Performance of Iridium Single Atom Catalyst in a Porous Organic Polymer for Glycerol Conversion to Lactic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single Atom Catalysts (SACs) are a promising frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, combining the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with high active metal site dispersion. A novel, stable Iridium (Ir) SAC catalyst synthesized by directly incorporating an active Ir complex within a porous organic polymer matrix exhibits exceptional efficiency and selectivity in converting glycerol to lactic acid.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) inherit the merit of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with atomically dispersed mononuclear metal centers on the solid supports. Herein, we developed an Ir&#8208;SAC catalyst via the polymerization of an active homogeneous 2&#8208;picolinylhydrazone ligand&#8208;based iridium (Ir) metal complex. Such catalysts provide great stabilization against migration and agglomeration due to the strong covalent C&#8722;C bond linkage of active complexes and the polymer matrix. This Ir&#8208;SAC catalyst shows excellent selectivity towards glycerol to lactic acid conversion with a remarkable recyclability to offer an unprecedentedly high TON of over 104 million under optimized conditions.

         <title>Programmable Modular Assembly of Homochiral Ir(III)&#8208;Metallohelices to Reverse Metallodrug Resistance by Inhibiting CDK1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel programmable modular assembly approach was developed for the construction of homochiral, luminescent dinuclear Ir(III) metallohelices with flexible dithiourea linkages. The metallohelices exhibit significant chirality&#8208;dependent photocytotoxicities and CDK1&#8208;specific targeting ability, offering innovative insights into the design of chiral helical metallodrugs aimed at reversing metallodrug resistance.







Abstract
Drug resistance is a major cause of cancer recurrence and poor prognosis. The innovative design and synthesis of inhibitors to target drug&#8208;resistance&#8208;specific proteins is highly desirable. However, challenges remain in precisely adjusting their conformation and stereochemistry to adapt the chiral regions of target proteins. Herein, using a stepwise programmable modular assembly approach, we precisely engineered two pairs of homochiral dinuclear Ir(III) metallohelices (&#923;2S4&#8208;Hbpy and &#916;2R4&#8208;Hbpy, &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy and &#923;2R4&#8208;Hbpy) functionalized with flexible dithiourea linkages. The resulting homochiral metallohelices exhibited significant chirality&#8208;dependent photocytotoxicities, and the enhanced structural compatibility of &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy with the target cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase&#8197;1 (CDK1) contributed to its superior photodynamic therapy efficacy, achieving an outstanding photocytotoxicity index (PI) value of 2.3&#215;104. Interestingly, emerging as a critical mediator in the development of oxaliplatin resistance, CDK1 targeting by &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy achieved enhanced cellular uptake, anticancer activity, and oncosis&#8208;mediated cell death in oxaliplatin&#8208;resistant HCT&#8208;8/L cells. Mechanistic investigations, including proteomic profiling and CDK1 gene silencing, confirmed the pivotal role of chirality&#8208;selective CDK1 targeting in reversing metallodrug resistance. This study introduces a promising platform for constructing and customizing flexible metallohelices with precise conformation and stereochemistry to target drug&#8208;resistance&#8208;specific proteins, offering innovative insights into the designability of metallodrugs to overcome drug resistance.

         <title>Liquid Crystalline Nanorods by Synchronized Polymerization, Self&#8208;Assembly and Oriented Attachment for Utilization in Magnetically Responsive Displays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step strategy based on oriented attachment, synchronized with polymerization and self&#8208;assembly was reported to achieve single&#8208;domain smectic liquid crystalline (LC) homopolymer nanorods. The strategy was realized by developing a novel stabilizer derived from a thermo&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte system. The resulting LC nanorods further form hierarchical colloidal LCs, which show much larger light transmittance than that of non&#8208;LC nanorods.







Abstract
The creation of anisotropic nanoparticles (NPs) by polymerization and/or self&#8208;assembly (SA) has significantly promoted the applications of polymer nanomaterials in many fields. However, polymer nanorods are not easily accessible via conventional polymerization or SA. Here we report a one&#8208;step route to synthesize single&#8208;domain smectic liquid crystalline (LC) nanorods utilizing oriented attachment (OA) that was usually found in the synthesis of inorganic NPs, synchronized with polymerization and SA. The synchronization was achieved by developing a novel stabilizer derived from a thermo&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte system. Mechanistic studies reveal that controlling the thermo&#8208;responsive behavior and the distribution of stabilizers on NPs enabled OA. The LC nanorods can further form hierarchical colloidal LCs, which show much larger light transmittance than that of non&#8208;LC nanorods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this LC system can be manipulated by an external magnetic field, thus providing a candidate material for magnetic&#8208;responsive display.

         <title>Synthesis of Arenesulfenyl Fluorides and Fluorosulfenylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, and &#945;&#8208;Diazocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of arenesulfenyl fluorides (ArS&#8208;F) has been achieved via a Halex reaction. Several arenesulfenyl fluorides have been characterized by NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and FTIR spectroscopy, including structural analysis of two compounds by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group engages in direct, efficient, and highly regioselective&#160;anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes.







Abstract
Sulfenyl fluorides are organic compounds of sulfur in formal oxidation state +2 with the formula R&#8722;S&#8722;F. Although the chloride, bromide, and iodide analogues have been extensively described in the literature, arenesulfenyl fluorides remain essentially unstudied. These structures have been implicated as putative intermediates in established processes to access polyfluorinated sulfur species; however, definitive and direct evidence of their existence has not been obtained, nor has a systematic understanding of their reactivity. Here, we report the synthesis, isolation, and spectroscopic characterization of several arenesulfenyl fluorides, including structural analysis of 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride and 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group undergoes direct, efficient, and highly regioselective anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes. The resulting &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;fluoro thioether adducts can be readily transformed into useful fluorinated motifs, for example by modification of the sulfur groups (to sulfonamides or sulfonyl fluorides), by sulfur elimination (to generate formal C&#8722;H fluorination products), or by Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination (to form vinyl fluorides). Thus, we establish that sulfenyl fluorides are unexpectedly accessible and stable compounds, which serve as versatile reagents for the production of fluorinated organic compounds.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Swing Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework Films for Fast and Precise Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation and growth kinetics of COFs are regulated using the temperature&#8208;swing synthesis strategy, which contributes to highly crystalline and porous COF films. The regular channels within the COF enable fast solvent permeation and excellent selectivity to precisely discriminate fine antibiotic mixtures. This work paves the way towards the structural orderliness of framework materials.







Abstract
Producing crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) films is intimately related to the elusive nucleation and growth processes, which is desirable for efficient molecular transport. Rational control over these processes and insights into the mechanisms are crucial to improve synthetic methodology and achieve COF films with regular channels. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of COF films via the temperature&#8208;swing strategy and explore their crystallization from monomer assemblies to film formation. A detailed time&#8208;dependent study reveals that COF crystallites preferentially coalesce at low temperature, progressing from assembled nanospheres to continuous films through lateral and vertical interactions. Moreover, appropriately elevating the synthesis temperature promotes crystal growth and eliminate the defects of weakly crystalline regions, contributing to highly crystalline and porous COF film with a surface area of 746&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. The prepared COF composite membrane exhibits a methanol permeance of 79&#8197;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, which is 4.5 times higher than the weakly crystalline counterpart. In addition, the molecular sieving test recognize great membrane selectivity to discriminate the antibiotic mixture with a high separation factor of 15.4. This work offers a feasible way for the rational design of the synthesis environment, enabling access to highly crystalline framework materials for targeting molecular separations.

         <title>Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Amino Amides by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroamination of Internal Alkenes Directed by an Amide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unactivated internal alkenes were found to undergo enantioselective hydroamination catalyzed by a cationic iridium complex. An amide group effectively directs the catalyst to control the regioselectivity to over 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 and the enantioselectivity to up to 97&#8201;% ee. This coordination assistance enables hydroamination to occur selectively at the remote position, delivering valuable enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access.







Abstract
Catalytic regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroamination of less activated internal alkenes presents a challenge to synthetic chemists due to their low reactivity and the difficulty in simultaneously controlling regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Here, we report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of internal alkenes directed by an amide. The amide group on the alkene effectively directs the catalyst to overcome the low reactivity and control the regioselectivity and the enantiotopic face selection. Phthalimide serves as the amination agent, which could be readily removed to afford a primary amine. This coordination assistance enables hydroamination to occur selectively at the remote position with up to 97&#8201;% ee, delivering valuable enantio&#8208;enriched &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access.

         <title>Efficient Alkaline&#8208;Free Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic Acid using Electrochemically&#8208;Charged NixCo1&#8208;x(OH)2 as a Redox Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting biomass&#8208;derived molecules like 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into value&#8208;added products alongside hydrogen production using renewable energy offers significant opportunities for sustainable chemical and energy production. Yet, HMF electrooxidation requires strong alkaline conditions and membranes for efficient conversion. These harsh conditions destabilize HMF, leading to humin formation and reduced product purity, meanwhile membranes increase costs. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a two&#8208;step, decoupling system that operates without strong alkaline conditions and eliminates the need of membranes. In this system, nickel&#8208;cobalt hydroxides serve as effective redox mediators, driving HMF oxidation in pure water. The experimental results showed that Ni0.85Co0.15OOH effectively promotes the dehydrogenation of substrate and achieves a highly efficient oxidation of HMF in pure water, with the selectivity of product 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) approaching 100%. This system has been expanded to oxidize various substrates, achieving yields exceeding 92% for the corresponding acids of functionalized compounds such as furfuryl alcohol, furfural, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde.

Yet, HMF electrooxidation requires strong alkaline conditions and membranes for efficient conversion. These harsh conditions destabilize HMF, leading to humin formation and reduced product purity, meanwhile membranes increase costs. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a two-step, decoupling system that operates without strong alkaline conditions and eliminates the need of membranes. In this system, nickel-cobalt hydroxides serve as effective redox mediators, driving HMF oxidation in pure water. The experimental results showed that Ni0.85Co0.15OOH effectively promotes the dehydrogenation of substrate and achieves a highly efficient oxidation of HMF in pure water, with the selectivity of product 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) approaching 100%. This system has been expanded to oxidize various substrates, achieving yields exceeding 92% for the corresponding acids of functionalized compounds such as furfuryl alcohol, furfural, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde. By replacing fixed electrodes with flow electrodes, the scalability of decoupling strategy was evaluated for the harvesting of pure solid FDCA, highlighting the broad prospects in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Innate Immune Activation with Multifunctional Nanoparticles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers by leveraging the immune system to combat malignancies. However, its efficacy is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and other regulatory mechanisms of the immune system. Innate immune modulators (IIMs) provide potent immune activation to complement adaptive immune responses and help overcome resistance to ICB. This minireview provides an overview of IIMs and their roles in antitumor immune responses and summarizes recent advances in developing nanotechnology to enhance the delivery of IIMs to tumors for potentiating cancer immunotherapy and mitigating systemic toxicity. We discuss innovative nanoparticle platforms for the delivery of IIMs targeting the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes pathway, the toll&#8208;like receptor pathway, and the retinoic acid&#8208;inducible gene I&#8208;like receptor pathway. We review the preliminary clinical readouts of representative IIM nanoptherapeutics and highlight the development of multifunctional nanoparticles for combination treatments of IIMs with conventional treatment mdoalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynmic therapy, and tumor antigens. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned from the existing systems, the challenges in the field, and future perspectives for this exciting field of nanotherapeutics for cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Role of Hydrogen Migrations in the Taxadiene System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene is made by the taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene synthase (TxS) from Taxus brevifolia. The unique reactivity of the taxane system is characterised by long distance hydrogen migrations in the biosynthesis. This study demonstrates that selective long range hydrogen migrations also play a role in the high energy process of the EI&#8208;MS fragmentation of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene. A TxS enzyme variant was generated that produces cyclophomactene, a compound that is formed through a concerted process involving a long range proton shift and a ring closure that can also be described as the addition of a methylcarbinyl cation to an olefin. Based on a previous computational study the cyclisation mechanism towards taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene was suggested to involve two long distance proton migrations instead of one direct transfer. A substrate analog with a shifted double bond was converted with TxS to obtain experimental evidence for this proposal.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Pyridines at the C4 Position via Metalation and Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of pyridines at positions remote to the N&#8208;atom remains an outstanding problem in organic synthesis. The inherent challenges associated with overriding the influence of the embedded N&#8208;atom within pyridines was overcome using&#160;n&#8208;butylsodium, which provided an avenue to deprotonate and functionalize the C4&#8208;position over traditionally observed addition products that are formed with organolithium bases. In this work, we show that freshly generated 4&#8208;sodiopyrdines could undergo transition metal free alkylation reactions directly with a variety of primary alkyl halides bearing diverse functional groups. In addition, after transmetalation to zinc chloride a simple and efficient Negishi cross&#8208;coupling protocol was formulated for a variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic halides. The robustness of this protocol was demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage installation of 4&#8208;pyridyl fragments into a variety of complex active pharmaceutical ingredients including loratadine and prochlorperazine. Furthermore, through rapid injection NMR investigations, we are able to directly observe the evolution of anionic intermediates and determined that two distinct mechanistic pathways lead to the observed site selectivity: (1) the C4&#8208;H within 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines could be removed directly and (2) the C4 selectivity of unsubstituted pyridine originates from the intermolecular exchange of metalation sites via a thermodynamic pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Azidofunctionalization of Alkenes via Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The azidofunctionalization of alkenes using a hypervalent iodine reagent and various nucleophiles (Nu) under photoredox conditions is described. This method enables the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalized products from a wide range of alkenes and nucleophiles significantly improving the synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates. The generality and limitations of the approach in the alkene and nucleophile dimensions were examined through a standardized, unbiased substrate selection.







Abstract
The azidofunctionalization of alkenes under mild conditions using commercially available starting materials and easily accessible reagents is reported based on a radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy. A broad range of alkenes, including vinyl arenes, enamides, enol ethers, vinyl sulfides, and dehydroamino esters, were regioselectively functionalized with an azide and nucleophiles such as azoles, carboxylic acids, alcohols, phosphoric acids, oximes, and phenols. The method led to a more efficient synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azidofunctionalized pharmaceutical intermediates when compared to previous approaches, resulting in both reduction of step count and increase in overall yield. The scope and limitations of these transformations were further investigated through a standard unbiased selection of 15 substrate combinations out of 1,175,658 possible using a clustering technique.

         <title>&#8220;Double&#8208;Gene&#8221; Small Molecule as Guest Component Promotes the Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells Beyond 19.5%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introduction of a guest component into the active layer is a simple yet effective approach to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Despite various guest components successfully employed in the OSCs, efficient guest components require deliberate design and ingenious inspiration, which still remains a big challenge for developing high performance OSCs. In this work, we propose a concept of &#8220;structural gene&#8221; engineering to create a new &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule (L&#8208;DBDD) by simply combining the structures of both donor PM6 and acceptor L8&#8208;BO. L&#8208;DBDD inherit the features of both donor and acceptor, which naturally acts as a bridge between donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces to strengthen D/A interactions and compatibility. Incorporation of this &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule into the active layer can facilitate rapid charge dissociation and simultaneously optimize molecular packing for efficient charge transport. Consequently, the ternary OSC based on PM6: L&#8208;DBDD:L8&#8208;BO blend achieves a top power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.51%, significantly suppressing the binary control device (PCE=18.52%). These results demonstrate that the design concept of &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule by combination of the &#8220;structural gene&#8221; of donor and acceptor provides a simple and meaningful guideline for guest component&#8208;assisted highly efficient OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Yellow Emitter Based on a Double&#8208;Boron&#8208;Embedded&#160;Tetraazacyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;narrowband and highly modifiable multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are crucial for realizing high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut display applications. Despite progress, most MR&#8208;TADF emitters remain confined to blue and green wavelengths, with difficulties extending into longer wavelengths without significant spectral broadening, which compromises color purity in full&#8208;color organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. In this work, we present a novel tetraazacyclophane&#8208;based architecture embedding dual boron atoms to remarkedly enhance intramolecular charge transfer through the strategic positioning of boron and nitrogen atoms. This arrangement induces a substantial redshift while maintaining structural rigidity and molecular orbital symmetry, with a hole&#8208;electron central distance of 0 &#197;, allowing for ultra&#8208;narrowband emission. The resulting MR&#8208;TADF material, HBN, delivers yellow emission peaking at 572 nm (2.168 eV) with an impressively narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 17 nm (0.064 eV) in dilute toluene. Moreover, the corresponding phosphorescent&#8208;sensitized fluorescence OLED achieves yellow emission maximum at 581 nm, with a narrow FWHM of 25 nm, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.1%, and a luminance exceeding 40,000 cd m&#8208;2. These outstanding photoluminescent and electroluminescent performances validate the superiority of our molecular design strategy, highlighting its significant potential for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

In this work, we present a novel tetraazacyclophane-based architecture embedding dual boron atoms to remarkedly enhance intramolecular charge transfer through the strategic positioning of boron and nitrogen atoms. This arrangement induces a substantial redshift while maintaining structural rigidity and molecular orbital symmetry, with a hole-electron central distance of 0 &#197;, allowing for ultra-narrowband emission. The resulting MR-TADF material, HBN, delivers yellow emission peaking at 572 nm (2.168 eV) with an impressively narrow full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 17 nm (0.064 eV) in dilute toluene. Moreover, the corresponding phosphorescent-sensitized fluorescence OLED achieves yellow emission maximum at 581 nm, with a narrow FWHM of 25 nm, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.1%, and a luminance exceeding 40,000 cd m-2. These outstanding photoluminescent and electroluminescent performances validate the superiority of our molecular design strategy, highlighting its significant potential for cutting-edge optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Spiropyran Coacervates as Dual&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Switchable Reactive Oxygen Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compounds of certain structural features may form coacervates through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). These coacervates can enter mammalian cells and affect cellular physiology. Controlling the properties of the coacervates inside cells, however, is a challenge. Here, we report photochemical reactions of spiropyran (SP)&#8208;based coacervates with two wavelengths of light, in vitro, in the cell, and in animals, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photo&#8208;controlled cell killing. We identify an SP&#8208;containing compound, SP&#8208;PEG8&#8208;SP, that forms coacervates (SP&#8208;C) in the aqueous solution. Photo illumination by a UV light triggers the isomerization of SP to merocyanine (MC), switching SP&#8208;C to the fluorescent coacervates MC&#8208;C. A visible light converts MC&#8208;C back to SP&#8208;C and induces ROS generation. Notably, coacervate formation increases the compound's ROS generation efficiency. The SP&#8208;C/MC&#8208;C coacervate system (collectively called spiropyran coacervates) can spontaneously enter cells, and a dual&#8208;wavelength&#8208;controlled reversible on/off switch and spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved ROS production is realized within the cytoplasm. Light&#8208;induced ROS generation leads to cytotoxicity to cancer cells, tumor organoids, and tumors in vivo, supporting spiropyran coacervates&#8217; potential use as coacervate photosensitizers in photodynamic therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Linear Tetramer&#8208;type Acceptors for High&#8208;efficiency and High&#8208;stability Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has exceeded 20%, which has met the requirements for commercialisation. In the current stage, the main focus is to balance the performance and stability. It has been shown that all&#8208;polymer formulation can improve device stability, however, PCE is not in satifsfaction, and the batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation leads to quality control issues. In this work, we constructed monodispersed tetramer NFA materials named G&#8208;1 and G&#8208;2, to best integrate the merits of small molecule and polymer. It was revealed that different connecting units at the centre could significantly affect the molecular planarity and thin film morphology. The alkene&#8208;bonded tetramer G&#8208;1 had a more regioregular structure, leading to better molecular planarity, and more ordered packing in thin film. More importantly, the oligomeration induced a favourable face&#8208;on orientation, achieved a lower binding energy and a higher photoluminescence yield. As a result, the exciton and charge carrier kinetics was optimized with reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss. The OSC based on PM6:G&#8208;1 achieved a PCE of 19.6%, which is the highest PCE reported so far for oligomer&#8208;based binary OSC. In addition, the device stability was largely improved, showing a lifetime over 10000 hours in the inverted OSC device.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective [3+2] Annulation of Aldimines with Alkynes by Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective [3+2] annulation of readily accessible aldimines with alkynes via C&#8211;H activation is, in principle, a straightforward and atom&#8208;efficient route for synthesizing chiral 1&#8208;aminoindenes, which are important components in a wide array of natural products, bioactive molecules, and functional materials. However, such asymmetric transformation has remained undeveloped to date due to the lack of suitable chiral catalysts. Here, we report for the first time the enantioselective [3+2] annulation of aldimines with alkynes via C&#8211;H activation using chiral half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts. This protocol enabled the synthesis of diverse multi&#8208;substituted chiral 1&#8208;aminoindene derivatives with 100% atom&#8208;efficiency, broad substrate scope, and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) analyses have revealed that a noncovalent C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction between a tert&#8208;Bu substituent in the chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand and the phenyl ring of an aromatic aldimine substrate played an important role in achieving a high level of enantioselectivity. This work not only offers an efficient and selective route for synthesizing a new family of chiral 1&#8208;aminoindene derivatives but also offers unprecedented insights into enantioselectivity control in chiral Cp&#8208;ligated metal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Robust Europium(III)&#8208;Based Hybrid Lanthanide Scintillators for Advanced X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scintillators that convert ionizing radiation into low&#8208;energy photons are essential for medical diagnostics and industrial inspections. Despite advances in X&#8208;ray scintillators, challenges remain in achieving high efficiency, environmental compatibility, stability, and flexibility. Here, we present experimental investigations of a new type of europium(III)&#8208;based hybrid ternary complex scintillators for improved X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Benefiting from the synergistic interaction between dual organic ligands and lanthanide ions, the Eu(TTA)3Phen complex demonstrates exceptional radioluminescence and light yield under X&#8208;ray excitation, with a detection limit of 19.97 nGy s&#8722;1, well below typical radiation doses used in medical diagnostics. Moreover, lanthanide complex Eu(TTA)3Phen exhibited excellent thermal and photostability, showing minimal degradation even after extended X&#8208;ray exposure. By integrating with flexible polymer matrices, a high&#8208;transmission Eu(TTA)3Phen&#8208;PMMA composite film was fabricated for X&#8208;ray radiography, demonstrating high spatial resolution (&lt; 10 um) and superior image quality across various target samples. These findings hold substantial promise for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray imaging applications, offering high sensitivity, stability, flexibility, and versatility, making them ideally suited for advanced radiographic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Autocatalytic Interfacial Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Amide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has in principle relied on reversible dynamic chemistry. A general method to synthesize irreversibly bonded COFs is urgently demanded for driving the COF chemistry to a new era. Here we report a universal two&#8208;step method for the straightforward synthesis of irreversibly amide&#8208;linked COF (AmCOF) membranes by autocatalytic interfacial polymerization (AIP). Highly crystalline amide and imine bilinker COF (AICOF) membranes are readily synthesized by AIP strategy which ingeniously leverages interfacial polymerization to generate amide units followed by an autocatalytic condensation that forms imine bonds. Then, the fully amide&#8208;linked AmCOF membranes with Turing structures can be prepared through irreversible linker renovation. The universality of this method has been exemplified by nine AmCOF membranes. Among them, the AmCOF&#8208;1 membrane exhibits superior performance for H2O2 photosynthesis (4353 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and high stability, enabling continuous production of H2O2 under sunlight for 150 h without sacrificial agents. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the greatly improved properties are attributable to the built&#8208;in robust amide knots, facilitating full separation of electrons and holes, ultra&#8208;long exciton diffusion length, and fast dissociation of excitons within the AmCOF channels.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Single crystals that do not obey translational symmetry have been reported in various material systems. In polymers, twisted crystals are typically formed in banded spherulites, while a class of non&#8208;flat polymer single crystals (PSCs) has been observed. Herein, we report the formation of scrolled single crystals of biodegradable polymer poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA).

         <title>From Guest&#8208;Induced Crystallization to Molecular Imprinting: Calculation&#8208;Guided Discovery of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Tetrazole Frameworks for p&#8208;Xylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring host&#8208;guest interactions to regulate hydrogen&#8208;bonding assembly offers a promising approach for developing advanced porous crystal materials (PCMs). However, screening compatible guests with appropriate geometries and host&#8208;guest interactions that could inhibit the dense packing of building blocks remains a primary challenge. This study presents a novel guest&#8208;induced crystallization (GIC) strategy, guided by thermodynamic calculations, to develop porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) using structurally challenging tetrazole building units. Thermodynamic principles are established from the crystal structure data and the density functional theory calculation of the formation energy (&#916;E). This provides criteria to identify available guests in GIC, enabling the successful discovery of a hidden HOF that is kinetically challenging to crystallize. Furthermore, the potential application for p&#8208;xylene (PX) separation is predicted by analyzing the &#916;E of guest&#8208;induced HOFs. A high PX selectivity (PX/m&#8208;xylene=6.1, PX/o&#8208;xylene=7.2, and PX/ethylbenzene=4.1) is achieved through selective inclusion of PX from C8 aromatic isomers within the guest&#8208;induced HOFs. Significantly, the guest&#8208;free HOF (HOF&#8208;PX&#8208;a), bearing PX&#8208;templated cavities derived from molecular imprinting, shows a record&#8208;high PX/ethylbenzene selectivity (21.7) in liquid adsorption. This work elucidates the underpinning self&#8208;assembly rules of GIC for HOF construction, providing exciting new opportunities for the predictable assembly of PCMs for molecular recognition and target&#8208;specific separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Initiator&#8208;Free Thiol&#8208;Aldehyde Photo Polycondensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional photopolymerizations generally requires an initiator for initiating the polymerization while few cases have created degradable chemical bonds. Moreover, the migration instability and cytotoxicity of photo initiators are posing issues to human health and the environment. In this work, we discovered an initiator&#8208;free photo polycondensation system (IFPPC) between polymercaptans and aldehyde monomers, producing high strength plastic materials with exchangeable and degradable dithioacetal groups. IFPPC proceeds through a radical mechanism and is applicable in producing linear polymers and crosslinked networks. Nano&#8208;composites can also be obtained via an organic solvent&#8208;free Pickering emulsion polymerization using cellulose nanofibers as the stabilizer. The dithioacetal groups afford excellent stability under hydrolytic conditions and repeated thermal processing of cross&#8208;linked polymers, while their cleavage in aqueous solution of salts (silver nitrate, zinc iodide, copper bromide, etc.) results in fast degradation for recovering the aldehyde monomer. This is a successful demonstration of producing recyclable and degradable plastics through photo irradiation while avoiding the problematic issues of photo initiators.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Spiropyran Exchange for Rapid Structural Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we disclose that spiropyrans are able to undergo dynamic covalent exchange via their corresponding merocyanine isomers. In the latter, the indolinium moieties can be exchanged by a Michael&#8208;type addition&#8208;elimination sequence, in which a methylene indoline attacks a merocyanine and subsequently the initial indoline fragment is cleaved. The rate and position of the exchange equilibrium strongly depend on the reaction conditions as well as the substitution pattern on the methylene indoline fragments. Importantly, spiropyran cross exchange is catalyzed by indolinium salts and provides the opportunity for rapid in&#8208;situ structural diversification of spiropyrans. This was used as synthetic tool to access various, hitherto inaccessible spiropyrans as potential dual&#8208;color photoinitiators for xolography. Moreover, we foresee application to screen dynamic covalent libraries of spiropyrans for photochromic properties and to exploit their light&#8208;sensitivity to bias the thermal equilibrium.</dc:description>

         <title>The Amplification of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Amyloid Fibrils is Suppressed under Fully Quiescent Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital seed amplification assays in microemulsion droplets for the diagnostics of Parkinson's disease would be highly valuable. However, such assays are rendered challenging by the fact that fibril amplification by fragmentation or secondary nucleation is strongly suppressed under the fully quiescent conditions inside the droplets. Ultrasonic agitation allowed the successful amplification of pre&#8208;formed seeds and those from PD brains inside microemulsion droplets under acidic solution conditions.







Abstract
Seed amplification assays (SAAs) are a promising avenue for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, when amplifying fibrils from patient&#8208;derived samples in multiwell plates, it is currently highly challenging to accurately quantify the aggregates. It is therefore desirable to transfer such assays into a digital format in microemulsion droplets to enable direct quantification of aggregate numbers. To achieve transfer from conventional plate&#8208;based to the microfluidic digital format, effective seed amplification needs to be achieved inside the microdroplets. Therefore, we establish a new set of assay conditions that enable highly efficient seed amplification in plates without any shaking. However, the same set of conditions displayed a very different behavior upon transfer to a microfluidic platform where no amplification was observed. We demonstrate that this is caused by the suppression of all secondary processes that could amplify the seeds in the complete absence of mechanical perturbations inside the microdroplets. We further show that the amplification inside droplets can be achieved by subjecting the microemulsions to high&#8208;frequency vibrations using a piezo device. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the physical requirements of alpha&#8208;synuclein seed amplification and demonstrate a pathway towards the development of effective digital SAAs.

         <title>Polymer Films&#8217; Residual Stress Attenuation from the Supramolecular Complexation with Ultra&#8208;Small Nanoparticles for High Resolution Nanoimprint Lithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles can significantly alter the dynamics and physicochemical properties of polymers compared to colloid NPs due to their comparable sizes with characteristic lengths of polymer chain segment and the dense supramolecular interaction with polymers. This effect facilitates the fabrication of residual stress&#8208;free polymer films with high mechanical strengths, enabling unique application for low&#8208;cost, sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm resolution NIL.







Abstract
Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) has been broadly applied in the fabrication of nano&#8208;patterned polymer films for cost&#8208;efficiency and high through&#8208;put; however, the intrinsic tradeoff between mechanical strength and residual stress of polymer films significantly limits the NIL resolution while the harsh processing conditions limit its versatile applications to different substrates. Herein, 1&#8197;nm metal oxide cluster, phosphotungstic acid (PTA), is used to complex with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for high&#8208;resolution NIL that can be operated at large&#8208;scale and mild conditions. The ultra&#8208;small size of PTA enables dense supramolecular interaction with PVA for the diminished crystallinity and accelerated chain dynamics that help relax the residual stress during film casting. Meanwhile, the PTAs serve as supramolecular crosslinkers for the increased modulus of the films (ca. 2&#8197;GPa), providing promising dimensional stability required for high&#8208;resolution NIL. Simple casting the aqueous blend on a master mold successfully gives a residual stress&#8208;free film with sub&#8208;2&#8197;nm resolution at wafer scale (&gt;100&#8197;cm2). The mild processing at ambient condition permits broad NIL applications to diverse substrates, e.g., integrated circuit chips, compact discs, PET nano gratings and even delicate bio&#8208;surfaces.

Pt single atoms are successfully anchored onto C3N4 through a reactive deposition approach, achieving optimal positioning of Pt atoms in the most stable and active configurations. This strategy results in maximized photocatalytic H2 production efficiency at a low Pt loading of approximately 0.03&#8197;wt&#8201;%.







Abstract
The use of metal single atoms (SAs) as co&#8208;catalysts on semiconductors has emerged as a promising technology to enhance their photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. In this study, we describe the deposition of very low amounts of Pt SAs (&lt;0.1&#8201;at&#8201;%) on exfoliated graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) by a direct Pt&#8722;deposition approach from highly dilute chloroplatinic acid precursors. We find that &#8722; using this technique&#8722;a remarkably low loading of highly dispersed Pt SAs (0.03&#8197;wt&#8201;%) on C3N4 is sufficient to achieve a drastic decrease in the overall charge transfer resistance and a maximized photocatalytic efficiency. The resulting low&#8208;loaded Pt SAs/C3N4 provides a H2 production rate of 1.66&#8197;m&#8201;mol/h/mg&#8197;Pt, with a remarkable stability against agglomeration; even during prolonged photocatalytic reactions no sign of light&#8208;induced Pt agglomerations can be observed. We ascribe the high performance and stability to the site&#8208;selective, stable coordination of Pt within the C3N4 structure. Notably the H2 production rate of the low&#8208;loaded Pt SAs surpasses the activity of Pt SAs deposited by other techniques or nanoparticles at comparable or even higher loading &#8211; the optimized Pt SAs decorated C3N4 show &#8776;5.9 times higher rate than Pt NP decorated C3N4.

A photochromic dysprosium&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnet displays reversible redox transformation upon ultraviolet irradiation and subsequent dark treatment, leading to a significant change of magnetic memory effect.







Abstract
A photochromic dysprosium&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnet [Dy(CyPh2PO)2(H2O)5](PMo12O40)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3CyPh2PO&#8901;H2O (1&#8208;Dy) is synthesized via cocrystal engineering of a polyoxomolybdate (POMo) anion and an Ising&#8208;type cation with pseudo pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. Upon ultraviolet irradiation, MoVI&#8208;to&#8208;MoV single&#8208;electron photoreduction occurs in the POMo moiety, resulting in significant changes of optical and magnetic properties. The emergence of intervalence charge&#8208;transfer transitions in heteropoly blue state 1&#8208;Dy* facilitates photothermal conversion in near&#8208;infrared region. Meanwhile, the coercive field of hysteresis loop is altered from 0.72&#8197;T (1&#8208;Dy) to 0.04&#8197;T (1&#8208;Dy*) at 2&#8197;K, which might be contributed to the magnetic interaction between DyIII and MoV. After dark treatment, 1&#8208;Dy* can convert to the initial state with the recovery of magnetic memory effect. These results presented herein provide a blueprint for developing versatile opto&#8208;magnetic materials via the coupling of photochemical regulation and magnetic interaction.

         <title>Balancing Activity and Selectivity in Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction through First Coordination Shell Engineering in Cobalt Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co single&#8208;atom sites with different N/O coordination are synthesized using a precursor preselection strategy to investigate their effect on selectivity and activity in the two&#8208;electron ORR. The trans&#8208;Co&#8208;N2O2 site achieves an optimal balance between selectivity and activity, reaching a H2O2 production rate of 12.86&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an energy efficiency of 0.07&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;J&#8722;1 in a 100&#8208;hour flow&#8208;cell test.







Abstract
The electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) offers a potentially cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly route for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the competing 4e&#8722; ORR that converts oxygen to water limits the selectivity towards hydrogen peroxide. Accordingly, achieving highly selective H2O2 production under low voltage conditions remains challenging. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that modulation the first coordination sphere in Co single atom catalysts (Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts with Co&#8208;NxO4&#8208;x sites), specifically the replacement of Co&#8722;N bonds with Co&#8722;O bonds, can weaken the *OOH adsorption strength to boost the selectivity towards H2O2 (albeit with a slight decrease in ORR activity). Further, by synthesizing a series of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported catalysts with Co&#8208;NxO4&#8208;x active sites, we were able to validate the DFT findings and explore the trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and selectivity for 2e&#8722; ORR. A catalyst with trans&#8208;Co&#8208;N2O2 sites exhibited excellent catalytic activity and H2O2 selectivity, affording a H2O2 production rate of 12.86&#8197;

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generic incorporation of a thioxanthone&#8208;containing amino acid into a protein scaffold is described. The resulting artificial photoenzyme was engineered to catalyze a dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Genetically encodable photosensitizers allow the design of artificial photoenzymes to expand the scope of abiological reactions. Herein, we report the genetic incorporation of a thioxanthone&#8208;containing amino acid into a protein scaffold via an engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA/pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase pair. The designer enzyme was engineered to catalyze a dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in high yields (up to&gt;99&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 e.r.). This work provides a robust and facile method for photoenzyme design and lays the foundation for the development of further photoenzymatic reactions.

         <title>Spherical Mg/Cu Co&#8208;Doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 Cathode Materials with Mitigated Diffusion&#8208;Induced Stresses and Enhanced Cyclic Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spherical Na4Fe2.96Mg0.02Cu0.02(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMCPP) cathode materials have been successfully synthesized via the combination of spray&#8208;drying and solid&#8208;state reaction method. The Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping can effectively mitigate the lattice volume change and promote the electronic conductivity of NFMCPP. While, the small NFMCPP particles with spherical geometry exhibit an enhanced structural stability, due to the high sphericity structure enables a low high&#8208;stress concentration and alleviated diffusion&#8208;induced stress during the extensive (de)sodiation cycling.







Abstract
Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) has been regarded as the promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the practical applications of NFPP are hindered by its high&#8208;volume changes, poor intrinsic electron conductivity and sluggish Na+ ions diffusion kinetics. Herein, a spray&#8208;drying and solid&#8208;state reaction method have been utilized to fabricate the spherical trace amount Mg/Cu co&#8208;doped Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFMCPP). The Mg/Cu co&#8208;doping can effectively mitigate the lattice volume change and promote the electronic conductivity of NFMCPP by reducing band gap between the conduction and valence bands. While, the unique spherical structured NFMCPP with a carbon film even coated on its surface ensures rapid electron transport. Moreover, small NFMCPP particles with spherical geometry demonstrate an alleviated diffusion&#8208;induced stress and enhanced structural stability, due to the high sphericity structure enables fluent Na+ extraction/insertion, leads to a low high&#8208;stress concentration and uniform stress/strain distribution during extensive (de)sodiation process. Consequently, the optimized spherical NFMCPP cathode materials exhibit an excellent rate capability and cyclic stability.

         <title>Fragment Discovery by X&#8208;Ray Crystallographic Screening Targeting the CTP Binding Site of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa IspD</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During a crystallographic screening with IspD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we identified a fragment residing inside the active site. We confirmed its interactions with the protein by 1H saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy. Initial fragment growing yielded derivatives with improved affinity towards IspD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.







Abstract
With antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reaching alarming levels, new anti&#8208;infectives with unprecedented mechanisms of action are urgently needed. The 2&#8208;C&#8208;methylerythritol&#8208;D&#8208;erythritol&#8208;4&#8208;phosphate (MEP) pathway represents an attractive source of drug targets due to its essential role in numerous pathogenic Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt), whilst being absent in human cells. Here, we solved the first crystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) IspD, the third enzyme in the MEP pathway and present the discovery of a fragment&#8208;based compound class identified through crystallographic screening of PaIspD. The initial fragment occupies the CTP binding cavity within the active site. Confirmation of fragment&#8211;protein interactions was achieved through 1H saturation&#8211;transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (1H&#8208;STD NMR spectroscopy). Building upon these findings and insights from the co&#8208;crystal structures, we identified two growth vectors for fragment growing. We synthesized derivatives addressing both growth vectors, which showed improved affinities for PaIspD. Our new fragment class targets PaIspD, displays promising affinity and favorable growth vectors for further optimization.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly Enhanced Linear and Nonlinear Chiroptical Properties of Chiral Manganese Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chiral self&#8208;assembly strategy has been demonstrated to effectively boost the linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic manganese halides. Ultimately, a near&#8208;unity green light emission is achieved. These chiral samples not only feature intense circularly polarized luminescence (glum~4.2&#215;10&#8722;2), but also showcase a strengthened capability to discriminate circularly polarized laser (gSHG&#8208;CD~1.8) that ranks among the highest reported values.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) hold great promise in broad applications ranging from ferroelectrics, spintronics to nonlinear optics, owing to their broken inversion symmetry and tunable chiroptoelectronic properties. Typically, chiral HOMHs are constructed by chiral organic cations and metal anion polyhedra, with the latter regarded as optoelectronic active units. However, the primary design approaches are largely constrained to regulation of general components within structural formula. Herein, supramolecular approaches have been taken for the functionalization of chiral enantiomers by anchoring chiral cations with crown ether hosting molecules. Chiral HOMHs of R&#8208;/S&#8208;(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6@ClMBA)2MnBr4 have been thus obtained with boosted linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. The self&#8208;assembled cations lead to enhanced structural rigidity, which promote near&#8208;unity green light emission and strong circularly polarized luminescence with a high asymmetry factor, along with high efficiency second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses. In particular, these chiral HOMH single crystals demonstrate a sensitive discrimination for circularly polarized laser in the near&#8208;infrared region with the nonlinear optical asymmetry factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) as high as 1.8. This work highlights the contribution of supramolecular assembly in improving chiroptical performances, offering valuable insights for the design of new chiral HOMH materials with promising application potentials as linear and nonlinear CPL emitters and detectors.

         <title>Flexible Fiber Sensors for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Redox Signaling Molecules in Exercise&#8208;Mimicking Engineered Skeletal Muscle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has reported the fabrication of dual flexible electrochemical sensors and achieved simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and NO release from engineered skeletal muscle in response to exercise&#8208;mimicking stretch. The results proved that proper warm&#8208;up training could help improve exercise adaptation in skeletal muscle.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in skeletal muscle provides crucial insights into the cause&#8208;and&#8208;effect relationships between physical activity and health benefits. However, the dynamic production of exercise&#8208;induced RONS remains poorly explored, due to the lack of sensing tools that can conform to soft skeletal muscle while monitor RONS release during exercise. Here we introduce dual flexible sensors via twisting carbon nanotubes into helical bundles of fibers and subsequent assembling electrochemical sensing components. These flexible sensors exhibit low bending stiffness, excellent H2O2 and NO sensing abilities, outstanding biocompatibility and compliance with engineered skeletal muscle tissue. This allows real&#8208;time and simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and NO release from engineered skeletal muscle in response to different exercise&#8208;mimicking stretches, which reveals that warm&#8208;up activities before high&#8208;intensity exercise may enhance adaptive responses by down&#8208;regulating H2O2 and up&#8208;regulating NO production. The proposed sensing strategy demonstrates great versatility in monitoring multiple biomarkers of soft tissue and organs.

         <title>Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow in Flexible Polymeric Materials through the Introduction of Electron Donor/Acceptor Exciplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymers were fabricated through the introduction of electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. The polymers exhibited a remarkable green afterglow persisting for 12&#8197;hours under ambient conditions. The polymers are flexible and transparent, which are useful properties for flexible display applications. Moreover, the polymers were spun into fibers with the HLA property remaining, which holds promise for application in wearable smart devices.







Abstract
The development of organic afterglow materials has garnered significant attention due to their diverse applications in smart devices, optoelectronics, and bioimaging. However, polymeric afterglow materials often suffer from short emission lifetimes, typically ranging from milliseconds to seconds, posing a significant challenge for achieving hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymers. This study presents the successful fabrication of transparent HLA polymers by introducing electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. Employing aromatic polyesters as the polymer electron acceptor and charge reservoirs, the resulting HLA polymers exhibited a remarkable green afterglow that persisted for 12&#8197;hours under ambient conditions, representing the longest duration achieved for polymeric afterglow materials to date. Intriguingly, these HLA polymers could be activated solely by sunlight, maintaining a green afterglow for over 6&#8197;hours at room temperature in air, which outperformed all previously reported afterglow polymers. The doped polymers exhibited superior flexibility and transparency, making them ideal candidates for flexible display applications. Furthermore, successfully spinning these doped polymers into fibers while retaining their HLA properties opens up exciting possibilities for their use in wearable smart devices.

         <title>Support&#8208;Layer Integrated Zeolite Membranes through In Situ Interfacial Transformation of Clay&#8208;Based Protomembranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clay&#8208;based protomembranes transformed into support&#8208;layer integrated zeolite membranes by interfacial transformation without solvents. Inexpensive clay in protomembrane not only served as a raw material for the support but also provided active ingredients for the growth of zeolite crystals, which not only reduced the membrane preparation cost and environmental cost, but also improved the separation performance and stability of zeolite membranes.







Abstract
Zeolite membranes are considered ideal inorganic membrane materials for separating mixtures with molecular&#8208;level differences. However, their complex preparation process with excessive synthesis solutions for traditional hydrothermal heating methods leads to various drawbacks. Here, we describe a membrane preparation strategy involving an in situ interfacial transformation of the protomembrane without solvents. Inexpensive clay powder forms the protomembrane, and the active ingredients subsequently migrate from the interior of this protomembrane to its surface and transform into a zeolite layer. Ultimately, the protomembrane is calcined to obtain the support&#8208;layer integrated zeolite membrane. Systematic research shows that clay not only serves as a raw material for the support but also provides active ingredients for the growth of zeolite crystals; thus, zeolite membranes with zeolite particles inserted into the support are formed. The zeolite membrane calcined at 800&#8201;&#176;C possesses a p&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene separation factor approaching 6263 with a permeation flux of 1.21&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201; m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201; s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201; Pa&#8722;1. This interfacial transformation method can be applied to other membranes and promote the development of membrane separation technology.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrolytes with High Disordered Solvation Structures for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel low&#8208;concentration HE electrolyte is developed to address dendrite formation and side reactions in aqueous ZIBs. This HE electrolyte features weakly solvated structures and multiple anions, leading to highly disordered solvation shells that enhance zinc ion diffusion kinetics and electrode interface stability. As a result, Zn||Zn symmetric cells reach over 2,000&#8197;hours of cycling, and Zn||Cu cells achieve 99.9&#8201;% CE over 1,000 cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are playing an increasingly important role in the field of energy storage owing to their low cost, high safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their practical applications are still handicapped by severe dendrite formation and side reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction and corrosion) on the zinc anodes. Herein, a low&#8208;concentration high&#8208;entropy (HE) electrolyte strategy is proposed to achieve high reversibility and ultra&#8208;durable zinc metal anode. Specifically, this HE electrolyte features multiple anions participating in coordination and highly disordered solvation shells, which would disrupt the intrinsic H&#8208;bond network between water molecules and suppress interfacial side reactions. Moreover, these diversified weakly solvated structures can lower the solvation energy of Zn2+ solvation configurations and enhance zinc ion diffusion kinetics, thereby promoting uniform Zn deposition and electrode interface stability. Consequently, Zn||Zn symmetric cells exhibit over 2,000&#8197;hours of cycling stability, and Zn||Cu asymmetric cells achieve a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the Zn||PANI full cell with the optimized HE&#8208;50&#8197;mM electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity of 110.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 2,000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 70.4&#8201;% at 15&#8197;A g&#8722;1 after 10,000 cycles. Remarkably, even at a low temperature of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, the Zn||PANI full cells equipped with HE&#8208;50&#8197;mM electrolyte still demonstrate long&#8208;term cycling stability over 600 cycles with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.5&#8201;%. This research provides a promising strategy for the design of aqueous electrolytes, aiding in the development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, and high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Energy Transfer (EnT) Catalysis of Non&#8208;Symmetrical Borylated Dienes: Origin of Reaction Selectivity in Competing EnT Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy transfer (EnT) has emerged as the gold standard for the excitation of unsaturated bonds. However, control over competing reaction pathways remains an intractable challenge. Here boron is used to probe the reactivity of non&#8208;symmetrical dienes under EnT, enabling a site&#8208; and regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition. Counterintuitive regiodivergence was observed when probing geometric isomerisation, leading to a mechanistic investigation to determine the origin of selectivity in competing EnT processes.







Abstract
Energy transfer catalysis (EnT) has had a profound impact on contemporary organic synthesis enabling the construction of higher in energy, complex molecules, via efficient access to the triplet excited state. Despite this, intermolecular reactivity, and the unique possibility to access several reaction pathways via a central triplet diradical has rendered control over reaction outcomes, an intractable challenge. Extended chromophores such as non&#8208;symmetrical dienes have the potential to undergo [2+2] cycloaddition, [4+2] cycloaddition or geometric isomerisation, which, in combination with other mechanistic considerations (site&#8208; and regioselectivity), results in chemical reactions that are challenging to regulate. Herein, we utilise boron as a tool to probe reactivity of non&#8208;symmetrical dienes under EnT catalysis, paying particular attention to the impact of boron hybridisation effects on the target reactivity. Through this, a highly site&#8208; and regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition was realised with the employed boron motif effecting reaction efficiency. Subtle modifications to the core scaffold enabled a [4+2] cycloaddition, while a counterintuitive regiodivergence was observed in geometric isomerisation versus [2+2] cycloaddition. The observed reactivity was validated via a mechanistic investigation, determining the origin of regiodivergence and reaction selectivity in competing EnT processes.

         <title>Mass Transfer&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Membranes with Synergistic Light Utilization for High&#8208;Turbidity Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A suspended photothermal Fenton membrane is specifically designed to address the challenges of light attenuation and impurity interference in treating high&#8208;turbidity and colored wastewater. Impressive light utilization and mass transfer allow for continuous operation in a flow reactor for up to 10&#8197;days without any significant decline in actual industrial wastewater.







Abstract
The photo&#8208;Fenton process faces significant limitations in treating high&#8208;turbidity, colored wastewater due to light attenuation and impurity interference (blocked mass transfer). To address these issues, we developed a suspended photothermal Fenton membrane by loading a photothermal catalyst on a hydrophobically modified cotton filter paper, enabling precise suspension 1&#8197;mm below the water surface. This design achieved 89.49&#8201;% light utilization and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, even in wastewater with extreme chromaticity (10 multiples) and turbidity (703 NTU). The enhanced photothermal conversion accelerated molybdenum co&#8208;catalyzed Fenton reactions and improved peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, maintaining over 90&#8201;% phenol removal for 15&#8197;days. Mechanistic simulations revealed improved mass transfer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pollutants at the solid&#8211;liquid interface, with PMS diffusion identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step. The membrane resisted fouling from suspended solids and maintained stable operation in soil&#8208;containing solutions for 10&#8197;days. This innovative approach offers an efficient solution for degrading pollutants in dark&#8208;colored, high&#8208;turbidity wastewater, overcoming traditional process limitations.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Hydrolysis of Nitriles to Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive hydrolysis of inexpensive and easily accessible nitriles using Ni&#8208;tripos complex allows for the synthesis of functionalized and structurally diverse benzylic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic primary alcohols including the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Nitriles are an abundant class of compounds that are widely used as versatile feedstocks to produce various chemicals including pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals as well as materials.

&lt;p&gt;Nitriles are an abundant class of compounds that are widely used as versatile feedstocks to produce various chemicals including pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals as well as materials. Here we report Ni-catalyzed reductive hydrolysis of nitriles to alcohols in the presence of molecular hydrogen. This conversion likely occurs in a domino reaction sequence that first involves the hydrogenation of nitrile to primary imine, then the hydrolysis of imine, and subsequent deamination to the aldehyde, which is finally hydrogenated to the desired alcohol. Crucial for this reductive hydrolysis process is the commercially available triphos-ligated Ni-complex that enables highly efficient and selective transformation of aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic nitriles including fatty nitriles to prepare functionalized primary alcohols. Further, the synthetic applicability of this Ni-based protocol is presented for the selective conversion of nitrile to alcoholic group in structurally diverse and complex drug molecules as well as agrochemicals.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Stabilization of Excited Triplet States and Enhancement of Internal Electric Field at Dye/PCN Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work affords an efficient approach to promote PHE by both strengthening the driving force at dye/PCN interface and stabilizing excited triplet states of organic dyes by rational modulation of molecular structures and aggregated behaviors. The IEF strength increased by the adjustable substitution positions of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A moieties from p&#8208; to o&#8208;substitution, and the lifetimes of excited triplet states were prolonged by the alkyl chain engineering.







Abstract
The heterojunction photocatalysts composed of organic dyes and polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) have great potential for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE). However, serious charge recombination exists at the dye/PCN interface for the large gaps in time scales and the poor driving force of charge transfer process. Herein, both the excited triplet states of organic dyes with long lifetimes and strong internal electric fields (IEF) as charge transfer driving forces are achieved by the construction of high dipole moments with aromatic&#8208;core engineering, and modulation of dye aggregates by alkyl modification. Accordingly, PHE efficiency can achieve up to 833.49&#8197;&#956;mol/h, over 36&#8208;fold that of PCN/Pt (23.34&#8197;&#956;mol/h) under the same conditions. The relationship between molecular structures and PHE performance has been systematically investigated by the photophysical properties of organic dyes and the strength of IEF at dye/PCN interface. It afforded an efficient strategy to balance the charge transfer process in PHE systems, which can guide the molecular design of organic dyes with optimized aggregated behaviors and stable excited triplet states.

         <title>Linker Installation in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Enhanced Quantitative Redox Species Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) demonstrate remarkable versatility, enabling tailored properties and functions through targeted design and modification. Linker installation provides an efficient approach to achieve specific alterations. Notably, a series of redox&#8208;active dyes were successfully integrated into the Zr&#8208;MOF PCN&#8208;700, enabling enhanced&#8208;type quantitative recognition of diverse reductants and oxidants.







Abstract
Linker installation has proven to be an effective strategy for introducing diverse functional groups into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Reductants and oxidants are found in various environments, but their accumulation poses a danger due to their high reactivity, necessitating prompt monitoring instantly, particularly in natural environments and industrial processes. In this study, a series of redox&#8208;active dyes were successfully incorporated into a flexible Zr&#8208;based MOF, PCN&#8208;700, through linker installation strategy. Notably, both the reduction of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Resazurin towards oxidants and oxidation of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Amplex Red towards reductants result in the formation of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Resorufin, which exhibit visible color changes and largely elevated luminescent intensities, giving rise to the quantitative recognition of reductants and oxidants. This work presents a straightforward approach to developing efficient luminescent sensors for the rapid qualitative and quantitative detection of reductants and oxidants, extending the sensing mechanism from common energy transfer to electron transfer and demonstrating the MOF's versability as a highly designable sensing material for target analytes.

         <title>Dynamic Passivation of Perovskite Films via Gradual Additive Release for Enhanced Solar Cell Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this, we propose a dynamic passivation strategy that employs a pre&#8208;passivator, formamidinesulfinic acid (FSA), to synchronize the release of additives with the generation of defect sites, thereby enabling in situ and real&#8208;time defect passivation. A champion perovskite solar cell achieves an impressive solar conversion efficiency of 25.33&#8201;%, accompanied with an exceptional stability.







Abstract
Modifying perovskites with functional additives has proven effective in refining the crystallization process and passivating the defects of perovskite films, thereby ensuring high photovoltaic efficiencies. However, conventional methods that involve pre&#8208;mixing additives into the precursor solution often face challenges due to discrepancies in the spatial distribution of slow&#8208;diffused additives relative to dynamically formed defect sites, resulting in limited passivation effectiveness. To address this issue, this study innovatively proposes a dynamic passivation strategy that utilizes a pre&#8208;passivator to gradually release active additives during the thermal crystallization process of perovskite films. By leveraging the principle of energy minimization, these timely&#8208;released additives can interact precisely and selectively with the high&#8208;energy defect sites generated during crystallization, thus facilitating efficient additive utilization and in situ real&#8208;time defect passivation. Through analysis of crystallization kinetics and carrier dynamic, it is demonstrated that this dynamic passivation approach significantly improves film quality and prolongs carrier lifetime, outperforming traditional pre&#8208;mixing tactics. Consequently, the final perovskite solar cell achieves an impressive solar conversion efficiency of 25.33&#8201;%, along with exceptional stability. This work provides strong support of tailored additive strategies aimed at further enhancing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells and their subsequent commercial applications.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Skeletal Editing through a Formal Nitrogen Insertion into Indoles to Synthesize Atropisomeric Aminoaryl Quinoxalines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I) and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) relay catalyzed enantioselective skeletal editing of indoles with 1,2&#8208;aminoarenes to quinoxaline ring has been developed to prepare various axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines could be converted into various axially chiral building blocks and aminoaryl quinoxaline derived ligand is demonstrated to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Skeletal editing represents an attractive strategy for adding complexity to a given molecular scaffold in chemical synthesis. Isodesmic reactions provide a complementary skeletal editing approach for the redistribution of chemical bonds in chemical synthesis. However, catalytic enantioselective isodesmic reaction is extremely scarce and enantioselective isodesmic reaction to synthesize atropisomeric compounds is unknown. Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines through Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization and sequential chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;N bond formation and cleavage from indoles and 1,2&#8208;diaminoarenes under mild reaction conditions. In this process, the five&#8208;membered ring of the indole scaffold was broken and a novel quinoxaline skeleton was constructed. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines in high yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and generally excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Notably, this novel type of quinoxaline atropisomers has promising applications in developing axially chiral ligand in asymmetric catalysis. This strategy represents the first example of CPA&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic reaction to form axially chiral compounds.

         <title>Toward Rhenium&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized OLEDs Using Tailored Chiral Re(CO)3 Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Re(I) emitters exhibiting strong circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with enhanced dissymmetry factors and PLQYs are tailored and exploited to develop the the first examples of rhenium&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs. The latter exhibit gEL factors of up to 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3 along with a good device performance.

Chiral rhenium(I) emitters exhibiting circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) are an attractive mainstay for CP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). However, the efficiency of such emitters is not ideal, and they have never been explored for circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) applications. Here, we have tailored robust chiral Re(I) complexes with improved CPP properties, and demonstrated CPEL from rhenium emitters for the first time. Two pairs of enantiomeric Re(I) complexes have been synthesized by introducing of one or two chiral menthol groups into 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline unit (phen) of archetypical emitters [ReBr(CO)3(phen)]. The designed complexes exhibit a yellow CPP with enhanced |glum| factors (up to 2.5&#215;10&#8722;2) and a good quantum efficiency. The pioneering Re(I)&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs (based on the obtained emitters) exhibit yellow CPEL with |gEL| factors of up to 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3 and a maximal external quantum efficiency of 13.2&#8201;%. This work highlights the good potential of chiral Re(I) emitters for CPEL applications, and opens up a new shortcut to CPP&#8208;active Re(I) complexes.

         <title>A Chiral COFs Membrane for Enantioselective Amino Acid Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct synthesis approach was employed to fabricate a homochiral covalent organic framework (COF) utilizing a well&#8208;defined chiral amine precursor. The resulting membrane exhibited exceptional enantioselectivity for racemic phenylalanine due to the uniform distribution of chiral recognition sites and a high degree of size matching between the chiral centers and the target molecule. This resulted in an enantiomeric excess value reaching 99.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Incorporating chiral molecules in the covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with uniformly ordered pores results in chiral COFs, which have been highly promising candidates for enantioseparation. Herein, a homochiral COF nanochannel membrane is reported by introducing chiral centers (L&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester) into one of the organic ligands for the enantioseparation of chiral amino acids. The separation results show that the D&#8208;isomer is preferentially transported through the porous membrane channel. This composite membrane exhibits excellent selectivity for racemic phenylalanine with the highest enantiomeric excess value of up to 99.4&#8201;%. The adsorption and molecular modeling studies substantiate the experiment results by showing higher bonding affinity towards D&#8208;isomer over L&#8208;isomer. The excellent enantioselective gating performance unveils the porous COF skeleton with chiral selectors and the size&#8208;matching synergy for stereoselective interactions with chiral isomers.

Site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of oxime ethers by controlling the orientation of a directing group using electron&#8208;deficient Cp*CF3Ir(III) and a photosensitizer is reported. Switchable and successive C(sp3)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H double functionalization was accomplished by manipulating the order of C&#8722;H activation to construct densely functionalized structures.







Abstract
A site&#8208;selective functionalization of a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond was achieved in the presence of an intrinsically more reactive C(sp2)&#8722;H bond by controlling the orientation of a directing group via a photo&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization of an oxime ether. By combining E/Z isomerization and an electron deficient Cp*CF3Ir(III) catalyst, the scope of oxime ethers in C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization was successfully expanded. Based on this strategy, the order of C&#8722;H activation was switchable and successive C(sp3)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H double functionalizations were accomplished to construct densely functionalized structures.

         <title>Diastereoselective Polypseudorotaxane Formation with Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Co&#8208;crystallization Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective polypseudorotaxane formation was achieved through the simple co&#8208;crystallization of a diastereomeric pillar[5]arene macrocycle and poly(ethylene glycol). During the co&#8208;crystallization process, the concentration gradually increased, allowing the pillar[5]arene and poly(ethylene glycol) to assemble closely. Consequently, the matched packing of the pillar[5]arene side chains facilitated the cooperative arrangement of pillar[5]arenes with the same chirality along the polymer chain.







Abstract
As the number of chiral ring molecules in chiral polyrotaxane increases, the number of possible stereoisomers exponentially increases. Consequently, the selective synthesis of a specific stereoisomer becomes much more challenging. To address this problem, we co&#8208;crystallized poly(ethylene glycol) and a diastereomeric ring molecule, pillar[5]arene, in the solid state. The co&#8208;crystallization formed polypseudorotaxanes with a high diastereomeric excess (ca. 88&#8201;% de), meaning that polypseudorotaxanes containing (S, pS) stereoisomer pillar[5]arene rings were synthesized selectively. By contrast, in solution and evaporation systems, the selectivity remained low (ca. 10&#8201;% de). The results suggested that the packing effect by the co&#8208;crystallization contributed to the denser assembly of ring molecules on the polymeric chain, resulting in the diastereoselective formation. High diastereoselectivity was also observed even in higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(ethylene glycol)s. These selectivities arose from the cooperative effects of the ring molecules on the polymeric chain, which were supported by calculating the stabilization energy.

         <title>Insight into Robust Anion Coordination Behavior of Organic Cathode with Dual Elongated &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual elongation strategy of &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs with active sites is proposed, containing both the extended carbazole and electropolymerized polymer, which enhances electronic conductivity by the electronic delocalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing conjugated groups, boosts theoretical capacity by increasing redox&#8208;active site density, and endows robust electrochemical stability attributed to nanonetwork organic structures.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials offer multi&#8208;electron reactivity, flexible structures, and redox reversibility, but encounter poor conductivity and durability in electrolytes. To overcome above barriers, we propose a dual elongation strategy of &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs with active sites, involving the extended carbazole and electropolymerized polymer, which enhances electronic conductivity by the electronic delocalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing conjugated groups, boosts theoretical capacity by increasing redox&#8208;active site density, and endows robust electrochemical stability attributed to the nanonetwork feature of polymer structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, 5,11&#8208;dihydridoindolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole (DHIC) is selected as the model cathode material for a dual&#8208;ion battery, with elongated carbazole groups functioning both as redox&#8208;active centers and polymerization anchors. Electrochemical comparisons and theoretical simulations validate the excellent specific capacity, accelerated reaction kinetics, and enhanced anion storage stability imparted by the dual elongated &#960;&#8208;conjugated system containing both carbazole motif and electropolymerized DHIC (pDHIC). Simultaneously, the coordination interaction between pDHIC and anions is innovatively evidenced through operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. As anticipated, pDHIC cathode delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 197&#8197;mAh/g at 50&#8197;mA/g, far outperforming graphite cathodes, and maintains excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 86.1&#8201;% over 500&#8197;cycles. This synergetic strategy sheds light on the performance revolution of organic electrode materials.

As anticipated, pDHIC cathode delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 197&#8197;mAh/g at 50&#8197;mA/g, far outperforming graphite cathodes, and maintains excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 86.1&#8201;% over 500&#8197;cycles. This synergetic strategy sheds light on the performance revolution of organic electrode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Dehalogenation of Aryl Halides Mediated by the Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework MIL&#8208;53(Cr)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic potential of flexible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains underexplored, particularly in solution&#8208;phase reactions. This study employs MIL&#8208;53(Cr), a prototypical "breathing" MOF capable of structural adaptation via pore size modulation, as a photocatalyst for the dehalogenation of aryl halides. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function analyses reveal that organic solvents influence pore opening, while substrates and products dynamically adjust the framework configuration during catalysis. This structural flexibility enables precise tuning of photocatalytic efficiency via solvent&#8208;mediated control of the pore aperture. The results demonstrate that the dynamic behavior of MIL&#8208;53(Cr) facilitates enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity, advancing the application of flexible MOFs as tunable, enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalysts. These findings pave the way for the rational design of next&#8208;generation flexible photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Energy/Electron Transfer within Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) &#8211; compact covalently folded single polymer chains &#8211; can increase photocatalytic performance of an embedded catalytic center, compared to the comparable catalytic system in free solution. In particular, we demonstrate that the degree of compaction allows to finely tailor the catalytic activity, thus evidencing that molecular confinement is a key factor in controlling photocatalysis. Specifically, we decorate a linear parent polymer with both photoreactive chalcone moieties as well as Ru(bpy)3 catalytic centers. We initially construct a SCNP via a photosensitized [2+2] cycloaddition at 510&#160;nm and demonstrate that the SCNP formation is substantially more efficient when the Ru(bpy)3 units are part of the polymer chain instead of as free molecules in solution. Subsequently, we employ the same Ru(bpy)3 units as photocatalysts in a model reaction employing pyrene units as charge transfer moieties. We establish that the photocatalytic activity increases as the polymer becomes more compact, reaching peak efficiency, followed by a subsequent decline as the SCNP becomes too compact. Thus, we identify a goldilocks regime of catalyst confinement via SCNP compaction for use in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrosynthesis of mussel&#8208;inspired adhesive polymers as a novel class of transient enzyme stabilizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional ortho&#8208;quinones are required for the formation of thiol&#8208;catechol&#8208;connectivities (TCC) but can be delicate to handle. We present the electrochemical oxidation of the dipeptide DiDOPA, achieving up to 92% conversion efficiency of the catechols to ortho&#8208;quinones. Graphite and stainless steel could be employed as cost&#8208;efficient electrodes. The electrochemical activation yields quinone&#8208;solutions, which are free of undesired reactive compounds and eliminates the challenging step of isolating the reactive quinones. The DiDOPA quinones were employed in polyaddition reactions with multi&#8208;thiols, forming oligomers that functioned as transient enzyme stabilizers (TES). These TCC&#8208;TES&#8208;additives improved the thermal stability and the activity of tyrosinase in heat stress assays.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF&#8208;based Dual&#8208;Layer Pickering Emulsion: Molecular&#8208;Level Gating of Water Delivery at Water&#8208;Oil Interface for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogenation Using H2O as a Hydrogen Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biphasic system not only presents a promising opportunity for complex catalytic processes, but also is a grand challenge in efficient tandem reactions. As an emerging solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and water&#8208;donating hydrogenation combines the sustainability of photocatalysis and economic&#8208;value of hydrogenation. However, the key and challenging point is to couple water&#8208;soluble photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with oil&#8208;soluble hydrogenation. Herein, we employed metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and CdS nanorods to construct a MOF&#8208;CdS dual&#8208;layer Pickering emulsion (water in oil, W/O), which compartmented aqueous phase for photocatalytic HER and oil phase for hydrogenation. The hydrophobic MOF and hydrophilic CdS were isolated at the inner and outer layers of W/O emulsion, respectively. The molecularly regulated hydrophobicity of MOF controlled the water delivery onto CdS photocatalysts, which realized the synergistic regulation of HER and hydrogenation. In the photocatalytic hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, the highest yield of MOF&#8208;CdS Pickering emulsion reached 187.37 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1, 30 times that of the counterpart without emulsion (6.44 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1). Its apparent quantum yield reached 43.24% without co&#8208;catalysts. To our knowledge, this performance is at a top&#8208;level so far. Our work realized the precise regulation of water&#8208;oil interface to effectively couple two reactions in different phases, providing new perspective for challenging tandem catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Insulator Heterojunction with Electric Dipole Domain to Boost Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterojunction materials are considered as promising electrocatalyst candidates that empower advanced lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. However, the detailed functional mechanism of heterojunction materials to boost the sulfur redox reaction kinetics remains unclear. Herein, we construct a multifunctional potential well&#8208;type Bi2Te3/TiO2 topological insulator (TI) heterojunction with electric dipole domain to elucidate the synergistic mechanism, which facilitates rapid mass transport, strengthens polysulfide capture ability and accelerates polysulfide conversion. Therefore, the Li&#8208;S battery with Bi2Te3/TiO2 TI heterojunction modified separator achieves high utilization of sulfur cathode, delivering a high reversible specific capacity of 1375 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 C and long cycling capability with a negligible capacity decay of 0.022% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Even with the high sulfur loading of 13.2 mg cm&#8208;2 and low E/S ratio of 3.8 &#181;L mg&#8208;1, a high area capacity of 11.2 mAh cm&#8208;2 and acceptable cycling stability can be obtained. This work provides guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TI heterojunctions to promote the practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The last decade has witnessed significant progress in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) due to their enormous potential applications in various bioelectronic devices, such as artificial synapses, biological interfaces, and biosensors. The remarkable advance achieved in this filed is highly powered by the development of novel organic mixed ionic/electronic conductors (OMIECs). Among these, &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs), which are widely used in various optoelectronics, are emerging as key channel materials for OECTs. In this review, after briefly introducing of OECT, we then mainly focus on the latest progress in CPs for high&#8208;performance OECTs. The correlations of their structure, basic physicochemical properties, and device performance are further elucidated via evaluating their electronic characters, optoelectronic properties, and OECT performance. Then, the applications of CP&#8208;based OECTs are briefly presented. Finally, we discuss several remaining issues or challenges in this field and give our insight into advancing CPs for enhanced OECT performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Defluorinative C&#8210;O Coupling between Trifluoromethylarenes and Alcohols via Copper Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds have shown unparalleled impacts in the realm of functional molecules, and the ability to prepare novel structures has been crucial in unlocking new properties for applications in pharmaceutical and materials science. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed, photoinduced defluorinative C&#8210;O coupling between trifluoromethylarenes and alcohols. This method allows for direct access to a wide selection of difluorobenzylether (ArCF2OR) molecules, including a compound displaying liquid crystal behavior. Through slight modification of the protocol, we were able to generate ArCF2I products, another class of synthetically useful fluorine&#8208;bearing molecules. Mechanistic investigations first suggested that ArCF2I can serve as a reservoir to steadily supply the key ArCF2&#8226; radical species. Furthermore, experimental evidence supported a mechanism consisting of two collaborative cycles: C&#8210;F activation operated by a homoleptic Cu(I) coordinated by two bisphosphine ligands as the photocatalyst and C&#8210;O coupling promoted by a Cu(I) ligated by a single bisphosphine ligand. The critical roles of the two salt additives, lithium iodide and zinc acetate, in orchestrating the two cycles were also elucidated. This dual&#8208;role copper catalyst demonstrates the power of base metal photoredox catalysis in achieving both substrate activation and chemical bond formation via a single catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>2,3:6,7&#8210;Naphthalenediimide&#8208;based Chiral Triangular Macrocycle: Self&#8208;Assembled Helix, Outer &#960;&#8208;surface Directed Co&#8208;assembly and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of a novel chiral 2,3:6,7&#8210;naphthalenediimide&#8208;based triangular macrocycle (NDI&#8208;&#8710;) and their chiroptical properties. The enantiomeric NDI&#8208;&#8710; is synthesized by condensation of (RR) or (SS)&#8208;trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine and 2,3,6,7&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylic 2,3:6,7&#8208;dianhydride, in which the chirality of the macrocycles is controlled by the diamine. With the rigid outer &#960;&#8208;surface, the macrocycle showed unique chiroptical properties and self&#8208;assembly modes. The NDI&#8208;&#8710; showed circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in solution and can self&#8208;assemble into helical structures with the inversion of CPL signal and the enhancement of |glum|. Moreover, the NDI&#8208;&#8710; has a tailored electron&#8208;deficient outer &#960;&#8208;surface, which can co&#8208;assemble with an electron&#8208;rich anthracene (AN) to form an intermolecular charge transfer (CT) complex, generating a yellow&#8208;green CT&#8208;CPL. Crystal structure analysis confirms that AN is mounted on the outer surface of NDI&#8208;&#8710; through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. This work provides a critical example for self&#8208;assembly of macrocycles into helical structures and outer &#960;&#8208;surface directed CT complexes formation, opening up a new clue for designing chiral macrocycle&#8208;based chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Topology&#8208;Controlled BODIPY and CO2&#8208;Based Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based zirconium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) possess strong light&#8208;harvesting capabilities and great potential for artificial photosynthesis without the use of sacrificial reagents. However, their direct preparation has not yet been achieved due to challenges in synthesizing suitable ligands. Herein, we reported the first successful direct synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOFs, utilizing CO&#8322; as a feedstock. By controlling synthetic conditions, we successfully obtained two distinct Zr&#8208;MOFs. The first, CO2&#8208;Zr6&#8208;DEPB, exhibits a face&#8208;centered cubic (fcu) topology based on a Zr6(&#956;3&#8208;O)4(&#956;3&#8208;OH)4 node, while the second, CO2&#8208;Zr12&#8208;DEPB, features a hexagonal closed packed (hcp) topology, structured around a Zr12(&#956;3&#8208;O)8(&#956;3&#8208;OH)8(&#956;2&#8208;OH)6 node. Both MOFs demonstrated excellent crystallinity, as verified through powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses. These MOF catalysts displayed suitable photocatalytic redox potentials for the reduction of CO2 to CO using H2O as the electron donor in the absence of co&#8208;catalyst or toxic sacrificial reagent. Under light irradiation, CO2&#8208;Zr12&#8208;DEPB and CO2&#8208;Zr6&#8208;DEPB offered high CO yields of 16.72 and 13.91 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, respectively, with nearly 100% selectivity. CO2 uptake and photoelectrochemical experiments revealed key insights into the mechanisms driving the different catalytic activities of the two MOFs. These BODIPY and CO2&#8208;based, light&#8208;responsive Zr&#8208;MOFs represent a promising platform for the development of efficient photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Bionic Hollow Porous Carbon Nanofibers for Energy&#8208;Dense and Rapid Zinc Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Suboptimal spatial utilization and inefficient access to internal porosity preclude porous carbon cathodes from delivering high energy density in zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs). Inspired by the function of capillaries in biological systems, this study proposes a facile coordination&#8208;pyrolysis method to fabricate thin&#8208;walled hollow carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with optimized pore structure and surface functional groups for ZHICs. The capillary&#8208;like CNFs maximize the electrode/electrolyte interface area, facilitating the optimal utilization of energy storage sites. The precision&#8208;engineered pore sizes in the fiber walls are specifically tailored to accommodate solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+, thus enhancing ion storage capacity and supporting accelerated transport kinetics. The resultant ZIHCs achieve a battery&#8208;grade energy density of 132.8 Wh kg&#8208;1 (based on active material), remarkable stability (98.7% retention after 80,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1), along with practically high areal capacities. Combined in situ/ex situ spectroscopic characterizations, kinetic analyses, and theoretical calculations revealed that the superior energy storage performance arises from the advantageous microstructure of the biomimetic CNFs and the reversible physical/chemical adsorption process. This investigation offers a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency zinc ion storage carbon nanomaterials and provides insights into the cathodic storage mechanisms essential for advancing ZIHCs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenide&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solar cell optimized for rear illumination and used for CO2 reduction is presented. Central to this innovation is a thinner, Cu(In,Ga)S2 chalcopyrite absorber coated with a robust metallic top layer, which potentially surpasses the performance of conventional front&#8208;illuminated designs. Using cobalt quaterpyridine molecular catalyst, photocurrent densities for CO2 reduction exceeding 10 mA/cm2 at 0.0 V vs. RHE under 1 Sun illumination, and ca. 16 mA/cm2 at &#8208;0.25 V vs. RHE were achieved in voltammetry experiments. Controlled potential electrolysis showed catalytic activity over 20 h with selectivity for CO ranging from &gt; 92% (first 4 hours) to 86% at the end of the experiment. This approach opens limitless possibilities for employing various reduction catalysts, extending far beyond CO2 reduction. It imposes minimal constraints on absorption properties, immobilization methods, and catalyst nature, setting the stage for high&#8208;performance, adaptable PEC devices.</dc:description>

         <title>B12&#8208;Dependent Radical SAM Enzymes Catalyze C&#8208;Fluoromethylation via a CH2F&#8208;cobalamin Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine and fluorine&#8208;containing functional groups play important roles in drugs and agrochemicals. Recently, SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and several SAM analogues have been reported for fluoromethyl transfer through a nucleophilic mechanism. However, fluoromethylation of unactivated carbon centers is very challenging, and their substitution usually involves a radical mechanism. To date, no biocatalysts have been developed for fluoromethylation of unactivated carbon centers. In this study, we found that the B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM methyltransferase (B12&#8208;RSMT) QCMT can fluoromethylate the glutamine C&#945; position of peptides with fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) generated in situ by the enzyme AclHMT.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fluorine and fluorine-containing functional groups play important roles in drugs and agrochemicals. Recently, SAM-dependent methyltransferases and several SAM analogues have been reported for fluoromethyl transfer through a nucleophilic mechanism. However, fluoromethylation of unactivated carbon centers is very challenging, and their substitution usually involves a radical mechanism. To date, no biocatalysts have been developed for fluoromethylation of unactivated carbon centers. In this study, we found that the B12-dependent radical SAM methyltransferase (B12-RSMT) QCMT can fluoromethylate the glutamine C&#945; position of peptides with fluorinated SAM (F-SAM) generated in situ by the enzyme AclHMT. QCMT can cleave F-SAM to produce the 5&#180;-dA radical. The significant reaction intermediate CH2FCbI was characterized by HR-MS, 19F-NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. In addition, B12-RSMTs CysS and GenD1 can also transfer fluoromethyl groups onto natural products. We also found that F-SAM is not compulsory. The reduced B12-RSMTs can directly generate CH2FCbI with CH2FI and transfer the CH2F group when SAM is used as the radical initiator. Our results demonstrate a radical-mediated enzymatic strategy for fluoromethylation with abiological cofactors and expand radical SAM enzymes to the field of fluorine chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Design of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts with Nonplanar and Triple Pyrrole&#8208;N Coordination for Highly Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with nonplanar configurations possess unique capabilities for tailoring the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance compared with the ones with planar configurations, owing to the additional orbital rearrangement arising from the asymmetric coordination atoms. However, the systematic investigation of these nonplanar SACs has long been hindered by the difficulty in screening feasible nonplanar configurations and precisely controlling the coordination structures. Herein, we demonstrate a combined high&#8208;throughput screening and experimental verification of nonplanar SACs (ppy&#8208;MN3) for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysis. With the additional p&#8208;orbital rearrangement of N&#8208;ligands for ppy&#8208;MN3 during catalysis, a new descriptor &#65288;&#916;&#1297;d&#8208;p&#65289;&#160;is proposed to accurately identify the relationship between their catalytic activities and electronic structures, on top of the conventional d&#8208;band center theory. Consequently, ppy&#8208;ZnN3 is identified with excellent 2e&#8722; ORR activity (&#951; = 0.08 eV), selectivity, and a low 2e&#8722; ORR kinetic barrier under alkaline condition, which is experimentally verified by its high electrocatalytic H2O2 yield (43 mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and selectivity (92%) under alkaline condition. Thus, this study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept and performance&#8208;oriented design of nonplanar catalysts with precise coordination configurations and presents a complement to the d&#8208;band theory for more accurately predicting the catalytic activities for nonplanar materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Coverage Tuning for Suppressing Over&#8208;oxidation: A Case of Photoelectrochemical Alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;Aldehyde/Ketone Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Suppressing over&#8208;oxidation is a crucial challenge for various chemical intermediate synthesis in heterogeneous catalysis. The distribution of oxidative species and the substrate coverage, governed by the direction of electron transfer, are believed to influence the oxidation extent. In this study, we present an experimental realization of surface coverage modulation on a photoelectrode using a photo&#8208;induced charge activation method. Through the surface coverage modulation, both pre&#8208;oxidized alcohol substrates and surface coverage are increased, which not only improves the reaction kinetics but also suppresses the over&#8208;oxidation of the generated aldehydes/ketones. As a demonstration, the Faradaic efficiency for the conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone increased from 31.8% to 46.8% (with selectivity rising from 47.6% to 71.3%), from 73.4% to 87.8% for benzyl alcohol to benzyl aldehyde (selectivity increasing from 76.7% to 92.4%) and from 4.2% to 53.6% for ethylene glycol to glycolaldehyde (selectivity increasing from 6.2% to 62.7%). Our findings offer a promising strategy for the production of high&#8208;value carbon products in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO on Ni&#8208;Based Cationic Polymer with TiO2&#8208;Assisted Exfoliation and Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic polymers have shown great potential in photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to their unique tunable structure favoring gas adsorption and metal sites integration. However, efficient photocatalysis in porous polymers is greatly limited by the low surface reactivity and electron mobility of bulk structure. Herein, we incorporate TiO2 nanoparticles and Ni(II) sites into a layered cationic imidazolium polymer (IP), in which the imidazolium moieties and free anions can stabilize the key intermediates and enhance the reaction kinetics of CO2 reduction. During the photocatalytic reaction, the layered TiO2/NiIP is in situ exfoliated to nanosheets (NSs) with more accessible active sites and shorten electron transport pathways. The formed TiO2/NiIP&#8208;NSs exhibit an impressively high CO production rate as 54.9 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 with selectivity of 99.9%. The embedding with TiO2 nanoparticles could improve the electron transport efficiency so as to facilitate the photochemical stripping process of layered polymer. Moreover, the exfoliated nanosheets with assistance of TiO2 possess excellent stability during the recycling experiments in comparison to the rapidly declined activity of NiIP&#8208;NSs. This work presents a new strategy to construct highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Mesoscopic Disorder in Graphitic Carbon with Spectroelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intrinsic structural and oxidic defects activate graphitic carbon electrodes towards electrochemical reactions underpinning energy conversion and storage technologies. Yet, these defects can also disrupt the long&#8208;range and periodic arrangement of carbon atoms, and thus the characterization of graphitic carbon electrodes necessitate in&#8208;situ atomistic differentiation of graphitic regions from mesoscopic bulk disorder. Here, we leverage the combined techniques of in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations to reveal that graphitic carbon electrodes exhibit electric&#8208;field dependent infrared activity that is sensitive to the bulk mesoscopic intrinsic disorder. With this platform, we identify graphitic regions from amorphous domains by discovering that they demonstrate opposing electric&#8208;field&#8208;dependent infrared activity under electrochemical conditions. Our work provides a roadmap for identifying mesoscopic disorder in bulk carbon materials under potential bias.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bifunctional Imidazolyl Iodide Mediator of Electrolyte Boosts Cathode Kinetics and Anode Stability Towards Low Overpotential and Long&#8208;Life Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of a redox mediator as soluble catalyst into electrolyte can effectively overcome the bottlenecks of poor energy efficiency and limited cyclability for Li&#8208;O2 batteries caused by passivation of insulating discharge products and unfavorable byproducts. Herein we report a novel soluble catalyst of bifunctional imidazolyl iodide salt additive, 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazole iodide (DMII), to successfully construct highly efficient and durable Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The anion I&#8722; can effectively promote the charge transport of Li2O2 and accelerate the redox kinetics of oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions on the cathode side, thereby significantly decreasing the charge/discharge overpotential. Simultaneously, the cation DMI+ forms an ultrathin stably solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase film on Li metal, greatly inhibiting the shuttle effect of I&#8722; and improving the stability of anode. Using this DMII additive, our Li&#8208;O2 batteries achieve an extremely low voltage of 0.52 V and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability over 960 h. Notably, up to 95.8% of the Li2O2 yield further proves the reversible generation/decomposition of Li2O2 without the occurrence of side reactions. Both experimental and theoretical results disclose that DMII enables Li+ easily solvated, testifying the dominance of the solution&#8208;induced reaction mechanism. This work provides the possibility to design the soluble catalysts towards high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;O2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Regioselective Hydroboration of Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#945;&#8208;boration of allenes has been achieved. Moreover, this unusual selectivity is not only limited to &#945;&#8208;boration, but also generally applicable to the unprecedented &#945;&#8208;alkynylation and the rarely explored &#945;&#8208;silylation of allenes.







Abstract
Hydroboration of allenes is powerful and atom&#8208;economic approach to the synthesis of organoboranes, such as the highly versatile allylboranes. However, regarding regiocontrol, existing methods uniformly deliver the boron functionality to the less hindered &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;position, but not the &#945;&#8208;position. The latter is particularly challenging for allenes with substantial steric difference between the two terminals and lacking electronic bias (e.g., 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes). Herein we report the first highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of allenes featuring exclusive &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity, providing access to sterically hindered allyl boranes that are limitedly accessible by conventional methods. DFT studies suggested that the unusual &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity is attributed to the disfavored reductive elimination at the &#947;&#8208;position due to the high energy cost required to overcome the agostic interaction and rotation of the key &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates. This protocol is also applicable to the previously unprecedented &#945;&#8208;hydroalkynylation and underdeveloped &#945;&#8208;hydrosilylation of allenes, thus complementing known catalytic systems and providing convenient access to highly congested yet densely&#8208;functionalized allyl silanes and skipped enynes bearing a fully&#8208;substituted allylic carbon center. It is expected that this ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed system can serve as a new platform for the development of other hydrofunctionalization processes with unorthodox selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;The first ruthenium-catalyzed regioselective &#945;-boration of allenes has been achieved. Moreover, this unusual selectivity is not only limited to &#945;-boration, but also generally applicable to the unprecedented &#945;-alkynylation and the rarely explored &#945;-silylation of allenes.

&lt;p&gt;Hydroboration of allenes is powerful and atom-economic approach to the synthesis of organoboranes, such as the highly versatile allylboranes. However, regarding regiocontrol, existing methods uniformly deliver the boron functionality to the less hindered &#946;- or &#947;-position, but not the &#945;-position. The latter is particularly challenging for allenes with substantial steric difference between the two terminals and lacking electronic bias (e.g., 1,1-disubstituted allenes). Herein we report the first highly efficient ruthenium-catalyzed hydroboration of allenes featuring exclusive &#945;-regioselectivity, providing access to sterically hindered allyl boranes that are limitedly accessible by conventional methods. DFT studies suggested that the unusual &#945;-regioselectivity is attributed to the disfavored reductive elimination at the &#947;-position due to the high energy cost required to overcome the agostic interaction and rotation of the key &#960;-allyl intermediates. This protocol is also applicable to the previously unprecedented &#945;-hydroalkynylation and underdeveloped &#945;-hydrosilylation of allenes, thus complementing known catalytic systems and providing convenient access to highly congested yet densely-functionalized allyl silanes and skipped enynes bearing a fully-substituted allylic carbon center.

         <title>Cascade&#160;Selenization Regulated the Electronic Structure and Interface Effect of Transition Metal Sulfides for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of cobalt&#8208;based sulfides is constrained by their inherently low conductivity and slow sodium ion diffusion kinetics. Modifying the electronic configuration and constructing heterostructures are promising strategies to enhance intrinsic conductivity and expedite the sodium ion diffusion process. In this study, heterogeneous nanoparticles of Se&#8208;substituted CoS2/CoSe2, embedded within heteroatom&#8208;modified carbon nanosheet, were synthesized using metal molten salt&#8208;assisted dimensionality reduction alongside concurrent sulfurization and selenization techniques. The incorporation of Se into CoS2&#160;markedly enhances its intrinsic conductivity, thereby significantly improving its rate performance. The elongated Co&#8208;S bonds and the formation of CoSe2&#160;species contribute to the acceleration of dynamics and facilitate the construction of the CoS2/CoSe2&#160;heterointerface. In&#8208;situ&#160;Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with theoretical calculations, has elucidated the sodium storage mechanism of the Se&#8208;CoS2/CoSe2&#160;and the underlying factors contributing to its enhanced performance. The synergistic effects of electronic structure engineering, have resulted in the optimized Se&#8208;CoS2/CoSe2&#160;demonstrating exceptional rate performance, achieving 442 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;at 10 A g&#8722;1, and a prolonged cycle lifespan, maintaining 409.3 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;at 5 A g&#8722;1&#160;over 2100 cycles&#160;and 262.5 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;after 7000 cycles&#160;at 10 A g&#8722;1. This study presents a viable strategy for integrating electronic structure engineering with interface engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverting methanol dehydrogenation selectivity by crowding atomic Ni species over &#945;&#8208;MoC catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal carbides with earth&#8208;abundant elements are widely regarded as promising alternatives of noble metal catalysts. Although comparable catalytic performances have been observed for metal carbides in several types of reactions, precise control of reaction pathways on them remains a formidable challenge, partially due to strong adsorption of reactants or intermediates. In this study, we show that bimolecular dehydrogenation of methanol to methyl formate and H2 is kinetically favored on bare &#945;&#8208;MoC catalysts, while monomolecular dehydrogenation to CO and H2 becomes the dominant pathway when &#945;&#8208;MoC is decorated with crowding atomic Ni species. Under optimal conditions, excellent selectivities of the target products (&gt; 90%) were achieved in both cases, with unprecedented production rates of methyl formate and H2 for the former and latter mechanisms, respectively. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational assessments were integrated to clarify the mechanism driving this remarkable selectivity inversion. Isolated Ni sites bound to &#945;&#8208;MoC exhibit superior dehydrogenation activity, which promotes complete cleavage of C&#8208;H bonds in methanol&#8208;derived intermediates rather than the C&#8208;O coupling between them. Our study offers an effective approach to modulating the selectivity of carbide&#8208;based catalysts in alcohol dehydrogenation towards different target products.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenomics&#8208;based Discovery of Novel Orthosteric Choline Kinase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Choline kinase alpha (CHKA) is a central mediator of cell metabolism linked to cancer and immune regulation. Cellular and clinical evaluation of CHKA has been hampered by challenges in the development of drug&#8208;like choline kinase inhibitors. Here, we identify CHKA as an unexpected off&#8208;target of histone methyltransferase inhibitors using an integrated phenomic approach. We confirm CHKA as a direct protein target of the aminoquinazolines UNC0638 and UNC0737 using a combination of chemoproteomic, biochemical, cellular, and metabolic profiling assays, possibly explaining the previously reported discrepancies observed for different G9a/GLP inhibitor scaffolds in cellular assays. Using primary human cell model systems, we discover that CHKA modulation impairs IgG secretion and B&#8208;cell maturation consistent with the notion that choline metabolism plays an important role in immune signalling. Co&#8208;crystal structures of UNC0638 and UNC0737 with CHKA unravel an unexpected binding mode and suggest the inhibitors as attractive starting points for the development of selective chemical tools to further explore the biological role of CHKA in cancer and immune metabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering lattice dislocations of TiO2 support of PdZn&#8208;ZnO dual&#8208;site catalysts to boost CO2 hydrogenation to methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 hydrogenation to methanol using green hydrogen derived from renewable resources provides a promising method for sustainable carbon cycle but suffers from high selectivity towards byproduct CO. Here, we develop an efficient PdZn&#8208;ZnO/TiO2 catalyst by engineering lattice dislocation structures of TiO2 support. We discover that this modification orders irregularly arranged atoms in TiO2 to stabilize crystal lattice, and consequently weakens electronic interactions with supported active phases. It facilitates the transformation of metallic Pd into PdZn alloy, effectively suppressing CO production through inhibiting the reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction mediated by the carboxylate pathway on Pd0 sites. Moreover, it enables the efficient transfer of hydrogen species via hydrogen spillover from PdZn alloy to ZnO for compensating the poor hydrogen dissociation ability of ZnO, thereby creating both more oxygen vacancies essential for CO2 activation and a hydroxyl&#8208;rich environment conducive to hydrogenation of intermediates. These collective modifications on PdZn&#8208;ZnO dual sites synergistically induce the propensity of the formate pathway for methanol synthesis. Consequently, compared to the unmodified catalyst, our as&#8208;designed catalyst increases methanol selectivity from 64.2 to 80.0%, reduces CO selectivity from 35.0 to 19.8%, and achieves an impressive methanol space&#8208;time yield of 9028.0 mgMeOH gPd+Zn&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at a similar CO2 conversion (~8.0%).</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Microdomain Consistency in Polymer Electrolytes towards Sustainable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer electrolytes incorporated with fillers possess immense potential for constructing the fast and selective Li+ conduction. However, the inhomogeneous distribution of the fillers usually deteriorates the microdomain consistency of the electrolytes, resulting in uneven Li+ flux, and unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we formulate a solution&#8208;process chemistry to in&#8208;situ construct gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with well&#8208;dispersed metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), leading to a uniform microdomain structure. Through the integration of X&#8208;ray computed tomography analyses and theoretical simulations, our research identifies that the improvement of microdomain consistency in GPEs is beneficial for enhancing its mechanical strength, homogenizing ionic/electronic field distribution and upgrading the interface stability with the elctrodes. Moreover, consistently spread MOFs bind effectively with Lewis&#8208;base anions of Li salts, enhancing Li+ kinetics. Owing to these advantages, the developed GPEs achieve a high conductivity of 1.51 mS cm&#8722;1 and a Li+ transference number of 0.66, resulting in exceptional cyclability of lithium metal electrodes (over 1800 hours). Additionally, the solid&#8208;state NCM811//Li pouch batteries exhibit an impressive capacity retention of 94.2% over 200 cycles with an N/P ratio of 1.69. This study emphasizes the significant impact of microdomain structural chemistry on the advancement of solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Cross&#8208;Linked Polymers for Enhanced Thermal Cycling Stability in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) are a promising emerging photovoltaic technology, with certified power conversion efficiencies reaching 26.61%. However, the frequent occurrence of grain fractures and interface delamination raises concerns about their ability to endure the mechanical stresses caused by temperature fluctuations. In this study, we employ an in&#8208;situ polymerization molecule with extended functional end groups to preserve mechanical integrity during thermal cycling. The AMPS&#8208;DEA molecule chemically anchors to grain boundaries and cross&#8208;links neighboring grains, protecting the structure from stress accumulation. Additionally, its hydroxyl groups form bidentate chelation with SnO2, enhancing interfacial adhesion and preventing delamination. More importantly, the relaxed residual stress provided by AMPS&#8208;DEA allows the perovskite layer to adapt to temperature changes, effectively matching adjacent layers and preventing mechanical failure. Our findings demonstrate that AMPS&#8208;DEA modification not only boosts PCE to 25.78% in rigid PSCs and 24.54% in flexible PSCs but also improves stability, maintaining over 95% efficiency after 10,000 bending cycles and 200 thermal cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Reinforcing Coverage of Self&#8208;assembled Monomolecular Layers for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency of 25.70%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM) as hole transport layers have been widely used in high&#8208;efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeded 26%. However, the poor coverage and non&#8208;uniform distribution on the substrate of SAM further restrict the improvement of device performance. Herein, we utilize the mixed SAM strategy via the MeO&#8208;2PACz along with perfluorotripropylamine (FC&#8208;3283) to improve the SAM coverage, aiming to accelerate the carrier transport, promote the perovskite growth, regulate the surface energy levels and suppress the nonradiative recombination. The champion device with the mixed&#8208;SAM achieves an efficiency of 25.70% (certified efficiency of 25.6%) with long&#8208;term stability (maintained the initial efficiency of 90% after 1000 h and 180 h under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 and ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Na+ Transport Pathway and Stable Interface Design Enabling Ultralong Life Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) using solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) show impressive superiority in energy density and safety. As promising candidates for SPEs, solid&#8208;state plastic crystal electrolytes (SPCE) based on succinonitrile (SN) plastic crystal could achieve high ion conductivity and wide voltage window. Nonetheless, the notorious SN decomposition reaction on the electrode/electrolyte interface seriously challenges the stable operation of the battery. To address this drawback, we commence with the structural engineering of the polymer chain segments in SPCE and employ intermolecular interactions to optimize the composition of solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Moreover, this study elucidates the migration mechanism of sodium ions in SPCE in detail. The assembled sodium symmetric cells display a high critical current density of up to 2.7 mA cm&#8208;2 and stable cycling performance for 700 hours at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the Na/SPCE&#8208;9/Na3V2(PO4)3 maintains a discharge specific capacity of up to 76.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 10 C and shows impressive long&#8208;cycle stability, retaining 86.2% of initial capacity over 5000 cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.9%. The stability of the SEI construction is meaningful to the cycle life. Our work presents a high&#8208;performance SPCE with intrinsic safety, providing valuable insights for the future design of solid&#8208;state SMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Upgrading to Biodegradable Plastics through Photo/Electro&#8208;Synthetic Biohybrid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and the pervasive issue of nondegradable plastic pollution underscore dual urgent challenges in pursuit of a sustainable society. Achieving such sustainability in the plastic industry, while effectively addressing these environmental concerns, necessitates the development and implementation of innovative strategies for the synthesis of biodegradable polymers utilizing CO2 as feedstocks. The technologies not only facilitate the mitigation of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations but also introduce a renewable carbon resource for polymer manufacturing. While considerable research has been undertaken in CO2 upgrading to various C1&#8208;3 products, the production of biodegradable polymers from CO2 remains a formidable challenge. Here, we delineate the principal methodologies for catalytic CO2 upgrading to biodegradable polymers, encompassing photocatalytic&#8208;biological processes and electrocatalytic&#8208;biological approaches. The emphasis of this perspective is on the optimization of production processes and catalyst efficiency, which are paramount in addressing the imperative challenge of decarbonization in the plastic industry, thereby aligning with global environmental sustainability goals.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Rational Design of Confined Catalysis in Carbon Nanotube by Machine Learning and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The microenvironment is recognized to be as crucial as active sites in heterogeneous catalysis. It was found that the catalytic activity of a set of chemical reactions can be significantly influenced by the confined space of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with some reactions showing superior activity, while others experience a negative impact. The rational design of confined catalysis must rely on the accurate insights of confined microenvironment. However, the structural complexity of confined catalysts and the interaction with microenvironment hinders the deciphering of chemical origins behind experiments. In this work, Grand&#8208;canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are conducted for confined catalysis in CNTs at various reaction atmospheres, accelerated by machine learning potentials. The statistical outcomes of GCMC simulations corroborate a general feature that the electronic interaction (binding energy) inside CNTs is weaker than outside cases. By using Random Forest (RF) model, we ascertain that the shortening of the bond lengths of catalysts within the confined space is the dominant factor, resulting in the weakened binding energy and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center. Using the bond length variation as a simplified descriptor, our microkinetic models successfully reproduced the seemingly contradictive experiments, namely, the observed enhancement and suppression for the same reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>La3+ Doped Nickel&#8208;Manganese Oxide as High&#8208;Capacity Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Guided by Bayesian Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the layered transition metal oxides used as cathode often experience interlayer sliding of interlayer spacing and lattice variations during charge/discharge, leading to structural damage and capacity degradation. To address this challenge, a La3+ doping strategy guided by Bayesian optimization has been employed to prepare the high&#8208;performance O3&#8208;NaNi0.39Mn0.50Cu0.06La0.05O2 (NMCL) cathode material. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the O 2p orbital overlaps with the t2g orbital of transition metals in NMCL, facilitating the formation of Na&#8208;O&#8208;La bonds and promoting the oxygen redox reaction kinetics. During the Na&#8314; (de)intercalation process, NMCL exhibits significant negative lattice expansion, characterized by an increase in the c lattice parameter and exceptionally low volume expansion of 1.8% and 3.4%, respectively. Consequently, it delivers an excellent specific capacity of 243.3 mAh g&#8208;1 over a wide voltage range of 2.0 V to 4.5 V, which can be attributed to La3+ doping that promotes oxidation of O2&#8208; to peroxide O2n&#8208; (n &lt; 2) during charge.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing battery longevity by regulating the solvation chemistry of organic iodide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, the low electrical conductivity of iodine and the easy dissolution of polyiodide in the electrolyte need to be carefully managed to ensure efficient operation. Herein, we introduce an organic iodized salt, formamidinium iodide (CH5N2I), to modulate the solvation structure of iodide ion, aimed to improve the reaction kinetics of iodine for reversible redox conversion. The participation of formamidinium ion (FA+) into solvation structure leads to the formation of the favorable FAIZn(H2O)42+ complex, facilitating easier desolvation for redox conversion with iodine. Consequently, the inhibited formation of soluble polyiodide efficiently suppresses self&#8208;discharging and improves reversible redox conversion. Specifically, the fabricated battery demonstrates extraordinary cycling stability, with 90.1% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles and high coulombic efficiency of 99.6%. These results provide inspiring principles to develop organohalide materials for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries through the solvation modification and interface regulation strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;adjustable High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles as an Efficient Platform for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high entropy alloy (HEA) possesses distinctive thermal stability and electronic characteristics, which exhibits substantial potential for diverse applications in electrocatalytic reactions. However, accurately controlling the size of HEA still remains a challenge, especially for the ultrasmall HEA nanoparticles. Herein, we firstly calculate and illustrate the size impact on the electronic structure of HEA and the adsorption energies of crucial intermediates in typical electrocatalytic reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) and NO3&#8211; electroreduction (NO3RR). Under the guidance of theoretical calculations, we synthesize a range of ultrasmall PtRuPdCoNi HEA nanoparticles with adjustable sizes (1.7, 2.3, 3.0, and 3.9 nm) using a one&#8208;step spatially confined approach. Specifically, HEA nanoparticles with 1.7 nm size (HEA&#8208;1.7) endows a 16 mV overpotential at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, yielding a mass activity of 31.9 A mgNM&#8208;1 of noble metal in HER, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst. This strategy can also be easily applicable to other reduction reactions attributed to the richness of metal components and size adjustability, presenting a promising platform for various electrocatalytic applications as advanced catalysts.</dc:description>
