         <title>Low&#8208;Frequency Sub&#8208;Terahertz Absorption in HgII&#8211;XCN&#8211;FeII (X = S, Se) Coordination Polymers</title>

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Directed Symmetry Breaking and Spin Filtering of Supramolecular Assemblies from only Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe the self&#8208;assembly of an achiral molecule into macroscopic helicity as well as the emergent chirality selective spin filtering effect. It was found that benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) motif with an aminopyridine group in each arm could coordinate with Ag(I) and self&#8208;assemble into nanospheres. Upon sonication symmetry breaking occurred and the nanospheres transfer into helical nanofibers with strong CD signals. Although the sign of the CD signals appeared randomly, it could be controlled by using the as&#8208;made chiral assemblies as a seed. Furthermore, it was found that the charge transport of the helical nanofibers was highly selective with a spin&#8208;polarization transport of up to 45% although the chiral nanofibers are composed exclusively from achiral building blocks. The work demonstrated a new example of the symmetry breaking under sonication and the chirality selective spin filtering effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Instant and Selective Photo&#8208;Degradation of Polymers: Design of an Alternating Copolymer with an o&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Ether Pendant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of polymers with on&#8208;demand degradability is required to alleviate the current global issues on polymer&#8208;waste pollution. Therefore, we designed a vinyl ether monomer with an o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNBn) group as a photo&#8208;deprotectable pendant (oNBnVE) and synthesized an alternating copolymer with an oNBn&#8208;capped acetal backbone via cationic copolymerization with p&#8208;tolualdehyde (pMeBzA). The resultant alternating copolymer could be instantly degraded into lower&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compounds upon simple exposure to UV irradiation without any reactants or catalysts, while it was sufficiently stable toward heat and ambient light. This degradation proceeds via cleavage of the hemiacetal structure generated upon photo&#8208;deprotection of the oNBn pendant. The oNBn&#8208;peculiar degradability allowed the exclusive photo&#8208;degradation of the oNBnVE/pMeBzA segments in a diblock copolymer composed of oNBnVE/pMeBzA and benzyl vinyl ether (BnVE)/pMeBzA segments.</dc:description>

Here, we find a series of mechanisms to program a hexagonal arrangement using: the sticky end sequence; triangle edge torsional stress; and crystallization condition.

         <title>A Compound I Mimic Reveals the Transient Active Species of a Cytochrome P450 Enzyme: Insight&#160;into the Stereoselectivity of P450&#8208;Catalysed Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catching the structure of cytochrome P450 enzymes in flagrante is crucial for the development of P450 biocatalysts, as most structures collected are found trapped in a precatalytic conformation. At the heart of P450 catalysis lies Cpd I, a short&#8208;lived, highly reactive intermediate, whose recalcitrant nature has thwarted most attempts at capturing catalytically relevant poses of P450s. We report the crystal structure of P450BM3 mimicking the state in the precise moment preceding epoxidation that is in perfect agreement with the experimentally observed stereoselectivity. This feat was achieved by incorporation of the stable Cpd I mimic oxomolybdenum mesoporphyrin IX into P450BM3 in the presence of styrene. The orientation of styrene to the Mo&#8208;oxo species in the crystal structures sheds light onto the dynamics involved in rotation of styrene to present its vinyl group to Cpd I. This method serves as a powerful tool for predicting and modelling the stereoselectivity of P450 reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Phonon Energies in Lanthanide&#8208;doped Potassium Lead Halide Nanocrystals for Enhanced Nonlinearity and Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop phonon&#8208;engineered, lanthanide&#8208;doped upconverting nanoparticles with the lowest phonon energies available to date. Low&#8208;phonon&#8208;energy KPb2X5 (X=Cl, Br) upconverting nanoparticles exhibit dramatically suppressed multiphonon relaxation, enhancing upconversion emission from higher lanthanide excited states and enabling the first room&#8208;temperature observation of avalanche&#8208;like upconversion by Nd3+ ions.







Abstract
Optical applications of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles require materials with low phonon energies to minimize nonradiative relaxation and promote nonlinear processes like upconversion. Heavy halide hosts offer low phonon energies but are challenging to synthesize as nanocrystals. Here, we demonstrate the size&#8208;controlled synthesis of low&#8208;phonon&#8208;energy KPb2X5 (X=Cl, Br) nanoparticles and the ability to tune nanocrystal phonon energies as low as 128&#8197;cm&#8722;1. KPb2Cl5 nanoparticles are moisture resistant and can be efficiently doped with lighter lanthanides. The low phonon energies of KPb2X5 nanoparticles promote upconversion luminescence from higher lanthanide excited states and enable highly nonlinear, avalanche&#8208;like emission from KPb2Cl5&#8201;:&#8201;Nd3+ nanoparticles. The realization of nanoparticles with tunable, ultra&#8208;low phonon energies facilitates the discovery of nanomaterials with phonon&#8208;dependent properties, precisely engineered for applications in nanoscale imaging, sensing, luminescence thermometry and energy conversion.

&lt;p&gt;Optical applications of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles require materials with low phonon energies to minimize nonradiative relaxation and promote nonlinear processes like upconversion. Heavy halide hosts offer low phonon energies but are challenging to synthesize as nanocrystals. Here, we demonstrate the size-controlled synthesis of low-phonon-energy KPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (X=Cl, Br) nanoparticles and the ability to tune nanocrystal phonon energies as low as 128&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. KPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles are moisture resistant and can be efficiently doped with lighter lanthanides. The low phonon energies of KPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles promote upconversion luminescence from higher lanthanide excited states and enable highly nonlinear, avalanche-like emission from KPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; nanoparticles. The realization of nanoparticles with tunable, ultra-low phonon energies facilitates the discovery of nanomaterials with phonon-dependent properties, precisely engineered for applications in nanoscale imaging, sensing, luminescence thermometry and energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization/cyclopropanation/carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been realized. This reaction provided an efficient method to access a variety of chiral 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes with two adjacent quaternary carbon stereocenters in good efficiency.







Abstract
We herein disclose a mild and efficient access to chiral 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization/cyclopropanation/carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes. Various nucleophiles, such as alcohols, phenols, amines and water, are well compatible with the reaction system. This reaction forms three C&#8722;C bonds, two rings, two adjacent quaternary carbon stereocenters as well as one C&#8722;O/C&#8722;N bond with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The products could be further functionalized to generate a library of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane frameworks.

         <title>Exploring Helical Peptides and Foldamers for the Design of Metal Helix Frameworks: Current Trends and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent progress of metal peptide frameworks (MPFs) comprised of helical peptides and foldamers for future energy storage, chiral recognition, and biomedical applications.







Abstract
Flexible and biocompatible metal peptide frameworks (MPFs) derived from short and ultra&#8208;short peptides have been explored for the storage of greenhouse gases, molecular recognition, and chiral transformations. In addition to short flexible peptides, peptides with specifically folded conformations have recently been utilized to fabricate a variety of metal helix frameworks (MHFs). The secondary structures of the peptides govern the structure&#8208;assembly relationship and thereby control the formation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#8208;MHFs. Particularly, the hierarchical structural organization of peptide&#8208;based MHFs has not yet been discussed in detail. Here, we describe the recent progress of metal&#8208;driven folded peptide assembly to construct 3D porous structures for use in future energy storage, chiral recognition, and biomedical applications, which could be envisioned as an alternative to the conventional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs).

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Allylation of Alkanes: Facile Access to Allylic Quaternary sp3&#8208;Carbon Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion of unactivated alkanes with non&#8208;acceptor vinylcarbenes was achieved by silver catalysis and with bench&#8208;stable vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as substrates. The corresponding products feature allylic quaternary sp3&#8208;carbon centers and were obtained in high yields.







Abstract
The construction of allylic quaternary sp3&#8208;carbon centers has long been a formidable challenge in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8208;allyl coupling reactions due to the severe steric hindrance. Herein, we report an effective carbene strategy that employs well&#8208;defined vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as a versatile allylating reagent to enable direct assembly of these medicinally desirable structural elements from low&#8208;cost alkane feedstocks. The reaction exhibited excellent site selectivity for tertiary C&#8722;H bonds, broad scope (&gt;60&#8197;examples and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1:0 r.&#8201;r.) and good efficiency, even on a gram&#8208;scale, making it a convenient alternative to the well&#8208;known Trost&#8211;Tsuji allylation reaction for the formation of alkyl&#8211;allyl bonds. Combined experimental and computational studies were employed to unravel the mechanism and origin of site&#8208; and chemoselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Enzymatic C4&#8208;Epimerization of UDP&#8208;Glucuronic Acid: Precisely Steered Rotation of a Transient 4&#8208;Keto Intermediate for an Inverted Reaction without Decarboxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic C4&#8208;epimerization of UDP&#8208;glucuronic acid involves precisely steered rotation of a transient 4&#8208;ketohexuronic acid intermediate that is facilitated by chair&#8208;to&#8208;boat distortion of a sugar ring. The enzyme thus retains stereoelectronic control and prevents even trace amounts of decarboxylation occurring. A link between conformational selection and epimerase or decarboxylase activity is suggested.







Abstract
UDP&#8208;glucuronic acid (UDP&#8208;GlcA) 4&#8208;epimerase illustrates an important problem regarding enzyme catalysis: balancing conformational flexibility with precise positioning. The enzyme coordinates the C4&#8208;oxidation of the substrate by NAD+ and rotation of a decarboxylation&#8208;prone &#946;&#8208;keto acid intermediate in the active site, enabling stereoinverting reduction of the keto group by NADH. We reveal the elusive rotational landscape of the 4&#8208;keto intermediate. Distortion of the sugar ring into boat conformations induces torsional mobility in the enzyme's binding pocket. The rotational endpoints show that the 4&#8208;keto sugar has an undistorted 4C1 chair conformation. The equatorially placed carboxylate group disfavors decarboxylation of the 4&#8208;keto sugar. Epimerase variants lead to decarboxylation upon removal of the binding interactions with the carboxylate group in the opposite rotational isomer of the substrate. Substitutions R185A/D convert the epimerase into UDP&#8208;xylose synthases that decarboxylate UDP&#8208;GlcA in stereospecific, configuration&#8208;retaining reactions.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Multicolour Luminescence of Organic Materials: Internal Mechanism and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to Kasha's rule for luminescent materials, the emitting electronic level of a given multiplicity is the lowest excited level of that multiplicity. A characteristic exception, excitation&#8208;dependent multicolour emission, is presented systemically, with the aim of enriching fundamental photophysics and potential applications. This Minireview will serve as a timely summary of the scattered reports of multicolour phenomena and their underlying mechanisms.







Abstract
Excitation&#8208;dependent emission (Ex&#8208;de) materials have been of considerable academic interest and have potential applications in real life. Such multicolour luminescence is a characteristic exception to the ubiquitously accepted Kasha's rule. This phenomenon has been increasingly presented in some studies on different luminescence systems; however, a systematic overview of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is currently absent. Herein, we resolve this issue by classifying multicolour luminescence from single chromophores and dual/ternary chromophores, as well as multiple emitting species. The underlying processes are described based on electronic and/or geometrical conditions under which the phenomenon occurs. Before we present it in categories, related photophysical and photochemical foundations are introduced. This systematic overview will provide a clear approach to designing multicolour luminescence materials for special applications.

         <title>Peptide Amphiphile Mediated Co&#8208;assembly for Nanoplasmonic Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric probe for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease is reported by modulating the interplay of peptide amphiphiles and gold nanoparticles via aromatic interactions. This probe showed good performance in exhaled breath and saliva, demonstrating a favorable strategy for designing amphiphilic peptides for plasmonic coupling in complex media.







Abstract
Aromatic interactions are commonly involved in the assembly of naturally occurring building blocks, and these interactions can be replicated in an artificial setting to produce functional materials. Here we describe a colorimetric biosensor using co&#8208;assembly experiments with plasmonic gold and surfactant&#8208;like peptides (SLPs) spanning a wide range of aromatic residues, polar stretches, and interfacial affinities. The SLPs programmed in DDD&#8722;(ZZ)x&#8722;FFPC self&#8208;assemble into higher&#8208;order structures in response to a protease and subsequently modulate the colloidal dispersity of gold leading to a colorimetric readout. Results show the strong aggregation propensity of the FFPC tail without polar DDD head. The SLPs were specific to the target protease, i.e., Mpro, a biomarker for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This system is a simple and visual tool that senses Mpro in phosphate buffer, exhaled breath condensate, and saliva with detection limits of 15.7, 20.8, and 26.1&#8197;nM, respectively. These results may have value in designing other protease testing methods.

         <title>Design and Manipulation of a Minimalistic Hydrocarbon Nanocar on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular design and construction of a minimalistic nanocar is described, featuring an anthracene chassis and four benzene derivatives as wheels. After sublimation and adsorption on an Au(111) surface, controlled and fast manipulation of a nanocar is shown along the surface using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope.







Abstract
Nanocars are carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;molecules with a precise design that facilitates their atomic&#8208;scale control on a surface. The rational design of these molecules is important in atomic and molecular&#8208;scale manipulation to advance the development of molecular machines, as well as for a better understanding of self&#8208;assembly, diffusion and desorption processes. Here, we introduce the molecular design and construction of a collection of minimalistic nanocars. They feature an anthracene chassis and four benzene derivatives as wheels. After sublimation and adsorption on an Au(111) surface, we show controlled and fast manipulation of the nanocars along the surface using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The mechanism behind the successful displacement is the induced dipole created over the nanocar by the STM tip. We utilized carbon monoxide functionalized tips both to avoid decomposition and accidentally picking the nanocars up during the manipulation. This strategy allowed thousands of maneuvers to successfully win the Nanocar Race II championship.

         <title>Persistent ATP&#8208;Concentration Gradients in a Hydrogel Sustained by Chemical Fuel Consumption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatially controlled activation of two antagonistic enzymes installs macroscopic ATP&#8208;concentration gradients in a hydrogel. Gradients are maintained as long as chemical fuel is present to drive the reaction network. The ATP&#8208;concentration gradients affect the surface coverage of Au nanoparticles leading to fluorescent patterns that dynamically evolve over time.







Abstract
We show the formation of macroscopic ATP&#8208;concentrations in an agarose gel and demonstrate that these gradients can be sustained in time at the expense of the consumption of a chemical fuel. The approach relies on the spatially controlled activation of ATP&#8208;producing and ATP&#8208;consuming reactions through the local injection of enzymes in the matrix. The reaction&#8208;diffusion system is maintained in a stationary non&#8208;equilibrium state as long as chemical fuel, phosphocreatine, is present. The reaction&#8208;diffusion system is coupled to a supramolecular system composed of monolayer protected gold nanoparticles and a fluorescent probe. As a result of this coupling, fluorescence signals emerge spontaneously in response to the ATP&#8208;concentration gradients. We show that the approach permits the rational formation of complex fluorescence patterns that change over time as a function of the evolution of the ATP&#8208;concentrations present in the system.

         <title>A Synthesis of Alstonlarsine A via Alstolucines&#8197;B and F Demonstrates the Chemical Feasibility of a Proposed Biogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alstonlarsine&#8197;A, an indole monoterpene alkaloid isolated from Alstonia plants, was prepared by a rearrangement of other Alstonia alkaloids, alstolucines&#8197;B and F. The successful process was patterned after a revised biogenetic proposal that features the first example of the &#8220;tert&#8208;amino effect&#8221; in alkaloid biogenesis.







Abstract
We offer a new biogenetic proposal for the origin of the complex alkaloid alstonlarsine&#8197;A, through rearrangement of the Strychnos alkaloids alstolucines&#8197;B and F. Further, we provide evidence of the chemical feasibility of this proposal in the facile conversion of synthetic alstolucines into alstonlarsine&#8197;A through a short, efficient sequence of N&#8208;methylation, &#946;&#8208;elimination, and a cascade 1,7&#8208;hydride shift/Mannich cyclization. We believe that this is the first biogenetic proposal involving the &#8220;tert&#8208;amino effect&#8221;, a hydride&#8208;shift&#8208;based internal redox trigger of a Mannich cyclization. A further interesting feature of the cascade is that its stereochemical outcome most likely originates in conformational preferences during the hydride shift.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, two&#8208;step chemical&#8208;biological approach converts post&#8208;consumer polyethylenes to structurally diverse and pharmacologically active fungal natural products, as reported by Travis&#8197;J. Williams, Clay&#8197;C.&#8197;C. Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202214609). Polyethylenes are first cleaved into carboxylic diacids using catalytic oxidation. Genetically engineered strains of fungi then rapidly convert these diacids into natural product pharmaceutical platforms implicated in the treatment of cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and bacterial infections.

         <title>17O Hyperfine Spectroscopy Reveals Hydration Structure of Nitroxide Radicals in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydration structure of two different nitroxide radicals in bulk water is investigated by hyperfine spectroscopy that detects H217O. Combination of ENDOR and HYSCORE methods reveals preferred coordination geometries and H&#8208;bonding. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with DFT calculations provided the link between observed spectroscopic parameters and their distribution.







Abstract
The hydration structure of nitroxide radicals in aqueous solutions is elucidated by advanced 17O hyperfine (hf) spectroscopy with support of quantum chemical calculations and MD simulations. A piperidine and a pyrrolidine&#8208;based nitroxide radical are compared and show clear differences in the preferred directionality of H&#8208;bond formation. We demonstrate that these scenarios are best represented in 17O hf spectra, where in&#8208;plane coordination over 
&#8208;type H&#8208;bonding leads to little spin density transfer on the water oxygen and small hf couplings, whereas 
&#8208;type perpendicular coordination generates much larger hf couplings. Quantitative analysis of the spectra based on MD simulations and DFT predicted hf parameters is consistent with a distribution of close solvating water molecules, in which directionality is influenced by subtle steric effects of the ring and the methyl group substituents.

         <title>A Sterically Tuned Directing Auxiliary Promotes Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Carbofluorination of Alkenyl Carbonyl Compounds
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Judicious tuning of the steric environment on the bidentate directing auxiliary is proposed to facilitate challenging C(sp3)&#8722;F reductive elimination from a PdIV intermediate in the site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of unactivated alkenyl carbonyl compounds, aryl&#8208; or alkenylboronic acids, and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of unactivated alkenyl carbonyl compounds, aryl&#8208; or alkenylboronic acids, and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide is described herein. Tuning of the steric environment on the bidentate directing auxiliary enhances regioselectivity and facilitates challenging C(sp3)&#8722;F reductive elimination from a PdIV intermediate to afford 1,2&#8208;carbofluorination products in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Indium&#8208;Nickel Atomic Pair as Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites Enabling Synergistic Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts offer a promising pathway for electrochemical CO2 conversion. However, it is still a challenge to optimize the electrochemical performance of dual&#8208;atom catalysts. Here, an atomic indium&#8208;nickel dual&#8208;sites catalyst bridged by an axial oxygen atom (O&#8208;In&#8208;N6&#8208;Ni moiety) was anchored on nitrogenated carbon (InNi DS/NC). InNi DS/NC exhibits superior CO selectivity with Faraday efficiency higher than 90% over a wide potential range from &#8208;0.5 to &#8208;0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). Moreover, an industrial CO partial current density up to 317.2 mA cm&#8208;2 is achieved at &#8208;1.0 V vs. RHE in a flow cell. In situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS combined with theory calculations reveal that the synergistic effect of In&#8208;Ni dual&#8208;sites and O atom bridge not only reduces the reaction barrier for the formation of *COOH, but also retards the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction. This work provides a feasible strategy to construct dual&#8208;site catalysts towards energy conversion.</dc:description>

Moreover, an industrial CO partial current density up to 317.2 mA cm-2 is achieved at -1.0 V vs. RHE in a flow cell. In situ ATR-SEIRAS combined with theory calculations reveal that the synergistic effect of In-Ni dual-sites and O atom bridge not only reduces the reaction barrier for the formation of *COOH, but also retards the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <dc:description>Alkynes and 1,3&#8208;dienes are among the most readily available precursors for organic synthesis.

Complexes of an earth abundant metal, cobalt, with several commercially available chiral bisphosphine ligands with narrow bite angles catalyze [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions between a 1,3&#8208;diene and an alkyne giving a cyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene in excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. In sharp contrast, complex of a finely tuned phosphino&#8208;oxazoline ligand promotes unique [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between the alkyne and the terminal double bond of the diene giving a highly functionalized cyclobutene in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Access to Chiral Lactams via Nucleophilic Dearomatisations of Pyridine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;bearing rings are common features in the molecular structures of modern drugs, with chiral &#948;&#8208;lactams being an important subclass due to their known pharmacological properties. Catalytic dearomatisation of preactivated pyridinium ion derivatives emerged as a powerful method for the rapid construction of chiral N&#8208;heterocycles. However, direct catalytic dearomatisation of simple pyridine derivatives are scarce and methodologies yielding chiral &#948;&#8208;lactams are yet to be developed. Herein, we describe an enantioselective C&#8208;4&#8208;dearomatisation of methoxypyridine derivatives for the preparation of functionalised enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams using chiral copper catalysis. Experimental 13C kinetic isotope effects and density functional theory calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity</dc:description>

However, direct catalytic dearomatisation of simple pyridine derivatives are scarce and methodologies yielding chiral &#948;-lactams are yet to be developed. Herein, we describe an enantioselective C-4-dearomatisation of methoxypyridine derivatives for the preparation of functionalised enantioenriched &#948;-lactams using chiral copper catalysis. Experimental 13C kinetic isotope effects and density functional theory calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Controllable Single and Double Difluoromethylene Formal Insertions into C&#8211;H Bonds of Aldehydes with TMSCF2Br</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a new strategy for controllable single and double difluoromethylene (CF2) formal insertions into C&#8211;H bonds of aldehydes with nearly full selectivity under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The key to the success of controllable difluoromethylene (CF2) insertions lies in the well&#8208;defined formation of 2,2&#8208;difluoroenolsilyl ether and 2,2,3,3tetrafluorocyclopropanolsilyl ether intermediates using difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS = trimethylsilyl). These two intermediates can react with various electrophiles including proton sources and various halogenation reagents, allowing for the access to diverse arrays of ketones containing difluoromethylene (CF2) and tetrafluoroethylene (CF2CF2) units. The first synthesis of relatively stable 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluorocyclopropanolsilyl ethers have been achieved, which offer a new platform to explore other unknown chemical space.</dc:description>

         <title>C3&#8208;Cyanation of Pyridines: Constraints on Electrophiles and Determinants of Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for C&#8211;H cyanation of pyridines are rare. Here, we report a method for C3&#8208;selective cyanation of pyridines by a tandem process with the reaction of an in situ generated dihydropyridine&#160;with a cyano electrophile&#160;as the key step. The method is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of pyridine drugs. The low reduction potential of the electrophile and effective transfer of the nitrile group were found to be essential for the success of this method. We studied the reaction mechanism in detail by means of control experiments and theoretical calculations and found that a combination of electronic and steric factors determined the regioselectivity of reactions involving C2&#8208;substituted pyridines.</dc:description>

         <title>Gradient Graphdiyne Induced Copper and Oxygen Vacancies in Cu0.95V2O5&#160;Anodes for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vacancies can significantly affect the performance of metal oxide materials. Here, a gradient graphdiyne (GDY) induced Cu/O&#8208;dual&#8208;vacancies abundant Cu0.95V2O5@GDY heterostructure material has been prepared as a competitive fast&#8208;charging anode material. Cu0.95V2O5 self&#8208;catalyzes the growth of gradient GDY with rich alkyne&#8208;alkene complex in the inner layer and rich alkyne bonds in the outer layer, leading to the formation&#160;of Cu and O vacancies in Cu0.95V2O5. The synergistic effect of vacancies and gradient GDY results in the electron redistribution at the hetero&#8208;interface to drive the generation of a built&#8208;in electric field. Thus, the Li&#8208;ion transport kinetics, electrochemical reaction reversibility and Li storage sites of Cu0.95V2O5 are greatly enhanced. The Cu0.95V2O5@GDY anodes show excellent fast&#8208;charging performance with high capacities and negligible capacity decay for 10,000 cycles and 20,000 cycles at extremely high current densities of 5 A g&#8208;1 and 10 A g&#8208;1, respectively. Over 30% of capacity can be delivered in 35 seconds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral boron/nitrogen doped multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are promising for highly efficient and color&#8208;pure circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Herein, we report two pairs of MR&#8208;TADF materials (Czp&#8208;tBuCzB, Czp&#8208;POAB) based on planar chiral paracyclophane with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 98%. The enantiomers showed symmetric circularly polarized photoluminescence spectra with dissymmetry factors |gPL| of up to 1.6 &#215; 10&#8208;3 in doped films. Meanwhile, the sky&#8208;blue CP&#8208;OLEDs with (R/S)&#8208;Czp&#8208;tBuCzB showed an external quantum efficiency of 32.1% with the narrowest full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 24 nm among the reported CP&#8208;OLEDs, while the devices with (R/S)&#8208;Czp&#8208;POAB displayed the first nearly pure green CP electroluminescence with&#160;|gEL|&#160;factors&#160;at the 10&#8208;3 level. These results demonstrate the incorporation of planar chirality into MR&#8208;TADF emitter is a reliable strategy for constructing of efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As an analogue to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of organic molecules, thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) observed in molecule&#8208;functionalized semiconductor nanocrystals represents an exotic mechanism to harvest energy from dark molecular triplets and to obtain controllable, long&#8208;lived PL from nanocrystals. The reported TADPL systems have successfully covered the visible spectrum. However, TADF molecules already emit very efficiently in the visible, diminishing the technological impact of the less&#8208;efficient nanocrystal&#8208;molecule TADPL. Here we report bright, near&#8208;infrared TADPL in lead&#8208;free CuInSe2 nanocrystals functionalized with carboxylated tetracene ligands, which results from efficient triplet energy transfer from photoexcited nanocrystals to ligands, followed with thermally activated reverse energy transfer from ligand triplets back to nanocrystals. This strategy prolonged the nanocrystal exciton lifetime from 100 ns to 60 &#956;s at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Cycling a Tether into Multiple Rings: Pt&#8208;Bridged Macrocycles for Differentiated Guest Recognition, Pseudorotaxane Transformations, and Guest Capture and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wrapping a tether around a platinum ion gives five different pseudocrown ethers that differ in shape and host activity. The Pt ion in the rings is redox&#8208;active and stays that way even if the host is occupied by a guest, facilitating expeditious pseudorotaxane&#8208;to&#8208;pseudorotaxane transformations, guest&#8208;directed ring reactivity, and release of guests upon redox stimulation.







Abstract
Macrocycle engineering is a key topic in supramolecular chemistry. When synthesizing a ring, one can obtain either complex mixtures of macrocycles of different sizes or a single ring if a template is utilized. Here, we unite these approaches along with post&#8208;synthetic modifications to transform a single tether into multiple rings&#8212;up to five per tether. The macrocycles contain two bridged phenylpyridine ligands that are connected through a Pt atom, which defines the rings&#8217; shape, size, and host activity. All rings undergo redox reactions (between PtII and PtIV) that allow for large conformational changes. Their reactivity, together with their host performance, is a convenient way to control the capture and release of guests, to mediate ring transformations, and to control pseudorotaxane&#8208;to&#8208;pseudorotaxane conversions. This novel approach could serve to assemble other libraries of small ring molecules, create cyclic polymers bridged by responsive&#8208;at&#8208;metal nodes, and produce processable mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile 1,2&#8208;Silyl&#8208;Arylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes with Chlorosilanes and Aryl Bromides</title>

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalysed reductive silylarylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes using chlorosilanes and aryl bromides is reported. The reaction affords 1,2&#8208;linear&#8208;silylated products, a selectivity that is distinct from those obtained with conventional hydro&#8208; and carbosilylation methods. This work shows the possibility to achieve the silyl&#8208;functionalization of unsaturated bonds using readily available chlorosilanes.







Abstract
Catalytic, three&#8208;component, cross&#8208;electrophile reactions have recently emerged as a promising tool for molecular diversification, but studies have focused mainly on the alkyl&#8208;carbonations of alkenes. Herein, the scope of this method has been extended to conjugated dienes and silicon chemistry through silylative difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes with chlorosilanes and aryl bromides. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions to afford 1,2&#8208;linear&#8208;silylated products, a selectivity that is different to those obtained from conventional methods via an intermediary of H(C)&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allylmetal species. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that chlorosilane reacts with 1,3&#8208;diene first and then couples with aryl bromide.

         <title>On the Reactivity of Phosphaalumenes towards C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocycles containing group 13 and 15 elements such as borazines are an integral part of organic, biomedical and materials chemistry. Surprisingly, heterocycles containing P and Al are rare. We have now utilized phosphaalumenes in reactions with alkynes, alkenes and conjugated double bond systems. With sterically demanding alkynes 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumetes were afforded, whereas the reaction with HCCH or HCCSiMe3 gave 1,4&#8208;phosphaaluminabarrelenes. Using styrene saturated 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumates were formed, which reacted further with additional styrene to give different regio&#8208;isomers of 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinanes. Using ethylene, a 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinane is obtained, while with 1,3&#8208;butadiene a bicyclic system containing an aluminacyclopentane and a phosphirane unit was synthesized. The experimental work is supported by theoretical studies to shed light on the mechanism governing the formation of these heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Hybrid Neutral Lipids with Archaeal and Eukaryotic Characteristics in Engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconstitution of archaeal lipid biosynthesis in eukaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in unexpected production of hybrid neutral lipids, which contain both archaeal isoprenoids and eukaryotic fatty acids. The responsible enzymes, diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs), were found to be present in all domains of life.







Abstract
Discovery of the Asgard superphylum of archaea provides new evidence supporting the two&#8208;domain model of life: eukaryotes originated from an Asgard&#8208;related archaeon that engulfed a bacterial endosymbiont. However, how eukaryotes acquired bacterial&#8208;like membrane lipids with a sn&#8208;glycerol&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate (G3P) backbone instead of the archaeal&#8208;like sn&#8208;glycerol&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (G1P) backbone remains unknown. In this study, we reconstituted archaeal lipid production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by expressing unsaturated archaeol&#8208;synthesizing enzymes. Using Golden Gate cloning for pathway assembly, modular gene replacement was performed, revealing the potential biosynthesis of both G1P&#8208; and G3P&#8208;based unsaturated archaeol by uncultured Asgard archaea. Unexpectedly, hybrid neutral lipids containing both archaeal isoprenoids and eukaryotic fatty acids were observed in recombinant S. cerevisiae. The ability of yeast and archaeal diacylglycerol acyltransferases to synthesize such hybrid lipids was demonstrated.

         <title>Small Fluorogenic Amino Acids for Peptide&#8208;Guided Background&#8208;Free Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzodiazole amino acids are excellent small building blocks for the construction of background&#8208;free peptide probes for fluorescence imaging. We demonstrate their robustness and versatility for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, their minimally invasive character, and their compatibility with different optical imaging modalities, including super&#8208;resolution peptide&#8208;PAINT imaging.







Abstract
The multiple applications of super&#8208;resolution microscopy have prompted the need for minimally invasive labeling strategies for peptide&#8208;guided fluorescence imaging. Many fluorescent reporters display limitations (e.g., large and charged scaffolds, non&#8208;specific binding) as building blocks for the construction of fluorogenic peptides. Herein we have built a library of benzodiazole amino acids and systematically examined them as reporters for background&#8208;free fluorescence microscopy. We have identified amine&#8208;derivatized benzoselenadiazoles as scalable and photostable amino acids for the straightforward solid&#8208;phase synthesis of fluorescent peptides. Benzodiazole amino acids retain the binding capabilities of bioactive peptides and display excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios. Furthermore, we have demonstrated their application in peptide&#8208;PAINT imaging of postsynaptic density protein&#8208;95 nanoclusters in the synaptosomes from mouse brain tissues.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Drugs via Alkene Formal Insertion into Benzylic C&#8722;F Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we describe a new strategy of alkene&#8208;selective formal insertion into a benzylic C&#8722;F bond, which enables late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules. This transformation breaks a strong C&#8722;F bond and forms a somewhat weaker C&#8722;F bond at the same time, under mild conditions, thus providing an opportunity for straightforward access to partially fluorinated organic molecules via difunctionalization of alkenes.







Abstract
C&#8722;F insertion of carbon&#8208;atom units is underdeveloped although it poses significant potential applications in both drug discovery and development. Herein, we report a photocatalytic protocol for late&#8208;stage modification of trifluoromethyl aromatic drugs involving formal insertion of abundant alkene feedstocks into a benzylic C&#8722;F bond selectively. This redox&#8208;neutral transformation features mild conditions and extraordinary functional group tolerance. Preliminary studies are consistent with this transformation involving a radical&#8208;polar crossover pathway. Additionally, it offers an alternative strategy for difunctionalization of alkenes via quenching of the carbocation intermediate with nucleophiles other than external fluoride.

         <title>An Isolable Bis(Germylene)&#8208;Stabilized Plumbylone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable plumbylone was synthesized and characterized, which possesses a singlet electronic ground state with a Pb0 center. In accord with its electron&#8208;rich nature, the plumbylone exhibits intriguing reactivity involving transfer of Pb0 atom to an organic azide to form a tetrameric imido complex and undergoing a metathetic reaction with GeCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dioxane to afford a germylone.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis of a stable plumbylone (3) by reduction of a bromodigermylplumbylene (2) with 2.2&#8197;equiv of potassium graphite (KC8). The molecular structure of 3 was established by a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study and features a two&#8208;coordinated Pb center with an acute Ge&#8722;Pb&#8722;Ge bond angle. Computational studies showed that this complex (3) possesses a singlet electronic ground state with a Pb0 center. Its high thermal stability can be most likely ascribed to the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the Ge&#8722;Pb&#8722;Ge moiety. A preliminary reactivity study demonstrates that complex 3 can deliver Pb0 atoms to an organic azide producing a tetrameric imido complex [(PbNDipp)4] (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr&#8208;C6H3, 4) and perform a metathesis reaction with GeCl2&#8901;dioxane to produce a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized germylone (5), highlighting the synthetic utility of 3.

     alt="An Isolable Bis(Germylene)-Stabilized Plumbylone"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stable plumbylone was synthesized and characterized, which possesses a singlet electronic ground state with a Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; center. In accord with its electron-rich nature, the plumbylone exhibits intriguing reactivity involving transfer of Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; atom to an organic azide to form a tetrameric imido complex and undergoing a metathetic reaction with GeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dioxane to afford a germylone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein the synthesis of a stable plumbylone (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) by reduction of a bromodigermylplumbylene (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) with 2.2&#8197;equiv of potassium graphite (KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;). The molecular structure of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; was established by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study and features a two-coordinated Pb center with an acute Ge&#8722;Pb&#8722;Ge bond angle. Computational studies showed that this complex (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) possesses a singlet electronic ground state with a Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; center. Its high thermal stability can be most likely ascribed to the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the Ge&#8722;Pb&#8722;Ge moiety. A preliminary reactivity study demonstrates that complex &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; can deliver Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; atoms to an organic azide producing a tetrameric imido complex [(PbNDipp)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (Dipp=2,6-&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Pr-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) and perform a metathesis reaction with GeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;dioxane to produce a bis(germylene)-stabilized germylone (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), highlighting the synthetic utility of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Control in Micro&#8208;/Nanomotor Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the advancements in the area of micro&#8208; and nanomotors and discusses current methods and mechanisms to control their movement. We review motors&#8217; design, modes of propulsion and incorporation of different modes in one motor chassis so that control can be achieved.







Abstract
Unprecedented opportunities exist for the generation of advanced nanotechnologies based on synthetic micro/nanomotors (MNMs), such as active transport of medical agents or the removal of pollutants. In this regard, great efforts have been dedicated toward controlling MNM motion (e.g., speed, directionality). This was generally performed by precise engineering and optimizing of the motors&#8242; chassis, engine, powering mode (i.e., chemical or physical), and mechanism of motion. Recently, new insights have emerged to control motors mobility, mainly by the inclusion of different modes that drive propulsion. With high degree of synchronization, these modes work providing the required level of control. In this Minireview, we discuss the diverse factors that impact motion; these include MNM morphology, modes of mobility, and how control over motion was achieved. Moreover, we highlight the main limitations that need to be overcome so that such motion control can be translated into real applications.

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroxylation of C&#8722;H bonds by Synergistic Use of Protein Engineering and Exogenous Dual&#8208;Functional Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic approach is reported for multiple&#8208;site highly regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroxylation of alkylbenzenes by a combination of P450 variants and exogenous dual&#8208;functional small molecules (DFSMs). Crystallographic analysis and molecular dynamic simulations provided strong evidence for the synergistic effects of engineered P450s and DFSMs, thus establishing a new synthetic toolbox for sustainable divergent biohydroxylation of C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
It is a great challenge to optionally access diverse hydroxylation products from a given substrate bearing multiple reaction sites of sp3 and sp2 C&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we report the highly selective divergent hydroxylation of alkylbenzenes by an engineered P450 peroxygenase driven by a dual&#8208;functional small molecule (DFSM). Using combinations of various P450BM3 variants with DFSMs enabled access to more than half of all possible hydroxylated products from each substrate with excellent regioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%), enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee), and high total turnover numbers (up to 80963). Crystal structure analysis, molecular dynamic simulations, and theoretical calculations revealed that synergistic effects between exogenous DFSMs and the protein environment controlled regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work has implications for exogenous&#8208;molecule&#8208;modulated enzymatic regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroxylation with potential applications in synthetic chemistry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable vinyl polymers are synthesized with periodically arranged in&#8208;chain thioacetal bonds via cationic degenerative chain&#8208;transfer copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a 7&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal, as reported by Mineto Uchiyama, Masami Kamigaito, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215021). The copolymers can be degraded into low&#8208; and controlled&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers via hydrolysis.

         <title>Controlled Annealing in Adaptive Multicomponent Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annealing changes the assembly of fibres and leads to self&#8208;sorting in the case of multicomponent systems. When a multilayer gel is formed, annealing can be used to form hybrid materials.







Abstract
We use a pH&#8208;driven annealing process to convert between co&#8208;assembled and self&#8208;sorted networks in multicomponent gels. The initially formed gels at low pH are co&#8208;assembled, with the two components coexisting within the same self&#8208;assembled structures. We use an enzymatic approach to increase the pH, resulting in a gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition, followed by a hydrolysis to lower the pH once again. As the pH decreases, a self&#8208;sorted network is formed by a two&#8208;stage gelation process determined by the pKa of each component. This approach can be expanded to layered systems to generate many varied systems by changing composition and rates of pH change, adapting their microstructure and so allowing access to a far greater range of morphologies and complexity than can be achieved in single component systems.

         <title>Modelling Development in Radical (Co)Polymerization of Multivinyl Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major developments of modelling approaches in radical polymerization of multivinyl monomers (MVM) are summarized and their applications on FRP and RDRP are highlighted. This Minireview hopes to show that the combination of modelling and wet experiments can be a great asset to polymer scientists. It aims to serve as a concise introduction to push the boundary of using modelling techniques to understand the mechanism and product structure in MVM polymerization.







Abstract
Radical polymerization (RP) of multivinyl monomers (MVMs) provides a facile solution for manipulating polymer topology and has received increasing attention due to their industrial and academic significance. Continuous efforts have been made to understand their mechanism, which is the key to regulating materials structure. Modelling techniques have become a powerful tool that can provide detailed information on polymerization kinetics which is inaccessible by experiments. Many publications have reported the combination of experiments and modelling for free radical polymerization (FRP) and reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerizations (RDRP) of MVMs. Herein, a minireview is presented for the most important modelling techniques and their applications in FRP/RDRP of MVMs. This review hopes to illustrate that the combination of modelling and wet experiments can be a great asset to polymer researchers and inspire new thinking for the future MVMs experiment optimization and product design.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;like Pt(100)&#8208;oriented Ultrathin Surface: Combining the Merits of Single Crystals and Nanoparticles to Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk&#8208;like Pt(100)&#8208;oriented ultrathin surface with up to 6.9&#8201;% compressive strain combines the high specific activity of single crystals and high electrochemically active surface area of nanoparticles, achieving order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in specific and mass activities toward oxygen reduction reaction compared with benchmark Pt/C.







Abstract
Single crystal surfaces with highly coordinated sites very often hold high specific activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and others. Transposing their high specific activity to practical high&#8208;surface&#8208;area electrocatalysts remains challenging. Here, ultrathin Pt(100) alloy surface is constructed via epitaxial growth. The surface shows 3.1&#8211;6.9&#8201;% compressive strain and bulk&#8208;like characteristics as demonstrated by site&#8208;probe reactions and different spectroscopies. Its ORR activity exceeds that of bulk Pt3Ni(100) and Pt(111) and presents a 19&#8208;fold increase in specific activity and a 13&#8208;fold increase in mass activity relative to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is increased by 4&#8208;fold compared to traditional thin films (e.g. NSTF), which makes the catalyst more tolerant to voltage loss at high current densities under fuel cell operation. This work broadens the family of extended surface catalysts and highlights the knowledge&#8208;driven approach in the development of advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Anion&#8208;Exchange Membrane with an Ordered Ion&#8208;Conducting Channel via the McMurray Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
McMurry coupling was used to prepare &#960;&#8208;conjugated anion exchange membranes (AEMs). The inter&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between adjacent benzene rings induces directional self&#8208;assembly aggregation and enables highly ordered ion&#8208;conductive channels, leading to a high OH&#8722; conductivity of 135.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The double bonds in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system trigger in situ self&#8208;crosslinking of the AEMs to enhance dimensional and alkaline stability.







Abstract
The McMurry coupling is a facile, gentle and low&#8208;cost chemical reaction for synthesizing. Here, for the first time, we employed the McMurry coupling reaction to prepare &#960;&#8208;conjugated anion exchange membranes (AEMs). The inter&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between adjacent benzene rings induces directional self&#8208;assembly aggregation and enables highly ordered ion&#8208;conductive channels. The resulting structure was characterized through UV/VIS spectrum, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, leading to high OH&#8722; conductivity of 135.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the double bonds in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system also trigger in situ self&#8208;crosslinking of the AEMs to enhance dimensional and alkaline stability. Benefiting from this advantage, the as&#8208;obtained Cr&#8208;QPPV&#8208;2.51 AEM exhibits superior alkaline stability (95&#8201;% conductivity retention after 3000&#8197;hrs in 1&#8197;M KOH at 80&#8201;&#176;C) and high mechanical strength of 34.8&#8197;MPa. Moreover, the fuel cell using Cr&#8208;QPPV&#8208;2.51 shows a maximum peak power density of 1.27&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Alkaline&#8208;Earth Metal Mediated Benzene&#8208;to&#8208;Biphenyl Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attempts to isolate low&#8208;valent (BDI)Ae&#8208;Ae(BDI) complexes led to reduction of the benzene solvent and formation of (BDI)Ae&#8208;(C6H6)&#8208;Ae(BDI); BDI=&#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligand, Ae=Ca or Sr. Reaction of bridging C6H62&#8722; with benzene gave (biphenyl)2&#8722; complexes. Ball&#8208;milling is an efficient synthetic tool for this dehydrogenative benzene&#8208;benzene coupling. Calculations suggest attack of C6H62&#8722; at benzene. This is facilitated by Ae2+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;benzene coordination.







Abstract
Complex [(DIPePBDI)Ca]2(C6H6), with a C6H62&#8722; dianion bridging two Ca2+ ions, reacts with benzene to yield [(DIPePBDI)Ca]2(biphenyl) with a bridging biphenyl2&#8722; dianion (DIPePBDI=HC[C(Me)N&#8208;DIPeP]2; DIPeP=2,6&#8208;CH(Et)2&#8208;phenyl). The biphenyl complex was also prepared by reacting [(DIPePBDI)Ca]2(C6H6) with biphenyl or by reduction of [(DIPePBDI)CaI]2 with KC8 in presence of biphenyl. Benzene&#8208;benzene coupling was also observed when the deep purple product of ball&#8208;milling [(DIPPBDI)CaI(THF)]2 with K/KI was extracted with benzene (DIPP=2,6&#8208;CH(Me)2&#8208;phenyl) giving crystalline [(DIPPBDI)Ca(THF)]2(biphenyl) (52&#8201;% yield). Reduction of [(DIPePBDI)SrI]2 with KC8 gave highly labile [(DIPePBDI)Sr]2(C6H6) as a black powder (61&#8201;% yield) which reacts rapidly and selectively with benzene to [(DIPePBDI)Sr]2(biphenyl). DFT calculations show that the most likely route for biphenyl formation is a pathway in which the C6H62&#8722; dianion attacks neutral benzene. This is facilitated by metal&#8208;benzene coordination.

         <title>Controlling Selectivity in Plasmonic Catalysis: Switching Reaction Pathway from Hydrogenation to Homocoupling Under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light irradiation was employed to accelerate and control reaction selectivity by harvesting plasmonic and catalytic effects in AgPd nanoparticles. By focusing on the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, plasmonic effects allowed the control (switch) of the reaction pathway from hydrogenation (leading to ethylbenzene as the product in the dark) to homocoupling (leading to 1,4&#8208;diphenylbutadiyne as the product under visible&#8208;light irradiation).







Abstract
Plasmonic catalysis enables the use of light to accelerate molecular transformations. Its application to the control reaction selectivity is highly attractive but remains challenging. Here, we have found that the plasmonic properties in AgPd nanoparticles allowed different reaction pathways for tunable product formation under visible&#8208;light irradiation.

     alt="Controlling Selectivity in Plasmonic Catalysis: Switching Reaction Pathway from Hydrogenation to Homocoupling Under Visible-Light Irradiation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visible-light irradiation was employed to accelerate and control reaction selectivity by harvesting plasmonic and catalytic effects in AgPd nanoparticles. By focusing on the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, plasmonic effects allowed the control (switch) of the reaction pathway from hydrogenation (leading to ethylbenzene as the product in the dark) to homocoupling (leading to 1,4-diphenylbutadiyne as the product under visible-light irradiation).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasmonic catalysis enables the use of light to accelerate molecular transformations. Its application to the control reaction selectivity is highly attractive but remains challenging. Here, we have found that the plasmonic properties in AgPd nanoparticles allowed different reaction pathways for tunable product formation under visible-light irradiation. By employing the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene as a model transformation, we demonstrate that visible-light irradiation can be employed to steer the reaction pathway from hydrogenation to homocoupling. Our data showed that the decrease in the concentration of H species at the surface due to plasmon-enhanced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; desorption led to the control in selectivity. These results provide important insights into the understanding of reaction selectivity with light, paving the way for the application of plasmonic catalysis to the synthesis of 1,3-diynes, and bringing the vision of light-driven transformations with target selectivity one step closer to reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Color Photoconvertible Fluorescent Probes Based on Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to obtain bright dual&#8208;color photoconvertible fluorophores is presented based on a new mechanism called Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion (DPIC). The mechanism is based on the directed oxidation of the pyrrole that is conjugated to the fluorophore. This approach led to SC&#8208;P, which stains the lipid droplets in live cells and that undergoes a hypsochromic shift of 68&#8197;nm upon visible light irradiation.







Abstract
We herein present a new concept to produce dual&#8208;color photoconvertible probes based on a mechanism called Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion (DPIC). As a support of this mechanism, styryl&#8208;coumarins (SCs) bearing Aromatic Singlet Oxygen Reactive Moieties (ASORMs) like furan and pyrrole have been synthesized. SCs are bright fluorophores, which undergo a hypsochromic conversion upon visible light irradiation due to directed photooxidation of the ASORM that leads to the disruption of conjugation. SC&#8208;P, a yellow emitting probe bearing a pyrrole moiety, converts to a stable blue emitting coumarin with a 68&#8197;nm shift allowing the photoconversion and tracking of lipid droplet in live cells. This new approach might pave the way to a new generation of photoconvertible dyes for advanced bioimaging applications.

         <title>Single Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Charged Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets with High Volume Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single solution&#8208;phase synthesis method for charged covalent organic framework nanosheets (COF&#8208;NSs) is developed. Charged monomers and appropriate solvent with good solubility and ion dissociation ability are mixed as a high&#8208;concentration stable colloidal solution, in which substantial charged COF&#8208;NSs are formed via charge&#8208;induced in&#8208;plane oriented growth, achieving high volume yield.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework nanosheets (COF&#8208;NSs) are emerging building blocks for functional materials, and their scalable fabrication is highly desirable. Current synthetic methods suffer from low volume yields resulting from confined on&#8208;surface/at&#8208;interface growth space and complex multiple&#8208;phase synthesis systems. Herein, we report the synthesis of charged COF&#8208;NSs in open space using a single&#8208;phase organic solution system, achieving magnitudes higher volume yields of up to 18.7&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Charge&#8208;induced electrostatic repulsion forces enable in&#8208;plane anisotropic secondary growth from initial discrete and disordered polymers into large and crystalline COF&#8208;NSs. The charged COF&#8208;NS colloidal suspensions are cast into thin and compact proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with lamellar morphology and oriented crystallinity, displaying outstanding proton conductivity, negligible dimensional swelling, and good H2/O2 fuel cell performance.

         <title>Superchaotropic Nano&#8208;ion Binding as a Gelation Motif in Cellulose Ether Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergy between salt and sugar: Nanometric ions like Keggin polyoxometalates are revealed to induce the cross&#8208;linking and hydrogel formation of polymeric sugars, namely non&#8208;ionic cellulose ethers, as reported by Max Hohenschutz, Walter Richtering et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202210208). This novel gelation phenomenon exceeds the thickening effects of typical additives like classical salts and surfactants by orders of magnitude and arises due to the superchaotropicity of the nano&#8208;ions, which drives them out of the water bulk onto the polymers.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Structure and Dynamics Landscape of Proteins in Mammalian Cells Revealed by In&#8208;Cell NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In buffer the NMR spectrum of a folded protein (A) shows no peak splitting effect due to the absence of multiple structural species. Inside cells (B) a subpopulation of the same protein binds different partners which result in structural changes leading to chemical shifts perturbations of the cross peaks. The co&#8208;existence of these structurally different variants in cells leads to the peak splitting effect and the appearance of two daughter peaks.







Abstract
Governing function, half&#8208;life and subcellular localization, the 3D structure and dynamics of proteins are in nature constantly changing in a tightly regulated manner to fulfill the physiological and adaptive requirements of the cells. To find evidence for this hypothesis, we applied in&#8208;cell NMR to three folded model proteins and propose that the splitting of cross peaks constitutes an atomic fingerprint of distinct structural states that arise from multiple target binding co&#8208;existing inside mammalian cells. These structural states change upon protein loss of function or subcellular localisation into distinct cell compartments. In addition to peak splitting, we observed NMR signal intensity attenuations indicative of transient interactions with other molecules and dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scale.

         <title>Towards a Cradle&#8208;to&#8208;Cradle Polyolefin Lifecycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective depolymerization of polyethylene to propylene was achieved by two independent studies using a tandem catalysis approach. By combining a dehydrogenation, an isomerization and an ethenolysis catalyst under an ethylene atmosphere, propylene was the favoured product which could be further used as precursor for polypropylene production.







Abstract
Achieving efficient chemical depolymerization of waste polyolefins to monomers remains an unsolved challenge, while it could be an effective means to avoid further waste accumulation in the environment and generate economic benefits. In a recent publication by Conk et&#8197;al., polyethylene (PE) is converted to propylene, the second most used monomer in the polymer industry. The conversion is achieved via a tandem catalysis approach in which partially unsaturated PE chains react with ethylene to generate propylene with yields as high as 87&#8201;%. The study is a first proof of concept showcasing a selective chemical depolymerization of PE to a monomer. Future research is expected to focus on the catalyst optimization, process design, and compatibility with contaminated and multi&#8208;polymer waste streams.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and general kinetic resolution of azaarylethynyl tertiary alcohols was developed by a novel phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation strategy catalysed by a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid. Besides enabling the asymmetric construction of azaarene&#8208;functionalized tertiary alcohols of biological importance, the method provides a precise synthetic path to generate enantioenriched azaaryl&#8208;functionalized allenes and deuterated derivatives.







Abstract
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysed phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation protocol is reported. This metal&#8208;free method provides a precise kinetic resolution platform for azaarylethynyl tertiary alcohols, which are a broad category of biologically and synthetically important azaarene derivatives. In addition to providing an efficient method for the first asymmetric preparation of these tertiary alcohols, the strategy facilitates the construction of azaaryl&#8208;functionalized allenes with good to excellent enantioselectivities. The high selectivity factors (s up to 235), broad substrate scope, and ability to convert azaaryl compounds into both chiral tertiary alcohols and allenes robustly underscore the efficiency and promising utility of this method. The practicability is further validated by the successful synthesis of deuterated allenes with high ee values and substantial incorporation of deuterium using inexpensive D2O as the deuterium source.

         <title>Designing Thiophene&#8208;Enriched Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework as Metal&#8208;Free Oxygen Reduction Catalyst for Hydrogen Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thiophene&#8208;enriched fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework was designed and synthesized. Attributed to its conjugated and thiophene&#8208;enriched skeletons, the material exhibited intrinsic metal&#8208;free oxygen&#8208;reduction catalytic activity. It was for the first time integrated into the hydrogen fuel cells as cathode catalyst, and the devices displayed a peak power density up to 493&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The application of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in renewable energy fields is greatly limited due to their non&#8208;conjugated skeletons. Here, we design and successfully synthesize a thiophene&#8208;enriched fully conjugated 3D COF (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;11) through an all&#8208;thiophene&#8208;linked saddle&#8208;shaped building block (COThTh&#8208;CHO). The BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;11 exhibits excellent semiconducting property with intrinsic metal&#8208;free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Using the COF as cathode catalyst, the assembled anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) exhibited a high peak power density up to 493&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. DFT calculations reveal that thiophene introduction in the COF not only improves the conductivity but also optimizes the electronic structure of the sample, which therefore boosts the ORR performance. This is the first report on the application of COFs as metal&#8208;free catalysts in fuel cells, demonstrating the great potential of fully conjugated 3D COFs as promising semiconductors in energy fields.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks with Polyethylene Glycol as Self&#8208;Sustained Humidity&#8208;Responsive Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating rigid covalent organic frameworks with flexible polyethylene glycol generates rigid&#8208;flexible coupled membrane actuators with outstanding humidity&#8208;responsive performance. These actuators exhibited interesting self&#8208;oscillating properties on the water surface, and can continuously generate electricity after coupling with a piezoelectric film.







Abstract
Regarding the global energy crisis, it is of profound significance to develop spontaneous power generators that harvest natural energy. Fabricating humidity&#8208;responsive actuators that can conduct such energy transduction is of paramount importance. Herein, we incorporate covalent organic frameworks with flexible polyethylene glycol to fabricate rigid&#8208;flexible coupled membrane actuators. This strategy significantly improves the mechanical properties and humidity&#8208;responsive performance of the actuators, meanwhile, the existence of ordered structures enables us to unveil the actuation mechanism. These high&#8208;performance actuators can achieve various actuation applications and exhibit interesting self&#8208;oscillation behavior above a water surface. Finally, after being coupled with a piezoelectric film, the bilayer device can spontaneously output electricity over 2&#8197;days. This work paves a new avenue to fabricate rigid&#8208;flexible coupled actuators for self&#8208;sustained energy transduction.

         <title>Blocked Phosphates as Photolatent Catalysts for Dynamic Photopolymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photolatent organophosphate is synthesized and introduced into a resin system, which is 3D printed with visible light. The subsequently UV&#8208;released transesterification catalyst activates dynamic exchange reactions at elevated temperatures. Without affecting the thermal stability of the polymer network, bond exchange reactions and shape memory can be spatiotemporally controlled.







Abstract
While latent catalysts are a well&#8208;established strategy for initiating and controlling the rate of polymerization reactions, their use in dynamic polymer networks is still in its infancy. The ideal latent catalyst should be thermally stable and release a highly active species in response to an external trigger. Here, we have synthesized a temperature resistant (&gt;200&#8201;&#176;C) organic phosphate with a photolabile o&#8208;nitrobenzyl protecting group that can be cleaved by UV light. Introduced in a visible light curable thiol&#8208;click photopolymer, the sequence&#8208;dependent &#955;&#8208;orthogonality of the curing and cleavage enables an efficient network formation at 451&#8197;nm, without premature release of the catalyst. Once cured, irradiation at 372&#8197;nm spatiotemporally activates the phosphate, which catalyzes transesterifications at elevated temperature. The formed catalyst has no effect on the thermal stability of the polymeric network and allows the activation of bond exchange reactions in selected domains of printed 3D objects.

         <title>Highly Efficient Production of Nanoporous Block Copolymers with Arbitrary Structural Characteristics for Advanced Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pore&#8208;forming strategy has been developed for the fabrication of nanoporous block copolymers (BCPs) with arbitrary structural characteristics with 1&#8197;s soaking. This rapid, facile, and universal strategy can produce percolating nanopore structures in the polystyrene&#8208;based BCPs with various bulk morphologies, which inspires us to prepare advanced membranes derived from the CO2&#8208;based sustainable BCPs for fast molecular separation for the first time.







Abstract
The great significance of boosting the design of percolating nanopore structures in block copolymers (BCPs) for various cases has been widely demonstrated in the past several decades. However, it still remains challenging to prepare the desired porous structures in a rapid, facile, and universal manner. Here we have developed an unconventional and benchtop strategy to rapidly generate the nanoporous polystyrene&#8208;based BCPs with arbitrary structural characteristics regardless of the BCP bulk morphology. This universal pore&#8208;forming strategy enables the sustainable CO2&#8208;based BCPs to form advanced membranes after 1&#8197;s soaking for efficiently rejecting 94.2&#8201;% brilliant blue R (826&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Meanwhile, the water permeance retains around 1020&#8197;L&#8201;(m2&#8201;h&#8201;bar)&#8722;1, which is 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than that of other membranes. This strategy may offer an excellent opportunity to introduce percolating pore structures in those newly developed BCPs with which the previously reported pore&#8208;forming methods may not deal.

         <title>Sustainable and Selective Modern Methods of Noble Metal Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently developed solvometallurgical methods with the emphasis on green reagents, solvents and strategies are discussed in recycling noble metals Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, Ag and Au. Sustainable and separative techniques including selective dissolution, precipitation and coordination for processing of multi&#8208;metal substrates like end of life catalysts and WEEE are highlighted.







Abstract
Noble metals exhibit broad arrange of applications in industry and several aspects of human life which are becoming more and more prevalent in modern times.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble metals exhibit broad arrange of applications in industry and several aspects of human life which are becoming more and more prevalent in modern times. Due to their limited sources and constantly and consistently expanding demand, recycling of secondary and waste materials must accompany the traditional mineral extractions. This Minireview covers the most recent solvometallurgical developments in regeneration of Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, Ag and Au with emphasis on sustainability and selectivity. Processing&#8212;by selective oxidative dissolution, reductive precipitation, solvent extraction, co-precipitation, membrane transfer and trapping to solid media&#8212;of eligible multi-metal substrates for recycling from waste printed circuit boards to end-of-life automotive catalysts are discussed.

         <title>Access to Disentangled Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylene via a Binuclear Synergic Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient synthetic method is reported to tie together two half&#8208;sandwich scandium dialkyls with short linkers. The binuclear complex C1&#8208;Sc2 exhibits extremely high activity for ethylene polymerization and affords ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) featuring low entanglement degree and excellent processing capability under a wide range of reaction temperatures (25&#8211;120&#8201;&#176;C) and ethylene pressures (2&#8211;13&#8197;bar).







Abstract
Disentangled ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (dis&#8208;UHMWPE) has excellent processability but can be achieved under extreme conditions. Herein, we report ethylene polymerization with the binuclear half&#8208;sandwich scandium complexes C1&#8208;Sc2 and C2&#8208;Sc2 to afford UHMWPE. C1&#8208;Sc2 bearing a short linker shows higher activity and gives higher molecular weight PEs than C2&#8208;Sc2 containing a flexible spacer and the mononuclear Sc1. Strikingly, all UHMWPEs isolated from C1&#8208;Sc2 under broad temperature range (25&#8211;120&#8201;&#176;C) and wide ethylene pressures (2&#8211;13&#8197;bar) feature very low degree of entanglement as proved by rheological test, DSC annealing study and SEM. These dis&#8208;UHMWPEs are facilely mediated solid&#8208;state&#8208;process at 130&#8201;&#176;C and their tensile strength and modulus reach up to 149.2&#8197;MPa and 1.5&#8197;GPa, respectively. DFT simulations reveal that the formation of dis&#8208;UHMWPE is attributed to the binuclear synergic effect and the agostic interaction between the active center and the growing chain.

         <title>Predicting Collagen Triple Helix Stability through Additive Effects of Terminal Residues and Caps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen model peptides are like a construction set. The stability of collagen triple helices is critically determined by the frame, terminal residues, capping groups, and their charge state. The effects are additive and can be used to predict the melting temperatures of new collagen trimers. Combined experimental and theoretical studies shed light on the origins of these effects at the molecular level.







Abstract
Collagen model peptides (CMPs) consisting of proline&#8208;(2S,4R)&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;glycine (POG) repeats have provided a breadth of knowledge of the triple helical structure of collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals. Predictive tools for triple helix stability have, however, lagged behind since the effect of CMPs with different frames ([POG]n, [OGP]n, or [GPO]n) and capped or uncapped termini have so far been underestimated. Here, we elucidated the impact of the frame, terminal functional group and its charge on the stability of collagen triple helices. Combined experimental and theoretical studies with frame&#8208;shifted, capped and uncapped CMPs revealed that electrostatic interactions, strand preorganization, interstrand H&#8208;bonding, and steric repulsion at the termini contribute to triple helix stability. We show that these individual contributions are additive and allow for the prediction of the melting temperatures of CMP trimers.

         <title>Diboraanthracene&#8208;Doped Polymer Systems for Colour&#8208;Tuneable Room&#8208;Temperature Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diboraanthracene compounds are presented as a new class of room temperature organic afterglow materials for colour&#8208;tuneable polymer&#8208;based systems. The afterglow consists of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), or organic afterglow, is a unique phenomenon, gaining widespread attention due to its far&#8208;reaching application potential and fundamental interest. Here, two laterally expanded 9,10&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;diboraanthracene (DBA) derivatives are demonstrated as excellent afterglow materials for red and blue&#8208;green light emission, which is traced back to persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and RTP. The lateral substitution of polycyclic DBA scaffold, together with weak transversal electron&#8208;donating mesityl groups, ensures the optimal molecular properties for (reverse) intersystem crossing and long&#8208;lived triplet states in a rigid poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix. The achieved afterglow emission quantum yields of up to 3&#8201;% and 15&#8201;%, afterglow lifetimes up to 0.8&#8197;s and 3.2&#8197;s and afterglow durations up to 5&#8197;s and 25&#8197;s (for red and blue&#8208;green emitters, respectively) are attributed to the properties of single molecules.

         <dc:description>
Darobactins bind to the novel antibiotic target BamA in the outer membrane BAM&#8208;complex of Gram&#8208;negative pathogens. The renewal of the outer membrane proteins is prevented and bacteria are lysed. The new derivative D22 was created through cryo&#8208;EM structure&#8208; and activity&#8208;guided biosynthetic engineering as described by Thomas Marlovits, Jennifer Herrmann, Rolf M&#252;ller et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202214094), showing superior potency against multi&#8208;drug resistant clinical isolates, for which most antibiotics on the market are no longer effective.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Atomic Structure in Multivariate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for Guiding Electrocatalysts Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) technique is utilized to visualize the structure and resolve the lattice strain information of multivariate MOFs (MTV&#8208;MOFs) at an atomic level, providing important guidance in the further design of MOFs for efficient OER, unlocking the iDPC&#8208;STEM technique as an effective tool in MOF design for electrocatalytic applications.







Abstract
The direct utilization of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has attracted increasing interests. Herein, we employ the low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) technique to visualize the atomic structure of multivariate MOFs (MTV&#8208;MOFs) for guiding the structural design of bulk MOFs for efficient OER. The iDPC&#8208;STEM images revealed that incorporating Fe3+ or 2&#8208;aminoterephthalate (ATA) into Ni&#8208;BDC (BDC: benzenedicarboxylate) can introduce inhomogeneous lattice strain that weaken the coordination bonds, which can be selectively cleaved via a mild heat treatment to simultaneously generate coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, conductive Ni@C and hierarchical porous structure. Thus, excellent OER activity with current densities of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 are achieved over the defective MOFs at small overpotentials of 286&#8197;mV and 365&#8197;mV, respectively, which is superior to the commercial RuO2 catalyst and most of the bulk MOFs.

&lt;p&gt;The low-dose integrated differential phase contrast-scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) technique is utilized to visualize the structure and resolve the lattice strain information of multivariate MOFs (MTV-MOFs) at an atomic level, providing important guidance in the further design of MOFs for efficient OER, unlocking the iDPC-STEM technique as an effective tool in MOF design for electrocatalytic applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct utilization of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has attracted increasing interests. Herein, we employ the low-dose integrated differential phase contrast-scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) technique to visualize the atomic structure of multivariate MOFs (MTV-MOFs) for guiding the structural design of bulk MOFs for efficient OER. The iDPC-STEM images revealed that incorporating Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; or 2-aminoterephthalate (ATA) into Ni-BDC (BDC: benzenedicarboxylate) can introduce inhomogeneous lattice strain that weaken the coordination bonds, which can be selectively cleaved via a mild heat treatment to simultaneously generate coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, conductive Ni@C and hierarchical porous structure. Thus, excellent OER activity with current densities of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved over the defective MOFs at small overpotentials of 286&#8197;mV and 365&#8197;mV, respectively, which is superior to the commercial RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst and most of the bulk MOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Helical Nanofibrous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral COFs with well&#8208;defined, one&#8208;handed double&#8208;helical nanofibrous morphologies are constructed for the first time involving a chiral aminal linkage. By adjusting the amount of acetic acid during synthesis, the helicity of the resulting COF double helices can be readily inversed. Circularly polarized luminescence of the COF double helices is achieved via transferring chirality to achiral fluorophores.







Abstract
Despite significant progress on the design and synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), precise control over microstructures of such materials remains challenging. Herein, two chiral COFs with well&#8208;defined one&#8208;handed double&#8208;helical nanofibrous morphologies were constructed via an unprecedented template&#8208;free method, capitalizing on the diastereoselective formation of aminal linkages. Detailed time&#8208;dependent experiments reveal the spontaneous transformation of initial rod&#8208;like aggregates into the double&#8208;helical microstructures. We have further demonstrated that the helical chirality and circular dichroism signal can be facilely inversed by simply adjusting the amount of acetic acid during synthesis. Moreover, by transferring chirality to achiral fluorescent molecular adsorbents, the helical COF nanostructures can effectively induce circularly polarized luminescence with the highest luminescent asymmetric factor (glum) up to &#8776;0.01.

         <title>Tunable Electrochemical Peptide Modifications: Unlocking New Levels of Orthogonality for Side&#8208;Chain Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The programmable electrochemical modification of peptides is enabled by designer electroauxiliaries which are readily compatible with solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Anodic oxidation facilitates the functionalization of &#8220;electroactive&#8221; glutamine residues to deliver high&#8208;value peptide N,O&#8208;acetals. By dialing in the oxidation potential of distinct electroauxiliaries, the iterative and orthogonal functionalization of peptides is accomplished.







Abstract
Electrochemical transformations provide enticing opportunities for programmable, residue&#8208;specific peptide modifications. Herein, we harness the potential of amidic side&#8208;chains as underutilized handles for late&#8208;stage modification through the development of an electroauxiliary&#8208;assisted oxidation of glutamine residues within unprotected peptides. Glutamine building blocks bearing electroactive side&#8208;chain N,S&#8208;acetals are incorporated into peptides using standard Fmoc&#8208;SPPS. Anodic oxidation of the electroauxiliary in the presence of diverse alcohol nucleophiles enables the installation of high&#8208;value N,O&#8208;acetal functionalities. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for an electrochemical peptide stapling protocol, as well as the functionalization of dynorphin B, an endogenous opioid peptide, demonstrates the applicability of the method to intricate peptide systems. Finally, the site&#8208;selective and tunable electrochemical modification of a peptide bearing two discretely oxidizable sites is achieved.

         <title>Isolated Electron&#8208;Rich Ruthenium Atoms in Intermetallic Compounds for Boosting Electrochemical Nitric Oxide Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The body&#8208;centered cubic RuGa intermetallic compounds (i.e., bcc RuGa IMCs) are prepared via a substrate&#8208;anchored thermal annealing method. Electron&#8208;rich Ru atoms are the active sites and are isolated in bcc RuGa IMCs, which promote electron transfer from the electrocatalyst to key intermediates, thereby effectively improving the electrocatalytic performance of the nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR).







Abstract
The direct electrochemical nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) is an attractive technique for converting NO into NH3 with low power consumption under ambient conditions. Optimizing the electronic structure of the active sites can greatly improve the performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, we prepare body&#8208;centered cubic RuGa intermetallic compounds (i.e., bcc RuGa IMCs) via a substrate&#8208;anchored thermal annealing method. The electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable NH4+ yield rate of 320.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1Ru with the corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 72.3&#8201;% at very low potential of &#8722;0.2&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in neutral media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electron&#8208;rich Ru atoms in bcc RuGa IMCs facilitate the adsorption and activation of *HNO intermediate. Hence, the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step in NORR could be greatly reduced.

         <title>Chemical Upcycling of Conventional Polyureas into Dynamic Covalent Poly(aminoketoenamide)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an approach for the chemical upcycling of urea bonds&#8208;containing materials. Our strategy is mediated by acetylacetone and ultimately affords dynamic covalent aminoketoenamide bonds. The here reported conversion scheme allows for the preparation of dynamic covalent poly(aminoketoenamide) networks, which can be healed and reprocessed via catalyst&#8208;free thermal treatments.







Abstract
The chemical upcycling of polymers is an emerging strategy to transform post&#8208;consumer waste into higher&#8208;value chemicals and materials. However, on account of the high stability of the chemical bonds that constitute their main chains, the chemical modification of many polymers proves to be difficult. Here, we report a versatile approach for the upcycling of linear and cross&#8208;linked polyureas, which are widely used because of their high chemical stability. The treatment of these polymers or their composites with acetylacetone affords di&#8208;vinylogous amide&#8208;terminated compounds in good yield. These products can be reacted with aromatic isocyanates, and the resulting aminoketoenamide bonds are highly dynamic at elevated temperatures. We show here that this conversion scheme can be exploited for the preparation of dynamic covalent poly(aminoketoenamide) networks, which are healable and reprocessable through thermal treatment without any catalyst.

         <title>Reversible Isomerization Between Silacyclopropyl Cation and Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;stabilized silacyclopropyl cation has been synthesized and fully characterized. Interestingly, this silacyclopropyl cation reversibly isomerizes into the corresponding seven&#8208;membered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene at room temperature via a formal migratory ethylene insertion into the Si&#8722;P bond. Although the silylene has not been spectroscopically detected, its transient formation has been evidenced by various trapping reactions.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;stabilized silacyclopropyl cation 2 has been synthesized and fully characterized. Of particular interest, 2 reversibly isomerizes into the corresponding seven&#8208;membered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene 3 at room temperature via a formal migratory ethylene insertion into the Si&#8722;P bond. Although silylene 3 has not been spectroscopically detected, its transient formation has been evidenced by the isolation of the corresponding disilene dimer 5 as well as by trapping reactions.

Although silylene &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; has not been spectroscopically detected, its transient formation has been evidenced by the isolation of the corresponding disilene dimer &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; as well as by trapping reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystalline Unipolymer Monolayer with High Modulus and Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the ultimate goals in polymer science is how to approach physical limits such as density, modulus, conductivity, etc. Our work demonstrates the creation of crystalline polymer monolayers for approaching the physical limits of polymer electronic materials and also provides an opportunity to challenge the synthetically iterative limit of an isolated ultra&#8208;long polymer.







Abstract
The synthesis of crystalline polymer with a well&#8208;defined orientated state and a two&#8208;dimensional crystalline size beyond a micrometer will be essential to achieve the highest physical feature of polymer material but remain challenging. Herein, we show the synthesis of the crystalline unipolymer monolayer with an unusual ultrahigh modulus that is higher than the ITO substrate and high conductance by simultaneous electrosynthesis and manipulation. We find that the polymer monolayer has fully extended in the vertical and unidirectional orientation, which is proposed to approach their theoretically highest density, modulus, and conductivity among all aggregation formations of the current polymer. The modulus and current density can reach 40 and 1000&#8197;times higher than their amorphous counterpart. It is also found that these monolayers exhibit the bias&#8208; and length&#8208;dependent multiple charge states and asymmetrically negative differential resistance (NDR) effect, indicating that this unique molecular tailoring and ordering design is promising for multilevel resistive memory devices. Our work demonstrates the creation of a crystalline polymer monolayer for approaching the physical limit of polymer electronic materials and also provides an opportunity to challenge the synthetically iterative limit of an isolated ultra&#8208;long polymer.

         <title>Monomer and Excimer Emission in a Conformational and Stacking&#8208;Adaptable Molecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of molecular conformations, alkyl chain lengths, and charge&#8208;transfer effects has been used to precisely regulate monomer and excimer emission in multiple states. This approach has led to conformational and stacking&#8208;adaptable donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960; type molecules derived from cyanostilbene, diphenyldiacetylene, and alkyl side chains that show applications in temperature monitoring and advanced information encryption.







Abstract
A design strategy that combines molecular conformation, alkyl chain length, and charge&#8208;transfer effects has been developed to obtain conformational and stacking&#8208;adaptable donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960; type molecules for precisely regulating the monomer and excimer emission in a single luminous platform under different environments. These fluorophores can exhibit bright monomer emissions when they are in the dispersed state based on their planar conformation. However, when the luminous molecules with short alkyl side chains are in the crystalline state, their molecular conformation can become distorted, further inducing strong intermolecular interactions and staggered &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking for bright excimer emission. More importantly, their dispersed and aggregated states can be reversibly regulated in a phase&#8208;change fatty acid matrix, to achieve temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence for temperature monitoring and advanced information encryption.

         <title>A Liquid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Solid System to Manipulate the Cascade Reaction for Highly Selective Electrosynthesis of Aldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel liquid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid system was designed to manipulate the selectivity of cascade reaction and the selectivity for benzaldehyde is a 200&#8208;fold increase compared with the traditional liquid&#8208;solid system. The produced benzaldehyde could be in situ extracted by organic phase and separated from the complex electrolyte to achieve purification.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of aldehydes from alcohols exhibits unique superiorities as a promising technology, in which cascade reactions are involved. However, the cascade reactions are severely limited by the low selectivity resulting from the peroxidation of aldehydes in a traditional liquid&#8208;solid system. Herein, we report a novel liquid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid system to regulate the selectivity of benzyl alcohol electrooxidation. The selectivity of benzaldehyde increases 200&#8208;fold from 0.4&#8201;% to 80.4&#8201;% compared with the liquid&#8208;solid system at a high current density of 136&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is the highest one up to date. In the tri&#8208;phase system, the benzaldehyde peroxidation is suppressed efficiently, with the conversion of benzaldehyde being decreased from 87.6&#8201;% to 3.8&#8201;%. The as&#8208;produced benzaldehyde can be in situ extracted to toluene phase and separated from the electrolyte to get purified benzaldehyde. This strategy provides an efficient way to efficiently enhance the selectivity of electrocatalytic cascade reactions.

         <title>Elastic moduli: a tool for understanding chemical bonding and thermal transport in thermoelectric materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The elastic behavior of a material can be a powerful tool to decipher thermal transport. In thermoelectrics, measuring the elastic moduli &#8208; directly tied to sound velocity &#8208; is critical to understand trends in lattice thermal conductivity, as well as study bond anharmonicity and phase transitions, given the sensitivity of elastic moduli to the chemical bonding. In this review, we introduce the basics of elasticity and explain the origin of high&#8208;temperature lattice softening from a bonding perspective. We then review elasticity data throughout classes of thermoelectrics, and explore trends in sound velocity, anharmonicity, and thermal conductivity. We reveal how experimental sound velocities can improve the accuracy of common thermal conductivity models and present a critical discussion of Gr&#252;neisen parameter estimates from elastic moduli. Readers will be equipped with tools to leverage elasticity measurements or calculations to accurately interpret thermal transport trends.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Re&#8208;Organization Enables Polythiophene as an Extraordinary Cathode Material for Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries with a Cycle Life of 100,000 Cycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs)&#160;have attracted great attentions&#160;in recent years. Organic materials such as polythiophene (PT) are promising cathode&#160;for AIBs. However, the capacity and cyclic stability of conventional organic cathode&#160;such as PT are limited by the inadequate degree of reaction and the unstable nature of organic materials. To obtain high&#8208;performance&#160;organic cathode, a new PT with the ability of self&#8208;adaptive re&#8208;organization&#160;was prepared. During&#160;cycling, its&#160;molecular chain can be re&#8208;organized, and the polymerization mode will change from C&#945;&#8208;C&#945;&#160;(&#945;&#8208;PT)&#160;to C&#946;&#8208;C&#946;&#160;(&#946;&#8208;PT). This change leads to smaller steric hindrance and faster kinetics&#160;during ion insertion which can lower the reaction energy barrier and stabilize the molecular structure. Benefited by this, AIBs&#160;with this cathode can deliver&#160;a&#160;specific capacity of 180 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;(@2 A g&#8208;1) and a&#160;superb stability of 100,000 cycles&#160;at 10 A g&#8208;1.&#160;High energy density and power density&#160;can also be achieved&#160;with this cathode.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs)&#160;have attracted great attentions&#160;in recent years. Organic materials such as polythiophene (PT) are promising cathode&#160;for AIBs. However, the capacity and cyclic stability of conventional organic cathode&#160;such as PT are limited by the inadequate degree of reaction and the unstable nature of organic materials. To obtain high-performance&#160;organic cathode, a new PT with the ability of self-adaptive re-organization&#160;was prepared. During&#160;cycling, its&#160;molecular chain can be re-organized, and the polymerization mode will change from C&#945;-C&#945;&#160;(&#945;-PT)&#160;to C&#946;-C&#946;&#160;(&#946;-PT). This change leads to smaller steric hindrance and faster kinetics&#160;during ion insertion which can lower the reaction energy barrier and stabilize the molecular structure. Benefited by this, AIBs&#160;with this cathode can deliver&#160;a&#160;specific capacity of 180 mAh g-1&#160;(@2 A g-1) and a&#160;superb stability of 100,000 cycles&#160;at 10 A g-1.&#160;High energy density and power density&#160;can also be achieved&#160;with this cathode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conjugated and Non&#8208;conjugated Polymers Containing Two&#8208;Electron Redox Dihydrophenazines for Lithium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic p&#8208;type cathode materials have recently attracted increasing attention due to their higher redox potentials and rate capabilities in comparison to n&#8208;type cathodes. However, most of the p&#8208;type cathodes based on one&#8208;electron redox still suffer from limited stability and low specific capacity (&lt; 150 mAh/g). Herein, two polymers, conjugated poly(diethyldihydrophenazine vinylene) (CPP) and non&#8208;conjugated poly(diethyldihydrophenazine ethylidene) (NCPP) containing two&#8208;electron redox dihydrophenazine, have been developed as p&#8208;type cathode materials. It is experimentally and theoretically found that the conjugated linkage among the redox centers in polymer CPP is more favorable for the effective charge delocalization on the conjugated polymer backbone and the sufficient oxidation in the higher potential region (3.3&#8208;4.2 V vs. Li/Li+). Consequently, the CPP cathode displays a higher reversible specific capacity of 184 mAh/g with excellent cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Conversion of Microplastics to Methane with Ultrahigh Selectivity by a Biotic&#8211;Abiotic Hybrid Photocatalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methanogen&#8208;semiconductor biohybrids drive sustainable conversion of microplastics to CH4 under illumination. This addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge of photocatalysis by fully utilizing photogenerated electrons and holes without the need of using expensive and unsustainable chemical sacrificial quenchers.







Abstract
Efficient conversion of microplastics into fuels provides a promising strategy to alleviate environmental pollution and the energy crisis. However, the conventional processes are challenged by low product selectivity and potential secondary pollution. Herein, a biotic&#8208;abiotic photocatalytic system is designed by assembling Methanosarcina barkeri (M.&#8197;b) and carbon dot&#8208;functionalized polymeric carbon nitrides (CDPCN), by which biodegradable microplastics&#8212;poly(lactic acid) after heat pretreatment can be converted into CH4 for five successive 24&#8208;day cycles with nearly 100&#8201;% CH4 selectivity by the assistance of additional CO2. Mechanistic analyses showed that both photooxidation and photoreduction methanogenesis worked simultaneously via the fully utilizing photogenerated holes and electrons without chemical sacrificial quenchers. Further research validated the real&#8208;world applicability of M.&#8197;b&#8208;CDPCN for non&#8208;biodegradable microplastic&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion, offering a new avenue for engineering the plastic reuse.

         <title>Diboron(4)&#8208;Catalyzed Remote [3+2] Cycloaddition of Cyclopropanes via Dearomative/Rearomative Radical Transmission through Pyridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previously challenging pyridinyl cyclopentanes, cyclopentenes and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes with multiple substituents now can be efficiently prepared via a remote [3+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reaction features a simple diboron(4) catalyst, modular disconnection mode, broad scope, high atom economy and a unique dearomative/rearomative mechanistic process.







Abstract
Ring structures such as pyridine, cyclopentane or their combinations are important motifs in bioactive molecules. In contrast to previous cycloaddition reactions that necessitated a directly bonded initiating functional group, this work demonstrated a novel through&#8208;(hetero)arene radical transmission concept for selective activation of a remote bond. An efficient, metal&#8208;free and atom&#8208;economical [3+2] cycloaddition between 4&#8208;pyridinyl cyclopropanes and alkenes or alkynes has been developed for modular synthesis of pyridine&#8208;substituted cyclopentanes, cyclopentenes and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes that are difficult to access using known methods. This complexity&#8208;building reaction was catalyzed by a very simple and inexpensive diboron(4) compound and took place via dearomative/rearomative processes. The substrate scope was broad and more than 100 new compounds were prepared in generally high yields. Mechanistic experiments and density function theory (DFT) investigation supported a radical relay catalytic cycle involving alkylidene dihydropyridine radical intermediates and boronyl radical transfer.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Triaryl &#945;&#8208;Pyranones with 1,2&#8208;Diaxes by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;step atroposelective construction of triaryl &#945;&#8208;pyranones with stereogenic 1,2&#8208;diaxes was accomplished by NHC organocatalysis. The structure of the substrates and the catalytic system play a critical role in the success of this protocol. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the origin of the high stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Atropisomers bearing multiple stereogenic axes are of increasing importance to the field of material science, pharmaceuticals, and catalysis. However, the atroposelective construction of multi&#8208;axis atropisomers remains rare and challenging, due to the intrinsical difficulties in the stereo&#8208;control of the multiple stereogenic axes. Herein, we demonstrate a single&#8208;step construction of a new class of 1,2&#8208;diaxially chiral triaryl &#945;&#8208;pyranones by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalytic asymmetric [3+3] annulation of well&#8208;designed alkynyl acylazolium precursors and enolizable sterically hindered 2&#8208;aryl ketones. The protocol features broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples), excellent stereo&#8208;control (most cases &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, up to 99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er), and potentially useful synthetic applications. The success of this reaction relies on the rational design of structurally matched reaction partners and the careful selection of the asymmetric catalytic system. DFT calculations have also been performed to discover and rationalize the origin of the high stereoselectivity of this reaction.

         <title>Catalytic Biosensors Operating under Quasi&#8208;Equilibrium Conditions for Mitigating the Changes in Substrate Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a catalytic quasi&#8208;equilibrium biosensor concept in which an O2&#8208;insensitive enzyme is wired with a redox polymer to the electrode. This allows the enzymatic conversion to be switched off by applying a low potential, the redox polymer can be charged with a short positive potential pulse, and the glucose concentration can be determined potentiometrically with minimal disturbance of the concentration equilibrium. This concept is opening the door for mitigating any impact of the foreign&#8208;body reaction in implantable biosensors.







Abstract
Despite the success of continuous glucose measuring systems operating through the skin for about 14&#8197;days, long&#8208;term implantable biosensors are facing challenges caused by the foreign&#8208;body reaction. We present a conceptually new strategy using catalytic enzyme&#8208;based biosensors based on a measuring sequence leading to minimum disturbance of the substrate equilibrium concentration by controlling the sensor between &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; state combined with short potentiometric data acquisition. It is required that the enzyme activity can be completely switched off and no parasitic side reactions allow substrate turnover. This is achieved by using an O2&#8208;independent FAD&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenase embedded within a crosslinked redox polymer. A short measuring interval allows the glucose concentration equilibrium to be restored quickly which enables the biosensor to operate under quasi&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

     alt="Catalytic Biosensors Operating under Quasi-Equilibrium Conditions for Mitigating the Changes in Substrate Diffusion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a catalytic quasi-equilibrium biosensor concept in which an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-insensitive enzyme is wired with a redox polymer to the electrode. This allows the enzymatic conversion to be switched off by applying a low potential, the redox polymer can be charged with a short positive potential pulse, and the glucose concentration can be determined potentiometrically with minimal disturbance of the concentration equilibrium. This concept is opening the door for mitigating any impact of the foreign-body reaction in implantable biosensors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the success of continuous glucose measuring systems operating through the skin for about 14&#8197;days, long-term implantable biosensors are facing challenges caused by the foreign-body reaction. We present a conceptually new strategy using catalytic enzyme-based biosensors based on a measuring sequence leading to minimum disturbance of the substrate equilibrium concentration by controlling the sensor between &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; state combined with short potentiometric data acquisition. It is required that the enzyme activity can be completely switched off and no parasitic side reactions allow substrate turnover. This is achieved by using an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-independent FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase embedded within a crosslinked redox polymer. A short measuring interval allows the glucose concentration equilibrium to be restored quickly which enables the biosensor to operate under quasi-equilibrium conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Green and Red Narrowband Emissive Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters

Through careful selection of donor substituents about the DiKTa core, record&#8208;high efficiency green&#8208;emitting OLEDs were fabricated, with EQEmax of 30.8&#8201;%, and the reddest MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs have been reported based on ketone&#8208;containing multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate how judicious selection of the donor decorating a central multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) core based on DiKTa can lead to very high&#8208;performance OLEDs. By decorating the DiKTa core with triphenylamine (TPA) and diphenylamine (DPA), 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa and 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa exhibit bright, narrowband green and red emission in doped films, respectively. The OLEDs based on these emitters showed record&#8208;high performance for this family of emitters with maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax) of 30.8&#8201;% for 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa at &#955;EL of 551&#8197;nm and 16.7&#8201;% for 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa at &#955;EL=613&#8197;nm. The efficiency roll&#8208;off in the OLEDs was improved significantly by using 4CzIPN as an assistant dopant in hyperfluorescence (HF) devices. The outstanding device performance has been attributed to preferential horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moments of 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa and 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa.

         <title>Catalytically Stable Potassium Single&#8208;Atom Solid Superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of solid superbase derived from potassium single atoms anchored on graphene is developed by a tandem redox strategy. The source of the basicity is the single K atoms, thus differing from conventional basicity which originates from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The high dispersion and anchoring of superbasic sites endows the catalyst with excellent activity and stability in transesterification reactions.







Abstract
Solid superbases can catalyze diverse reactions under mild conditions, while they suffer from aggregation of basic sites and poor stability during recycling. Here we report a new generation of solid superbases derived from K single atoms (SAs) prepared by a tandem redox strategy. The initial redox reaction takes place between base precursor KNO3 and graphene support, producing K2O at 400&#8201;&#176;C. Further increasing the temperature to 800&#8201;&#176;C, the graphene reduces K2O to K anchored by its vacancies, leading to the generation of K SAs (denoted as K1/G). The source of basicity in the K1/G is K SAs, and neighboring single atoms (NSAs) possess superbasicity, which is different from conventional basicity originated from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Due to the superbasicity as well as high dispersion and anchoring of basic sites, the K1/G shows excellent catalytic activity and stability in transesterification reaction, which is much superior to the reported catalysts.

         <title>Durable Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Interfacial Layers Based on Mechanically Interlocked Networks Capable of Energy Dissipation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically interlocked network (MIN) with robustness and unique energy dissipation capability was used as the interfacial layer which survived and suppressed repeated Li protrusion in long&#8208;term and high&#8208;capacity cycling to afford durable lithium metal anodes. This work highlights the importance of the energy dissipation feature in stabling Li metal anodes, promising MIN's future success in other battery&#8208;related fields suffering from repeated volume variations.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has received considerable attention due to its vital role in stabilizing Li anode. However, native and many artificial SEIs often suffer from cracking and fragmentation under dendrite impact or long&#8208;term repeated volume variation, causing capacity decay. Herein, a mechanically interlocked network (MIN) was innovatively designed as interfacial layer to protect Li anode by incorporating the unique energy dissipation capability, which helps Li anode survive repeated volume variation during long&#8208;term cycling. As a result, symmetric cell with MIN&#8208;coated Li anode (MIN@Li) exhibited prolonged cycling life of 1500&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The full cell using LFP cathode (13.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) cycled stably for 500 cycles with capacity retention over 88&#8201;% (1&#8197;C). Our results highlight a creative application of MIN in Li anode, and its unique energy dissipation capability promises future success in other battery fields suffering from repeated volume variations.

         <title>Suprasomes Based on Host&#8211;Guest Molecular Recognition: An Excellent Alternative to Liposomes in Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suprasomes, considered the third generation of vesicular drug delivery systems, are constructed based on host&#8211;guest recognition. Cisplatin&#8208;loaded suprasomes are promising for photothermal therapy (PTT) and laser&#8208;triggered spatiotemporally controllable drug release. Compared to liposomal nanomedicines, CDDP@Suprasomes realize complete tumor ablation without metastasis as a result of the synergy between PTT and chemotherapy, showing great potential in cancer theranostics.







Abstract
Liposomes and polymersomes, typical vesicular drug delivery systems (DDSs), have faced some limitations in cancer theranostics. Suprasomes, supramolecular vesicles assembled from amphiphiles linked by noncovalent interactions, show potential as new generation of vesicular DDSs. We construct suprasomes based on host&#8211;guest recognition, by which the desired functions can be integrated into carriers without tedious synthesis. Photothermally active host&#8211;guest complex is formed between a functional guest and pillar[5]arene, which further self&#8208;assembles into hollow suprasomes. A supramolecular nanomedicine is developed by encapsulating cisplatin in the suprasomes. The obtained cisplatin@Suprasomes achieve excellent anticancer efficacy and anti&#8208;metastasis combining chemotherapy and photothermal therapy, which ablate the tumors without relapse and metastasis. This work demonstrates the facile functionalization of suprasomes, holding promise as alternatives to liposomes and polymersomes.

         <title>A Crosslinked Ionic Organic Framework for Efficient Iodine and Iodide Remediation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic porous organic framework (HCOF&#8208;7) has been developed to remove iodine residues (I2 and I&#8722;) after water disinfection, demonstrating high breakthrough volumes and wide working temperatures.







Abstract
Iodine is widely used as an antimicrobial reagent for water disinfection in the wilderness and outer space, but residual iodine and iodide need to be removed for health reasons. Currently, it is challenging to remove low concentrations of iodine and iodide in water (&#8776;5&#8197;ppm). Furthermore, the remediation of iodine and iodide across a broad temperature range (up to 90&#8201;&#176;C) has not previously been investigated. In this work, we report a nitrate dimer&#8208;directed synthesis of a single&#8208;crystalline ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework (HCOF&#8208;7). HCOF&#8208;7 removes iodine and iodide species in water efficiently through halogen bonding and anion exchange, reducing the total iodine concentration to 0.22&#8197;ppm at room temperature. Packed HCOF&#8208;7 columns were employed for iodine/iodide breakthrough experiments between 23 and 90&#8201;&#176;C, and large breakthrough volumes were recorded (&#8805;18.3&#8197;L&#8201;g&#8722;1). The high iodine/iodide removal benchmarks recorded under practical conditions make HCOF&#8208;7 a promising adsorbent for water treatment.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Simultaneous Regulating Solvation Structures for Advanced Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional electrolyte additive, N&#8208;Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), is developed to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anodes. NMP not only alters the solvation structure of Zn2+, but also in situ produces a dense nitrogen&#8208;rich layer on Zn. This layer protects Zn from corrosive electrolytes and benefits the uniform plating/stripping of Zn.







Abstract
Zn metal as one of promising anode materials for aqueous batteries suffers from notorious dendrite growth, serious Zn corrosion and hydrogen evolution. Here, a bifunctional electrolyte additive, N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), is developed to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anode. NMP not only alters the solvation structure of Zn2+, but also in situ produces a dense N&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase layer on Zn foils. This layer protects Zn foils from corrosive electrolytes and benefits the uniform plating/stripping of Zn. Hence, the asymmetrical cells with NMP in the electrolyte retain a high coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles. The symmetric cells survive &#8776;200&#8197;h for 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a high Zn utilization of 85.6&#8201;%. The full cells of Zn||MnO2 show an impressive cumulative capacity even with lean electrolyte (E/C ratio=10&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1), limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=2.3) and high areal capacity (5.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>The Anionic Chemistry in Regulating the Reductive Stability of Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>

The participation of anions in the solvation sheath of lithium ions promotes the reductive stability of solvents. Simultaneously, anions themselves tend to get reduced more easily and induce the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, which is beneficial to stabilizing lithium metal anodes.







Abstract
Advanced electrolyte design is essential for building high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) batteries, and introducing anions into the Li+ solvation sheaths has been widely demonstrated as a promising strategy. However, a fundamental understanding of the critical role of anions in such electrolytes is very lacking. Herein, the anionic chemistry in regulating the electrolyte structure and stability is probed by combining computational and experimental approaches. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, the solvents and anions in Li+ solvation sheaths exhibit enhanced and decreased reductive stability compared with free counterparts, respectively, which agrees with both calculated and experimental results of reduction potentials. Accordingly, new strategies are proposed to build stable electrolytes based on the established anionic chemistry. This work unveils the mysterious anionic chemistry in regulating the structure&#8211;function relationship of electrolytes and contributes to a rational design of advanced electrolytes for practical Li metal batteries.

This work develops exo&#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z) as chain&#8208;transfer agents for the sulfur&#8208;free RAFT polymerization of methacrylates in homogeneous solution. A series of R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z with the MMA&#8208;dimer structure as R and substituted &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene unit as &#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z (Z: Ph&#8722;Y) were synthesized. More electron&#8208;donating substituents (Y) work better. Colorless sulfur&#8208;free multiblock copolymers were prepared via sequential monomer additions.







Abstract
In this work, the development of exo&#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z) as chain&#8208;transfer agents for the sulfur&#8208;free reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization of methacrylates in homogeneous solution is described. A series of exo&#8208;olefin compounds with a methyl methacrylate (MMA) dimer structure as the R group and a substituted &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene unit as the &#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z (Z: Ph&#8722;Y) group were synthesized and used for the radical polymerization of MMA in toluene and PhC(CF3)2OH. These compounds underwent transfer of the CH2C(=CH2)Z group via addition&#8208;fragmentation of the propagating methacryloyl radical. More electron&#8208;donating (Y) substituents, such as methoxy and dimethylamino groups, produced polymers with narrower molecular weight distributions. A continuous monomer addition method further improved molecular weight control and enabled the synthesis of colorless, sulfur&#8208;free, multiblock copolymers of methacrylates in homogeneous solutions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the development of &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-olefin compounds (R&#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Z) as chain-transfer agents for the sulfur-free reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization of methacrylates in homogeneous solution is described. A series of &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-olefin compounds with a methyl methacrylate (MMA) dimer structure as the R group and a substituted &#945;-methylstyrene unit as the &#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Z (Z: Ph&#8722;Y) group were synthesized and used for the radical polymerization of MMA in toluene and PhC(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH. These compounds underwent transfer of the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Z group via addition-fragmentation of the propagating methacryloyl radical. More electron-donating (Y) substituents, such as methoxy and dimethylamino groups, produced polymers with narrower molecular weight distributions. A continuous monomer addition method further improved molecular weight control and enabled the synthesis of colorless, sulfur-free, multiblock copolymers of methacrylates in homogeneous solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Computational Design of &#969;&#8208;Transaminase by Reprograming of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Barrier Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism&#8208;guided computational enzyme design was used to reprogram the transition states and ground states of key steps in the asymmetric reductive amination of indanones. The common features of three high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier steps responsible for low catalytic efficiency were revealed by quantum mechanics and guided subsequent enzyme design. The best mutant exhibited a significant improvement in catalytic efficiency towards various prochiral indanones.







Abstract
&#969;&#8208;Transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) show considerable potential for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, their low catalytic efficiency towards bulky substrates limits their application, and complicated catalytic mechanisms prevent precise enzyme design. Herein, we address this challenge using a mechanism&#8208;guided computational enzyme design strategy by reprograming the transition and ground states in key reaction steps. The common features among the three high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier steps responsible for the low catalytic efficiency were revealed using quantum mechanics (QM). Five key residues were simultaneously tailored to stabilize the rate&#8208;limiting transition state with the aid of the Rosetta design. The 14 top&#8208;ranked variants showed 16.9&#8211;143&#8208;fold improved catalytic activity. The catalytic efficiency of the best variant, M9 (Q25F/M60W/W64F/I266A), was significantly increased, with a 1660&#8208;fold increase in kcat/Km and a 1.5&#8211;26.8&#8208;fold increase in turnover number (TON) towards various indanone derivatives.

         <title>[3,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic Rearrangements of Naphthyl 1&#8208;Propargyl Ethers: para&#8208;Propargylation and Catalytic Asymmetric Dearomatization</title>

The formal thermal para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H propargylation of C4&#8208;unsubstituted naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers through para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement was described, and chirality transfer was observed. Moreover, the enantioselective dearomatization of C4&#8208;substituted substrates was realized by using a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/CoII complex catalyst. The DFT calculations and experimental results support the ortho&#8208;Claisen rearrangement/Cope rearrangement sequence process.







Abstract
The para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of aryl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers involves two&#8208;step [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements and dearomatization process, which has high activation barriers and is of challenge. Here we discovered thermal para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers, and it enabled the formation of formal para&#8208;C&#8722;H propargylation products upon rearomatization. Chirality transfer occurred if optically active propargyl ethers were employed, leading to the construction of aryl/propargyl&#8208;containing stereogenic centers. Moreover, catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers with different substitution at para&#8208;position gave access to benzocyclohexenones bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. The reaction was accelerated by a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Co(OTf)2 complex catalyst to achieve high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 93&#8201;% ee). The DFT calculations and experimental results provided important clues to clarify the para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement process as well as the chiral induction and remote delivery.

         <title>Dithiol&#8208;Activated Bioorthogonal Chemistry for Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Synergistic Chemophototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry is introduced for design of organic nitrite donors, on the basis of SNAr and cyclization reactions between dithiols and 5&#8208;nitrobenzo[c][2,1,3]thiadiazole derivatives. A combination of &#8220;click to release&#8221; strategy and photoactivation is achievable for cancer chemophototherapy.







Abstract
The controlled intracellular release of nitrite is still an unmet challenge due to the lack of bio&#8208;friendly donors, and the antitumor effect of nitrite is limited by its physiologically inert activity. Herein, we designed benzothiadiazole&#8208;based organic nitrite donors that are stable against bio&#8208;relevant species but selectively respond to dithiol species through SNAr/intramolecular cyclization tandem reactions in the aqueous media. The bioorthogonal system was established to target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of liver cancer HepG2 cells. The nitrite and nonivamide were coupled to induce elevation of intracellular levels of calcium ions as well as reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which resulted in ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We demonstrated that a combination of photoactivation and &#8220;click to release&#8221; strategy could enhance antitumor effect in cellular level and show good potential for cancer precision therapy.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Fluorinated Solvation Shell and Low Salt Concentration Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;concentration electrolyte was employed in high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries. The synergistic effects of fluorinated solvation shell and low salt concentration generated robust and LiF&#8208;rich SEI and fewer unfavorable decomposition products. The excellent performance implies that the optimization of low concentration electrolytes is a successful solution for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale electrolyte designs.







Abstract
Concentration of electrolyte has significant effects on performances of rechargeable batteries. Previous studies mainly focused on concentrated electrolytes. So far, only several recipes on low&#8208;concentration electrolytes were studied, performing enhanced performance in advanced rechargeable batteries. Here, based on common electrolyte components, a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte composed of 0.2&#8197;M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) solvated in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) is employed for high&#8208;voltage Li metal battery. The synergistic working mechanisms of introducing fluorine&#8208;containing solvent in the solvated structure and low salt concentration effect are revealed, resulting in LiF&#8208;rich, uniform, and robust solid electrolyte interphase layer and fewer unfavorable decomposition products. As a result, this low&#8208;concentration electrolyte significantly enhances electrochemical performances of Li||Li symmetric cells and high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2||Li batteries.

         <title>Near&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoelectric Coupling via Spin Crossover in an Iron(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoelectric coupling is achieved near room temperature in a spin crossover FeII molecule&#8208;based compound. The coupling is realized through the interplay of structural, magnetic, and electrical changes that allows the spin crossover to be driven by a remarkably low magnetic field of 3&#8197;T.







Abstract
Magnetoelectric coupling is achieved near room temperature in a spin crossover FeII molecule&#8208;based compound, [Fe(1bpp)2](BF4)2. Large atomic displacements resulting from Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions induce a change in the molecule dipole moment when switching between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin states leading to a step&#8208;wise change in the electric polarization and dielectric constant. For temperatures in the region of bistability, the changes in magnetic and electrical properties are induced with a remarkably low magnetic field of 3&#8197;T. This result represents a successful expansion of magnetoelectric spin crossovers towards ambient conditions. Moreover, the observed 0.3&#8211;0.4&#8197;mC&#8201;m&#8722;2 changes in the H&#8208;induced electric polarization suggest that the high strength of the coupling obtained via this route is accessible not just at cryogenic temperatures but also near room temperature, a feature that is especially appealing in the light of practical applications.

         <title>Fabricating Industry&#8208;Compatible Olefin&#8208;Linked COF Resins for Oxoanion Pollutant Scavenging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral and ionic vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were constructed with inexpensive 2,4,6&#8208;collidine as the building unit by a melt polymerization method. The as&#8208;prepared, low&#8208;cost cationic COF foams showed high crystallinity, abundant porosity, superior stability, and high adsorption capacity for oxoanion pollutants. This study opens a pathway to large&#8208;scale industrial production of ionic COFs.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to meet the demands of industrial application remains formidably challenge. Here we report using 2,4,6&#8208;collidine as monomer to produce a series of highly crystalline olefin&#8208;linked COFs by a melt polymerization method. This method enables the kilogram&#8208;scale fabrication of self&#8208;shaped monolithic robust foams. The afforded COFs possess extremely low cost (&lt;50&#8197;USD/kg), superior to all the reported COFs. Furthermore, using one&#8208;pot or post&#8208;modification methods can conveniently transform neutral COFs to ionic COFs, which can be applied as highly efficient ion&#8208;exchange sorbents for scavenging oxoanion pollutants. Remarkably, the superior adsorption capacity of a model oxoanion (ReO4&#8722;) is the highest among crystalline porous materials reported so far. This work not only expands the scopes of olefin&#8208;linked COFs but also enlightens the route for the industrial production of crystalline ion exchange sorbents.

         <title>Precisely Tailoring Heterometallic Polyoxotitanium Clusters for the Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterometallic cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster is prepared by incorporating Fe species into a polyoxotitanium cluster. The cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster enables both C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photogenerated holes and further reactions by singlet oxygen. As a result Ti4Fe1 has higher activity and selectivity in the photocatalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons than the Fe&#8208;doped Ti3Fe1 cluster.







Abstract
Photocatalysis is a promising yet challenging approach for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to valuable oxygenated chemicals with O2 under mild conditions. In this work, we report an atomically precise material model to address this challenge. The key to our solution is the rational incorporation of Fe species into polyoxotitanium cluster to form a heterometallic Ti4Fe1 cocrystal. This newly designed cocrystal cluster, which well governs the energy and charge transfer as evidenced by spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations, enables the synergistic process involving C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photogenerated holes and further reactions by singlet oxygen (1O2). Remarkably, the cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster achieves efficient and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons (C5 to C16) into aldehydes and ketones with a conversion rate up to 12&#8201;860&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 5 times higher than that of Fe&#8208;doped Ti3Fe1 cluster. This work provides insights into photocatalyst design at atomic level enabling synergistic catalysis.

         <title>2D Hexagonal Assemblies of Amphiphilic Double&#8208;Helical Poly(phenylacetylene) Homopolymers with Enhanced Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique assembly strategy has been developed to generate free&#8208;standing two&#8208;dimensional chiral nanomaterials based on amphiphilic poly(phenylacetylene) homopolymers, which bear hydrophobic and hydrophilic dendritic side chains and adopt a DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helical conformation. The aggregates form modulable 2D hexagonal nanosheets directly in solution, with enhanced CPL and chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral materials have been attracting immense attentions owing to their unique properties. Herein, we successfully developed a unique assembly strategy of amphiphilic homopolymers to construct stable free&#8208;standing 2D chiral nanosheets in solution. The amphiphilic poly(phenylacetylene) (PPA) homopolymers bearing the hydrophobic and hydrophilic dendritic side chains adopt a DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helical conformation. The regular hexagonal nanosheets were formed in THF/EtOH through nucleation and epitaxial growth. The sizes of the nanosheets can be modulated from nanometers to submillimeters upon varying the ratio of binary solvents, while the thickness is linearly correlated with the molecular weights. The 2D architecture can significantly enhance the CPL of polymers with a high dissymmetry factor &#8776;0.1. Driven by a discrimination of helical conformation, the PPAs can self&#8208;sort into homochiral 2D nanosheets, as directly visualized by using fluorescent microscopy.

         <title>A General Method to Edit Histone H3 Modifications on Chromatin Via Sortase&#8208;Mediated Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sortase&#8208;based method of histone H3 tail editing on chromatin is reported. Histone H3 tail peptides with cell&#8208;penetrating sequence can be metathesized to histone H3 for multivalent modifications on chromatin and influence epigenetics. This described sortase mediated metathesis strategy could be broadly applied to edit endogenous proteins in live cells.







Abstract
The post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) on the tail of histone H3 control chromatin structure and influence epigenetics and gene expression. The current chemical methods including unnatural amino acid incorporation and protein splicing enable preparations of the histone with diverse PTMs in cellular contexts, but they are not applicable to edit native chromatin. The manipulation of histone&#8208;modifying enzymes alter the endogenous histone PTMs but the lack of specificity of most histone&#8208;modifying enzymes prevents precise control of specific H3 tail PTM patterns. Here we report a new method to edit the N&#8208;tail of histone H3 via sortase mediated metathesis (SMM). The sortase can install desired PTM patterns into histone H3 on nucleosomes in vitro and in cellulo. This study expands the application scope of sortase from ligation to metathesis in live cells using cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs).

     alt="A General Method to Edit Histone H3 Modifications on Chromatin Via Sortase-Mediated Metathesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sortase-based method of histone H3 tail editing on chromatin is reported. Histone H3 tail peptides with cell-penetrating sequence can be metathesized to histone H3 for multivalent modifications on chromatin and influence epigenetics. This described sortase mediated metathesis strategy could be broadly applied to edit endogenous proteins in live cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post-translational modifications (PTMs) on the tail of histone H3 control chromatin structure and influence epigenetics and gene expression. The current chemical methods including unnatural amino acid incorporation and protein splicing enable preparations of the histone with diverse PTMs in cellular contexts, but they are not applicable to edit native chromatin. The manipulation of histone-modifying enzymes alter the endogenous histone PTMs but the lack of specificity of most histone-modifying enzymes prevents precise control of specific H3 tail PTM patterns. Here we report a new method to edit the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-tail of histone H3 via sortase mediated metathesis (SMM). The sortase can install desired PTM patterns into histone H3 on nucleosomes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in cellulo&lt;/i&gt;. This study expands the application scope of sortase from ligation to metathesis in live cells using cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). In addition, it offers a strategy to edit PTMs of cellular histone H3 with potential for the development of precise epigenome editing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An RNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Structure within the ADAR 5&#8242;UTR Interacts with DHX36 Helicase to Regulate Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4) structure was identified in the 5&#8242;UTR of the ADAR1 mRNA using multi&#8208;disciplinary assays in vitro and cells. The binding and resolving effect of rG4&#8208;specific helicase DHX36 on this rG4 was monitored using G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;triggered fluorogenic hybridization (GTFH) probe. Functionally, ADAR1 5&#8242;UTR rG4 inhibits reporter gene and native transcript translation with DHX36 modulating its formation in cells.







Abstract
RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4) structures in the 5&#8242; untranslated region (5&#8242;UTR) play crucial roles in fundamental cellular processes. ADAR is an important enzyme that binds to double&#8208;strand RNA and accounts for the conversion of Adenosine to Inosine in RNA editing. However, so far there is no report on the formation and regulatory role of rG4 on ADAR expression. Here, we identify and characterize a thermostable rG4 structure within the 5&#8242;UTR of the ADAR1 mRNA and demonstrate its formation and inhibitory role on translation in reporter gene and native gene constructs. We reveal rG4&#8208;specific helicase DHX36 interacts with this rG4 in vitro and in cells under knockdown and knockout conditions by GTFH (G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;triggered fluorogenic hybridization) probes and modulates translation in an rG4&#8208;dependent manner. Our results further substantiate the rG4 structure&#8208;DHX36 protein interaction in cells and highlight rG4 to be a key player in controlling ADAR1 translation.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Triggered Synthetic Nanopore for Controlling Molecular Transport Across Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic light&#8208;gated nanopore controls transport of molecules across bilayer membranes. The pore self&#8208;assembles from seven DNA strands including one lid strand carrying light&#8208;switchable azobenzene chromophores. The gated pore may be used for research, biosensing, and targeted drug release.







Abstract
Controlling biological molecular processes with light is of interest in biological research and biomedicine, as light allows precise and selective activation in a non&#8208;invasive and non&#8208;toxic manner. A molecular process benefitting from light control is the transport of cargo across biological membranes, which is conventionally achieved by membrane&#8208;puncturing barrel&#8208;shaped nanopores. Yet, there is also considerable gain in constructing more complex gated pores. Here, we pioneer a synthetic light&#8208;gated nanostructure which regulates transport across membranes via a controllable lid. The light&#8208;triggered nanopore is self&#8208;assembled from six pore&#8208;forming DNA strands and a lid strand carrying light&#8208;switchable azobenzene molecules. Exposure to light opens the pore to allow small&#8208;molecule transport across membranes. Our light&#8208;triggered pore advances biomimetic chemistry and DNA nanotechnology and may be used in biotechnology, biosensing, targeted drug release, or synthetic cells.

         <title>Revealing the High Salt Concentration Manipulated Evolution Mechanism on the Lithium Anode in Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical processes at the Li anode/electrolyte interface are disclosed in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with high salt concentration via in&#8208;situ atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy. The 3D morphology, local mechanics, and ion conductivity of the on&#8208;site formed solid electrolyte interphase are in&#8208;situ measured and analyzed to reveal the regulation effect of high salt concentration on interfacial electrochemistry.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are promising candidates of energy storage devices. Both adjusting salt/solvent ratio and applying quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes are regarded as effective strategies to improve the lithium (Li) anode performance. However, reaction mechanisms and interfacial properties in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur (QSSLS) batteries with high salt concentration are not clear. Here we utilize in&#8208;situ characterizations and molecular dynamics simulations to unravel aforesaid mysteries, and construct relationships of electrolyte structure, interfacial behaviour and performance. The generation mechanism, formation process, and mechanical/chemical/electrochemical properties of the anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are deeply explored. Li deposition uniformity and dissolution reversibility are further tuned by the sustainable SEI. These straightforward evidences and deepgoing studies would guide the electrolyte design and interfacial engineering of QSSLS batteries.

         <title>Biocatalytic Thionation of Epoxides for Enantioselective Synthesis of Thiiranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic thionation method is presented for the enantioselective synthesis of thiiranes from epoxides by a halohydrin dehalogenase catalyzed kinetic resolution approach using thiocyanate as a sulfur donor. Various chiral thiiranes bearing aryl and alkyl substituents were synthesized in good yields and enantioselectivities by using recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing the engineered halohydrin dehalogenase HHDHapb variants.







Abstract
Expanding the enzymatic toolbox for the green synthesis of valuable molecules is still of high interest in synthetic chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry. Chiral thiiranes are valuable sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, but relevant methods for their enantioselective synthesis are limited. Herein, we report a biocatalytic thionation strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of thiiranes, which was developed based on the halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with thiocyanate and a subsequent nonenzymatic rearrangement process. A novel HHDH was identified and engineered for enantioselective biocatalytic thionation of various aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted epoxides on a preparative scale, affording the corresponding thiiranes in up to 43&#8201;% isolated yield and 98&#8201;% ee. Large&#8208;scale synthesis and useful transformations of chiral thiiranes were also performed to demonstrate the utility and scalability of the biocatalytic thionation strategy.

         <title>Thiamyxins: Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxobacterial RNA&#8208;Virus Inhibitors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical structure and absolute stereochemistry of an unprecedented natural product family, the thiamyxins, is presented. These thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;containing cyclic depsipeptides are produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster, whose structure is described herein. The thiamyxins were found to exhibit promising antiviral activity against three different RNA viruses.







Abstract
During our search for novel myxobacterial natural products, we discovered the thiamyxins: thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;rich non&#8208;ribosomal peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids with potent antiviral activity. We isolated four congeners of this unprecedented natural product family with the non&#8208;cyclized thiamyxin&#8197;D fused to a glycerol unit at the C&#8208;terminus. Alongside their structure elucidation, we present a concise biosynthesis model based on biosynthetic gene cluster analysis and isotopically labelled precursor feeding. We report incorporation of a 2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylpent&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acid moiety by a GCN5&#8208;related N&#8208;acetyltransferase&#8208;like decarboxylase domain featuring polyketide synthase. The thiamyxins show potent inhibition of RNA viruses in cell culture models of corona, zika and dengue virus infection. Their potency up to a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 560&#8197;nM combined with milder cytotoxic effects on human cell lines indicate the potential for further development of the thiamyxins.

         <title>An Atom&#8208;Pair Design Strategy for Optimizing the Synergistic Electron Effects of Catalytic Sites in NO Selective Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactant adsorption and surface reactions are two key steps in heterogeneous catalysis but the simultaneous optimization of these two variables remains challenging. These two key steps were optimized concomitantly in a model reaction&#8212;NO selective reduction&#8212;by designing a series of atom&#8208;pair active sites with a strong electronic synergy.







Abstract
Effective adsorption and speedy surface reactions are vital requirements for efficient active sites in catalysis, but it remains challenging to maximize these two functions simultaneously. We present a solution to this issue by designing a series of atom&#8208;pair catalytic sites with tunable electronic interactions. As a case study, NO selective reduction occurring on V1&#8722;W1/TiO2 is chosen. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic electron effect present between the paired atoms enriches high&#8208;energy spin charge around the Fermi level, simultaneously rendering reactant (NH3 or O2) adsorption more effective and subsequent surface reactions speedier as compared with single V or W atom alone, and hence higher reaction rates. This strategy enables us to rationally design a high&#8208;performance V1&#8722;Mo1/TiO2 catalyst with optimized vanadium(IV)&#8208;molybdenum(V) electronic interactions, which has exceptional activity significantly higher than the commercial or reported catalysts.

         <title>Enhanced Acidic Water Oxidation by Dynamic Migration of Oxygen Species at the Ir/Nb2O5&#8722;x Catalyst/Support Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic migration of oxygen species between oxide support and Ir catalyst during OER is uncovered. These migrations not only regulate the in situ Ir catalytic structure towards boosted activity, but also suppress Ir over&#8208;oxidation via oxygen species transference, thereby ensuring overall high performance in PEM water electrolyzer.







Abstract
Catalyst/support interaction plays a vital role in catalysis towards acidic oxygen evolution (OER), and the performance reinforcement is currently interpreted by either strain or electron donation effect. We herein report that these views are insufficient, where the dynamic evolution of the interface under potential bias must be considered. Taking Nb2O5&#8722;x supported iridium (Ir/Nb2O5&#8722;x) as a model catalyst, we uncovered the dynamic migration of oxygen species between IrOx and Nb2O5&#8722;x during OER. Direct spectroscopic evidence combined with theoretical computation suggests these migrations not only regulate the in situ Ir structure towards boosted activity, but also suppress its over&#8208;oxidation via spontaneously delivering excessive oxygen from IrOx to Nb2O5&#8722;x. The optimized Ir/Nb2O5&#8722;x thus demonstrated exceptional performance in scalable water electrolyzers, i.e., only need 1.839&#8197;V to attain 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (surpassing the DOE 2025 target), and no activity decay during a 2000&#8197;h test at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Deaminative Arylation and Alkenyaltion of Aliphatic Tertiary Amines with Aryl and Alkenylboronic Acids via Nitrogen Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and general deaminative arylation and alkenylation of tertiary amines with aryl and alkenylboronic acids is enabled by difluorocarbene under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. This protocol represents a novel reaction mode which succeeded in the construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp2 bonds via an in situ formed nitrogen ylide from tertiary amines (propargyl amines, allyl amines and 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl methane amines) and difluorocarbene with aryl and alkenylboronic acids.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling has significantly advanced C&#8722;C bond formation and has been well recognized in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, materials science and other fields. In this rapid development, cross coupling without transition metal catalyst is a big challenge in this field, and using widely existing tertiary amines as electrophiles to directly couple with boronic acids has great hurdles yet significant application prospects. Herein, we report an efficient and general deaminative arylation and alkenylation of tertiary amines (propargyl amines, allyl amines and 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl methane amines) with ary and alkenylboronic acids enabled by difluorocarbene under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. Preliminary mechanism experiments suggest that in situ formed difluoromethyl quaternary amine salt, nitrogen ylide and tetracoordinate boron species are the key intermediates, the subsequent 1,2&#8208;metallate shift and protodeboronation complete the new coupling reaction.

         <title>Organizing Enzymes on Self&#8208;Assembled Protein Cages for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled protein cages were functionalized to achieve spatial organization of sequential enzymes in living cells, which confer cascade reactions with optimal local concentrations and microenvironment, thereby entailing enhanced biocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Cells use self&#8208;assembled biomaterials such as lipid membranes or proteinaceous shells to coordinate thousands of reactions that simultaneously take place within crowded spaces. However, mimicking such spatial organization for synthetic applications in engineered systems remains a challenge, resulting in inferior catalytic efficiency. In this work, we show that protein cages as an ideal scaffold to organize enzymes to enhance cascade reactions both in vitro and in living cells. We demonstrate that not only enzyme&#8208;enzyme distance but also the improved Km value contribute to the enhanced reaction rate of cascade reactions. Three sequential enzymes for lycopene biosynthesis have been co&#8208;localized on the exterior of the engineered protein cages in Escherichia coli, leading to an 8.5&#8208;fold increase of lycopene production by streamlining metabolic flux towards its biosynthesis. This versatile system offers a powerful tool to achieve enzyme spatial organization for broad applications in biocatalysis.

However, mimicking such spatial organization for synthetic applications in engineered systems remains a challenge, resulting in inferior catalytic efficiency. In this work, we show that protein cages as an ideal scaffold to organize enzymes to enhance cascade reactions both in vitro and in living cells. We demonstrate that not only enzyme-enzyme distance but also the improved &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value contribute to the enhanced reaction rate of cascade reactions. Three sequential enzymes for lycopene biosynthesis have been co-localized on the exterior of the engineered protein cages in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, leading to an 8.5-fold increase of lycopene production by streamlining metabolic flux towards its biosynthesis. This versatile system offers a powerful tool to achieve enzyme spatial organization for broad applications in biocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Selective Charge Transport in Lead&#8208;Free Chiral Perovskites: The Key towards High&#8208;Anisotropy in Circularly&#8208;Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of zero&#8208;dimensional bismuth&#8208;based chiral perovskites has been introduced for the detection of circularly polarized light. The lower dimensional perovskites exhibit high degree of chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity allowing the transport of one type of spin&#8208;half state while blocking the other type resulting in an anisotropic current response of the photodetectors that can be used to detect the polarization state of CPL photons.







Abstract
A pair of zero&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free chiral perovskites is introduced towards the detection of circularly polarized light (CPL). Although spin&#8208;polarized carriers are generated in the perovskites under the CPL, the absorption anisotropy remained low leading to mostly similar density of photogenerated carriers under the two CPLs. Interestingly, due to the intrinsic chirality in the perovskites, they exhibited chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity (CISS) allowing the transport of only one type of spin&#8208;half states. A high anisotropy in photocurrent along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction has therefore appeared resulting in a spin&#8208;dependent photovoltaic effect in vertical heterojunction devices and making them suitable for CPL detection. While a self&#8208;powered CPL detector showed a limited (but one of the highest to date) anisotropy factor of 0.3 due to possible spin&#8208;flips during the transport process, the factor rose to 0.6 under bias prompting extension of the effective spin&#8208;diffusion length.

         <title>Gold(I) Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters for Highly Efficient Ultrapure&#8208;Green Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple gold(I) coordination strategy affords highly efficient narrowband green and blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence with emission quantum yields of ca. 0.9 and considerably shortened lifetimes down to 5.5&#8197;&#956;s. The resultant AuI emitters deliver ultrapure&#8208;green OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.3&#8201;%, alongside diminished roll&#8208;offs as low as 0.8&#8201;% and device lifetimes (LT60) of 1210&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Acceleration of singlet&#8208;triplet intersystem crossings (ISC) is instrumental in bolstering triplet exciton harvesting of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. This work describes a simple gold(I) coordination strategy to enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling of green and blue BN(O)&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters, which results in a notable increase in rate constants of the spectroscopically observed ISC process to 3&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1 with nearly unitary ISC quantum yields. Accordingly, the resultant thermally&#8208;stable AuI emitters attained large values of delayed fluorescence radiative rate constant up to 1.3&#215;105/1.7&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 in THF/PMMA film while preserving narrowband emissions (FWHM=30&#8211;37&#8197;nm) and high emission quantum yields (ca. 0.9). The vapor&#8208;deposited ultrapure&#8208;green OLEDs fabricated with these AuI emitters delivered high luminance of up to 2.53&#215;105&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 as well as external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.3&#8201;% with roll&#8208;offs as low as 0.8&#8201;% and long device lifetimes (LT60) of 1210&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Multiprocessing Quantum Computing through Hyperfine Couplings in Endohedral Fullerene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical derivatives of endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time were used to demonstrate the multiprocessing of quantum computing with different subgroups of energy transitions divided by hyperfine couplings. Cooperatively combining the parallelly calculated results enabled quantum error correction of a D&#8208;J algorithm and multi&#8208;task qubit manipulations of different types of quantum gates.







Abstract
Magnetic molecules have shown great potential in quantum information processing due to the chemical tunablity of their quantum behaviors. Chemical derivatives of endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time and rich energy levels were synthesized and studied to demonstrate the ability of multiprocessing in quantum information using electron magnetic resonance. After initialization of the 12&#8208;levelled spin system, subgroups of spin energy levels coursed by the hyperfine couplings can be selectively manipulated. The cooperatively combining of the parallel calculations enabled quantum error correction, increasing the correct rate by up to 17.82&#8201;%. Also, different subgroups of transitions divided by hyperfine coupling can be treated as independent qubits, and multi&#8208;task quantum computing were realized by performing Z&#8208;gate and X&#8208;gate simultaneously, which accelerates the overall gating speed.

         <title>An Electrocatalytic Model of the Sulfur Reduction Reaction in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic model is proposed to probe the sulfur reduction reaction pathway in working lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries by considering the adsorption free energy of LiS&#8901;, LiS2&#8901;, and LiS3&#8901; radicals as descriptors. With an overall consideration of &#916;G(LiS3&#8901;*), &#916;G(LiS2&#8901;*), and &#916;G(LiS&#8901;*) descriptors, a regional diagram model is constructed to visualize the overpotential and rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is strongly considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems due to its high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the sluggish reduction kinetics from Li2S4 to Li2S during discharge hinders the practical application of Li&#8211;S batteries. Although various electrocatalysts have been proposed to improve the reaction kinetics, the electrocatalytic mechanism is unclear due to the complexity of sulfur reduction reactions (SRR). It is crucial to understand the electrocatalytic mechanism thoroughly for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Herein an electrocatalytic model is constructed to reveal the chemical mechanism of the SRR in Li&#8211;S batteries based on systematical density functional theory calculations, taking heteroatoms&#8208;doped carbon materials as an example. The adsorption energy of LiSy&#8901; (y=1, 2, or 3) radicals is used as a key descriptor to predict the reaction pathway, rate&#8208;determining step, and overpotential. A diagram for designing advanced electrocatalysts is accordingly constructed. This work establishes a theoretical model, which is an intelligent integration for probing the complicated SRR mechanisms and designing advanced electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>The Electronic Origin of the Zeta Potential is Supported by the Redox Mechanism on an Aqueous Dispersion of Exfoliated Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous graphite dispersion was prepared without passivating agents and a minimal amount of functional groups by treating graphite with ammonium hydroxide. This approach has raised the Fermi level above the original value. The negative zeta potential has been revisited and attributed to the electrons accumulated on the material.







Abstract
Herein we have proposed that a redox mechanism can produce surface charges and negative zeta potential on an aqueous graphite dispersion. Graphite was kept in contact with a concentrated ammonia aqueous solution, washed, and exfoliated in water, resulting in a dispersion with lyophobic nature. Ammonia treatment did not provide functional groups or nitrogen doping to graphite. Moreover, this material was washed twice before sonication to remove most hydroxide. Therefore, neither functional groups, nitrogen atoms, nor hydroxide excess is responsible for the zeta potential. Kelvin probe force microscopy has shown that the ammonia&#8208;treated and exfoliated graphite has higher Fermi level than the water&#8208;treated material, indicating that the contact between ammonia and graphite promotes redox reactions that provide electrons to graphite. These electrons raise the Fermi level of graphite and generate the negative zeta potential, consequently, they account for the colloidal stability.

         <title>Identification of Cysteine 270 as a Novel Site for Allosteric Modulators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Papain&#8208;Like Protease
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two allosteric and covalent activators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) were identified to elucidate a novel site, cysteine 270 (C270), which led to the discovery of an endogenous activator and an inhibitor of the protease. This study provides a paradigm for identifying covalent and allosteric sites and offers an opportunity for the development of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro inhibitors.







Abstract
The coronavirus papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) plays an important role in the proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins and the dysregulation of the host immune response, providing a promising therapeutic target. However, the development of inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) PLpro is challenging owing to the restricted S1/S2 sites in the substrate binding pocket. Here we report the discovery of two activators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro and the identification of the unique residue, cysteine 270 (C270), as an allosteric and covalent regulatory site for the activators. This site is also specifically modified by glutathione, resulting in protease activation. Furthermore, a compound was found to allosterically inhibit the protease activity by covalent binding to C270. Together, these results elucidate an unrevealed molecular mechanism for allosteric modulation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro and provid a novel site for allosteric inhibitors design.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Selective Activation of Toll&#8208;Like Receptor 7/8 Agonist Nano&#8208;Immunomodulator Generates Safe Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Responses upon Systemic Administration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the uncontrolled off&#8208;target systemic immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs) of imidazoquinolines after systemic administration, we developed a nano&#8208;immunomodulator (cN@SS&#8208;IMQ) that is inactive until it is selectively metabolized to an active immunostimulant within tumor cells. cN@SS&#8208;IMQ promoted robust immune activation within tumors while limiting extra&#8208;tumoral stimulation, suggesting its promising potential for systemically targeting innate immune tumor stimulators.







Abstract
Agonists of innate pattern recognition receptors such as toll&#8208;like receptors (TLRs) prime adaptive anti&#8208;tumor immunity and hold promise for cancer immunotherapy. However, small&#8208;molecule TLR agonists cause immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs) after systemic administration. Herein, we report a polymeric nano&#8208;immunomodulator (cN@SS&#8208;IMQ) that is inactive until it is selectively metabolized to an active immunostimulant within the tumor. cN@SS&#8208;IMQ was obtained via self&#8208;assembly of a cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys)&#8208;modified amphiphilic copolymeric prodrug. Upon systemic administration, cN@SS&#8208;IMQ preferentially accumulated at tumor sites and responded to high intracellular glutathione levels to release native imidazoquinolines for dendritic cell maturation, thereby enhancing the infiltration of T lymphocytes. Collectively, cN@SS&#8208;IMQ tends to activate the immune system without irAEs, thus suggesting its promising potential for safe systemic targeting delivery.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Acylation of Alkenes by a Single Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction for the difunctionalization of terminal alkenes with an acyl group and a fluoromethyl, alkyl, sulfonyl, or thioether group was developed with acylation at the internal position by using a single photocatalyst. Key to success was a kinetic difference in the reactivity of the radical precursors with the excited photocatalyst, whereby the terminal position was first occupied by the more kinetically favorable radical precursor.







Abstract
A direct strategy for the difunctionalization of alkenes, with acylation occurring at the more substituted alkene position, would be attractive for complex ketone synthesis. We report herein a reaction driven by a single photocatalyst that enables &#945;&#8208;acylation in this way with the introduction of a fluoromethyl, alkyl, sulfonyl or thioether group at the &#946;&#8208;position of the alkene with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity under extremely mild conditions. Crucial to the success of this method are rate differences in the kinetics of radical generation through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) between different radical precursors and the excited photocatalyst (PC*). Thus, the &#946;&#8208;position of the alkene is first occupied by the group derived from the radical precursor that can be generated most readily, and &#945;&#8208;keto acids could be used as an electrophilic reagent for the &#945;&#8208;acylation of alkenes.

         <dc:description>
The edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of a photochemical reaction during the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photomechanical transformation was newly found for a 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine (DSP) single crystal. This is in contrast to the fact that the photochemical reaction generally proceeds homogeneously in molecular crystals.







Abstract
Photomechanical molecular crystals are promising materials for photon&#8208;powered artificial actuators. To interpret the photomechanical responses, the spatiotemporal distribution of photoproducts in crystals could be an important role in addition to molecular structures, molecular packings, illumination conditions, crystal morphology, crystal size, and so on. In this study, we have found that single crystals of 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine show a smooth single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photomechanical expansion, and the photochemical reaction propagates from the edge to the center of the single crystal. We revealed that the surface effect (special reactivity at the crystal surface) in addition to the cooperative effect (the reaction is facilitated by neighboring molecules) is essential for the edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of the photochemical reaction. Our results would provide a foundation for future studies of the photochemical reaction dynamics in photomechanical molecular crystals.

To interpret the photomechanical responses, the spatiotemporal distribution of photoproducts in crystals could be an important role in addition to molecular structures, molecular packings, illumination conditions, crystal morphology, crystal size, and so on. In this study, we have found that single crystals of 2,5-distyrylpyrazine show a smooth single-crystal-to-single-crystal photomechanical expansion, and the photochemical reaction propagates from the edge to the center of the single crystal. We revealed that the surface effect (special reactivity at the crystal surface) in addition to the cooperative effect (the reaction is facilitated by neighboring molecules) is essential for the edge-to-center propagation of the photochemical reaction. Our results would provide a foundation for future studies of the photochemical reaction dynamics in photomechanical molecular crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The photochemical reaction of 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine single crystals was investigated by Daichi Kitagawa, Seiya Kobatake, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202212290). Under uniform illumination conditions, the photochemical reaction starts from the edge of the crystals and propagates to the center. Both surface and cooperative effects are shown to be essential for this edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of the photochemical reaction.

Methanogen&#8211;semiconductor biohybrids drive the sustainable conversion of microplastics into CH4 under illumination, as reported by Shungui Zhou, Yujie Xiong, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202213244). The biotic&#8211;abiotic hybrid system not only addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge of photocatalysis by fully utilizing photogenerated electrons and holes without the need for unsustainable chemical sacrificial quenchers, but also provides clues for a better understanding of the global carbon cycle.

A new generation of solid superbases derived from potassium single atoms is described by You Han, Lin&#8208;Bing Sun, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202215157). The source of basicity is different from conventional basicity originating from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Because of the superbasicity as well as high dispersion and anchoring of the basic sites, the potassium single atoms on graphene exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability in transesterification reactions.

         <title>Photoexcited Enzymes for Asymmetric Csp3&#8722;Csp3 Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of photochemistry with enzyme catalysis offers exciting opportunities to induce new reactivities and to create novel enzymes for reactions other than their native ones. Recently, Hyster and co&#8208;workers demonstrated this for a photoenzymatic asymmetric Csp3&#8722;Csp3 cross&#8208;electrophile coupling, a reactivity previously unknown to enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymes have several advantages over conventional catalysts for organic synthesis. Over the last two decades, much effort has been made to further extend the scope of biocatalytic reactions available to synthetic chemists, particularly by expanding the repertoire of enzymes for abiological transformations. In this regard, exciting new developments in the area of photobiocatalysis enable now the introduction of non&#8208;natural reactivity in enzymes to solve long&#8208;standing synthetic challenges. A recently described example from the Hyster group demonstrates in an unprecedented way how the combination of photochemistry with enzyme catalysis empowers the catalytic asymmetric construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds with high chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in the Presence of Impurities: Influences and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Power plants release CO2 and gaseous impurities into the atmosphere. In recent years, the effect of gaseous impurities on CO2 electrolysis has emerged as an important research topic, with an emphasis placed on understanding the catalytic reaction and developing mitigation strategies to lessen the negative effects of gaseous impurities.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of waste CO2 into useful fuels and chemical products is a promising approach to reduce CO2 emissions; however, several challenges still remain to be addressed. Thus far, most CO2 reduction studies use pure CO2 as the gas reactant, but CO2 emissions typically contain a number of gas impurities, such as nitrogen oxides, oxygen gas, and sulfur oxides. Gas impurities in CO2 can pose a significant obstacle for efficient CO2 electrolysis because they can influence the reaction and catalyst. This Minireview highlights early examples of CO2 reduction studies using mixed&#8208;gas feeds, explores strategies to sustain CO2 reduction in the presence of gas impurities, and discusses their implications for future progress in this emerging field.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Interactions in Diatomic Catalysts Boosting Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diatomic catalysts have attracted much attention, especially in electrochemistry. However, there have been no comprehensive reviews on long&#8208;range interactions (LRIs) between metallic centres. This Minireview introduces the key aspects of LRIs and highlights opportunities for regulating electrocatalytic mechanisms, thus presenting guidelines for the targeted usage of LRIs.







Abstract
The simultaneous presence of two active metal centres in diatomic catalysts (DACs) leads to the occurrence of specific interactions between active sites. Such interactions, referred to as long&#8208;range interactions (LRIs), play an important role in determining the rate and selectivity of a reaction. The optimal combination of metal centres must be determined to achieve the targeted efficiency. To date, various types of DACs have been synthesised and applied in electrochemistry. However, LRIs have not been systematically summarised. Herein, the regulation, mechanism, and electrocatalytic applications of LRIs are comprehensively summarised and discussed. In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of LRIs in DACs are proposed in order to present an overall view and reference for future research.

         <dc:description>
The use of polymeric systems for bioconversion is an efficient and recyclable technology for the future industry due to its zero&#8208;pollution features. This Review focuses on self&#8208;assembled polymeric nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;sized structures and their application as biocatalytic reactors for chemical synthesis, including polymersomes, reverse micelles, polymer emulsions, Pickering emulsions, and static emulsions.







Abstract
Biocatalysis is increasingly being explored for the sustainable development of green industry. Though enzymes show great industrial potential with their high efficiency, specificity, and selectivity, they suffer from poor usability and stability under abiological conditions. To solve these problems, researchers have fabricated nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;sized biocatalytic reactors based on the self&#8208;assembly of various polymers, leading to highly stable, functional, and reusable biocatalytic systems. This Review highlights recent progress in self&#8208;assembled polymeric nano&#8208; and microreactors for biocatalytic synthesis, including polymersomes, reverse micelles, polymer emulsions, Pickering emulsions, and static emulsions. We categorize these reactors into monophasic and biphasic systems and discuss their structural characteristics and latest successes with representative examples. We also consider the challenges and potential solutions associated with the future development of this field.

The fundamental physical and electrochemical properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are scrutinized with particular attention paid to the similarity and difference between Mg&#8208;ion and the popular Li&#8208;ion based electrolytes. The Review was written with the intention of accelerating the development of sustainable and high&#8208;performance battery technologies.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered as one of the most viable battery chemistries amongst the &#8220;post&#8221; lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) technologies owing to their high volumetric capacity and the natural abundance of their key elements. The fundamental properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are of essence to regulate the overall performance of RMBs. In this Review, the basic electrochemistry of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes batteries is discussed and compared to that of the Li&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes, and a comprehensive overview of the development of different Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes is provided. In addition, the remaining challenges and possible solutions for future research are intensively discussed. The present work is expected to give an impetus to inspire the discovery of key electrolytes and thereby improve the electrochemical performances of RMBs and other related emerging battery technologies.

         <title>Native Amide&#8208;Directed C(sp3)&#8722;H Amidation Enabled by Electron&#8208;Deficient RhIII Catalyst and Electron&#8208;Deficient 2&#8208;Pyridone Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
Direct C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions of native amides can facilitate streamlined synthesis of valuable molecules, but their insufficient directing ability is one of the current severe challenges of the field. Here we report that the combination of an electron&#8208;deficient RhIII catalyst and an electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand shows high catalytic activity for C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation of various native amides.







Abstract
Trivalent group&#8208;9 metal catalysts with a cyclopentadienyl&#8208;type ligand (CpMIII; M=Co, Rh, Ir, Cp=cyclopentadienyl) have been widely used for directed C&#8722;H functionalizations, albeit that their application to challenging C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations suffers from the limitations of the available directing groups. In this report, we describe directed C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation reactions of simple amide substrates with a variety of substituents. The combination of an electron&#8208;deficient CpERh catalyst (CpE=1,3&#8208;bis(ethoxycarbonyl)&#8208;substituted Cp) and an electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand is essential for high reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;Direct C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H functionalization reactions of native amides can facilitate streamlined synthesis of valuable molecules, but their insufficient directing ability is one of the current severe challenges of the field. Here we report that the combination of an electron-deficient Rh&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst and an electron-deficient 2-pyridone ligand shows high catalytic activity for C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H amidation of various native amides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivalent group-9 metal catalysts with a cyclopentadienyl-type ligand (CpM&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;; M=Co, Rh, Ir, Cp=cyclopentadienyl) have been widely used for directed C&#8722;H functionalizations, albeit that their application to challenging C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H functionalizations suffers from the limitations of the available directing groups. In this report, we describe directed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H amidation reactions of simple amide substrates with a variety of substituents. The combination of an electron-deficient Cp&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;Rh catalyst (Cp&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;=1,3-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)-substituted Cp) and an electron-deficient 2-pyridone ligand is essential for high reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereochemistry Controls Dihydrogen Bonding Strengths in Chiral Amine Boranes Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
How the strength of the N&#8722;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#948;&#8722;H&#8722;B interaction and hence the DHB&#8208;driven self&#8208;aggregation of amine&#8208;borane adducts is governed by steric effects has been investigated by comparing the structures and binding enthalpies of various chiral derivatives. For a diastereomeric pair of amine&#8208;boranes prepared from a chiral secondary amine, it is shown that the stereochemistry at the nitrogen atom has a significant influence on the interaction enthalpy.







Abstract
The growing interest in exploiting novel concepts of non&#8208;covalent interactions in catalysts and supramolecular chemistry made us revisit a special kind of hydrogen bonding: the dihydrogen bond (DHB), formed between a classical hydrogen bond donor and a hydridic hydrogen as acceptor. Herein, we investigate how the strength of the N&#8722;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#948;&#8722;H&#8722;B interaction and hence the DHB&#8208;driven self&#8208;aggregation of amine&#8208;borane adducts is governed by steric effects by comparing the structures and binding enthalpies of various chiral derivatives. For a diastereomeric pair of amine&#8208;boranes prepared from a chiral secondary amine, we show that the stereochemistry at the nitrogen has significant influence on the interaction enthalpy. Based on this finding, N&#8208;chiral amine boranes can be envisioned to become interesting building blocks in supramolecular chemistry to fine&#8208;tune the formation dynamics of assemblies.

         <title>Selective Cross&#8208;Ketonization of Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical ketones can be prepared through selective coupling of two structurally distinct carboxylic acids without the need for preactivation of either partner. This photoredox cross&#8208;ketonization strategy exploits differences in the rates of key one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron activation steps using the two reactants.







Abstract
Carboxylic acids are attractive building blocks for synthetic chemistry because they are chemically stable, abundant, and commercially available with substantial structural diversity. The process of combining two carboxylic acids to furnish a ketone is termed ketonization. This is a potentially valuable transformation that has been underutilized in organic synthesis due to the harsh reaction conditions generally required and the lack of selectivity obtained when coupling two distinct carboxylic acids. We report herein a metallaphotoredox strategy that selectively generates unsymmetrical ketones via cross&#8208;ketonization of two structurally dissimilar carboxylic acids. Cross&#8208;selectivity is achieved by exploiting divergent reactivity of differentially substituted acids towards critical one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron processes in the proposed coupling mechanism. This method is broadly applicable to a variety of functionalized carboxylic acids. It can also be applied to acids of similar steric profile by exploiting differences in their relative rates of decarboxylation.

         <title>Observation of an Alternate Charge&#8208;Polarization State in a One&#8208;Dimensional Pt&#8722;Pt&#8722;I Chain Compound with a Bulky Pendant Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and physical properties of a new one&#8208;dimensional (1D) halogen&#8208;bridged dinuclear&#8208;metal complex (MMX&#8208;chain) with a rigid and bulky pendant ligand are reported. The steric hindrance derived from the bulkiness induces a strain in its 1D chain, achieving the first pure electronic state coupled with lattice distortion at ambient condition. The strain effect also appears as a very large linear thermal expansion along the 1D chain.







Abstract
A one&#8208;dimensional&#8197;(1D) halogen&#8208;bridged dinuclear&#8208;metal complex (MMX&#8208;chain) exhibits various electronic states based on a mixed&#8208;valence metal&#8208;dimer system. This report deals with the synthesis and physical properties of a new MMX&#8208;chain with a bulky pendant ligand, Pt2(mcc&#8208;HexCS2)4I (mcc&#8208;HexCS2=trans&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)cyclohexanedithiocarboxylate). The steric hindrance caused by the bulky substituent induces a strain in its 1D chain, achieving at ambient condition the first pure alternate charge&#8208;polarization (ACP) state (&#8722;Pt2+&#8722;Pt3+&#8722;I&#8722;&#8722;Pt3+&#8722;Pt2+&#8722;I&#8722;&#8722;), a kind of spin&#8208;Peierls state, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and its conducting and magnetic properties. The strain effect is also manifested as a very large linear thermal expansion along the chain direction, which is quite different from conventional MMX&#8208;chains without a bulky ligand. The design of low&#8208;dimensional materials with ligand variations is expected to lead to the emergence of new electron&#8211;lattice coupled electronic states.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity to Assemble a Neutral and Terminal Niobium Phosphorus Triple Bond (Nb&#8801;P)</title>

Phosphorus atom transfer from [PCO]&#8722; to the NbIV precursor [(PNP)NbCl2(NtBuAr)] (PNP=N[2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl]2&#8722;; Ar=3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3) resulted in decarbonylation and coupling of the P&#8208;atom to give [(PNPP)NbCl(NtBuAr)]. Reduction by one electron afforded the first neutral and terminal phosphido ligand on Nb, and two electron oxidation reformed the P&#8722;P bond. Computational studies were conducted to understand the mechanism in this set of transformations.







Abstract
Decarbonylation along with P&#8208;atom transfer from the phosphaethynolate anion, PCO&#8722;, to the NbIV complex [(PNP)NbCl2(NtBuAr)] (1) (PNP=N[2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl]2&#8722;; Ar=3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3) results in its coupling with one of the phosphine arms of the pincer ligand to produce a phosphanylidene phosphorane complex [(PNPP)NbCl(NtBuAr)] (2). Reduction of 2 with CoCp*2 cleaves the P&#8722;P bond to form the first neutral and terminal phosphido complex of a group 5 transition metal, namely, [(PNP)Nb&#8801;P(NtBuAr)] (3). Theoretical studies have been used to understand both the coupling of the P&#8208;atom and the reductive cleavage of the P&#8722;P bond. Reaction of 3 with a two&#8208;electron oxidant such as ethylene sulfide results in a diamagnetic sulfido complex having a P&#8722;P coupled ligand, namely [(PNPP)Nb=S(NtBuAr)] (4).

&lt;/sup&gt;BuAr)] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). Reduction of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with CoCp*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cleaves the P&#8722;P bond to form the first neutral and terminal phosphido complex of a group 5 transition metal, namely, [(PNP)Nb&#8801;P(N&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;BuAr)] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). Theoretical studies have been used to understand both the coupling of the P-atom and the reductive cleavage of the P&#8722;P bond. Reaction of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; with a two-electron oxidant such as ethylene sulfide results in a diamagnetic sulfido complex having a P&#8722;P coupled ligand, namely [(PNPP)Nb=S(N&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;BuAr)] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Alkali Metal Antimonide&#8212;A New Approach to Antimony Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic pathway for the formation and isolation of the antimonides MSbH2 (M=alkali metal) is described. Starting from these SbH2&#8722; transfer reagents, the first primary silylstibane (Me3Si)3SiSbH2 was obtained.







Abstract
Alkali metal dihydrogen&#8208;antimonides [M(L)xSbH2], short: alkali metal antimonides (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; 1: L=pmdta; 2: L=crown&#8208;ether), were prepared from stibine and n&#8208;Butyllithium, M(hmds) (hmds=hexamethyldisilazane) or MOtBu, respectively. We developed a generally applicable synthesis route for these compounds and the obtained compounds were examined on their stability depending on the alkali metal and stabilizing additives used, whereby the use of appropriate crown&#8208;ethers allowed their isolation and characterization at room temperature. Moreover, the 1,4&#8208;dioxane adduct [Na(dioxane)xSbH2] was the appropriate starting compound for the synthesis of the first primary silylstibane (Me3Si)3SiSbH2 (3) which was characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy. Reaction of 3 with (Dipp2NacNac)Ga (Dipp2NacNac=HC{C(Me)N(Dipp)}2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) resulted in the formation of (Dipp2NacNac)GaH(SbHSi(SiMe3)3) (4) which was furthermore characterized by single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Bifunctional Europium for Operando Catalyst Thermometry in an Exothermic Chemical Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature determines the reaction kinetics, thermodynamics and catalyst stability. However, very limited information is known about the local catalyst temperature. Here, operando thermometry over bifunctional Eu3+ is performed to study the interplay between reaction conditions and the catalyst temperature dynamics in the exothermic methane oxychlorination reaction.







Abstract
Often the reactor or the reaction medium temperature is reported in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, even though it could vary significantly from the reactive catalyst temperature. The influence of the catalyst temperature on the catalytic performance and vice versa is therefore not always accurately known. We here apply EuOCl as both solid catalyst and thermometer, allowing for operando temperature determination. The interplay between reaction conditions and the catalyst temperature dynamics is studied. A maximum temperature difference between the catalyst and oven of +16&#8201;&#176;C was observed due to the exothermicity of the methane oxychlorination reaction. Heat dissipation by radiation appears dominating compared to convection in this set&#8208;up, explaining the observed uniform catalyst bed temperature. Application of operando catalyst thermometry could provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of catalyst performances and allow for safer process operation in chemical industries.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Devices Enabled by a Polyfullerene Electron Transporting Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyfullerene material (PFBS&#8208;C12) is developed that can work efficiently as the electron transporting material of p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs). PFBS&#8208;C12 retains the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits of conventional fullerene molecules, and shows suppressed aggregation and more conformal coverage on perovskites compared to PCBM. As a result, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs based on PFBS&#8208;C12 realize a high efficiency of 23.2&#8201;% with good device stability.







Abstract
Electron transporting materials (ETMs) play vital roles in determining the efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells. The widely used PCBM is prone to undesirable aggregation and migration in a cell, thus impairing device stability. In this work, we develop a new type of ETMs by polymerizing C60 fullerene with an aromantic linker unit. The resultant polyfullerene (PFBS&#8208;C12) not only maintains the good optoelectronic properties of fullerenes, but also can address the aforementioned aggregation problem of PCBM. The polyfullerene&#8208;based blade&#8208;coated cells exhibit a high efficiency of 23.2&#8201;% and good device stability that maintain 96&#8201;% of initial efficiency after &gt;1300&#8208;hour light soaking. An aperture efficiency of 18.9&#8201;% is also achieved on a 53.6&#8208;cm2 perovskite mini&#8208;module. This work provides a new strategy for designing ETMs that retain the key figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits of conventional fullerene molecules and enable more stable perovskite solar devices simultaneously.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Hybrid Functional Fluoropolymers Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free controlled radical copolymerization of trifluorovinyl boronic ester and vinyl esters has been established, enabling the on&#8208;demand synthesis of main&#8208;chain hybrid functional polymers driven by light. This work furnishes a facile and versatile strategy to tailor F/B&#8208;incorporated polymers, which facilitates chain&#8208;extensions, post modifications to unprecedented polymers, and allows innovations of copolymer electrolytes.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;controlled polymerizations are attractive to tailor macromolecules of complex compositions with spatiotemporal regulation. In this work, with a convenient synthesis for trifluorovinyl boronic ester (TFVB), we report a light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed copolymerization of vinyl monomers and TFVB for the first time, which enabled the controlled synthesis of a variety of hybrid fluorine/boron polymers with low dispersities and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. The good behaviors of &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switch, chain&#8208;extension polymerizations and post&#8208;modifications further highlight the versatility and reliability of this copolymerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of fluorine and boron could furnish copolymer electrolytes of high lithium&#8208;ion transference number (up to 0.83), bringing new opportunities of engineering high&#8208;performance materials for energy storage purposes.

         <title>A Sulfoxide Reagent for One&#8208;Pot, Three&#8208;Component Syntheses of Sulfoxides and Sulfinamides

Upon Grignard reactions, a simple sulfoxide reagent allows the formation of sulfenate anions that are subsequently transformed into sulfoxides and sulfinamides. This one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component method does not require substrates with preinstalled sulfur functional groups.







Abstract
Sulfoxides and sulfinamides represent versatile sulfur functional groups found in ligands, chiral auxiliaries, and bioactive molecules. Canonical two&#8208;component syntheses, however, rely on substrates with a preinstalled C&#8722;S bond and impede efficient and modular access to these sulfur motifs. Herein is presented the application of an easily prepared, bench&#8208;stable sulfoxide reagent for one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component syntheses of sulfoxides and sulfinamides. The sulfoxide reagent donates the SO unit upon the reaction with a Grignard reagent (RMgX) as a sulfenate anion (RSO&#8722;). While subsequent trapping reactions of this key intermediate with carbon electrophiles provide sulfoxides, a range of tertiary, secondary, and primary sulfinamides can be prepared by substitution reactions with electrophilic amines. The syntheses of sulfinamide analogs of amide&#8208; and sulfonamide&#8208;containing drugs illustrate the utility of the method for the rapid preparation of medicinally relevant molecules.

         <title>Broadband Photoresponses from Ultraviolet to Near&#8208;Infrared (II) Region through Light&#8208;induced Pyroelectric Effects in a Hybrid Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realize broadband photoresponses covering UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;II (266&#8211;1950&#8197;nm) spectral region through light&#8208;induced pyroelectric effect in a hybrid perovskite, which breaks the limitation of intrinsic optical band gap and provides a feasible way toward assembling broadband high&#8208;performance devices.







Abstract
Broadband photodetection has shown a great promise for diverse applications, while the realization of plateau photoresponse from ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region is very challenging. Herein, we exploit photoexcited pyroelectric effect in a chiral hybrid perovskite, (N, N&#8208;dimethylcyclohexylammonium)PbBr3 (1), serving as a new pathway to drive broadband photoactivities. It is a room&#8208;temperature pyroelectric with large polarization of &#8776;6.4&#8197;&#956;C cm&#8722;2 and high pyroelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits (FV=1.0&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201; &#956;C&#8722;1 and FD=7.1&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;Pa&#8722;1/2). Strikingly, light&#8208;induced pyroelectric effect arising from spontaneous polarization is observed in 1, which cover UV (266&#8197;nm) to NIR&#8208;II (1950&#8197;nm) full spectral region. The broadband photoresponses actualized by pyroelectricity break the limit of optical band gap. As the first demonstration of photo&#8208;pyroelectricity covering UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR spectral region in hybrid perovskites, this work paves a pathway to assemble high&#8208;performance smart devices.

         <title>Four&#8208;Component Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Functionalized Azetidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement/strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven anion relay sequence and its application to the modular synthesis of substituted azetidines is described. Three electrophilic coupling partners, whose identities can be individually varied, were added sequentially to the highly strained fragment azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;lithium to access a diverse compound library.







Abstract
Despite the favorable properties that azetidine rings can engender on drug&#8208;compounds, methods for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of azetidine&#8208;based structures are significantly underdeveloped. Herein, we report the successful realization of a multicomponent [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement/strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven anion relay sequence and its application to the modular synthesis of substituted azetidines. The rapidity of the reaction, as confirmed by in situ infra&#8208;red spectroscopy, leverages the strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane to drive the equilibrium of the Brook rearrangement. The three electrophilic coupling partners, added sequentially to azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;lithium, could be individually varied to access a diverse compound library. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated in a 4&#8208;step synthesis of the EP2 receptor antagonist PF&#8208;04418948.

         <title>Superior Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Activation with Dimethyl Ether</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid dimethyl ether is shown to be a potent activating solvent for MOFs. The combination of low surface tension, high volatility, and coordinating ability allows efficient activation of even MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated sites. The broad applicability of the technique is demonstrated, and the level of activation achievable compares very favorably against existing activation protocols.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are demonstrated to be readily activated by treatment with the low surface tension, low boiling point solvent dimethyl ether (DME). The mildness of the method enables access to high surface areas by avoiding structural changes in the framework that often plague thermal activation methods. A distinction from previous methods is that DME activation succeeds for materials with coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) and non&#8208;CUS MOFs as well. DME displaces solvent molecules occupying the pores of the MOF as well as those coordinated to metal centers; reducing evacuation temperature by using a coordinating, yet highly volatile guest enables low temperature activation with structural retention as demonstrated surface area measurements that match or exceed existing activation protocols.

         <title>Access to N&#8722;CF3 Formamides by Reduction of N&#8722;CF3 Carbamoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthetic access to N&#8208;trifluoromethylated formamides is reported. The method involves the reduction of bench&#8208;stable N&#8722;CF3 carbamoyl fluorides. In contrast to e.g. N&#8722;Me formamides, the newly made N&#8722;CF3 formamides do not show rotamers at room temperature. Moreover, they are highly robust and compatible with diverse chemical transformations.







Abstract
The departure into unknown chemical space is essential for the discovery of new properties and function. We herein report the first synthetic access to N&#8208;trifluoromethylated formamides. The method involves the reduction of bench&#8208;stable NCF3 carbamoyl fluorides and is characterized by operational simplicity and mildness, tolerating a broad range of functional groups as well as stereocenters. The newly made N&#8722;CF3 formamide motif proved to be highly robust and compatible with diverse chemical transformations, underscoring its potential as building block in complex functional molecules.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Ru(bda) Coordination Oligomers as Efficient Catalysts for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble Ru(bda) coordination oligomers with varying lengths are investigated in visible light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalysis. The excellent performance and stability of longer oligomers in pure water is rationalized by the very high local concentrations of active sites in self&#8208;assembled superstructures.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble multinuclear complexes based on ruthenium 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate (bda) and ditopic bipyridine linker units are investigated in three&#8208;component visible light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalysis. Systematic studies revealed a strong enhancement of the catalytic efficiency in the absence of organic co&#8208;solvents and with increasing oligomer length. In&#8208;depth kinetic and morphological investigations suggest that the enhanced performance is induced by the self&#8208;assembly of linear Ru(bda) oligomers into aggregated superstructures. The obtained turnover frequencies (up to 14.9&#8197;s&#8722;1) and turnover numbers (more than 1000) per ruthenium center are the highest reported so far for Ru(bda)&#8208;based photocatalytic water oxidation systems.

         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of branched allylic phosphine compounds under mild conditions is reported. Products bearing various functional groups can be synthesized with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99.9&#8201;% ee) and regioselectivity. The employment of phosphine sulfides with relatively low deactivation capacity against metal catalysts is crucial for the success of this reaction.

         <title>Conversion of a AuI Fluorido Complex into an N&#8208;Fluoroamido Derivative: N&#8722;F versus Au&#8722;N Reactivity</title>

The formation of a fluoroamido complex was achieved on reaction of [Au(F)(SPhos)] with NFSI. Reactivity studies revealed the insertion of CO into the N&#8722;F bond. The transfer of the fluoroamido group onto organic molecules was also accomplished.







Abstract
The AuI complex [Au{N(F)SO2Ph}(SPhos)] (SPhos=dicyclohexyl(2&#8242;,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphane) (2) bearing a fluoroamido ligand has been synthesized by reaction of the fluorido complex [Au(F)(SPhos)] (1) with NFSI (NFSI=N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide). A reaction with CO resulted in an unprecedented insertion into the N&#8722;F bond at 2. With the carbene precursor N2CH(CO2Et) N&#8722;F bond cleavage gave the Au&#8722;F bond insertion product [Au{CHF(CO2C2H5)}(SPhos)] (7). The presence of CNtBu led to Au&#8722;N cleavage at 2 and concomitant amide formation to give the cationic complex [Au(CNtBu)(SPhos)][N(F)SO2Ph)] (5), which reacted further to give FtBu as well as the cyanido complex [Au(CN)(SPhos)] (6). These results led to the development of a process for the amination of electrophilic organic substrates by transfer of the fluoroamido group NF(SO2Ph)&#8722;.

A novel boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped calix[4]arene named C&#8208;BN was successfully synthesized through one&#8208;shot double borylation. C&#8208;BN shows a highly centrosymmetric structure with two multiple resonance fragments bridged by tertiary amine groups at the 1,3 positions of the benzene ring. The optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes can exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 24.7&#8211;26.6&#8201;% and small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;max of 25&#8211;28&#8197;nm over a wide doping range of 1&#8211;12&#8197;wt&#8201;%.







Abstract
A novel macrocycle of B/N&#8208;doped calix[4]arene (C&#8208;BN) was synthesized by a one&#8208;shot double boronation. Owing to the structural tension and electron&#8208;donating properties of the nitrogen atoms in the macrocycle, reaction selectively proceeds between the adjacent benzene rings outside the macrocycle. C&#8208;BN shows a highly centrosymmetric structure with two multiple resonance (MR) fragments bridged by tertiary amine groups at the 1,3 positions of the benzene ring. Benefiting from the large intermolecular distance (&gt;4.6&#8197;&#197;) between adjacent MR&#8208;emitting cores, C&#8208;BN also exhibits excellent narrowband emitting features against aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and spectrum broadening. Optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices based on C&#8208;BN exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 24.7&#8211;26.6&#8201;% and small full width at half maximums of 25&#8211;28&#8197;nm over a wide doping range of 1&#8211;12&#8197;wt&#8201;%.

         <title>Highly Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Electrolyte for 4.7&#8197;V Sodium Metal Batteries Enabled by Anion/Cation Solvation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4.7&#8197;V oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte with self&#8208;purifying ability is successfully designed by anion/cation solvation strategy with NaClO4 and TPFS as dual additives. The Na||NVPF battery with such electrolyte could exhibit superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are considered as promising battery system due to abundant Na sources. However, poor compatibility between electrolyte and cathode severely impedes its development. Herein, we proposed an anion/cation solvation strategy for realizing 4.7&#8197;V resistant SMBs electrolyte with NaClO4 and trimethoxy(pentafluorophenyl)silane (TPFS) as dual additives (DA). The ClO4&#8722; can rapidly transfer to the cathode surface and strongly coordinate with Na+ to form stable polymer&#8208;like chains with solvents. Meanwhile, TPFS can preferentially enter into the PF6&#8722; anion solvation sheath for reducing PF6&#8208;solvent interaction and effectively scavenge adverse electrolyte species for protecting electrode electrolyte interphases. Thus, such electrolyte elevates the oxidative stability of carbonate electrolytes from 3.77 to 4.75&#8197;V, and enables Na||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPF) battery with a capacity retention of 93&#8201;% and an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles at 4.7&#8197;V.

&lt;p&gt;A 4.7&#8197;V oxidation-resistant electrolyte with self-purifying ability is successfully designed by anion/cation solvation strategy with NaClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and TPFS as dual additives. The Na||NVPF battery with such electrolyte could exhibit superior electrochemical performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are considered as promising battery system due to abundant Na sources. However, poor compatibility between electrolyte and cathode severely impedes its development. Herein, we proposed an anion/cation solvation strategy for realizing 4.7&#8197;V resistant SMBs electrolyte with NaClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and trimethoxy(pentafluorophenyl)silane (TPFS) as dual additives (DA). The ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can rapidly transfer to the cathode surface and strongly coordinate with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to form stable polymer-like chains with solvents. Meanwhile, TPFS can preferentially enter into the PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion solvation sheath for reducing PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-solvent interaction and effectively scavenge adverse electrolyte species for protecting electrode electrolyte interphases. Thus, such electrolyte elevates the oxidative stability of carbonate electrolytes from 3.77 to 4.75&#8197;V, and enables Na||Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F (NVPF) battery with a capacity retention of 93&#8201;% and an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles at 4.7&#8197;V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Open&#8208;Cage Fullerene as Molecular Container for F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; and I&#8722;</title>

         <dc:description>
Halide anions have been successfully inserted into the cavity of a 19&#8208;membered open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative at 60&#8201;&#176;C for Cl&#8722; and 90&#8201;&#176;C for F&#8722;, Br&#8722; and I&#8722; under atmospheric pressure. The encapsulation ratio is quantitative as shown by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis data and spectroscopic data. The presence of halide ions improves the stability of the cage structure, which could be stored at r.t. for weeks without noticeable change.







Abstract
A 19&#8208;membered open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative was prepared from C60 in 7&#8197;steps and 5.5&#8201;% yield through the peroxide&#8208;mediate pathway. There are four carbonyl groups, an ether oxygen and a quinoxaline moiety on the rim of the orifice. A chloride anion could be inserted into its cavity by heating with hydrochloric acid at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;h. Encapsulation of fluoride, bromide and iodide anions was also achieved at slightly more forcing conditions, 90&#8201;&#176;C for 14&#8197;h. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the sodium salt of the chloride and the bromide encapsulated derivatives were obtained, which showed the halide anion in the center of the cavity and two sodium cations connecting two cages through coordination to the oxygen atoms on the rim of the orifices. The halide encapsulation ratio is quantitative in the isolated products.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalizing specific positions on a saturated alkyl molecule is a key challenge in synthetic chemistry. Herein, a ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent alkylations of alkyl bromides at different positions by Ni&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;electrophile coupling with the second alkyl bromides has been developed. The reaction undergoes site&#8208;selective isomerization on one alkyl bromides in a controlled manner, providing switchable access to diverse alkylated structures at different sites of alkyl bromides. The reaction occurs at three similar positions with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, representing a remarkable ligand tuned reactivity between alkyl&#8208;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling and nickel migration along the hydrocarbon side chain. This reaction offers a catalytic platform to diverse saturated architectures by alkyl&#8208;alkyl bond&#8208;formation from identical starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorogenic Inhibitor of the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inhibitors of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) are valuable tools for studying the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in various pathophysiological conditions. In this study, a new fluorogenic MCU inhibitor, RuOCou, is presented. This compound is an analogue of the known MCU inhibitor Ru265 that contains fluorescent axial coumarin carboxylate ligands. Upon aquation of RuOCou and release of the axial coumarin ligands, a simultaneous increase in its MCU&#8208;inhibitory activity and fluorescence intensity is observed. The fluorescence response of this compound enabled its aquation to be monitored in both HeLa cell lysates and live HeLa cells. This fluorogenic prodrug represents a potential theranostic MCU inhibitor that can be leveraged for the treatment of human diseases related to MCU activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Shot Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Full&#8208;Length H2 Relaxin Disulfide Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical synthesis of insulin superfamily proteins (ISPs) has recently been widely studied to develop next&#8208;generation drugs. Separate synthesis of multiple peptide fragments and tedious chain&#8208;to&#8208;chain folding are usually encountered in these studies, limiting accessibility to ISP derivatives. Here we report the finding that insulin superfamily proteins (e.g. H2 relaxin, insulin itself, and H3 relaxin) incorporating a pre&#8208;made diaminodiacid bridge at A&#8208;B chain terminal disulfide can be easily and rapidly synthesized by a single&#8208;shot automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis and expedient one&#8208;step folding. Our new H2 relaxin analogues exhibit almost identical structures and activities when compared to their natural counterparts. This new synthetic strategy will expediate production of new ISP analogues for pharmaceutical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Confining the Sol&#8208;Gel Reaction at the Water/Oil Interface: Creating Compartmentalized Enzymatic Nano&#8208;Organelles for Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Living organisms compartmentalize their catalytic processes in membranes to increase reaction efficiency and selectivity. To mimic the organelles of eukaryotic cells, here we develop an efficient and safe method for in situ encapsulating enzymes in aqueous&#8208;core mesoporous silica nanocapsules. The key to achieving an in situ encapsulation was to restrict the sol&#8208;gel reaction selectively at the water/oil interface. This was realized by introducing an aminosilane to the silica precursors, which served as both catalyst and an amphiphilic anchor that electrostatically assembly with negatively charged hydrolyzed alkoxysilanes at the interface. The semi&#8208;permeable silica shell protected enzymes from external proteolytic attack, and preserved enzymatic activity by allowing the transport of reactants and products. Finally, the enzyme&#8208;carrying nanocapsules, as synthetic nano&#8208;organelles, were able to successfully perform cascade reactions when enveloped in a polymer vesicle, mimicking the hierarchically compartmentalized reactions of eukaryotic cells. This in situ encapsulation approach provides a versatile platform for the delivery of biomacromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Assisted Halogen Bonding in an Ionic Cavity of a Coordination Cage Based on a Copper(I) Iodide Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of molecular containers capable of selective binding of specific guest molecules presents an interesting synthetic challenge in supramolecular chemistry. Here, we report the synthesis and structure of a coordination cage assembled from Cu3I4&#8211; clusters and tripodal cationic N&#8208;donor ligands. Owing to the localized permanent charges in the ligand core the cage binds iodide anions in specific regions within the cage by ionic interactions. This allows the selective binding of bromomethanes as secondary guest species within cage promoted by halogen bonding, which was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Twisting of Porphyrin by Assembly in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework yielding Chiral Photoconducting Films for Circularly&#8208;Polarized&#8208;Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While materials based on organic molecules have usually either superior optoelectronic or superior chiral properties, the combination of both is scarce. Here, a crystalline chiroptical film based on porphyrin with homochiral side groups is presented. While the dissolved molecule has a planar, thus, achiral porphyrin core, upon assembly in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) film, the porphyrin core is twisted and chiral. The close packing and the crystalline order of the porphyrin cores in the MOF film also results in excellent optoelectronic properties. By exciting the Soret band of porphyrin, efficient photoconduction with a high On&#8208;Off&#8208;ratio is realized. More important, handedness&#8208;dependent circularly&#8208;polarized&#8208;light photoconduction with a dissymmetry factor g of 4.3&#160;&#739;&#160;10&#8208;4 is obtained. We foresee the combination of such assembly&#8208;induced chirality with the rich porphyrin chemistry will enable a plethora of organic materials with exceptional chiral and optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable and Highly Robust Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Polymer&#8208;Based Transparent Films with Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Networks for Erasable Light Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, an efficient polymer&#8208;based organic afterglow system, which shows reversible photochromism, switchable ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP), and prominent water and chemical resistance simultaneously, has been developed for the first time. By doping phenoxazine (PXZ) and 10&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (PXZEt) into epoxy polymers, the resulting PXZ@EP&#8208;0.25% and PXZEt@EP&#8208;0.25% films show unique photoactivated UOP properties, with phosphorescence quantum yields and lifetimes up to 10.8% and 845 ms, respectively. It is found that the steady&#8208;state luminescence and UOP of PXZ@EP&#8208;0.25% are switchable by light irradiation and thermal annealing. Moreover, the doped films can still produce conspicuous UOP after soaking in water, strong acid and base, and organic solvents for more than two weeks, exhibiting outstanding water and chemical resistance. Inspired by these exciting results, the PXZ@EP&#8208;0.25% has been successfully exploited as an erasable transparent film for light printing.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Reporter for in Vivo Imaging of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window holds great promise for in vivo visualization of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) pathology, which can facilitate characterization and deep understanding of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD); however, it has been rarely exploited. Herein, we report the development of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent reporters with a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) architecture for specific detection of A&#946; plaques in AD&#8208;model mice. Among all the designed probes, DMP2 exhibits the highest affinity to A&#946; fibrils and can specifically activate its NIR&#8208;II fluorescence after binding to A&#946; fibrils via suppressed twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effect. With suitable lipophilicity for ideal blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) penetrability and deep&#8208;tissue penetration of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, DMP2 possesses specific detection of A&#946; plaques in in vivo AD&#8208;model mice. Thus, this study presents a potential agent for non&#8208;invasive imaging of A&#946; plaques and deep deciphering of AD progression.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time In Situ Volatile Organic Compound Sensing by a Dual&#8208;Emissive Polynuclear Ln&#8208;MOF with the Pronounced LnIII Luminescence Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) are promising for luminescence detection of volatile organic compound (VOC) vapors, but usually suffer from the silent or quenched Ln3+ emission. Herein, we report a new dual&#8208;emissive Eu&#8208;MOF composed of the coordinatively unsaturated Eu9 clusters that afford abundant open metal sites to form a confined &#8220;binding pocket&#8221; to facilitate the preconcentration and recognition of VOCs. Single&#8208;crystal structural analyses reveal that specific analytes can replace the OH oscillators in the first coordination sphere of Eu3+ and form a unique hydrogen&#8208;bonding second&#8208;sphere adduct tying adjacent Eu9 clusters together to minimize their nonradiative vibrational decay. With the promoted Eu3+ luminescence, the MOF realizes real&#8208;time in situ visual sensing of THF vapor (&lt;1 s) and shows a quantitative ratiometric response to the vapor pressure with a limit of detection down to 17.33 Pa. Also, it represents a top&#8208;performing ratiometric luminescent thermometer.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Alcohols from Alkenes and Water: Directed Evolution of a Styrene Hydratase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective synthesis of chiral alcohols through asymmetric addition of water across an unactivated alkene is a highly sought&#8208;after transformation and a big challenge in catalysis. Here we report the identification and directed evolution of a fatty acid hydratase from&#160;Marinitoga hydrogenitolerans&#160;for highly enantioselective hydration of styrenes yielding chiral 1&#8208;arylethanols. While directed evolution for styrene hydration was performed in the presence of heptanoic acid to mimic fatty acid binding, the engineered enzyme displayed remarkable asymmetric styrene hydration activity in the absence of the small molecule activator.

         <title>Aluminoborates as Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultraviolet (UV) and Deep&#8208;UV (DUV, &#955; &lt; 200 nm) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials play a significant role to convert the wavelength of laser for producing UV/DUV coherent light in the laser industry. The Al [Ne]3s23p1 atom with empty d orbitals can form sp3, sp3d, and sp3d2 hybrid orbitals when bonding with O/F atoms, which leads to the construction of [AlO m F n ] (m + n = 4, 5, 6) units. Therein, aluminoborates have received intensive attention due to the effective structural and functional adjustment effects of the diverse Al&#8208;O/F units. Accordingly, numerous aluminoborates as candidates for the next generation of UV/DUV NLO materials were discovered. In this review, recently discovered aluminoborates are overviewed and analyzed, including their syntheses, crystal structure features, and second&#8208;order NLO performances. We aim to provide the latest progress and outlook on the crystal chemistry of aluminoborates and boost the finding of the next NLO candidates with high performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Selectivity in Shuttle Hetero&#8208;difunctionalization Reactions: Electrochemical Transfer Halo&#8208;thiolation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shuttle catalysis is emerging as a potent strategy to unleash unprecedented synthetic flexibility in organic synthesis. Herein, we disclose a rare example of shuttle hetero&#8208;difunctionalization to transfer two distinct functional groups between &#946;&#8208;halosulfides and alkynes with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity via a paired electrolysis process. This unfolds new opportunities for selective shuttle difunctionalization reactions.







Abstract
Shuttle hetero&#8208;difunctionalization reaction, in which two chemically distinct functional groups are transferred between two molecules, has long been an unmet goal due to the daunting challenges in controlling the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. Herein, we disclose an electrochemistry enabled shuttle reaction (e&#8208;shuttle) to selectively transfer one RS&#8722; and one X&#8722; group between &#946;&#8208;halosulfides and unsaturated hydrocarbons via a consecutive paired electrolysis mechanism. The preferential anodic oxidation of one anion over the other, which is controlled by their distinct redox potentials, plays a pivotal role in controlling the high chemoselectivity of the process. This easily scalable methodology enables the construction of a myriad of densely functionalized &#946;&#8208;halo alkenyl sulfides in unprecedented chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity using benign surrogates, e.g., 2&#8208;bromoethyl sulfide, avoiding the handling of corrosive and oxidative RS&#8211;Br reagents. In a broader context, these results open up new strategies for selective shuttle difunctionalization reactions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution at the quaternary carbon stereocenter of cyclopropyl carbinol derivatives using water, alcohols and phenols as nucleophiles is reported. A variety of highly sterically hindered tertiary alkyl ethers and alcohols with adjacent tertiary carbon stereocenters are obtained in good yields with excellent diastereopurity.







Abstract
An efficient method for the stereoselective construction of tertiary C&#8722;O bonds via a stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution at the quaternary carbon stereocenter of cyclopropyl carbinol derivatives using water, alcohols and phenols as nucleophiles has been developed. This substitution reaction proceeds under mild conditions and tolerates several functional groups, providing a new access to the stereoselective formation of highly congested tertiary homoallyl alcohols and ethers.

         <title>Liquid Fluxional Ga Single Atom Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, we discover the fluxional property of single atom catalysts (SACs) could effectively influence the catalytic performance. Ga SACs was firstly systematically synthesized to be used in efficient electrochemistry CO2 reduction for CO. The Ga SACs with the P, S atomic coordination environment displays specific fluxional properties, showing CO products with FE of &#8776;92&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE in electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Precise design and tuning of the micro&#8208;atomic structure of single atom catalysts (SACs) can help efficiently adapt complex catalytic systems. Herein, we inventively found that when the active center of the main group element gallium (Ga) is downsized to the atomic level, whose characteristic has significant differences from conventional bulk and rigid Ga catalysts. The Ga SACs with a P, S atomic coordination environment display specific flow properties, showing CO products with FE of &#8776;92&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Theoretical simulations demonstrate that the adaptive dynamic transition of Ga optimizes the adsorption energy of the *COOH intermediate and renews the active sites in time, leading to excellent CO2RR selectivity and stability. This liquid single atom catalysts system with dynamic interfaces lays the foundation for future exploration of synthesis and catalysis.

         <title>Ammonia Synthesis at Room Temperature and Atmospheric Pressure from N2: A Boron&#8208;Radical Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;centered radicals, generated by reduction of R2BCl derivatives, react with N2 all the way to borylamine formation. DFT calculations rationalize the reduction/functionalization process, involving N&#8722;N bond splitting. Hydrolysis of the mixture yields NH4+. Radical addition to N2 provides a new strategy for N2 fixation.







Abstract
Ammonia, NH3, is an essential molecule, being part of fertilizers. It is currently synthesized via the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, from the very stable dinitrogen molecule, N2 and dihydrogen, H2. This process requires high temperatures and pressures, thereby generating ca 1.6&#8201;% of the global CO2 emissions. Alternative strategies are needed to realize the functionalization of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions. Here, we show that boron&#8208;centered radicals provide a means of activating N2 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure whilst allowing a radical process to occur, leading to the production of borylamines. Subsequent hydrolysis released NH4+, the acidic form of NH3. EPR spectroscopy supported the intermediacy of radicals in the process, corroborated by DFT calculations, which rationalized the mechanism of the N2 functionalization by R2B radicals.

DFT calculations rationalize the reduction/functionalization process, involving N&#8722;N bond splitting. Hydrolysis of the mixture yields NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Radical addition to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; provides a new strategy for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is an essential molecule, being part of fertilizers. It is currently synthesized via the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, from the very stable dinitrogen molecule, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and dihydrogen, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This process requires high temperatures and pressures, thereby generating &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt; 1.6&#8201;% of the global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Alternative strategies are needed to realize the functionalization of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under mild conditions. Here, we show that boron-centered radicals provide a means of activating N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature and atmospheric pressure whilst allowing a radical process to occur, leading to the production of borylamines. Subsequent hydrolysis released NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the acidic form of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. EPR spectroscopy supported the intermediacy of radicals in the process, corroborated by DFT calculations, which rationalized the mechanism of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; functionalization by R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B radicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dibenzomethanopentacene&#8208;based polymers of intrinsic microporosity for use in gas separation membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dibenzomethanopentacene (DBMP) is shown to be a useful structural component for making Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) with promise for making efficient membranes for gas separations. DBMP&#8208;based monomers for PIMs are readily prepared using a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 2,3&#8208;dimethoxyanthracene and norbornadiene as the key synthetic step. Compared to date for the archetypal PIM&#8208;1, the incorporation of DBMP simultaneously enhances both gas permeability and the ideal selectivity for one gas over another. Hence, both ideal and mixed gas permeability data for DBMP&#8208;rich co&#8208;polymers and an amidoxime modified PIM are close to the current Robeson upper bounds, which define the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, for several important gas pairs. Furthermore, long&#8208;term studies (over ~3 years) reveal that the reduction in gas permeabilities on ageing is less for DBMP&#8208;containing PIMs relative to that for other high performing PIMs, which is an attractive property for the fabrication of membranes for efficient gas separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Dicyclohepta[a,g]heptalene&#8208;Containing Polycyclic Conjugated Hydrocarbon and the Impact of Non&#8208;Alternant Topologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating the non&#8208;hexagonal rings into polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) can significantly affect their electronic and optoelectronic properties and chemical reactivities. Here, we report the first bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a dicyclohepta[a,g]heptalene&#8208;embedded PCH (1) with four continuous heptagons, which are arranged in a &#8220;Z&#8221; shape. Compared with its structural isomer bischrysene 1R with only hexagonal rings, compound 1 presents a distinct antiaromatic character, especially the inner heptalene core possessing clean antiaromatic nature. In addition, PCH 1 exhibits a narrower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)&#8208;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy gap than its benzenoid contrast 1R verified by the experimental measurements and theoretical calculation. Our work reported herein not only provides a new way to synthesize novel PCHs with non&#8208;alternant topologies but also offers the possibility to tune their electronic and optical properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing solution&#8208;processable red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity and efficiency based on multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) is a formidable challenge. Herein, by introducing auxiliary electron donor and acceptor moieties into the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) distributed positions of multiple resonance skeleton simultaneously, an effective strategy to obtain red MR&#8208;TADF emitters was represented. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept molecule BN&#8208;R exhibits a narrowband pure&#8208;red emission at 624 nm, with a high luminous efficiency of 94% and a narrow bandwidth of 46 nm. Notably, the fabricated solution&#8208;processable pure&#8208;red OLED based on BN&#8208;R exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiency over 20% with the Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.663, 0.337) and a long operational lifetime (LT50) of 1088 hours at an initial luminance of 1,000 cd m&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Excitation of Aldehyde to Activate the C(sp2)&#8211;H Bond by Cobaloxime Catalysis toward Fluorenones Synthesis with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Represented herein is a new manner to form fluorenones via direct excitation of substrate instead of photocatalyst to activate sp2 C&#8211;H bond under redox&#8208;neutral condition. Our design relies on the photoexcited triplet state of aromatic aldehyde intermediates with higher reactivity that can be intercepted by cobaloxime catalyst through single electron transfer for following &#946;&#8208;H elimination. The simple generation of acyl radical and successful interception by a metal catalyst cobaloxime avoid the use of both photocatalyst and stoichiometric external oxidants, affording a series of highly substituted fluorenones, even for six&#8208;membered ketones, such as xanthone and thioxanthone derivatives in good to excellent yields, and H2 is as the only byproduct. This catalytic system features the readily available metal catalyst, mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope, in which sunlight reaction and scale&#8208;up experiment by the continuous&#8208;flow approach make the developed methodology sustainable and amenable for potentially operational procedures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes play a key role in biocatalytic energy conversion and storage, e.g., photosynthesis or nitrogen fixation. Here, we report a series of bipyridine&#8208;containing di&#8208; to tetranuclear Ru(bda) macrocycles 2C&#8211;4C (bda: 2,2&#8216;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8216;&#8208;dicarboxylate) to promote the O&#8211;O bond formation. In photocatalytic water oxidation under neutral conditions, all complexes 2C&#8211;4C prevail in a folded conformation that support the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) pathway with remarkable turnover frequencies of up to 15.5 s&#8211;1, per Ru unit respectively. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed an increased tendency for intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and preorganization of the proximal bases close to the active centers for the larger macrocycles. H/D kinetic isotope effect studies and electrochemical data demonstrate the key role of the proximal bipyridines as proton&#8208;acceptors in lowering the activation barrier for the crucial nucleophilic attack of H2O in the WNA mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Significant Enhancement of the Upconversion Emission in Er3+ Highly&#8208;Doped Nanoparticles at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Relatively low efficiency is the bottleneck for the application of lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The high&#8208;level&#8208;doping strategy realized in recent years has not improved the efficiency as much as expected. It is argued that cross relaxation (CR) is not detrimental to upconversion. Here we combine theoretical simulation and spectroscopy to elucidate the role of CR in upconversion process of Er3+ highly doped (HD) UCNPs. It is found that if CR is purposively suppressed, upconversion efficiency can be significantly improved. Specifically, we demonstrate experimentally that inhibition of CR by introducing cryogenic environment (40 K) enhances upconversion emission by more than two orders of magnitude. This work not only elucidates the nature of CR and its non&#8208;negligible adverse effects, but also provides a new perspective for improving upconversion efficiency. The result can be directly applied to cryogenic imaging and wide range temperature sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Stainless Steel&#8208;Like Passivation Inspires Persistent Silicon Anodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passivation of stainless steel by additives forming mass&#8208;transport blocking layers is widely practiced, where Cr element is added into bulk Fe&#8208;C forming the Cr2O3&#8208;rich protective layer. Here we extend the long&#8208;practiced passivation concept to Si anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, incorporating the passivator of LiF/Li2CO3 into bulk Si. The passivation mechanism is studied by various ex situ characterizations, redox peak contour maps, thickness evolution tests, and finite element simulations. The results demonstrate that the passivation can enhance the lithiation of Li2Si and de&#8208;lithiation of Li3.75Si, induce the formation of F&#8208;rich robust solid electrolyte interphase, stabilize the Si/LiF/Li2CO3 composite, and mitigate the volume change of Si anodes upon cycling. The 3D passivated Si anode can fully retain a high capacity of 3701 mAh g&#8208;1 after 1500 cycles and tolerate high rates up to 50 C. This work provides insight into how to construct durable Si anodes through effective passivation.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Azulene&#8208;based 2D Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Organic Memristors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a conjugated and unsymmetric building block composed of an electron&#8208;poor seven&#8208;membered sp2 carbon ring and an electron&#8208;rich five&#8208;membered carbon ring, azulene and its derivatives have been recognized as one of the most promising building blocks for novel electronic devices due to its intrinsic redox activity. By using 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;benzene and azulene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbaldehyde as the starting materials, an azulene(Azu)&#8208;based 2D conjugated covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;Azu, is prepared through liquid&#8208;liquid interface polymerization strategy for the first time. The as&#8208;fabricated Al/COF&#8208;Azu/indium tin oxide (ITO) mem&#8208;ristor shows typical non&#8208;volatile resistive switching performance due to the electric filed induced intramolecular charge transfer effect. Associated with the unique memristive performance, a simple convolutional neural network is built for image recognition. After 8 epochs of training, image recognition accuracy of 80% for a neutral network trained on a larger data set is achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step&#160;In Situ&#160;Polymerization: A Facile Design Strategy for Block Copolymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To optimize the rapid transport of lithium ions (Li+) inside lithium metal batteries (LMBs), block copolymer electrolytes (BCPEs) have been fabricated in situ in LMBs via a one&#8208;step method combining reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and carboxylic acid&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP). The BCPEs balanced the Li+ coordination characteristics of the polyether&#8208; and polyester&#8208;based electrolytes to achieve a rapid Li+ migration in the SPEs. The carboxylic acid played a dual role since it both catalyzed the ROP and stabilized the interface. Furthermore, the in situ assembly of LMBs did effectively enable an efficient intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation of Li+ at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The in situ assembled Li/BCPE4/LFP exhibited high&#8208;capacity retention of 92% after 400 cycles at 1 C. The one&#8208;step in situ fabrication of BCPEs provides a new direction for the design of polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Handedness Inversion and Circularly Polarized Light Reflection Tuning in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Macrocyclic Chiral Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of macrocyclic azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitches have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and characterized. In the molecular structures, binaphthyl is covalently linked to ortho&#8208;positions of azobenzene, and four different substituents are linked to 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions of binaphthyl. The photoswitches show enhanced helical twisting power (HTP) when doping in commercially available achiral liquid crystals to form self&#8208;organized helical superstructures, i.e., cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs). All the photoswitches exhibit reversible photoisomerization driven by visible light of different wavelengths in both organic solvent and liquid crystals. The photoswitches with shorter substituents enable handedness inversion of CLCs upon photoisomerization. These are the first examples of ortho&#8208;linked azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitches that enable handedness inversion in CLCs. The photoswitches with longer substituents display only HTP values decreasing while maintaining the same handedness.</dc:description>

         <title>Olefin Dihydroxylation Using Nitroarenes as Photoresponsive Oxidants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vicinal diols are abundant among natural and synthetic molecules, and also represent valuable intermediates throughout organic synthesis. Olefin dihydroxylation is an effective strategy to access these derivatives owing to the broad range and availability of alkene feedstocks. OsO4 is the among most used reagents to achieve this transformation, yet its high toxicity and cost remain concerning. Herein, we present a mechanistically distinct strategy for olefin dihydroxylation using nitroarenes as photoresponsive oxidants. Upon purple LED irradiation, these species undergo a [3+2]&#8208;photocycloaddition with a wide range of olefins to give a stable 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine intermediate. This species can be accumulated in solution and then reduced in situ to the desired diols, utilising readily accessible and easy to handle solid reagents as H2 surrogates.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Vinylphosphonates and Diarylvinylphosphine Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted ethylphosphonate and ethylphosphine oxide compounds are widely used in drugs, pesticides, and ligands. However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis is still rare. Of the only asymmetric hydrogenation methods available at present, all cases use rare metal catalysts. Herein, we report an efficient earth&#8208;abundant transition&#8208;metal nickel catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation affording the corresponding chiral ethylphosphine products with up to 99% yield, 96% ee (enantiomeric excess) (99% ee, after recrystallization) and 1000 S/C (substrate/catalyst); this is also the first study on the asymmetric hydrogenation of terminal olefins using a nickel catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere. The catalytic mechanism was investigated via deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments and calculations which indicate that the two added hydrogen atoms of the products come from hydrogen gas. Additionally, it is believed that the reaction involves a Ni(II) rather than Ni(0) cyclic process based on the weak attractive interactions between the Ni catalyst and terminal olefin substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Nature of Zinc in Copper&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Zirconium Catalysts by Operando Spectroscopies for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active Zn species in Cu&#8208;based methanol synthesis catalysts have not been clearly identified yet due to their complex nature and dynamic structural changes during reactions. Herein, atomically dispersed Zn on ZrO2 support is established in Cu&#8208;based catalysts by separating Zn and Zr components from Cu (Cu&#8208;ZnZr) via the double&#8208;nozzle flame spray pyrolysis (DFSP) method. It exhibits superiority in methanol selectivity and yield compared to those with Cu&#8208;ZnO interface and isolated ZnO nanoparticles. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the atomically dispersed Zn species are induced during the reaction due to the strengthened Zn&#8208;Zr interaction. They can suppress formate decomposition to CO and decrease the H2 dissociation energy, shifting the reaction to methanol production. This work enlightens the rational design of unique Zn species by regulating coordination environments and offers a new perspective for exploring complex interactions in multi&#8208;component catalysts.</dc:description>

This work enlightens the rational design of unique Zn species by regulating coordination environments and offers a new perspective for exploring complex interactions in multi-component catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stable Solid Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Battery with Electronically Conductive Fillers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic conduction in solid&#8208;polymer electrolytes is generally not desired, which causes leakage of electrons or energy loss, and the electronically conductive domains at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces can lead to continuous decomposition of electrolytes and shorting issues. However, it is noticed in this work that in an insulating matrix, the conductive domains at certain aspects could also have positive effects on the electrolyte performance with proper control. This work evaluates the limitation and benefits of electronically conductive domains in a solid&#8208;polymer electrolyte system and discusses the approach to improve the electrolyte physicochemical properties with densified local electric field distribution, enhanced bulk dielectric property, and charge transfer. By deliberately introducing the conductive domains in a regular solid&#8208;polymer electrolyte, stable cycle life, low overpotential, and promising full cell performance could be achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Achievements, Challenges, and Perspectives on Nitrogen Electrochemistry for Carbon&#8208;Neutral Energy Technologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unrestrained anthropogenic activities have severely disrupted the global natural nitrogen cycle, causing numerous energy and environmental issues. Electrocatalytic nitrogen transformation is a feasible and promising strategy for achieving a sustainable circular nitrogen economy. These processes can realize renewable energy storage and conversion, restore the global nitrogen balance, and remediate environmental crises via multiple reactions. Here, the minireview integrates three essential nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds (i.e., N2, NH3, and NO3&#8211;) and four feasible electrochemical reactions, including the nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR), nitrogen oxidation reaction (N2OR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), and ammonia oxidation reaction (NH3OR). We provide a concise perspective on an artificial nitrogen cycle through these clean electrochemical reactions. Additionally, this minireview highlights the underlying mechanistic relationships between different nitrogen reactions, demonstrating fundamental connections to the associated clean energy technologies and a sustainable nitrogen&#8208;based economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Bioassay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay is developed here which allows imaging and direct quantification of single biomolecules. Imaging single biomolecules is realized by localizing the electrochemiluminescence events of the labeled molecules. Such an imaging system allows mapping the spatial distribution of biomolecules with electrochemiluminescence and contains quantitative single&#8208;molecule insights. We further quantify biomolecules by spatiotemporally merging the repeated reactions at one molecule site and then counting the clustered molecules. The proposed single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay is used to detect carcinoembryonic antigen, showing a limit of detection of 67 attomole&#160;concentration which is 10, 000 times better than conventional electrochemiluminescence bioassays. This spatial resolution and sensitivity enable single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence bioassay a new toolbox for both specific bioimaging and ultrasensitive quantitative analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Delocalized Mixed&#8208;Valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 Complex: Strong Cu&#8208;Cu Interaction and Fast Electron Self&#8208;Exchange Rate Despite Large Structural Changes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A flexible macrocyclic ligand with two tridentate {CNC} compartments can host two Cu ions in reversibly interconvertible states, CuICuI (1) and mixed&#8208;valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 (2). They were characterized by XRD and multiple spectroscopic methods, including EPR, UV&#8208;Vis absorption and MCD, in combination with TD&#8208;DFT and CASSCF calculations. 2 features a short Cu&#8943;Cu distance (~2.5 &#197;; compared to ~4.0 &#197; in 1) and a very high delocalization energy of 13000 cm&#8208;1, comparable to the mixed&#8208;valent state of the biological CuA site. Electron self&#8208;exchange between 1 and 2 is rapid despite large structural reorganization, and is proposed to proceed via a sequential mechanism involving an active conformer of 1, viz. 1&#8217;; the latter has been characterized by XRD. Such electron transfer (ET) process is reminiscent of the conformationally gated ET proposed for biological systems. This redox couple is a unique pair of flexible dicopper complexes, achieving fast electron self&#8208;exchange closely related to the function of the CuA site.</dc:description>

         <title>Superlattice&#8208;based Plasmonic Catalysis: Concentrating Light at the Nanoscale to Drive Efficient Nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Fixation at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmonic catalysis promises green ammonia synthesis but is limited by the need of co&#8208;catalysts and poor performances due to weak electromagnetic field enhancement. Here, we use two&#8208;dimensional plasmonic superlattices with dense electromagnetic hotspots to boost ambient nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia photoconversion without needing co&#8208;catalyst. By organizing Ag octahedra into a square superlattice to concentrate light, the ammonia formation is enhanced by ~15&#8208;fold and 4&#8208;fold over hexagonal superlattice and disorganized array, respectively. Our unique catalyst achieves superior ammonia formation rate and apparent quantum yield up to ~15&#8208;fold and ~103&#8208;fold, respectively, better than traditional designs. Mechanistic investigations reveal the abundance of intense plasmonic hotspots is crucial to promote hot electron generation and transfer for nitrogen reduction. Our work offers valuable insights to design electromagnetically hot plasmonic catalysts for diverse chemical and energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Data&#8208;driven Machine Learning for Understanding Surface Structures of Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of heterogeneous catalysts is necessarily surface&#8208;focused, generally achieved via adsorption energy and microkinetic modelling. A prerequisite is to ensure the adsorption energy is physically meaningful is the stable existence of the conceived active&#8208;site structure on the surface. The development of improved understanding of the catalyst surface however is practically challenging because of the complex nature of dynamic surface formation and evolution under in&#8208;situ reactions. We propose therefore data&#8208;driven machine&#8208;learning (ML) approaches as a solution. In this minireview we summarize recent progress in using machine&#8208;learning to search&#8208;out and predict (meta)stable structures, assist operando simulation under reaction conditions and micro&#8208;environments and, identify and critically analyze experimental characterization data. We conclude that ML will become the new norm to lower costs associated with discovery and benefit researchers in optimal design of heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3&#8208;Substituted 2H&#8208;azirines can be considered strained cyclic ketimines, and highly enantioselective addition reactions of silicon nucleophiles to either acyclic or cyclic ketimines have been elusive so far. The present work closes this gap for those azirines by means of a copper&#8208;catalyzed silylation using a silyl boronic ester as a latent silicon nucleophile. The resulting C&#8208;silylated, unprotected (N&#8211;H) aziridines are obtained in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities and can be further converted into valuable compounds with hardly any erosion of the enantiomeric excess.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Epoxidation and Aziridination of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes via Palladium Catalyzed &#963;&#8208;Bond Nucleopalladation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of preparative methods for the synthesis of four&#8208;membered carbocycles is gaining increasing importance due to the widespread utility of cyclic compounds in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report the development of a new methodology for the production of spirocyclic epoxides and aziridines containing a cyclobutane motif. In a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot process, a bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl sulfoxide is lithiated and added to a ketone, aldehyde or imine, and the resulting intermediate is cross&#8208;coupled with an aryl triflate through C&#8211;C &#963;&#8208;bond alkoxy&#8208; or aminopalladation with concomitant epoxide or aziridine formation. After careful optimization, a remarkably efficient reaction was conceived that tolerated a broad variety of both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. Lastly, through several high yielding ring&#8208;opening reactions, we demonstrated the excellent applicability of the products as modular building blocks for the introduction of three&#8208;dimensional structures into target molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Bimetallic Cooperativity Through a Hydrogen Bonding Spacer in CO2&#160;Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At the core of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) active site two metal ions together with hydrogen bonding scheme from amino acids orchestrate the interconversion between CO2&#160;and CO. We have designed a molecular catalyst implementing a bimetallic iron complex with an embarked second coordination sphere with multi&#8208;point hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. We found that, when immobilized on carbon paper electrode, the dinuclear catalyst enhances up to four fold the heterogeneous CO2&#160;reduction to CO in water with an improved selectivity and stability compared to the mononuclear analogue. Interestingly, quasi&#8208;identical catalytic performances are obtained when one of the two iron centers was replaced by a redox inactive Zn metal, questioning the cooperative action of the two metals. Snapshots of X&#8208;ray structures indicate that the two metalloporphyrin units tethered by a urea group is a good compromise between rigidity and flexibility to accommodate CO2&#160;capture, activation, and reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Melt&#8208;Quenched Luminescent Glass of an Organic&#8208;Inorganic Manganese Halide as a Large&#8208;Area Scintillator for Radiation Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glass is a group of materials with appealing qualities, including simplicity in fabrication, durability, and high transparency, and they play a crucial role in the optics field. In this paper, a new organic&#8208;inorganic metal halide luminescent glass exhibiting &gt;78% transmittance at 550&#8208;800 nm range together with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 28.5% is reported through a low&#8208;temperature melt&#8208;quenched approach of pre&#8208;synthesized (HTPP)2MnBr4 (HTPP = hexyltriphenylphosphonium) single crystal. Temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, polarizing microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were combined to investigate the glass&#8208;crystalline interconversion process, revealing the disordered nature of the glassy state. Benefiting from the transparent nature, (HTPP)2MnBr4 glass yields an outstanding spatial resolution of 10 lp/mm for X&#8208;ray imaging. The superb optical properties and facility of large&#8208;scale fabrication distinguish the organic&#8208;inorganic metal halide glass as a highly promising class of materials for optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled construction of heteroleptic [Pd2(LA)2(LB)(LC)]4+ cages: A facile approach for site&#8208;selective endo&#8208;functionalization of supramolecular cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of supramolecular structures with internal functionalities is a promising approach to build enzyme&#8208;like cavities.&#160;The endo&#8208;functionalized [Pd12L24] and [Pd2L4] coordination cages represent the most successful systems in this regard. However, these systems mainly contain one type of endo&#8208;moieties. We herein provide a solution for controlled endo&#8208;functionalization of [Pd2L4] cages. Site&#8208;selective introduction of the endo&#8208;functional group was achieved via the formation of heteroleptic [Pd2(LA)2(LB)(LC)] cages. Using two orthogonal steric control elements is the key for the selective formation of the hetero&#8208;assemblies. We demonstrated the construction of two hetero&#8208;cages with a single internal functional group as well as a hetero&#8208;cage with two distinct endohedral functionalities.&#160;The endo&#8208;functionalized hetero&#8208;cages bound sulfonate guests with fast&#8208;exchange dynamic. This strategy provides a new solution for controlled endo&#8208;functionalization of supramolecular cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Operation of Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries in Air Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a green route for large&#8208;scale energy storage, aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are attracting extensive attention. However, most of the reported AORFBs were operated in an inert atmosphere. Herein, we clarify this issue by using the reported AORFB&#160;(i.e., 3, 3&#8217;&#8208;(9, 10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;methylbutanoicacid) (DPivOHAQ)//Ferrocyanide) as an example. We demonstrate that the dissolved O2 can oxidize the discharged DPivOHAQ in anolyte, leading to capacity&#8208;imbalance between anolyte and catholyte. Therefore, this cell shows continuous capacity fading when operated in an air atmosphere. We propose a simple strategy for this challenge, in which the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in catholyte is employed to balance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in anolyte. When using the Ni(OH)2&#8208;modifed carbon felt (CF) as a current collector for catholyte, this cell shows an excellent stability in air atmosphere because the Ni(OH)2&#8208;induced OER capacity in catholyte exactly balances the ORR capacity in anolyte. Such O2&#8208;balance strategy facilitates AORFBs&#8217; practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Control of the Scholl Reaction: Selective Synthesis of Spiro vs Helical Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scholl oxidation has become an essential reaction in the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of molecular nanographenes. Herein, we described a Scholl reaction controlled by the electronic effects on the starting substrate (1a,b). Anthracene&#8208;based polyphenylenes lead to spironanographenes under Scholl conditions. In contrast, an electron&#8208;deficient anthracene substrate affords a helically arranged molecular nanographene formed by two orthogonal dibenzo[fg,ij]phenanthro&#8208;[9,10,1,2,3&#8208;pqrst]pentaphene (DBPP) moieties linked through an octafluoroanthracene core. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations predict that electronic effects control either the first formation of spirocycles and subsequent Scholl reaction to form spironanographene&#160;2, or the expected dehydrogenation reaction leading solely to the helical nanographene&#160;3. The crystal structures of four of the new spiro compounds (syn2,&#160;syn9,anti9and&#160;syn10) were solved by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The photophysical properties of the new molecular nanographene&#160;3&#160;reveal a remarkable dual fluorescent emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Profiling the Heme&#8208;Binding Proteomes of Bacteria Using Chemical Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heme is a cofactor with myriad roles and essential to almost all living organisms. Beyond classical gas transport and catalytic functions, heme is increasingly appreciated as a tightly controlled signalling molecule regulating protein expression. However, heme acquisition, biosynthesis and regulation is poorly understood beyond a few model organisms, and the heme&#8208;binding proteome has not been fully characterised in bacteria. Yet as heme homeostasis is critical for bacterial survival, heme&#8208;binding proteins are promising drug targets. Herein we report a chemical proteomics method for global profiling of heme&#8208;binding proteins in live cells for the first time. Employing a panel of heme&#8208;based clickable and photoaffinity probes enabled the profiling of 32&#8208;54% of the known heme&#8208;binding proteomes in Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. This simple&#8208;to&#8208;implement profiling strategy could be interchangeably applied to different cell types and systems and fuel future research into heme biology.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heme is a cofactor with myriad roles and essential to almost all living organisms. Beyond classical gas transport and catalytic functions, heme is increasingly appreciated as a tightly controlled signalling molecule regulating protein expression. However, heme acquisition, biosynthesis and regulation is poorly understood beyond a few model organisms, and the heme-binding proteome has not been fully characterised in bacteria. Yet as heme homeostasis is critical for bacterial survival, heme-binding proteins are promising drug targets. Herein we report a chemical proteomics method for global profiling of heme-binding proteins in live cells for the first time. Employing a panel of heme-based clickable and photoaffinity probes enabled the profiling of 32-54% of the known heme-binding proteomes in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This simple-to-implement profiling strategy could be interchangeably applied to different cell types and systems and fuel future research into heme biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;step Approach for Constructing High Density Single&#8208;atom Catalysts toward Overall Water Splitting at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing highly active, durable, and cost&#8208;effective catalysts is urgent for green hydrogen production. Herein, high density Pt (24 atoms nm  &#8208;2  ) and Ir (32 atoms nm  &#8208;2  ) single atoms anchored on Co(OH)  2  were successfully constructed by a facile one&#8208;step approach. Remarkably, Pt  1  /Co(OH)  2  and Ir  1  /Co(OH)  2  only afforded 4 and 178 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, closing to the world record level. Moreover, assembled Pt  1  /Co(OH)  2  // Ir  1  /Co(OH)  2  system showed mass activity of 4.9 A mg  noble metal  &#8208;1  at 2.0 V in flowing alkali water electrolyzer, which is 316.1 times higher than that of Pt/C // IrO  2  . Mechanism studies revealed reconstructed Ir&#8208;O  6  single atoms and remodeled Pt triple&#8208;atom sites largely enhance the occupancy of Ir&#8208;O bonding orbitals and improve the occupation of Pt&#8208;H antibonding orbital, respectively, contributing to the formation of O&#8208;O bond and the desorption of hydrogen. This one&#8208;step approach was also generalized to fabricate other 20 kinds of single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Lasing from a Microcavity Filled with Achiral Single&#8208;Crystalline Microribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic circularly polarized (CP) lasers have received increasing attention due to their future photoelectric applications. Here, we demonstrate a CP laser from a pure organic crystal&#8208;filled microcavity without any chiral molecules or chiral structures. Benefited from the giant anisotropy and excellent laser gain of organic crystals, optical Rashba&#8208;Dresselhaus spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect can be induced and is conductive to the CP laser in such microcavities. The maximum dissymmetry factor of the CP lasing with opposite helicities reached, is as high as 1.2. Our strategy may provide a new idea for the design of CP lasers towards future 3D laser displays, information storage and other fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Bidirectional Tandem Electrocatalysis Manipulated Sulfur Speciation Pathway for High&#8208;Capacity and Stable Na&#8208;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish polysulfide redox kinetics and the uncontrollable sulfur speciation pathway, leading to serious shuttling effect and high activation barrier associated with sulfur cathode. We describe here the use of core&#8208;shell structured composite matrixes containing abundant catalytic sites for nearly fully reversible cycling of sulfur cathodes for Na&#8208;S batteries. The bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis provide successive reversible conversion of both long&#8208; and short&#8208;chain polysulfides, whereas Fe2O3 accelerates Na2S8/Na2S6 to Na2S4 conversion and the redox&#8208;active Fe(CN)64&#8208;&#8208;doped polypyrrole shell catalyzes Na2S4 reduction to Na2S. The electrochemically reactive Na2S can be readily charged back to sulfur with minimal overpotential. Simultaneously, stable cycling of Na&#8208;S pouch cell with a high reversible capacity of 696 mAh g&#8208;1 is also demonstrated. The bidirectional confined tandem catalysis renders the manipulation of sulfur redox electrochemistry for practical Na&#8208;S cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Didepside Formation by the Nonreducing Polyketide Synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera Requires Interaction of Starter Acyl Transferase and Thioesterase Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Orsellinic acid (OA) derivatives are produced by filamentous fungi using nonreducing polyketide synthases (nrPKSs). The chain&#8208;releasing thioesterase (TE) domains of such nrPKSs were proposed to also catalyze dimerization to yield didepsides such as lecanoric acid. Here, we use combinatorial domain exchanges, domain dissections and reconstitutions to reveal that the TE domain of the lecanoric acid synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera must collaborate with the starter acyl transferase (SAT) domain from the same nrPKS. We show that artificial SAT&#8208;TE fusion proteins are highly effective catalysts and reprogram ketide homologation chassi to form didepsides. We also demonstrate that dissected SAT and TE domains of Preu6 physically interact, and SAT and TE domains of OA&#8208;synthesizing nrPKSs may co&#8208;evolve. Our work highlights an unexpected domain&#8208;domain interaction in nrPKSs that must be considered upon combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural didepsides, depsidones, and diphenyl ethers.</dc:description>
