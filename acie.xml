         <title>Electronically Engineering Water Resistance in Methane Combustion with an Atomically Dispersed Tungsten on PdO Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the low&#8208;temperature water&#8208;resistance of methane combustion catalysts is of vital importance for industrial applications and it is challenging. A stepwise strategy is presented for the preparation of atomically dispersed tungsten species at the catalytically active site (Pd nanoparticles). After an activation process, a Pd&#8211;O&#8211;W1&#8208;like nanocompound is formed on the PdO surface with an atomic scale interface. The resulting supported catalyst possesses much stronger water resistance than the conventional catalysts for methane combustion. The integrated characterization results confirm that catalytic combustion of methane involves water, proceeding via a hydroperoxyl&#8208;promoted reaction mechanism on the catalyst surface. The results of density functional theory calculations indicate an upshift of the d&#8208;band center of palladium caused by electron transfer from atomically dispersed tungsten, which greatly facilitates the adsorption and activation of oxygen on the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Polymetallic Oxides and Hierarchical Porous Core&#8208;Shell Fibres for High Energy&#8208;Density Electrochemical Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing high energy&#8208;density and actual applications of fibre&#8208;based electrochemical supercapacitors (FESCs) are pivotal but challenging, as the ability to architect advanced fibres for accelerating charges kinetic diffusion and faradic storage remains key bottlenecks. Here, we demonstrate high&#8208;performance FESCs based on hetero&#8208;structured polymetallic oxides/porous graphene core&#8208;sheath fibres, where the large pseudo&#8208;active polymetallic oxides (PMO) sheath is uniformly loaded on hierarchical porous graphene fibre (PGF) core.&#160;&#160;Due to the abundant micro&#8208;/mesoporous pathways, large accessible surface, excellent redox activity and good interface electron conduction, the PMO&#8208;PGF possesses high areal capacitance (2959.78 mF cm&#8208;2) and manageable faradic reversibility in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the PMO&#8208;PGF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state FESCs present high energy&#8208;density (187.22 &#956;Wh cm&#8208;2), long&#8208;life cycles (95.8% capacitive retention after 20000 cycles), diverse&#8208;powered capabilities and actual energy&#8208;supply applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Polymer Adhesives: Straightforward Synthesis and Strong Substrate Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance adhesives are of great interest in view of industrial demand. We herein identify a straightforward synthetic strategy towards universal hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) polymeric adhesives, using a side&#8208;chain barbiturate (Ba) and Hamilton wedge (HW) functionalized copolymer. Starting from a rubbery copolymer containing thiolactone derivatives, Ba and HW moieties are tethered as pendant groups via an efficient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step amine&#8208;thiol&#8208;bromo conjugation. Hetero&#8208;complementary Ba/HW interactions thus yield H&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymeric networks. In addition to an enhanced polymeric network integrity induced by specific Ba/HW association, the presence of individual Ba or HW moieties enables strong binding to a range of substrates, outstanding compared to commercial glues and reported adhesives.</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding in a Crystalline Tri&#8208;Thorium Cluster: Not &#963;&#8208;Aromatic But Still Unique</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Very recently, Boronski  et al.  reported the first thorium&#8208;tho&#173;rium bond in a crystalline cluster prepared under normal experimental conditions. By using a range of experimental techniques and compu&#173;tational models, the authors found that the isolated actinide cluster contains at its heart two paired electrons delocalized over the tri&#8208;tho&#173;rium ring. The recorded Raman spectrum allegedly confirmed the ex&#173;istence of a &#963;&#8208;aromatic three&#8208;center two&#8208;electron bond. In the follow&#173;ing we demonstrate that the experimentally observed broad inelastic scattering bands between 60 and 135 cm  &#8208;1  , originally assigned by the authors to thorium&#8208;thorium vibrations, represent the combination of Th&#8211;Cl stretching and Th&#8211;Cl&#8211;Th bending modes, and they establish the existence of an unprecedented multicenter charge&#8208;shift bonding (ThCl  2  )  3  rather than the &#963;&#8208;aromatic bonding Th  3  . In the light of the pre&#173;sented findings, the latter remains experimentally unproven and com&#173;putationally questionable.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cycloisomerization/Cross&#8208;Coupling of Carbonyl&#8208; and Imine&#8208;Tethered Alkylidenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium catalytic system is reported for the divergent tandem cycloisomerization and cross&#8208;coupling of carbonyl&#8208; and imine&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs). The selection of ancillary ligands is pivotal for the interception of the heteropalladacyclic intermediates with different external nucleophiles.







Abstract
Pd0 catalysts featuring phosphorus&#8208;based monodentate ligands can detour the reactivity of carbonyl&#8208;tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) from standard (3+2) cycloadditions towards tandem cycloisomerization/cross&#8208;coupling processes. This new reactivity lies on the formation of key &#960;&#8208;allyl oxapalladacyclic intermediates, which are subsequently trapped with external nucleophilic partners, instead of undergoing canonical C&#8722;O reductive eliminations. Importantly, the use of imine&#8208;tethered ACP's is also feasible.

     alt="Palladium-Catalyzed Tandem Cycloisomerization/Cross-Coupling of Carbonyl- and Imine-Tethered Alkylidenecyclopropanes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A palladium catalytic system is reported for the divergent tandem cycloisomerization and cross-coupling of carbonyl- and imine-tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs). The selection of ancillary ligands is pivotal for the interception of the heteropalladacyclic intermediates with different external nucleophiles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; catalysts featuring phosphorus-based monodentate ligands can detour the reactivity of carbonyl-tethered alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) from standard (3+2) cycloadditions towards tandem cycloisomerization/cross-coupling processes. This new reactivity lies on the formation of key &#960;-allyl oxapalladacyclic intermediates, which are subsequently trapped with external nucleophilic partners, instead of undergoing canonical C&#8722;O reductive eliminations. Importantly, the use of imine-tethered ACP's is also feasible. Therefore, the method provides a straightforward and stereoselective entry to a wide variety of highly functionalized cyclic alcohols and amines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identifying Crystallographically Different Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites in LTA Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of crystallographically different Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al Br&#248;nsted acid sites in LTA zeolites has been identified using IR and 2D MAS NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. This has been successfully rationalized in terms of the secondary building unit concept.







Abstract
A clear understanding of the acidic properties of bridging Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al groups containing crystallographically different oxygen atoms in zeolites is a prerequisite for optimizing their performance as industrial solid catalysts and developing new acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions, but presents many challenges. Here, we report the direct observation of yet unrecognized bridging Si&#8722;OH&#8722;Al groups in the LTA zeolite whose oxygen atoms are crystallographically different from those of already known Br&#248;nsted acid sites. We also report that the creation of a crystallographically particular type of bridging OH groups in zeolites and its concentration and acid strength can vary strongly with the content and spatial distribution of framework Al atoms, thus being synthetic in nature, which has been rationalized in terms of the secondary building unit concept.

         <title>Charge Reservoirs in an Expanded Halide Perovskite Analog: Enhancing High&#8208;Pressure Conductivity through Redox&#8208;Active Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As halide perovskites and their derivatives are being developed for numerous optoelectronic applications, controlling their electronic doping remains a fundamental challenge. Herein, we describe a novel strategy of using redox&#8208;active organic molecules as stoichiometric electron acceptors. The cavities in the new expanded perovskite analogs (dmpz)[Sn2X6], (X = Br&#8210; ( 1Br ) or I&#8210; ( 1I )) are occupied by dmpz2+ (N, N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylpyrazinium), with the LUMOs lying ca. 1 eV above the valence band maximum (VBM). Compressing the metal&#8208;halide framework drives up the VBM in 1I relative to the dmpz LUMO. The electronic conductivity increases by a factor of 105 with pressure, reaching 50(17) S cm&#8211;1 at 60 GPa, exceeding the high&#8208;pressure conductivities of most halide perovskites. This conductivity enhancement is attributed to an increased hole density created by dmpz2+ reduction. This work elevates the role of organic cations in 3D metal&#8208;halides, from templating the structure to serving as charge reservoirs for tuning the carrier concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Oxo Cluster Assisted Fabrication of a Defect&#8208;Rich Ti&#8208;MOF Membrane Showing Versatile Gas&#8208;Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although having shown great promise for efficient gas separation, relevant study on Ti&#8208;MOF membranes remains very scarce, owing to limited Ti source types and uncertain factors which dominate the separation properties. In this work, we pioneered the use of Ti8(&#956;2&#8208;O)8(OOCC6H5)16 cluster as Ti source of MIL&#8208;125 membranes, which led to lower reaction temperature and higher missing&#8208;linker number within the framework and therefore, enhanced CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity. The MIL&#8208;125 membrane prepared by combining single&#8208;mode microwave heating with tertiary growth displayed an ideal CO2/N2 selectivity of 38.7, which ranked the highest among all pristine pure MOF membranes measured under comparable conditions. In addition, the ideal H2/N2 and H2/CH4 selectivity was as high as 64.9 and 40.7, thus showing great promise for versatile utility in gas separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;in&#8208;One Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Long&#8208;Lived Luminescent Systems Based on Pyrene&#8208;Doped Amorphous Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Materials exhibiting ultralong luminescent lifetime show promising applications in the fields of information encryption, sensing, and bioimaging. Herein, we present a low&#8208;cost and general strategy to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) based on pyrene chromophores doped into polymer matrices. The UOP of the resulted systems presents radiation&#8208;, concentration&#8208;, time&#8208;, and excitation&#8208;dependent characteristics. The UOP color can be turned from blue to red by changing the excitation wavelength or the concentration of chromophores. Experimental results prove that these characteristics are attributed to the consumption of triplet oxygen and the different aggregation states of chromophores in the polymer matrices. Finally, we demonstrate that these systems could be applied for multilevel information encryption. This work would promote further development of multi&#8208;responsive long&#8208;lived luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroalkynylation of Unactivated 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkynylation of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes is reported. Taking advantage of amide coordination and ligand control, both Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkynylation were readily accessible with high enantioselectivities. Computational studies revealed the origin of the ligand&#8208;controlled change of regioselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective functionalization of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes is challenging due to the difficulty to discriminate the enantiotopic faces. Enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of unactivated 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes with tunable Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity remains elusive. We report here an amide&#8208;directed, regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkynylation of unactivated alkenes. The regioselectivity can be readily tuned by the choice of a proper ligand. Catalytic alkynylations occurred with tunable Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity to afford products containing acyclic tertiary or quaternary stereocenters &#946; to an amide. Combining a sequence of alkene isomerization and regioselective hydroalkynylation, we further realized an iridium&#8208;catalyzed formal asymmetric conjugated alkynylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides. Computational studies suggest that the regioselectivity is dictated by the ligand structures.

         <title>Helicity Modulation in NIR&#8208;Absorbing Porphyrin&#8208;Ryleneimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereochemistry and curvature of porphyrin&#8208;based nanographenes change in response to coordination of metal ions and heat. By judicious choice of ionic radii, peripheral substituents and apical ligands, it is possible to control the thermodynamics and kinetics of isomerization, to achieve conversion between achiral and chiral structures.







Abstract
Peripheral substitution of a &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrin with bulky groups produces a curved chromophore with four helical stereogenic units. The curvature and stereochemistry of such porphyrins can be controlled by varying the substituents, coordinated metal ions, and apical ligands. In particular, when the achiral saddle&#8208;shaped free bases are treated with large metal ions, i.e., CdII or HgII, the resulting complexes convert to chiral propeller&#8208;like configurations. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses show that apical coordination of a water molecule is sufficient to induce a notable bowl&#8208;like distortion of the cadmium complex, which however retains its chiral structure. For phenyl&#8208; and tolyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, the conversion is thermodynamically controlled, whereas complexes bearing bulky 4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl groups transform into their chiral forms upon heating. In the latter case, the chiral Hg porphyrin was converted into the corresponding free base and other metal complexes without any loss of configurational purity, ultimately providing access to stable, enantiopure porphyrin propellers.

         <title>Extreme Enhancement of Carbon Hydrogasification via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plants capture CO2 from the air and fix it with H2O into carbohydrate molecules via photosynthesis. The main photosynthesized biomass, wood, can be converted into charcoal and chemicals via pyrolysis. The charcoal can then be hydrogenated into hydrocarbons using a mechanochemical method. The produced CH4 can be used directly as fuel, or as a feedstock for the synthesis of other chemicals, thereby creating a neutral or negative carbon cycle.







Abstract
Carbon hydrogasification is the slowest reaction among all carbon&#8208;involved small&#8208;molecule transformations. Here, we demonstrate a mechanochemical method that results in both a faster reaction rate and a new synthesis route. The reaction rate was dramatically enhanced by up to 4 orders of magnitude compared to the traditional thermal method. Simultaneously, the reaction exhibited very high selectivity (99.8&#8201;% CH4, versus 80&#8201;% under thermal conditions) with a cobalt catalyst. Our study demonstrated that this extreme increase in reaction rate originates from the continuous activation of reactive carbon species via mechanochemistry. The high selectivity is intimately related to the activation at low temperature, at which higher hydrocarbons are difficult to form. This work is expected to advance studies of carbon hydrogasification, and other solid&#8208;gas reactions.

         <title>Photoswitchable Serotonins for Optical Control of the 5&#8208;HT2A Receptor**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first&#8208;in&#8208;class photoswitchable agonists for the 5HT2A receptor (serotonin family GPCR) have been developed. Bifunctional, tethered variants (PORTLs) enable genetically targeted optical control.







Abstract
Serotonin receptors play central roles in neuromodulation and are critical drug targets for psychiatric disorders. Optical control of serotonin receptor subtypes has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of receptor function. While other neuromodulatory receptors have been successfully rendered photoswitchable, reversible photocontrol of serotonin receptors has not been achieved, representing a major gap in GPCR photopharmacology. Herein, we develop the first tools that allow for such control. Azo5HT&#8208;2 shows light&#8208;dependent 5&#8208;HT2AR agonism, with greater activity in the cis&#8208;form. Based on docking and test compound analysis, we also develop photoswitchable orthogonal, remotely&#8208;tethered ligands (PORTLs). These BG&#8208;Azo5HTs provide rapid, reversible, and repeatable optical control following conjugation to SNAP&#8208;tagged 5&#8208;HT2AR. Overall, this study provides a foundation for the broad extension of photopharmacology to the serotonin receptor family.

         <title>The Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Rhonin Targets RHOGDI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The identification of the pseudo&#8208;natural product Rhonin as the first small&#8208;molecule modulator of RHO GDP dissociation inhibitor (RHOGDI) is reported. Rhonin binds to RHOGDI and interferes with its function by disrupting the interaction between RHOGDI and RHO GTPases.







Abstract
For the discovery of novel chemical matter generally endowed with bioactivity, strategies may be particularly efficient that combine previous insight about biological relevance, e.g., natural product (NP) structure, with methods that enable efficient coverage of chemical space, such as fragment&#8208;based design. We describe the de novo combination of different 5&#8208;membered NP&#8208;derived N&#8208;heteroatom fragments to structurally unprecedented &#8220;pseudo&#8208;natural products&#8221; in an efficient complexity&#8208;generating and enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis sequence. The pseudo&#8208;NPs inherit characteristic elements of NP structure but occupy areas of chemical space not covered by NP&#8208;derived chemotypes, and may have novel biological targets. Investigation of the pseudo&#8208;NPs in unbiased phenotypic assays and target identification led to the discovery of the first small&#8208;molecule ligand of the RHO GDP&#8208;dissociation inhibitor 1 (RHOGDI1), termed Rhonin. Rhonin inhibits the binding of the RHOGDI1 chaperone to GDP&#8208;bound RHO GTPases and alters the subcellular localization of RHO GTPases.

         <title>Comprehensive Pore Tuning in an Ultrastable Fluorinated Anion Cross&#8208;Linked Cage&#8208;Like MOF for Simultaneous Benchmark Propyne Recovery and Propylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented ultrastable fluorinated anion cross&#8208;linked cage&#8208;like MOF (ZNU&#8208;2) was prepared for benchmark propyne/propylene separation with large C3H4 capacity (7.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), high C3H4/C3H6 selectivity (16.2), low adsorption enthalpy (43.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and high practical C3H4 and C3H6 productivity due to the precise control of pore size, shape and functionality.







Abstract
Propyne/propylene (C3H4/C3H6) separation is an important but challenging industrial process to produce polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 and recover high&#8208;purity C3H4. Herein, we report an ultrastable TiF62&#8722; anion cross&#8208;linked metal&#8211;organic framework (ZNU&#8208;2) with precisely controlled pore size, shape and functionality for benchmark C3H4 storage (3.9/7.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.01/1.0&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K) and record high C3H4/C3H6 (10/90) separation potential (31.0&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1). The remarkable C3H4/C3H6 (1/99, 10/90, 50/50) separation performance was fully demonstrated by simulated and experimental breakthroughs under various conditions with excellent recyclability and high productivity (42&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) of polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 from a 1/99&#8197;C3H4/C3H6 mixture. A modelling study revealed that the symmetrical spatial distribution of six TiF62&#8722; on the icosahedral cage surface provides two distinct binding sites for C3H4 adsorption: one serves as a tailored single C3H4 molecule trap and the other boosts C3H4 accommodation by cooperative host&#8211;guest and guest&#8211;guest interactions.

         <title>In Situ Constructed Nano&#8208;Drug Depots through Intracellular Hydrolytic Condensation for Chemotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intracellular hydrolytic condensation (IHC) system to construct long&#8208;term retentive nano&#8208;drug depots in situ is presented. Based on silicon particles, the nano&#8208;drug depots are capable of sustained drug release, which results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer.







Abstract
Intravesical administration of first&#8208;line drugs has shown failure in the treatment of bladder cancer owing to the poor tumor retention time of chemotherapeutics. Herein, we report an intracellular hydrolytic condensation (IHC) system to construct long&#8208;term retentive nano&#8208;drug depots in situ, wherein sustained drug release results in highly efficient suppression of bladder cancer. Briefly, the designed doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;silane conjugates self&#8208;assemble into silane&#8208;based prodrug nanoparticles, which condense into silicon particle&#8208;based nano&#8208;drug depots inside tumor cells. Significantly, we demonstrate that the IHC system possesses highly potent antitumor efficacy, which leads to the regression and eradication of large established tumors and simultaneously extends the overall survival of air pouch bladder cancer mice compared with that of mice treated with Dox. The concept of intracellular hydrolytic condensation can be extended via conjugating other chemotherapeutic drugs, which may facilitate rational design of novel nanomedicines for augmentation of chemotherapy.

         <title>Critical Role of Removing Impurities in Nickel Oxide on High&#8208;Efficiency and Long&#8208;Term Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality NiOx nanoparticles have been synthesized via an ionic liquid&#8208;assisted synthesis method (NiOx&#8208;IL). The inverted perovskite solar cell based on a NiOx&#8208;IL hole transport layer exhibits a striking efficiency exceeding 22.62&#8201;%, and a superior operational stability maintaining 92&#8201;% of its initial efficiency at a maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination for 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
The performance enhancement of inverted perovskite solar cells applying nickel oxide (NiOx) as the hole transport layer (HTL) has been limited by impurity ions (such as nitrate ions). Herein, we have proposed a strategy to obtain high&#8208;quality NiOx nanoparticles via an ionic liquid&#8208;assisted synthesis method (NiOx&#8208;IL). Experimental and theoretical results illustrate that the cation of the ionic liquid can inhibit the adsorption of impurity ions on nickel hydroxide through a strong hydrogen bond and low adsorption energy, thereby obtaining NiOx&#8208;IL HTL with high conductivity and strong hole&#8208;extraction ability. Importantly, the removal of impurity ions can effectively suppress the redox reaction between the NiOx film and the perovskite film, thus slowing down the deterioration of device performance. Consequently, the modified inverted device shows a striking efficiency exceeding 22.62&#8201;%, and superior stability maintaining 92&#8201;% efficiency at a maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination for 1000&#8197;h.

Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) UV&#8208;printing produces cross&#8208;linked materials that are stable and non&#8208;degradable. The introduction of a thionolactone dopant (2&#8197;wt&#8201;% of dibenzo[c,e]&#8208;oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT)) to acrylate&#8208;based resins produced via radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization confers (bio)degradability through the thioester units in the network. The resin was used in different setups, including commercial 3D printers, and the objects were shown to degrade in basic solution under mild conditions.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing and especially VAT photopolymerization leads to cross&#8208;linked materials with high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability. Nevertheless, these properties are incompatible with requirements of degradability and re/upcyclability. We show here that thionolactone and in particular dibenzo[c,e]&#8208;oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) can be used as an additive (2&#8197;wt&#8201;%) to acrylate&#8208;based resins to introduce weak bonds into the network via a radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization process. The low amount of additive makes it possible to modify the printability of the resin only slightly, keep its resolution intact, and maintain the mechanical properties of the 3D object. The resin with additive was used in UV microfabrication and two&#8208;photon stereolithography setups and commercial 3D printers. The fabricated objects were shown to degrade in basic solvent as well in a homemade compost. The rate of degradation is nonetheless dependent on the size of the object. This feature was used to prepare 3D objects with support structures that could be easily solubilized.

         <title>Catalytic Substrate&#8208;Selective Silylation of Primary Alcohols via Remote Functional&#8208;Group Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise molecular recognition of the substrate structure by catalyst 3 enabled substrate&#8208;selective silylation of long&#8208;chain primary alcohols. Silylation of A proceeded 11 times faster than that of B by recognition of a one&#8208;carbon difference between primary alcohols A and B. Preferential silylation of A took place over that of C by a factor of 21 owing to discrimination of the remote functionality at C(5) from the reacting OH group at C(1).







Abstract
Silylation of alcohols has generally been known to take place at the sterically most accessible less&#8208;hindered hydroxy group. Herein, the catalyst&#8208;controlled substrate&#8208;selective silylation of primary alcohols, in which the selectivity was controlled independently of the innate reactivity of the hydroxy group, based on the steric environment, is reported. The chain&#8208;length&#8208;selective silylation of 1,n&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives was achieved and 1,5&#8208;amino alcohol derivatives showed outstandingly high reactivity in the presence of analogues with a shorter or longer chain length under catalyst&#8208;controlled conditions. A highly substrate&#8208;selective catalytic silylation of pentanol analogues was also developed, in which the remote functionality at C(5) from the reacting hydroxy groups was effectively discriminated on silylation.

         <title>Profiling of the ADP&#8208;Ribosylome in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For further studies on protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation, two new NAD+ derivatives are introduced, which carry either a fluorophore or an affinity tag. In combination with developed methods for their mild cell delivery, studies of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living human cells were conducted. This approach allows not only the imaging of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living cells but also the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of cellular adaptation by protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation as a consequence of environmental changes.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) with ADP&#8208;ribose and poly(ADP&#8208;ribose) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as substrate is involved in the regulation of numerous cellular pathways in eukaryotes, notably the response to DNA damage caused by cellular stress. Nevertheless, due to intrinsic properties of NAD+ e.g., high polarity and associated poor cell passage, these PTMs are difficult to characterize in cells. Here, two new NAD+ derivatives are presented, which carry either a fluorophore or an affinity tag and, in combination with developed methods for mild cell delivery, allow studies in living human cells. We show that this approach allows not only the imaging of ADP&#8208;ribosylation in living cells but also the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of cellular adaptation by protein ADP&#8208;ribosylation as a consequence of environmental changes such as H2O2&#8208;induced oxidative stress or the effect of the approved anti&#8208;cancer drug olaparib. Our results therefore pave the way for further functional and clinical studies of the ADP&#8208;ribosylated proteome in living cells in health and disease.

         <title>Diversifying Nanoparticle Superstructures and Functions Enabled by Translative Templating from Supramolecular Polymerization</title>

Information transfer from &#960;&#8208;conjugated perylene diimide isomers to nanoparticle assemblies is successfully achieved through synchronized supramolecular polymerization and nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly, which enables the generation of self&#8208;assembled superstructures with long&#8208;range ordering, and potentially macroscopic materials, from synthetic small molecules and nanoparticles.







Abstract
Biology exploits a transcription&#8211;translation approach to deliver structural information from DNA to the protein&#8208;building machines with high precision. Here, we show how the structural information of small synthetic molecules could be used to guide the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into diversified yet long&#8208;range ordered superstructures, enabling the information transfer across four or five orders of magnitude in length scale. We designed three perylene diimide (PDI) based isomers differing by their site&#8208;specific substitutions of the methyl group, which were able to supramolecularly polymerize into diverse structures. Importantly, coassembly of these PDI isomers with nanoparticles (NPs) could produce diverse long&#8208;range ordered nanoparticle superstructures, including one&#8208;dimensional NPs chains, double helical NPs assemblies and two&#8208;dimensional NPs superlattices. Equally important, we demonstrate that the information originated from small molecules could diversify the functions of the self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites.

         <title>Heterotrimetallic Double Cavity Cages: Syntheses and Selective Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the synthesis of two heterotrimetallic double cavity cages, [PdnPtmL4]6+, (where n=1 and m =2 or n=2 and m=1) is described. The cages are shown to interact with several different guest molecules. The cage with two identical cavities can bind two identical guest molecules in a non&#8208;cooperative fashion, whereas the cage with two different cavities can bind two different guests in a segregated manner.







Abstract
A strategy for the generation of heterotrimetallic double cavity (DC) cages [PdnPtmL4]6+ (DC1: n=1, m=2; and DC2: n=2, m=1) is reported. The DC cages were generated by combining an inert platinum(II) tetrapyridylaldehyde complex with a suitably substituted pyridylamine and PdII ions. 1H and DOSY nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) data were consistent with the formation of the DC architectures. DC1 and DC2 were shown to interact with several different guest molecules. The structure of DC1, which features two identical cavities, binding two 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone (DAQ) guest molecules was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, DC1 was shown to bind two molecules of 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) in a statistical (non&#8208;cooperative) manner. In contrast, DC2, which features two different cage cavities, was found to interact with two different guests, 5&#8208;FU and cisplatin, selectively.

The cages are shown to interact with several different guest molecules. The cage with two identical cavities can bind two identical guest molecules in a non-cooperative fashion, whereas the cage with two different cavities can bind two different guests in a segregated manner.

The DC cages were generated by combining an inert platinum(II) tetrapyridylaldehyde complex with a suitably substituted pyridylamine and Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ions. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and DOSY nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) data were consistent with the formation of the DC architectures. &lt;b&gt;DC1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DC2&lt;/b&gt; were shown to interact with several different guest molecules. The structure of &lt;b&gt;DC1&lt;/b&gt;, which features two identical cavities, binding two 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (&lt;b&gt;DAQ&lt;/b&gt;) guest molecules was determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. In addition, &lt;b&gt;DC1&lt;/b&gt; was shown to bind two molecules of 5-fluorouracil (&lt;b&gt;5-FU&lt;/b&gt;) in a statistical (non-cooperative) manner. In contrast, &lt;b&gt;DC2&lt;/b&gt;, which features two different cage cavities, was found to interact with two different guests, &lt;b&gt;5-FU&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;cisplatin&lt;/b&gt;, selectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Arylation of Tertiary C&#8722;H Bonds of Cyclobutylmethyl Ketones Using Transient Directing Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PdII&#8208;catalyzed tertiary C&#8722;H activation of cyclobutylmethyl ketones using a transient directing group is reported. An electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand was identified as an external ligand to enable tertiary C&#8722;H activation. A variety of cyclobutylmethyl ketones bearing quaternary carbon centers was readily accessed in up to 81&#8201;% yield and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 regioisomeric ratios of tertiary C&#8722;H arylation to &#946;&#8208;methylene (&#946;&#8208;methyl) or &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation.







Abstract
We report the first example of selective PdII&#8208;catalyzed tertiary C&#8722;H activation of cyclobutylmethyl ketones using a transient directing group. An electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand was identified as the optimal external ligand to enable tertiary C&#8722;H activation. A variety of cyclobutylmethyl ketones bearing quaternary carbon centers was readily accessed without preinstalling internal directing groups in up to 81&#8201;% yield and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 regioisomeric ratios of tertiary C&#8722;H arylation to &#946;&#8208;methylene (&#946;&#8208;methyl) or &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Dynamic Microbial Fe(III) Respiration Metabolism with a Living Cell&#8208;Compatible Electron&#8208;Sensing Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;sensing probe Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ was developed to achieve dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolism monitoring in S. putrefaciens. With excellent monitoring performance, the Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ probe offers the potential to track the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolic response of S. putrefaciens to environmental stress and microbial co&#8208;culture interactions. Additionally, the Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ probe provides guidance for biosynthesis efficiency optimization.







Abstract
Monitoring microbial metabolism is vital for biomanufacturing processes optimization. However, it remains a grand challenge to offer insight into microbial metabolism due to particularly complex and dynamic processes. Here, we report an electron&#8208;sensing probe Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ for real&#8208;time and dynamic monitoring of Fe(III) respiration metabolism. The quenched persistent luminescence of Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ is recovered when Fe3+ accepted electrons from the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolism, enabling the real&#8208;time monitoring of microbial metabolism. The probe shows the capability to verify the role of related biomolecules in microbial Fe(III) respiration metabolism, to track the dynamic Fe(III) respiration metabolic response to environmental stress and microbial co&#8208;culture interactions. Furthermore, the Zn2GeO4:Mn@Fe3+ probe provides guidance for improving biosynthesis efficiency by monitoring Fe redox recycling in microbial co&#8208;culture.

         <title>Mechanochemical Access to a Short&#8208;Lived Cyclic Dimer Pd2L2: An Elusive Kinetic Species En Route to Molecular Triangle Pd3L3 and Molecular Square Pd4L4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions between cis&#8208;protected Pd ions and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, a classic self&#8208;assembly reaction studied for the past 30&#8197;years, would always give molecular square Pd4L4 and/or triangle Pd3L3. By solvent&#8208;free ball&#8208;milling, a highly&#8208;reactive cyclic dimer Pd2L2 is isolated for the first time as the major species, highlighting that unique chemical space mechanochemistry can provide an environment to stabilize species that are otherwise too reactive to both &#8220;see&#8221; and &#8220;capture&#8221;.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;based molecular square Pd4L4 and triangle Pd3L3 represent the molecular ancestors of metal&#8208;coordination polyhedra that have been an integral part of the field for the last 30&#8197;years. Conventional solution&#8208;based reactions between cis&#8208;protected Pd ions and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine exclusively give Pd4L4 and/or Pd3L3 as the sole products. We herein show that, under solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical conditions, the self&#8208;assembly energy landscape can be thermodynamically manipulated to form an elusive cyclic dimer Pd2L2 for the first time. In the absence of solvent, Pd2L2 is indefinitely stable in the solid&#8208;state, but converts rapidly to its thermodynamic products Pd3L3 and Pd4L4 in solution, confirming Pd2L2 as a short&#8208;lived kinetic species in the solution&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly process. Our results highlight how mechanochemistry grants access to a vastly different chemical space than available under conventional solution conditions. This provides a unique opportunity to isolate elusive species in self&#8208;assembly processes that are too reactive to both &#8220;see&#8221; and &#8220;capture&#8221;.

Selective regulation of Lewis acid&#8211;base sites in metal&#8211;organic framework catalysts is an effective strategy to turn&#8208;on/off the catalytic activity for different CO2 reactions.







Abstract
Regulating Lewis acid&#8211;base sites in catalysts to investigate their influence in the chemical fixation of CO2 is significant but challenging. A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with open metal Co sites, {(NH2Me2)[Co3(&#956;3&#8208;OH)(BTB)2(H2O)]&#8901;9&#8201;H2O&#8901;5&#8201;DMF}n (1), was obtained and the results of the catalytic investigation show that 1 can catalyze cycloaddition of CO2 and aziridines to give 99&#8201;% yield. The efficiency of the cyclization of CO2 with propargyl amines is only 32&#8201;%. To improve the catalytic ability of 1, ligand XN with Lewis base sites was introduced into 1 and coordinated with the open Co sites, resulting in a decrease of the Lewis acid sites and an increase in the Lewis base sites in a related MOF 2 ({(NH2Me2)[Co3(&#956;3&#8208;OH)(NHMe2)(BTB)2(XN)]&#8901;8&#8201;H2O&#8901;4&#8201;DMF}n). Selective regulation of the type of active centers causes the yield of oxazolidinones to be enhanced by about 2.4 times, suggesting that this strategy can turn on/off the catalytic activity for different reactions. The catalytic results from 2 treated with acid solution support this conclusion. This work illuminates a MOF&#8208;construction strategy that produces efficient catalysts for CO2 conversion.

         <title>Demonstrating and Unraveling a Controlled Nanometer&#8208;Scale Expansion of the Vacancy Defects in Graphene by CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 is demonstrated as a promising etchant for controlled manipulation of graphene edges and vacancy defects down to a rate of a few &#197; per minute while completely avoiding the nucleation of new vacancy defects. This makes CO2 a unique etchant for decoupling pore nucleation and expansion.







Abstract
A controlled manipulation of graphene edges and vacancies is desired for molecular separation, sensing and electronics applications. Unfortunately, available etching methods always lead to vacancy nucleation making it challenging to control etching. Herein, we report CO2&#8208;led controlled etching down to 2&#8211;3&#8197;&#197; per minute while completely avoiding vacancy nucleation. This makes CO2 a unique etchant for decoupling pore nucleation and expansion. We show that CO2 expands the steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;free edges with an activation energy of 2.71&#8197;eV, corresponding to the energy barrier for the dissociative chemisorption of CO2. We demonstrate the presence of an additional configurational energy barrier for nanometer&#8208;sized vacancies resulting in a significantly slower rate of expansion. Finally, CO2 etching is applied to map the location of the intrinsic vacancies in the polycrystalline graphene film where we show that the intrinsic vacancy defects manifest mainly as grain boundary defects where intragrain defects from oxidative etching constitute a minor population.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework as an Efficient Protection Layer for a Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin covalent organic framework layer is in situ fabricated on Li (COF&#8208;Li) to suppress Li dendrite growth and mitigate side reactions on the Li anode. COF&#8208;Li exhibits a non&#8208;dendritic morphology during repeated Li plating/stripping and demonstrates a remarkable cycle life of &gt;13&#8201;200&#8197;h with an impressive low overpotential of 16&#8197;mV at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal shows great potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. However, the practical applications of Li&#8208;metal batteries are still challenged by the formation of Li dendrites and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on metallic Li. Herein, a thin covalent organic framework layer is in situ fabricated on Li (COF&#8208;Li) to suppress Li dendrite growth and mitigate the side reaction on the Li anode. The COF has a periodic and uniform porosity, allowing for selectively sieving Li ions and guiding a uniform Li deposition. As a result, the COF&#8208;Li exhibits a non&#8208;dendrite morphology during repeated Li plating/stripping and demonstrates a remarkable cycle life over 13&#8201;200&#8197;h with an extremely low overpotential of only 16&#8197;mV at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Deep Downregulation of PD&#8208;L1 by Caged Peptide&#8208;Conjugated AIEgen/miR&#8208;140 Nanoparticles for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tumor cells, a caged peptide&#8208;AIEgen probe self&#8208;assembled with miR&#8208;140 could release the GO203 peptide binding to MUC1 and miR&#8208;140 degrading the PD&#8208;L1 mRNA, thus, achieving the deep downregulation of the PD&#8208;L1 expression. Subsequently, activated immune cells by PDT&#8208;induced release of TAAs would achieve more effective immunotherapy.







Abstract
Downregulating programmed cell death ligand 1(PD&#8208;L1) protein levels in tumor cells is an effective way to achieve immune system activation for oncology treatment, but current strategies are inadequate. Here, we design a caged peptide&#8208;AIEgen probe (GCP) to self&#8208;assemble with miR&#8208;140 forming GCP/miR&#8208;140 nanoparticles. After entering tumor cells, GCP/miR&#8208;140 disassembles in the presence of Cathepsin B (CB) and releases caged GO203 peptide, miR&#8208;140 and PyTPA. Peptide decages in the highly reductive intracellular environment and binds to mucin 1 (MUC1), thereby downregulating the expression of PD&#8208;L1. Meanwhile, miR&#8208;140 reduces PD&#8208;L1 expression by targeting downregulation of PD&#8208;L1 mRNA. Under the action of PyTPA&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT), tumor&#8208;associated antigens are released, triggering immune cell attack on tumor cells. This multiple mechanism&#8208;based strategy of deeply downregulating PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells activates the immune system and thus achieves effective immunotherapy.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Embedded [n]Helicenes (n=5, 6 and 7)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; approach has been used to synthesize azulene&#8208;embedded pristine [n]helicenes (n=5, 6 and 7) that show low&#8208;lying first electric states, small optical energy gaps, and anti&#8208;Kasha emissions. These azulene&#8208;embedded [n]helicenes contribute to the non&#8208;benzenoid helicene library and allow structure&#8211;property relationships to be better understood.







Abstract
Azulene is a non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic building block with unique chemical structure and physicochemical properties. By using the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthetic strategy, we synthesized three azulene&#8208;embedded [n]helicenes ([n]AzHs, n=5, 6 and 7), in which one terminal azulene subunit was fused with n&#8208;2 benzene rings. P&#8208; and M&#8208;enantiomers were observed in the packing diagrams of [5]&#8208;, and [6]AzHs. However, P&#8208; and M&#8208;[7]AzHs could be isolated by recrystallization of the racemic mixture.

&lt;p&gt;A straightforward &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; approach has been used to synthesize azulene-embedded pristine [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]helicenes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=5, 6 and 7) that show low-lying first electric states, small optical energy gaps, and &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Kasha emissions. These azulene-embedded [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]helicenes contribute to the non-benzenoid helicene library and allow structure&#8211;property relationships to be better understood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azulene is a non-benzenoid aromatic building block with unique chemical structure and physicochemical properties. By using the &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; synthetic strategy, we synthesized three azulene-embedded [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]helicenes (&lt;b&gt;[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]AzHs&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=5, 6 and 7), in which one terminal azulene subunit was fused with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt; benzene rings. &lt;i&gt;P-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M-&lt;/i&gt;enantiomers were observed in the packing diagrams of &lt;b&gt;[5]-&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;[6]AzHs&lt;/b&gt;. However, &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;[7]AzHs&lt;/b&gt; could be isolated by recrystallization of the racemic mixture. These &lt;b&gt;[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]AzHs&lt;/b&gt; were endowed with new properties through the azulene moiety such as low-lying first electric state (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), small optical energy gap and &lt;i&gt;anti-&lt;/i&gt;Kasha emission. &lt;b&gt;[6]-&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;[7]AzHs&lt;/b&gt; exhibit strong chiroptical responses with high absorption dissymmetry factor (g&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;) maxima of about 0.02, which is among the highest |g&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;| values of helicenes in the visible range. These azulene-embedded [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]helicenes contribute to the non-benzenoid helicene library and allow the structure&#8211;property relationships to be better understood.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Host&#8211;Guest Electron Transfer Mechanism for Magnetic and Electronic Modifications in a Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first reversible magnetic phase switch between antiferromagnet and paramagnet has been achieved through host&#8211;guest electron transfer via I2&#8208;vapor sorption. The partial charge delocalization was formed in the I2&#8208;loaded framework, resulting in a hundred&#8208;fold increase in electrical conductivity via hopping electronic transport.







Abstract
Host&#8211;guest electron transfer (HGET) in molecular framework systems is a critical trigger for drastic functional changes in both host framework and guest. A reversible magnetic phase transition was achieved via HGET in a layered framework, [{Ru2(2,6&#8208;F2PhCO2)4}2(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ)] (1), where 2,6&#8208;F2PhCO2&#8722; and BTDA&#8208;TCNQ represent 2,6&#8208;difluorobenzoate and bis[1,2,5]dithiazolotetracyanoquinodimethane, respectively. The guest&#8208;free 1 with an antiferromagnetic ground state transformed into a paramagnet, [{Ru2(2,6&#8208;F2PhCO2)4}2(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ)]I3 (1&#8208;I3), by adsorbing iodine (I2). The local charge distribution of [{Ru2II,III}+&#8208;(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ).&#8722;&#8208;{Ru2II,II}] in 1 was reversibly modified to [{Ru2II,III}+&#8208;(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ)0&#8208;{Ru2II,II}](I3&#8722;) in 1&#8208;I3 through HGET. Theoretical calculations of 1&#8208;I3 indicated a partial charge delocalization as [{Ru2}(1&#8722;&#948;)+&#8208;(BTDA&#8208;TCNQ)0&#8208;{Ru2}&#948;+](I3&#8722;) with &#948;&#8776;0.2, aided by weak ferromagnetic coupling. 1&#8208;I3 exhibited a hundred&#8208;fold enhancement in electrical conductivity compared to that of 1.

         <title>Increasing the Number of Aluminum Atoms in T3 Sites of a Mordenite Zeolite by Low&#8208;Pressure SiCl4 Treatment to Catalyze Dimethyl Ether Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
After low&#8208;pressure SiCl4 treatment (LPST), the undesired framework aluminum atoms in the 12&#8208;MR channels of a mordenite (MOR) zeolite migrate to the desired T3 sites to increase the number of favorable active sites.







Abstract
Controlling the location of aluminum atoms in a zeolite framework is critical for understanding structure&#8211;performance relationships of catalytic reaction systems and tailoring catalyst design. Herein, we report a strategy to preferentially relocate mordenite (MOR) framework Al atoms into the desired T3 sites by low&#8208;pressure SiCl4 treatment (LPST). High&#8208;field 27Al NMR was used to identify the exact location of framework Al for the MOR samples. The results indicate that 73&#8201;% of the framework Al atoms were at the T3 sites after LPST under optimal conditions, which leads to controllably generating and intensifying active sites in MOR zeolite for the dimethyl ether (DME) carbonylation reaction with higher methyl acetate (MA) selectivity and much longer lifetime (25&#8197;times). Further research reveals that the Al relocation mechanism involves simultaneous extraction, migration, and reinsertion of Al atoms from and into the parent MOR framework. This unique method is potentially applicable to other zeolites to control Al location.

         <title>Gadolinium Changes the Local Electron Densities of Nickel 3d Orbitals for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of Gd atoms into a Ni&#8208;based catalyst readily changes local electron densities of the Ni 3d orbitals and strengthens the electronic activity. The resulting Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon black electrocatalyst achieves high selectivity, large current density and outstanding stability in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Generally, in terms of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, single&#8208;atom catalysts show high selectivities yet low current densities whereas conventional nanoparticle catalysts exhibit relatively high current densities but low selectivities. This work combines the advantages of the two classes of catalysts by constructing a Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon black electrocatalyst within which NiI active sites are exposed outside the carbon layers and Ni nanoparticles are encapsulated inside the carbon layers. The Gd atoms can not only influence the local electron densities of Ni 3d orbitals, thus strengthening the electronic activity, but also tailor the sizes of the Ni nanoparticles, thereby minimizing the activity toward hydrogen evolution. Accordingly, this electrocatalyst yields both a high CO faradaic efficiency (97&#8201;%) and a large current density (308&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), alongside an outstanding stability (100&#8197;h).

         <title>Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interfacial Chemistry Modulation for Ultra&#8208;High Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a THF&#8208;based electrolyte with a weak solvation structure, Na+ desolvation is fast and a uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with abundant NaF and organic compounds is generated on the commercial hard carbon anode. This greatly enhances the interface stability and enables the rapid migration of Na+ in the SEI, thus realizing the high rate capability, long&#8208;term stability and good low&#8208;temperature performance for the hard carbon anode.







Abstract

As proven, weak ion solvation/desolvation of tetrahydrofuran greatly facilitates fast&#8208;ion diffusion at the SEI/electrolyte interface and homogeneous SEI with well&#8208;distributed NaF and organic components ensures fast Na+ diffusion through the SEI layer and a stable interface.

&lt;p&gt;In a THF-based electrolyte with a weak solvation structure, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation is fast and a uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with abundant NaF and organic compounds is generated on the commercial hard carbon anode. This greatly enhances the interface stability and enables the rapid migration of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the SEI, thus realizing the high rate capability, long-term stability and good low-temperature performance for the hard carbon anode.

         <title>Directing Multivalent Aptamer&#8208;Receptor Binding on the Cell Surface with Programmable Atom&#8208;Like Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA framework&#8208;based programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (aptPANs) and their assemblies with fixed aptamer copy numbers but different directionality were designed. These are employed to direct multivalent aptamer&#8211;receptor binding on the cell membrane interface. The directional&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible aptPAN molecules exhibit the adaptability to the receptor distribution on cell surfaces and thus high affinity against target tumor cells.







Abstract
Multivalent interactions of biomolecules play pivotal roles in physiological and pathological settings. Whereas the directionality of the interactions is crucial, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthetic multivalent ligand&#8211;receptor systems generally lack programmable approaches for orthogonal directionality. Here, we report the design of programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (aptPANs) to direct multivalent aptamer&#8211;receptor binding on the cell interface. The positions of the aptamer motifs can be prescribed on tetrahedral DNA frameworks to realize atom&#8208;like orthogonal valence and direction, enabling the construction of multivalent molecules with fixed aptamer copy numbers but different directionality. These directional&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible aptPAN molecules exhibit the adaptability to the receptor distribution on cell surfaces. We demonstrate the high&#8208;affinity tumor cell binding with a linear aptPAN oligomer (&#8776;13&#8208;fold improved compared to free aptamers), which leads to &#8776;50&#8201;% suppression of cell growth.

         <title>Oxidative Coupling of Methane: Examining the Inactivity of the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalyst at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction, the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst enriched with Q2 units in the SiO2 carrier achieves 23&#8201;% CH4 conversion and 72&#8201;% C2&#8211;3 selectivity at 660&#8201;&#176;C. A large number of Q2 units in MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 is a trigger for markedly lowering the light&#8208;off temperature of the Mn3+&#8596;Mn2+ redox cycle because of the easy formation of MnSiO3.







Abstract
Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) catalyzed by MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 has great industrial promise to convert methane directly to C2&#8211;3 products, but its high light&#8208;off temperature is the most challenging obstacle to commercialization and its working mechanism is still a mystery. We report the discovery of a low&#8208;temperature active and selective MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst enriched with Q2 units in the SiO2 carrier, being capable of converting 23&#8201;% CH4 with 72&#8201;% C2&#8211;3 selectivity at 660&#8201;&#176;C. From experiments and theoretical calculations, a large number of Q2 units in the MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst is a trigger for markedly lowering the light&#8208;off temperature of the Mn3+&#8596;Mn2+ redox cycle involved in the OCM reaction because of the easy formation of MnSiO3. Notably, the MnSiO3 formation proceeds merely through the SiO2&#8208;involved reaction in the presence of Na2WO4: Mn7SiO12+6&#8201;SiO2&#8596;7&#8201;MnSiO3+1.5&#8201;O2. The Na2WO4 not only drives the light&#8208;off of this cycle but also gets it working with substantial selectivity toward C2&#8211;3 products. Our findings shine a light on the rational design of more advanced MnOx&#8208;Na2WO4 based OCM catalysts through establishing new Mn3+&#8596;Mn2+ redox cycles with lowered light&#8208;off temperature.

         <title>Allosteric Binding&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Mechanical&#8208;Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analogous to allosteric enzymes, guest binding introduces a directional pulling or pushing force that acts on the reverse side of a Zn salen complex. This tunable intramolecular force promotes various degrees of conformational and torsional strain, as predicted by both classical conformational analysis and DFT. This strain energy can be further applied to cleave chemical bonds, and the efficiency can be tuned by the identity of the allosteric guest.







Abstract
Recently, polymer mechanochemistry has attracted much scientific interest due to its potential to develop degradable polymers. When the two ends of a polymer chain experience a linear pulling stress, molecular strain builds up, at sufficiently strong force, a bond scission of the weakest covalent bond results. In contrast, bond&#8208;breaking events triggered by conformational stress are much less explored. Here, we discovered that a Zn salen complex would undergo conformational switching upon allosteric complexation with alkanediammonium guests. By controlling the guest chain length, the torsional strain experienced by Zn complex can be modulated to induce bond cleavage with chemical stimulus, and reactivity trend is predicted by conformational analysis derived by DFT calculation. Such strain&#8208;release reactivity by a Zn(salen) complex initiated by guest binding is reminiscent of conformation&#8208;induced reactivity of enzymes to enable chemical events that are otherwise inhibited.

An unprecedentedly large cove&#8208;edged nanographene (NG), hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzo&#8208;bis&#8208;peri&#8208;octacene (HBPO), was synthesized. Different ratios of contorted conformations, &#8220;waggling&#8221; and &#8220;butterfly&#8221;, were found in the crystals. The amplified spontaneous emission, which was previously only reported for zigzag&#8208;edged NGs, can be observed in this cove&#8208;edged NG, thus enriching the choices of edge structures for potential applications in laser cavities.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of an unprecedentedly large cove&#8208;edged nanographene, hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzo&#8208;bis&#8208;peri&#8208;octacene (HBPO), is reported in this work. Chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed multiple conformations in solution. Two different molecular conformations, &#8220;waggling&#8221; and &#8220;butterfly&#8221;, were found in crystals by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the selectivity of conformations could be tuned by solvents. The optoelectronic properties of HBPO were investigated by UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, and DFT calculations. The contorted geometry and branched alkyl groups suppress the aggregation of HBPO in solution, leading to a high fluorescence quantum yield of 79&#8201;%. The optical&#8208;gain properties were explored through transient absorption and amplified spontaneous emission spectroscopies, which enrich the choices of edge structures for potential applications in laser cavities.

         <title>Exploring the Circular Polarization Capacity from Chiral Cellulose Nanocrystal Films for a Photo&#8208;Controlled Chiral Helix of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>

Transmitted circularly polarized light (CPL) and CPL emission were obtained from chiral cellulose nanocrystal films, and these CPL&#8208;active materials were applied for the photo&#8208;induced chiral alignment of supramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) is key to asymmetric photochemistry as it could impart the chiral organization information into chemical products. Here, we demonstrate the circular polarization capacity of chiral cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) films to trigger photo&#8208;alignment of achiral supramolecular polymers into helical structures. Right&#8208;handed transmitted (T&#8208;) CPL was generated from self&#8208;assembled CNC films, which induced amorphous azobenzene (Azo) supramolecular polymers into chiral structures. The chiral induction effect of T&#8208;CPL is enhanced on Azo polymers with longer spacers. The absorptive dissymmetry factor (gabs) values of liquid&#8208;crystal supramolecular polymers can be amplified significantly (over 10&#8197;times) after T&#8208;CPL irradiation. Moreover, by integrating carbon dots into CNC films, CPL emission with a considerable luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) up to &#8722;0.66 was achieved, and it could be used for the photo&#8208;alignment of Azo polymers with high chiroptical properties. This work provides new insight for the photo modulation of supramolecular polymers by CPL&#8208;active materials.

         <title>A Morphing [4Fe&#8208;3S&#8208;nO]&#8208;Cluster within a Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exchange of one amino acid (Cys&#8208;&gt;Glu) coordinating the Ni/Fe/S&#8208;cluster in carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODH) is the main difference resulting in the formation of a Fe/S/O&#8208;hybrid&#8208;cluster, found in CooS&#8208;V, while conserving the overall architecture of CODHs. The Fe/S/O&#8208;hybrid&#8208;cluster in CooS&#8208;V reversibly rearranges dependent on its redox&#8208;state.







Abstract
Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of CO2 to CO. Several anaerobic microorganisms encode multiple CODHs in their genome, of which some, despite being annotated as CODHs, lack a cysteine of the canonical binding motif for the active site Ni,Fe&#8208;cluster. Here, we report on the structure and reactivity of such a deviant enzyme, termed CooS&#8208;VCh. Its structure reveals the typical CODH scaffold, but contains an iron&#8208;sulfur&#8208;oxo hybrid&#8208;cluster. Although closely related to true CODHs, CooS&#8208;VCh catalyzes neither CO oxidation, nor CO2 reduction. The active site of CooS&#8208;VCh undergoes a redox&#8208;dependent restructuring between a reduced [4Fe&#8208;3S]&#8208;cluster and an oxidized [4Fe&#8208;2S&#8208;S*&#8208;2O&#8208;2(H2O)]&#8208;cluster. Hydroxylamine, a slow&#8208;turnover substrate of CooS&#8208;VCh, oxidizes the hybrid&#8208;cluster in two structurally distinct steps. Overall, minor changes in CODHs are sufficient to accommodate a Fe/S/O&#8208;cluster in place of the Ni,Fe&#8208;heterocubane&#8208;cluster of CODHs.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Osmotic Energy Conversion Enabled by Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Membranes with Record Output Power Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process for simultaneous and direct conversion of energy from the low&#8208;gradient heat and salinity differences into electricity was developed using ionic covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework membranes. A higher membrane charge density enables greater ion&#8208;transport resistance. The optimal thermo&#8208;osmotic energy conversion device offers a power density of 231&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 with a temperature difference.







Abstract
A vast amount of energy can be extracted from the untapped low&#8208;grade heat from sources below 100&#8201;&#176;C and the Gibbs free energy from salinity gradients. Therefore, a process for simultaneous and direct conversion of these energies into electricity using permselective membranes was developed in this study. These membranes screen charges of ion flux driven by the combined salinity and temperature gradients to achieve thermo&#8208;osmotic energy conversion. Increasing the charge density in the pore channels enhanced the permselectivity and ion conductance, leading to a larger osmotic voltage and current. A 14&#8208;fold increase in power density was achieved by adjusting the ionic site population of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes. The optimal COF membrane was operated under simulated estuary conditions at a temperature difference of 60&#8197;K, which yielded a power density of &#8776;231&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2, placing it among the best performing upscaled membranes. The developed system can pave the way to the utilization of the enormous supply of untapped osmotic power and low&#8208;grade heat energy, indicating the tremendous potential of using COF membranes for energy conversion applications.

The discovery of ligands for the &#8220;undruggable proteome&#8221; is likely to require the development of new chemical matter with a greater &#8220;molecular wingspan&#8221; than traditional Lipinski&#8208;compliant small molecules. A DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) of non&#8208;peptidic thioether macrocycles has been constructed and screened for high affinity protein ligands to a model protein, SA.







Abstract
There is considerable interest in the development of libraries of non&#8208;peptidic macrocycles as a source of ligands for difficult targets. We report here the solid&#8208;phase synthesis of a DNA&#8208;encoded library of several hundred thousand thioether&#8208;linked macrocycles. The library was designed to be highly diverse with respect to backbone scaffold diversity and to minimize the number of amide N&#8722;H bonds, which compromise cell permeability. The utility of the library as a source of protein ligands is demonstrated through the isolation of compounds that bind Streptavidin, a model target, with high affinity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is considerable interest in the development of libraries of non-peptidic macrocycles as a source of ligands for difficult targets. We report here the solid-phase synthesis of a DNA-encoded library of several hundred thousand thioether-linked macrocycles. The library was designed to be highly diverse with respect to backbone scaffold diversity and to minimize the number of amide N&#8722;H bonds, which compromise cell permeability. The utility of the library as a source of protein ligands is demonstrated through the isolation of compounds that bind Streptavidin, a model target, with high affinity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanographene with Multiple Embedded Heptagons: Cascade Radical Photocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced radical cyclization was used in the synthesis of nanocarbons with embedded heptagons, providing a new approach towards nanocarbons with novel topologies. The nanographene reported herein bears six heptagons, representing the nanocarbon containing the largest number of heptagons by organic synthesis reported to date. The embedded heptagons distort the graphene core into a Monkey&#8208;saddle&#8208;shaped conformation.







Abstract
Although heptagons are widely found in graphenic materials, the precise synthesis of nanocarbons containing heptagons remains a challenge, especially for the nanocarbons containing multiple&#8208;heptagons. Herein, we show that photo&#8208;induced radical cyclization (PIRC) can be used to synthesize multi&#8208;heptagon&#8208;embedded nanocarbons. Notably, a nanographene containing six heptagons (1) was obtained via a six&#8208;fold cascade PIRC reaction. The structure of 1 was clearly validated and showed a Monkey&#8208;saddle&#8208;shaped conformation. Experimental bond analysis and theoretical calculations indicated that the heptagons in 1 were non&#8208;aromatic, whereas the peripheral rings were highly aromatic. Compared to planar nanographene with the same number of &#960; electrons, 1 had a similar optical gap due to a compromise between the decreased conjugation in the wrapped structure and enhanced electronic delocalization at the rim. Electrochemical studies showed that 1 had low&#8208;lying oxidation potentials, which was attributed to the nitrogen&#8208;doping.

         <title>Intrinsic Hole Mobility in Luminescent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks and Its Application in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design concept involving introduction of sp3&#8208;hybridized nitrogen atom to conjugated organic linkers leads to intrinsic hole mobility in a luminescent metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The triarylamine&#8208;based MOF (Zr&#8208;NBP) has strong fluorescence and high hole mobility of 1.05&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. A thin film of Zr&#8208;NBP in pure phase was used directly as an emissive layer (EML) and a hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) in OLED devices.







Abstract
Most metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) lack charge mobility, which is crucial for realizing their use in optoelectronic applications. This work proposes the design of a MOF using triarylamine&#8208;based ligands (Zr&#8208;NBP) as the lone pair electron spacer to enhance the hole mobility in the MOF while maintaining its luminescent properties. Zr&#8208;NBP has strong fluorescence with a good hole mobility of 1.05&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is comparable to organic materials used in optoelectronic devices. We also employed a Zr&#8208;NBP nanofilm in the pure phase as both a non&#8208;doped emissive layer and a hole&#8208;transporting layer within organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The obtained OLED device produced a bright green light with a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.9&#8197;V. This work presents an advance in developing the electronic properties of MOFs by modifying the chemical properties of its building blocks, and will likely inspire further design of MOF materials as active layers in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Exceptional Selectivity to Olefins in the Deoxygenation of Fatty Acids over an Intermetallic Platinum&#8211;Zinc Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report an intermetallic PtZn alloy catalyst for the highly selective production of long&#8208;chain olefins from the direct deoxygenation of fatty acids. In the reaction over conventional metal catalysts like Pt, saturated alkanes are usually obtained as the major decarboxylation product.







Abstract
Direct deoxygenation of long&#8208;chain fatty acids can produce both saturated alkanes (CnH2n+2) and unsaturated olefins (CnH2n). However, the selectivity for the production of olefins via the decarbonylation route is relatively low because of the more favorable decarboxylation pathway. We present an atomically ordered intermetallic PtZn alloy on carbon catalyst (PtZn/C) with a record&#8208;high total selectivity (97&#8201;%) for undecane (C11H24) and undecene (C11H22) in the deoxygenation of lauric acid (C12H24O2). Interestingly, the selectivity for C11H22 is as high as 67.0&#8201;% on PtZn/C, which is significantly higher than that of 27.5&#8201;% obtained on the Pt/C counterpart under the same reaction conditions. Characterization and theoretical calculation results reveal that the intermetallic PtZn alloy not only inhibits the decarboxylation route by increasing the energy barrier of &#8722;COO* cleavage, but also facilitates the decarbonylation route by decreasing CO desorption energy, and therefore the major product is switched from alkanes to olefins.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Phenolic Nanosensitizer Performs Hydrogen Sulfide&#8208;Reprogrammed Oxygen Metabolism for Cancer Radiotherapy Intensification and Immunogenicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;traced metal&#8208;phenolic nanosensitizer was developed that performed H2S&#8208;reprogrammed oxygen metabolism for radiotherapy intensification and immunogenicity. Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX nanoparticles generate H2S under an acidic tumor microenvironment to inhibit mitochondrial respiration and reprogram oxygen metabolism for tumor oxygenation. The chelated Hf ions simultaneously make full use of the preserved oxygen to improve the generation of local reactive oxygen species against tumor cells and to trigger antitumor immune activation.







Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is hampered by the limited oxygen in tumors, which could be potentiated via reprogramming the oxygen metabolism and increasing the oxygen utilization efficiency. Herein, a metal&#8208;phenolic nanosensitizer (Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX) was integrated via an acid&#8208;sensitive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor (polyethylene glycol&#8208;co&#8208;polydithiocarbamates, PEG&#8208;DTC) and a hafnium&#8208;chelated polyphenolic semiconducting polymer (Hf&#8208;PSP) in an amphiphilic polymer (poloxamer F127, PLX). Hf&#8208;PSP&#8208;DTC@PLX elicited a high imaging performance for precise RT and generated H2S to reduce the cellular oxygen consumption rate via mitochondrial respiration inhibition, which reprogrammed the oxygen metabolism for improvement of the tumor oxygenation. Then, Hf&#8208;sensitization could fully utilize the well&#8208;preserved oxygen to intensify RT efficacy and activate immunogenicity. Such a synergistic strategy for improvement of oxygenation and oxygen utilization would have great potential in optimizing oxygen&#8208;dependent therapeutics.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Dearomative Hydrogen Atom Abstraction/ Cyclization Cascade of Indoles</title>

Upon irradiation with visible light and sensitization with thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (TXT), substituted indoles undergo a facile and high&#8208;yielding hydrogen atom transfer/cyclization cascade to dearomatized, spirocyclic products.







Abstract
The photochemical synthesis of yet unknown 2&#8208;oxospiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] (17 examples, 80&#8211;95&#8201;% yield), 2,4&#8208;dioxospiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] (eight examples, 87&#8211;97&#8201;% yield), and 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] (17 examples, 85&#8211;97&#8201;% yield) is described. Starting from readily accessible 3&#8208;substituted indoles, a dearomatization of the indole core was accomplished upon irradiation at &#955;=420&#8197;nm in the presence of thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (10&#8197;mol%) as the sensitizer. Based on mechanistic evidence (triplet energy determination, deuteration experiments, by&#8208;product analysis) it is proposed that the reaction proceeds by energy transfer via a 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;diradical intermediate. The latter intermediates are formed by excited state hydrogen atom transfer from suitable alkyl groups within the C3 substituent to the indole C2 carbon atom. Subsequent ring closure proceeds with pronounced diastereoselectivity to generate a 4&#8208; or 5&#8208;membered spirocyclic dearomatized product with several options for further functionalization.

         <title>Construction of Single&#8208;Crystalline Hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 with Open Nanoarchitectures via Anisotropic&#8208;Kinetics Transformation for the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy is developed to synthesize single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with highly open nanoarchitectures and different compositions. The as&#8208;prepared ZSM&#8208;5 nanocages exhibit remarkably improved catalytic lifetime and reduced coke formation rate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction.







Abstract
We report an anisotropic&#8208;kinetics transformation strategy to prepare single&#8208;crystalline aluminosilicate MFI zeolites (ZSM&#8208;5) with highly open nanoarchitectures and hierarchical porosities. The methodology relies on the cooperative effect of in situ etching and recrystallization on the evolution of pure&#8208;silica MFI zeolite (silicalite&#8208;1) nanotemplates under hydrothermal conditions. The strategy enables a controllable preparation of ZSM&#8208;5 nanostructures with diverse open geometries by tuning the relative rate difference between etching and recrystallization processes. Meanwhile, it can also be extended to synthesize other heteroatom&#8208;substituted MFI zeolite nanocages. Compared with conventional ZSM&#8208;5 microcrystals, nanocrystals, and nanoboxes, the ZSM&#8208;5 nanocages with single&#8208;crystalline nature, highly open nanoarchitectures, and hierarchical porosities exhibit remarkably enhanced catalytic lifetime and low coking rate in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction.

Host&#8211;guest electron transfer (HGET) plays a fundamental role in host&#8211;guest chemistry to modulate the functionality of molecular frameworks. In their Research Article (e202115976), Hitoshi Miyasaka and co&#8208;workers introduce this concept for a redox&#8208;active magnetic metal&#8211;organic framework, achieving a guest&#8208;induced magnetic phase transition between a guest&#8208;free antiferromagnet and a guest&#8208;containing paramagnet, which may aid the design of novel porous magnets.

         <title>Cover Picture: Shape&#8208;Shifting Molecules: Unveiling the Valence Tautomerism Phenomena in Bare Barbaralones (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 18/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;shifting molecules were probed in the gas phase, which conclusively unveiled the valence tautomerism phenomena for an archetypal barbaralone as described by Jos&#233; L. Alonso et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202117045). The two valence tautomers of this bistable molecular system were isolated in a supersonic jet for the first time and characterized by high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy coupled with laser ablation techniques. This observation opens the door towards the characterization of new fluxional systems under isolation conditions.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Gadolinium Changes the Local Electron Densities of Nickel 3d Orbitals for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 18/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N ternary doped porous carbon black catalyst was developed for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, as reported by Lang Xu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202201166). NiI active sites with high product selectivity and Ni nanoparticles with high conductivity are integrated within one catalyst. The Gd atoms not only tailor the sizes of the Ni nanoparticles but also change the local densities of the Ni 3d orbitals, thus enabling the catalyst to achieve high faradaic efficiency, large current density, and excellent stability.

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on intracellular supramolecular self&#8208;assembly that follows different strategies via host&#8211;guest interactions, enzymes, and polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. The resulting in cellulo non&#8208;natural aggregates, including nanofibers, gels, nanoparticles, and colloidal droplets of coacervate, exhibit a variety of topological structures suitable for applications ranging from cancer treatment to bioimaging.







Abstract
Supramolecular interactions rely on non&#8208;covalent forces, such as hydrophobic effects, hydrogen&#8208;bonding, and electrostatic interactions, which govern many intracellular biological pathways. In cellulo supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is mainly based on host&#8211;guest interactions, changes in pH, enzymes, and polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly to accurately induce various unnatural reactions without disturbing natural biological processes. This process can produce synthetic biocompatible macromolecules to control cell properties and regulate biological functions, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. This Minireview focuses on the latest reports in the field of in cellulo supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and anticipates future advances regarding its activation in response to internal and external stimuli, such as pH changes, reactive oxygen species, and enzymes, as well as external light illumination.

         <dc:description>
Optical biosensors are important tools for basic research and non&#8208;invasive diagnostics. Carbon nanotubes are versatile near&#8208;infrared fluorescent and non&#8208;bleaching materials that can be chemically functionalized to detect a broad variety of biomolecules. This Review highlights chemical design strategies and provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in this dynamic field.







Abstract
Biosensors are powerful tools for modern basic research and biomedical diagnostics. Their development requires substantial input from the chemical sciences. Sensors or probes with an optical readout, such as fluorescence, offer rapid, minimally invasive sensing of analytes with high spatial and temporal resolution. The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region is beneficial because of the reduced background and scattering of biological samples (tissue transparency window) in this range. In this context, single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have emerged as versatile NIR fluorescent building blocks for biosensors. Here, we provide an overview of advances in SWCNT&#8208;based NIR fluorescent molecular sensors. We focus on chemical design strategies for diverse analytes and summarize insights into the photophysics and molecular recognition. Furthermore, different application areas are discussed&#8212;from chemical imaging of cellular systems and diagnostics to in&#8197;vivo applications and perspectives for the future.

         <title>A Desaturative Approach for Aromatic Aldehyde Synthesis via Synergistic Enamine, Photoredox and Cobalt Triple Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>

Synergistic enamine, photoredox and cobalt triple catalysis enables a desaturative approach for the preparation of aromatic aldehydes.







Abstract
Aromatic aldehydes are fundamental intermediates that are widely utilised for the synthesis of important materials across the broad spectrum of chemical industries. Accessing highly substituted derivatives can often be difficult as their functionalizations are generally performed via electrophilic aromatic substitution, SEAr. Here we provide an alternative and mechanistically distinct approach whereby aromatic aldehydes are assembled from saturated precursors via a desaturative process. This novel strategy harnesses the high&#8208;fidelity of Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions to quickly construct multi&#8208;substituted cyclohexenecarbaldehyde cores which undergo desaturation via the synergistic interplay of enamine, photoredox and cobalt triple catalysis.

         <title>The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Glycoprotein Directly Binds Exogeneous Sialic Acids: A NMR View</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR experiments using 13C&#8208;labelled sialyl&#8208;containing trisaccharides unequivocally demonstrate that the N&#8208;terminal domain of the Spike (S) SARS CoV&#8208;2 glycoprotein directly binds sialic acid residues, highlighting the possibility of additional cellular receptor loci for the viral S protein at our cells.







Abstract
The interaction of the SARS CoV2 spike glycoprotein with two sialic acid&#8208;containing trisaccharides (&#945;2,3 and &#945;2,6 sialyl N&#8208;acetyllactosamine) has been demonstrated by NMR.

&lt;p&gt;NMR experiments using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-labelled sialyl-containing trisaccharides unequivocally demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of the Spike (S) SARS CoV-2 glycoprotein directly binds sialic acid residues, highlighting the possibility of additional cellular receptor loci for the viral S protein at our cells.

         <title>Amorphous Boron Carbide on Titanium Dioxide Nanobelt Arrays for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalytic NO Reduction to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti acts as an efficient and stable 3D electrocatalyst for converting NO to NH3, exhibiting an NH3 yield of 3678.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 87.6&#8201;%. An a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Zn&#8722;NO battery achieves both high power densities and NH3 yields. An in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms is gained by density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic NO reduction is regarded as an attractive strategy to degrade the NO contaminant into useful NH3, but the lack of efficient and stable electrocatalysts to facilitate such multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer processes impedes its applications. Here, we report on developing amorphous B2.6C supported on a TiO2 nanoarray on a Ti plate (a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti) as an NH3&#8208;producing nanocatalyst with appreciable activity and durability toward the NO electroreduction. It shows a yield of 3678.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a FE of 87.6&#8201;%, superior to TiO2/Ti (563.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 42.6&#8201;%) and a&#8208;B2.6C/Ti (2499.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 85.6&#8201;%). An a&#8208;B2.6C@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Zn&#8722;NO battery achieves a power density of 1.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 1125&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. An in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic mechanisms is gained by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Synthesis of Molecular Phenylcalcium Derivatives: Application to the Formation of Biaryls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolable and hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble &#946;&#8208;diketiminato calcium phenyls are accessible from the reaction of Ph2Hg and [(BDI)CaH]2. The compounds were shown to react with bromoarenes through a direct SNAr displacement of halide, leading to the uncatalyzed formation of biaryl molecules.







Abstract
Hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble &#946;&#8208;diketiminato phenylcalcium derivatives, which display various modes of Ca&#8722;&#956;2&#8208;Ph&#8722;Ca bridging, are accessible from reactions of Ph2Hg and [(BDI)CaH]2. Although the resultant compounds are inert toward the C&#8722;H bonds of benzene, they yield selective and uncatalyzed biaryl formation when reacted with readily available aryl bromides.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Hosted Enzymes for Continuous Flow Catalysis in Aqueous and Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flow enzyme reactor was developed using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to immobilize the enzyme. The MOF NU&#8208;1000 was inserted into a HPLC column and loaded with esterase without any modification of the MOF or the enzyme. A high space&#8208;time yield of 1432&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved, and the stability of the immobilized enzyme was enhanced to about 30 times that of the free enzyme.







Abstract
Fully exploiting the potential of enzymes in cell&#8208;free biocatalysis requires stabilization of the catalytically active proteins and their integration into efficient reactor systems. Although in recent years initial steps towards the immobilization of such biomolecules in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been taken, these demonstrations have been limited to batch experiments and to aqueous conditions. Here we demonstrate a MOF&#8208;based continuous flow enzyme reactor system, with high productivity and stability, which is also suitable for organic solvents. Under aqueous conditions, the stability of the enzyme was increased 30&#8208;fold, and the space&#8211;time yield exceeded that obtained with other enzyme immobilization strategies by an order of magnitude. Importantly, the infiltration of the proteins into the MOF did not require additional functionalization, thus allowing for time&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient fabrication of the biocatalysts using label&#8208;free enzymes.

         <title>Selective Catalytic Oxidation of Methane to Methanol in Aqueous Medium over Copper Cations Promoted by Atomically Dispersed Rhodium on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Rh on TiO2 was used for the oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen under mild conditions. Promoted by copper cations, the Rh/TiO2 catalysts produced a millimole level of methanol with a selectivity higher than 99&#8201;%. Copper maintained the low&#8208;valence state of Rh. Moreover, copper acted as a scavenger for suppressing the overoxidation, thus leading to the high selectivity of methanol.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane into value&#8208;added chemicals, such as methanol under mild conditions, is a promising route for industrial applications. In this work, atomically dispersed Rh on TiO2 suspended in an aqueous solution was used for the oxidation of methane to methanol. Promoted by copper cations (as co&#8208;catalyst) in solution, the catalysts exhibited high activity and selectivity for the production of methanol using molecular oxygen with the presence of carbon monoxide at 150&#8201;&#176;C with a reaction pressure of 31&#8197;bar. Millimole level yields of methanol were reached with the selectivity higher than 99&#8201;% using the Rh/TiO2 catalysts with the promotion of the copper cation. CO was the reductive agent to generate H2 from H2O, which led to the formation of H2O2 through the reaction of H2 and O2. Atomically dispersed Rh activated the C&#8722;H bond in CH4 and catalyzed the oxidation using H2O2. Copper cations maintained the low&#8208;valence state of Rh. Moreover, copper acted as a scavenger for suppressing the overoxidation, thus leading to the high selectivity of methanol.

Copper maintained the low-valence state of Rh. Moreover, copper acted as a scavenger for suppressing the overoxidation, thus leading to the high selectivity of methanol.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct conversion of methane into value-added chemicals, such as methanol under mild conditions, is a promising route for industrial applications. In this work, atomically dispersed Rh on TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; suspended in an aqueous solution was used for the oxidation of methane to methanol. Promoted by copper cations (as co-catalyst) in solution, the catalysts exhibited high activity and selectivity for the production of methanol using molecular oxygen with the presence of carbon monoxide at 150&#8201;&#176;C with a reaction pressure of 31&#8197;bar. Millimole level yields of methanol were reached with the selectivity higher than 99&#8201;% using the Rh/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts with the promotion of the copper cation. CO was the reductive agent to generate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which led to the formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the reaction of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Atomically dispersed Rh activated the C&#8722;H bond in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and catalyzed the oxidation using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Copper cations maintained the low-valence state of Rh. Moreover, copper acted as a scavenger for suppressing the overoxidation, thus leading to the high selectivity of methanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alternating Current Electrolysis Enabled Formal C&#8722;O/O&#8722;H Cross&#8208;Metathesis of 4&#8208;Alkoxy Anilines with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel alternating current promoted formal C&#8722;O/O&#8722;H cross&#8208;metathesis reaction of 4&#8208;alkoxy anilines with alcohols has been developed for the first time.







Abstract
While multiple bond metathesis reactions, for example olefin metathesis, have seen considerable recent progress, direct metathesis of traditionally inert C&#8722;O single bonds is extremely rare and particularly challenging. Undoubtedly, metathesis reaction of C&#8722;O bonds is one of the most ideal routes for the value&#8208;added upgrading of molecules involving C&#8722;O bonds. Reported here is a new protocol to achieve the formal C&#8722;O/O&#8722;H cross&#8208;metathesis via alternating current electrolysis. Featuring mild reaction conditions, the protocol allows readily available 4&#8208;alkoxy anilines and alcohols to be converted into a wide range of valuable products in highly regioselective and chemoselective manner. Moreover, the present strategy can be used in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals as well as biologically active compounds, which demonstrated the potential application.

         <title>Haptotropism in a Nickel Complex with a Neutral, &#960;&#8208;Bridging cyclo&#8208;P4 Ligand Analogous to Cyclobutadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;dependent reaction of white phosphorus with a Ni0 reagent incorporating a chelating bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) leads to complexes with neutral P2 and P4 ligands. The latter mirrors the coordination of cyclobutadiene to Ni0, displaying olefin&#8208;like bonding and &#951;2&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;haptotropism, and can be converted to the former. These findings emphasize the fluidity of cyclo&#8208;P4 coordination modes.







Abstract
Dedicated to Professor Manfred Scheer on the occasion of his 65th birthday
The reaction of (1)Ni(&#951;2&#8208;cod), 2, incorporating a chelating bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) 1, with P4 in pentane yielded the dinuclear complex [(2)Ni]2(&#956;2,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;P4), 3, formally featuring a cyclobutadiene&#8208;like, neutral, rectangular, &#960;&#8208;bridging P4&#8208;ring. In toluene, the butterfly&#8208;shaped complex [(1)Ni]2(&#956;2,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;P2), 4, with a formally neutral P2&#8208;unit was obtained from 2 and either P4 or 3. Computational studies showed that a haptotropic rearrangement involving two isomers of the &#956;2,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;P4 coordination mode and a low&#8208;energy &#956;2,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;P4 coordination mode, as previously predicted for related nickel cyclobutadiene complexes, could explain the coalescence observed in the low&#8208;temperature NMR spectra of 3. The insertion of the (1)Ni fragment into a P&#8722;P bond of P7(SiMe3)3, forming complex 5 with a norbornane&#8208;like P7 ligand, was also observed.

         <title>Selective Coupling of 1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;Boronic Esters at the more Substituted Site through Visible&#8208;Light Activation of Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;selective monofunctionalization of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters was achieved by using a catalyst&#8208;free photoinduced coupling with (hetero)aryl nitriles. The reaction proceeds through electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;driven deboronation and radical 1,2&#8208;boron shift, giving &#946;&#8208;aryl primary boronic ester products. The reaction also works with primary, secondary, and tertiary boronic esters.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;boronic esters are useful synthetic intermediates particularly as the two boronic esters can be selectively functionalized. Usually, the less hindered primary boronic ester reacts, but herein, we report a coupling reaction that enables the reversal of this selectivity. This is achieved through the formation of a boronate complex with an electron&#8208;rich aryllithium which, in the presence of an electron&#8208;deficient aryl nitrile, leads to the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex. Following visible&#8208;light photoinduced electron transfer, a primary radical is generated which isomerizes to the more stable secondary radical before radical&#8208;radical coupling with the arene radical&#8208;anion, giving &#946;&#8208;aryl primary boronic ester products. The reactions proceed under catalyst&#8208;free conditions. This method also allows stereodivergent coupling of cyclic cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters to provide trans&#8208;substituted products, complementing the selectivity observed in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Doped Highly Graphitic Carbon Urchin&#8208;Like Hollow Structures Loaded with Single&#8208;Ni Atoms towards Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow porous urchin&#8208;like N&#8208;doped carbon structures with abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites (Ni&#8208;NC(HPU)) are fabricated by a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed and Ni&#8208;templated strategy. The unique hollow thorns on the surface, high accessible surface area and good conductivity enable effective electron/mass transfer and afford numerous singe&#8208;Ni sites towards highly efficient CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
The rational design of single&#8208;atom catalysts featuring excellent conductivity, highly accessible discrete active sites and favorable mass transfer is crucial for electrocatalysis but remains challenging. In this study, a reliable Ni&#8208;catalyzed and Ni&#8208;templated strategy is developed to synthesize a single&#8208;atom catalyst by transforming metallic Ni into single&#8208;Ni atoms anchored on hollow porous urchin&#8208;like (HPU) N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(HPU)), which possesses high crystallinity and sufficient Ni&#8208;N4 moiety (2.4&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The unique hollow thorns on the surface, good conductivity and large external surface area facilitate electron/mass transfer and exposure of single&#8208;Ni sites. As a result, the Ni&#8208;NC(HPU) catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and high stability for CO2 electroreduction. Moreover, this synthetic strategy can also be facilely extended to prepare distinct hollow porous architectures with similar components, such as the wire&#8208; and sphere&#8208;like ones.

&lt;p&gt;Hollow porous urchin-like N-doped carbon structures with abundant accessible single-Ni sites (Ni-NC(HPU)) are fabricated by a novel Ni-catalyzed and Ni-templated strategy. The unique hollow thorns on the surface, high accessible surface area and good conductivity enable effective electron/mass transfer and afford numerous singe-Ni sites towards highly efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rational design of single-atom catalysts featuring excellent conductivity, highly accessible discrete active sites and favorable mass transfer is crucial for electrocatalysis but remains challenging. In this study, a reliable Ni-catalyzed and Ni-templated strategy is developed to synthesize a single-atom catalyst by transforming metallic Ni into single-Ni atoms anchored on hollow porous urchin-like (HPU) N-doped carbon (NC) (designated as Ni-NC(HPU)), which possesses high crystallinity and sufficient Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; moiety (2.4&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The unique hollow thorns on the surface, good conductivity and large external surface area facilitate electron/mass transfer and exposure of single-Ni sites. As a result, the Ni-NC(HPU) catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and high stability for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction. Moreover, this synthetic strategy can also be facilely extended to prepare distinct hollow porous architectures with similar components, such as the wire- and sphere-like ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Shifting Molecules: Unveiling the Valence Tautomerism Phenomena in Bare Barbaralones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two valence tautomers have been revealed in the supersonic expansion for an archetypal fluxional molecule phenyl&#8208;barbaralone, providing definite experimental evidence of the [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement in these shape&#8208;shifting systems.







Abstract
We report a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic study of an archetypical barbaralone, conclusively revealing the valence tautomerism phenomena for this bistable molecular system. The two distinct 1&#8208; and 5&#8208;substituted valence tautomers have been isolated in a supersonic expansion for the first time and successfully characterized by high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy. This work provides irrefutable experimental evidence of the [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement in barbaralones and highlights the use of rotational spectroscopy to analyze shape&#8208;shifting mixtures. Moreover, this observation opens the window toward the characterization of new fluxional systems in the isolation conditions of the gas phase and should serve as a reference point in the general understanding of valence tautomerism.

         <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Covalent Triazine Frameworks in a NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 Eutectic Salt for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent triazine&#8208;based frameworks with ordered molecular structures were synthesized in a ternary NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 eutectic salt system at 200&#8201;&#176;C to produce photocatalysts for hydrogen production.







Abstract
Covalent triazine&#8208;based frameworks (CTFs) are typically produced by the salt&#8208;melt polycondensation of aromatic nitriles in the presence of ZnCl2. In this reaction, molten ZnCl2 salt acts as both a solvent and Lewis acid catalyst. However, when cyclotrimerization takes place at temperatures above 300&#8201;&#176;C, undesired carbonization occurs. In this study, an ionothermal synthesis method for CTF&#8208;based photocatalysts was developed using a ternary NaCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;ZnCl2 eutectic salt (ES) mixture with a melting point of approximately 200&#8201;&#176;C. This temperature is lower than the melting point of pure ZnCl2 (318&#8201;&#176;C), thus providing milder salt&#8208;melt conditions. These conditions facilitated the polycondensation process, while avoiding carbonization of the polymeric backbone. The resulting CTF&#8208;ES200 exhibited enhanced optical and electronic properties, and displayed remarkable photocatalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Self&#8208;Replication Allows Selection for Dynamic Kinetic Stability in a System of Competing Replicators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 18, April 25, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two competing self&#8208;replicators are formed from two different dithiol building blocks through oxidation and disulfide exchange. The self&#8208;replicators differ in their size, building block composition, and dynamic kinetic stability. The slower replicator prevails over the faster competitor in a closed vial, but the outcome of the competition is reversed in an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium replication&#8211;destruction regime, implemented in a flow system.







Abstract
Among the key characteristics of living systems are their ability to self&#8208;replicate and the fact that they exist in an open system away from equilibrium. Herein, we show how the outcome of the competition between two self&#8208;replicators, differing in size and building block composition, is different depending on whether the experiments are conducted in a closed vial or in an open and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium replication&#8211;destruction regime. In the closed system, the slower replicator eventually prevails over the faster competitor. In a replication&#8208;destruction regime, implemented through a flow system, the outcome of the competition is reversed and the faster replicator dominates. The interpretation of the experimental observations is supported by a mass&#8208;action&#8208;kinetics model. These results represent one of the few experimental manifestations of selection among competing self&#8208;replicators based on dynamic kinetic stability and pave the way towards Darwinian evolution of abiotic systems.

         <title>Fibrous Nanoreactors from Microfluidic Blow Spinning for Mass Production of Highly Stable Ligand&#8208;Free Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;reactors have emerged as a powerful platform for chemical synthesis. Here, we develop fiber&#8208;spinning chemistry (FSC) based on a microfluidic blow spinning (  MBS  ) technique, allowing the availability of nanoreactors for chemical synthesis with scale&#8208;up capacities. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments focus on the utilization of MBS&#8208;derived fibrous nanoreactors for large&#8208;scale production of ligand&#8208;free perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) in one step. Typically, methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX  3  , X = Cl, Br, and I) PQDs  in situ  synthesized at large scale inside polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber films (size 120 cm &#215; 30 cm per hour), exhibit high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) of 71%, tunable emissive peaks (448&#8208;600 nm), and superb PL stability. The PQDs/polymer nanofiber films are potentially useful for CO  2  conversion, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays and light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices. These findings may guide the development of nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;reactor technology for scale&#8208;up production of nanomaterials with various potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Metalating Efficiency of the Sodium Amide NaTMP in Arene Borylation Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though LiTMP (TMP = 2,2&#8217;,6,6&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) is a commonly used amide, surprisingly the heavier NaTMP has hardly been utilised. Here, by mixing NaTMP with tridentate donor PMDETA (  N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;  &#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine), we provide structural, and mechanistic insights into the sodiation of non&#8208;activated arenes (e.g. anisole and benzene). While these reactions are low yielding, adding B(O  i  Pr)  3  has a profound effect, not only by intercepting the C  Ar  &#8208;Na bond, but also by driving the metalation reaction towards quantitative formation of more stabilized sodium aryl boronates. Demonstrating its metalating power, regioselective C2&#8208;metalation/borylation of naphthalene has been accomplished contrasting with single&#8208;metal based protocols which are unselective and low yielding. Extension to other arenes allows for  in situ  generation of aryl boronates which can then directly engage in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings, furnishing a range of biaryls in a selective and efficient manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong and Reversible Covalent Double Network Hydrogel Based on Force&#8208;coupled Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological load&#8208;bearing tissues are strong, tough, and recoverable under periodic mechanical loads. However, such features have rarely been achieved simultaneously in the same synthetic hydrogels. Here, we use a force&#8208;coupled enzymatic reaction to tune a strong covalent peptide linkage to a reversible bond. Based on this concept we engineered double network hydrogels that combine high mechanical strength and reversible mechanical recovery in the same hydrogels. Specifically, we found that a peptide ligase, sortase A, can promote the proteolysis of peptides under force. The peptide bond can be re&#8208;ligated by the same enzyme in the absence of force. This allows the sacrificial network in the double&#8208;network hydrogels to be ruptured and rebuilt reversibly. Our results demonstrate a general approach for precisely controlling the mechanical and dynamic properties of hydrogels at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Compensation in Displacement Mg2+ Storage Cathode through Polyselenide Mediated Anion Redox</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenides have been viewed as important conversion&#8208;type Mg  2+  &#8208;storage cathodes to fulfill the high volumetric energy density promise of magnesium (Mg) batteries. However, the low initial Columbic efficiency and the rapid capacity degradation remain challenges for the chalcogenide cathodes, as the clear Mg  2+  &#8208;storage mechanism has yet to be clarified. Herein, we illustrate that the charge storage mechanism of Cu  2&#8722;x  Se cathode is a reversible displacement reaction along with polyselenide (PSe) mediated solution process of anion&#8208;compensation. The unique anion redox improves charge storage, while the dissolution of PSe also leads to performance degradation. To address this issue, we introduce Mo  6  S  8  into Cu  2&#8722;x  Se cathode to immobilize PSe, which significantly improves performance, especially the reversible capacity (from 140 mAh g  &#8722;1  to 220 mAh g  &#8722;1  ). This work provides inspirations for the modification of Mg  2+  &#8208;storage cathode, which is a milestone for high performance Mg batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3,2&#8208;Diazaphospholene&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cyclizations of Organohalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholenes hydrides (DAP&#8208;Hs) are highly nucleophilic organic hydrides serving as main&#8208;group catalysts for a range of attractive transformations. DAP hydrides can act as stoichiometric hydrogen atom transfer agents in radical reactions. Herein, we report a DAP&#8208;catalyzed reductive radical cyclization of a broad range of aryl and alkyl halides under mild conditions. The pivotal DAP catalyst turnover was achieved by a DBU&#8208;assisted  &#963;  &#8208;bond metathesis between the formed DAP halide and HBpin rapidly regenerating DAP&#8208;H. The transformation is significantly accelerated by irradiation with visible light. Mechanistic investigations indicate that visible light irradiation leads to the formation of DAP dimers which are in equilibrium with the DAP radicals accelerating the cyclization. The direct use of (DAP)  2  enabled a catalytic protocol in the absence of light.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Decomposition of Long&#8208;Chain Olefins to Propylene via Isomerization&#8208;Metathesis Using Latent Bicyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene&#8208;Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;One of the most emerging scientific challenges today is the catalytic degradation of non&#8208;biodegradable polymers into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks. The mild pyrolysis of polyolefins, including high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), results in pyrolysis oils containing&#160;long&#8208;chain olefins&#160;as major products. In this paper, novel BICAAC&#8208;Ru&#160;temperature&#8208;activated&#160;latent olefin metathesis catalysts (14,&#160;16,&#160;18&#8211;20), which can be used for catalytic decomposition of long&#8208;chain olefins to propylene are reported. These thermally stable catalysts show significantly higher&#160;selectivity to propylene&#160;at a reaction temperature of 75&#160;&#176;C compared to second generation Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs (HG2) or CAAC&#8208;Ru catalysts (1&#8208;3) under ethenolysis conditions. The conversion of long&#8208;chain olefins (e.g., 1&#8208;octadecene or methyl oleate) to propylene&#160;via&#160;isomerization&#8208;metathesis (ISOMET) is performed by using a&#160;(RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3&#160;(RuH) isomerization co&#8208;catalyst. The reactions can be carried out at a BICAAC&#8208;Ru catalysts loading as low as 1 ppm at elevated reaction temperature (75&#160;&#176;C). The observed turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) are as high as 55000 and 10000 molpropylene&#160;&#8226; molcatalyst&#8208;1&#160;&#8226; h&#8208;1, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Atom Transfer Driven Enantioselective Minisci Reaction of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic enantioselective Minisci reactions have recently been developed but all instances so far utilize &#945;&#8208;amino radical coupling partners. We report a substantial evolution of the enantioselective Minisci reaction that enables &#945;&#8208;hydroxy radicals to be used, providing valuable enantioenriched secondary alcohol products. This is achieved through the direct oxidative coupling of two C&#8208;H bonds on simple alcohol and pyridine partners through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)&#8208;driven approach, a challenging process to achieve due to the numerous side reactions that can occur. Our approach is highly regioselective as well as highly enantioselective. Dicumyl peroxide, upon irradiation with 390 nm light, serves as both HAT reagent and oxidant whilst selectivity is controlled by use of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst. Computational and experimental evidence provide mechanistic insight as to the origin of selectivity, revealing a stereodetermining deprotonation step distinct from the analogous reaction of amide&#8208;containing substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Synthetic Affinity Probe Reveals Inhibitory Synapse Ultrastructure and Brain Connectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visualization of inhibitory synapses requires protocols tailored to different sample types and imaging techniques, and usually relies on genetic manipulation or the use of antibodies that underperform in tissue immunofluorescence. Starting from an endogenous ligand of gephyrin, a universal marker of the inhibitory synapse, we developed a short peptidic binder and dimerized it, significantly increasing affinity and selectivity. We further tailored fluorophores to the binder, yielding &#8220;Sylite&#8221; &#8211; a probe with outstanding signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio that outperforms antibodies in tissue staining with rapid and efficient penetration, mitigation of staining artifacts, and simplified handling. In super&#8208;resolution microscopy Sylite precisely localizes the inhibitory synapse and enables nanoscale measurements. Sylite profiles inhibitory inputs and synapse sizes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the midbrain and combined with complimentary tracing techniques reveals the synaptic connectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fusion of Multi&#8208;Resonance Fragment with Conventional Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon for Nearly BT.2020 Green Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through precise synthetic fusion of a multi&#8208;resonance fragment with a conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), ultrapure green BN&#8208;ICz emitters were successfully constructed. The optimal bottom&#8208;emitting OLED exhibits a record&#8208;high CIEy value of 0.74 with a high EQE of 30.5&#8201;%. The top&#8208;emitting OLED not only achieves the BT.2020 green color (CIE: 0.17, 0.78), but also shows a leading performance with current efficiency up to 220&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general strategy for achieving ultra&#8208;pure green emissions by suppressing the shoulder peaks in the emission spectra of conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Through precise synthetic fusion of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) fragments with conventional PAH, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, increased molecular rigidity, and reduced vibrational frequency could be simultaneously realized. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters exhibited ultra&#8208;pure green emissions with dominant peaks at ca. 521&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields that are greater than 99&#8201;%, a small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 23&#8197;nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.77). The bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibited a record&#8208;high CIEy value of 0.74 and a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.5&#8201;%. The top&#8208;emitting OLED not only achieved a BT.2020 green color (CIE: 0.17, 0.78) for the first time but also showed superior performance among all green OLED devices, with a current efficiency of 220&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;.

         <title>LiBF4&#8208;Induced Rearrangement and Desymmetrization of a Palladium&#8208;Ligand Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Template&#8208;induced complexity: LiBF4 induces the rearrangement of a homoleptic Pd2L4 complex into a Pd4L8 assembly. The complex shows a folded, highly compact structure, with a low apparent symmetry and two highly specific binding pockets.







Abstract
Thirteen palladium&#8208;ligand assemblies with different structures and topologies were investigated for the ability to bind lithium ions. In one case, the addition of LiBF4 resulted in a profound structural rearrangement, converting a dincluclear [Pd2L4]4+ complex into a low&#8208;symmetry [Pd4L8]8+ assembly with two binding pockets for solvated LiBF4 ion pairs. The rearrangement could only be induced by Li+, indicating highly specific host&#8211;guest interactions. A structural analysis of the [Pd4L8]8+ receptor revealed a compact structure with multiple intramolecular interactions, reminiscent of what is seen for natural and synthetic foldamers.

&lt;p&gt;Template-induced complexity: LiBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; induces the rearrangement of a homoleptic Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complex into a Pd&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; assembly. The complex shows a folded, highly compact structure, with a low apparent symmetry and two highly specific binding pockets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen palladium-ligand assemblies with different structures and topologies were investigated for the ability to bind lithium ions. In one case, the addition of LiBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; resulted in a profound structural rearrangement, converting a dincluclear [Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; complex into a low-symmetry [Pd&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;8+&lt;/sup&gt; assembly with two binding pockets for solvated LiBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ion pairs. The rearrangement could only be induced by Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating highly specific host&#8211;guest interactions. A structural analysis of the [Pd&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;8+&lt;/sup&gt; receptor revealed a compact structure with multiple intramolecular interactions, reminiscent of what is seen for natural and synthetic foldamers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterocyclic Conjugated Polymer Nanoarchitectonics with Synergistic Redox&#8208;Active Sites for High&#8208;Performance Aluminium Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic C=O/C=N redox centre strategy has been demonstrated to realise high&#8208;performance Al&#8211;organic batteries using a heteroatom &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer cathode in a low&#8208;cost AlCl3/urea electrolyte. The fused C=N sites in the polymer not only contribute good &#960;&#8208;conjugation but also assist neighbouring C=O to uptake four AlCl2(urea)2+ per repeating unit, enabling batteries with high capacity, long cyclability, and high energy density.







Abstract
The development of cost&#8208;effective and long&#8208;life rechargeable aluminium ion batteries (AIBs) shows promising prospects for sustainable energy storage applications. Here, we report a heteroatom &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer featuring synergistic C=O and C=N active centres as a new cathode material in AIBs using a low&#8208;cost AlCl3/urea electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the fused C=N sites in the polymer not only benefit good &#960;&#8208;conjugation but also enhance the redox reactivity of C=O sites, which enables the polymer to accommodate four AlCl2(urea)2+ per repeating unit. By integrating the polymer with carbon nanotubes, the hybrid cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity and a long cycle life (295&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 85&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 4000&#8197;cycles). The achieved specific energy density of 413&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 outperforms most Al&#8211;organic batteries reported to date. The synergistic redox&#8208;active sites strategy sheds light on the rational design of organic electrode materials.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Zeolitic Organic Framework**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of zeolite&#8208;like crystalline porous organic materials, ZOF&#8208;1 with high chemical stability, large pore size (up to 16&#8197;&#197;), and excellent specific surface area (&#8776;2785&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) is reported. It is superior to its analogues with the same network, including traditional aluminosilicate zeolites and zeolitic imidazole frameworks.







Abstract
The development of novel zeolite&#8208;like materials with large channel windows and high stability is of importance but remains a tremendous challenge. Herein, we report the first example of a 3D covalent organic framework with zeolitic network, namely the zeolitic organic framework (ZOF). By combining two kinds of tetrahedral building blocks with fixed or relatively free bond angles, ZOF&#8208;1 with the zeolitic crb net has been successfully synthesized. Its structure was determined by the single&#8208;crystal 3D electron diffraction technique. Remarkably, ZOF&#8208;1 shows high chemical stability, large pore size (up to 16&#8197;&#197;), and excellent specific surface area (&#8776;2785&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), which is superior to its analogues with the same network, including traditional aluminosilicate zeolites and zeolitic imidazole frameworks. This study thus opens a new avenue to construct zeolite&#8208;like materials with pure organic frameworks and will promote their potential applications in adsorption and catalysis for macromolecules.

         <title>Functionalized Acyclic (l)&#8208;Threoninol Nucleic Acid Four&#8208;Way Junction with High Stability In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oligonucleotide analogue (l)&#8208;aTNA forms a highly stable four&#8208;way junction, which is used to assemble multiple components conjugated to the short (l)&#8208;aTNA strands. This represents a modular approach to assemble multifunctional drug structures. The cellular targeting of a structure containing a HER2 nanobody is shown in vitro and the circulation of a fatty acid functionalized structure is shown in vivo.







Abstract
Oligonucleotides are increasingly being used as a programmable connection material to assemble molecules and proteins in well&#8208;defined structures. For the application of such assemblies for in vivo diagnostics or therapeutics it is crucial that the oligonucleotides form highly stable, non&#8208;toxic, and non&#8208;immunogenic structures. Only few oligonucleotide derivatives fulfil all of these requirements. Here we report on the application of acyclic l&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (aTNA) to form a four&#8208;way junction (4WJ) that is highly stable and enables facile assembly of components for in vivo treatment and imaging. The aTNA 4WJ is serum&#8208;stable, shows no non&#8208;targeted uptake or cytotoxicity, and invokes no innate immune response. As a proof of concept, we modify the 4WJ with a cancer&#8208;targeting and a serum half&#8208;life extension moiety and show the effect of these functionalized 4WJs in vitro and in vivo, respectively.

         <title>Enantio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Regioselective Synthesis of Chiral Cyclic and Acyclic gem&#8208;Difluoromethylenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition between substituted&#8208;2&#8208;alkylidenetrimethylene carbonates and cyclic or acyclic gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl ketones enabled the synthesis of chiral gem&#8208;difluoromethylene compounds. A novel phosphoramidite ligand, which contains a bulky 1,1&#8208;dinaphthylmethanamino moiety, was the key to providing high yield products with excellent enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene moieties are attractive in medicinal chemistry due to their ability to mimic other more ubiquitous functional groups. Thus, effective asymmetric methods for their construction are highly desirable, especially for the industrial production of chiral drugs. Using a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition between substituted&#8208;2&#8208;alkylidenetrimethylene carbonates and gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl ketones, we were able to easily access chiral 1,3&#8208;dioxanes that contain a tetrasubstituted difluoroalkyl stereogenic center in cyclic and acyclic skeletons. A novel phosphoramidite ligand, which contains a bulky 1,1&#8208;dinaphthylmethanamino moiety, was developed to provide the products in high yield with excellent enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselectivity. Strikingly, the gem&#8208;difluoro substitution pattern promotes the reaction, and pentafluoroethylketone, an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated &#946;&#8208;ketoester, and a &#946;&#8208;ketosulfone are suitable substrates for this method.

         <title>Extended Conjugation Attenuates the Quenching of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emitters by Photocyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions to shorten and lengthen the conjugation between oligoaryl alkene units of aggregation&#8208;induced emitters toggle between rapid photocyclization and efficient photoluminescence properties. Trienes are resistant to photocyclization, giving them higher photoluminescence quantum yields, whereas nonconjugated aryl alkene units cyclize readily to form extended polycyclic frameworks.







Abstract
Herein, we expose how the antagonistic relationship between solid&#8208;state luminescence and photocyclization of oligoaryl alkene chromophores is modulated by the conjugation length of their alkenyl backbones. Heptaaryl cycloheptatriene molecular rotors exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics. We show that their emission is turned off upon breaking the conjugation of the cycloheptatriene by epoxide formation. While this modification is deleterious to photoluminescence, it enables formation of extended polycyclic frameworks by Mallory reactions. We exploit this dichotomy (i) to manipulate emission properties in a controlled manner and (ii) as a synthetic tool to link together pairs of phenyl rings in a specific sequence. This method to alter the tendency of oligoaryl alkenes to undergo photocyclization can inform the design of solid&#8208;state emitters that avoid this quenching mechanism, while also allowing selective cyclization in syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization with Hydrazonium Initiators**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;free ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with hydrazonium initiators ultilizing the principle of carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis is demonstrated.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclopropenes using hydrazonium initiators is described. The initiators, which are formed by the condensation of 2,3&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and an aldehyde, polymerize cyclopropene monomers by a sequence of [3+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion reactions. This process generates short chain polyolefins (Mn&#8804;9.4&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) with relatively low dispersities (&#272;&#8804;1.4). The optimized conditions showed efficiency comparable to that achieved with Grubbs&#8217; 2nd generation catalyst for the polymerization of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;phenylcyclopropene. A positive correlation between monomer to initiator ratio and degree of polymerization was revealed through NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Bearing a Macrocyclic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand: Improved Stability and Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Grubbs&#8208;type complexe containing macrocyclic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand with two small aryl arms tied together was obtained and characterised. Interestingly, it can exist in two forms, cis and trans. Both of them exhibit similarly high thermodynamic stability, yet different application profiles in catalysis, however both can be used in difficult metathesis reactions, also leading to the formation of tetrasubstituted double bonds.







Abstract
Formation of sterically hindered C&#8722;C double bonds via catalytic olefin metathesis is considered a very challenging task for Ru catalysts. This limitation led to the development of specialised catalysts bearing sterically reduced N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands that are very active in such transformations, yet significantly less stable as compared to general purpose catalysts. To decrease the small&#8208;size NHC catalysts susceptibility to decomposition, a new NHC ligand was designed, in which two sterically reduced aryl arms were tied together by a C&#8208;8 alkyl chain. The installation of this macrocyclic ligand on the ruthenium centre led to the formation of an olefin metathesis catalyst (trans&#8208;Ru6). Interestingly, this complex undergoes transformation into an isomer bearing two Cl ligands in the cis&#8208;arrangement (cis&#8208;Ru6). These two isomeric complexes exhibit similarly high thermodynamic stability, yet different application profiles in catalysis.

         <title>Reducing Energy Disorder for Efficient and Stable Sn&#8722;Pb Alloyed Perovskite Solar Cells.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic small molecule, 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;(methylsulfinyl)benzene (BBMS), was utilized to reduce the energy disorder of a Sn&#8722;Pb alloyed perovskite film via hydrogen bonding and coordination bonding interactions, and the resultant BBMS&#8208;treated device showed a high efficiency of over 22&#8201;% as well as outstanding long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Sn&#8722;Pb alloyed perovskites have drawn considerable attention because of their appropriate band gap for both single&#8208;junction and multi&#8208;junction tandem photovoltaics, but the easy&#8208;formation of energy disorder still limits their practical applications. Here, we report that the combination of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;(methylsulfinyl) benzene (BBMS) and SnF2 greatly reduced the Urbach energy of perovskite films, and largely restrained the oxidation of Sn2+. With the help of density functional theory calculations, we clarified the interactions between BBMS and perovskite were responsible for the improvements. As a result, a high efficiency of &gt;22&#8201;% was obtained for the Sn&#8722;Pb alloy&#8208;based solar cells treated by BBMS and SnF2. More importantly, the BBMS&#8208;treated device (devices) demonstrated outstanding stability, retaining 98&#8201;% of its original efficiency after heating at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 2660&#8197;h under N2.

         <title>Synergy in Au&#8208;CuO Janus Structure for Catalytic Isopropanol Oxidative Dehydrogenation to Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding ketones or aldehydes via selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond of alcohols under mild conditions still remains a significant challenge. Although metal/oxide interface is highly active and selective, the interfacial sites fall far behind the demand, due to large and thick support. Herein, we successfully develop a unique Au&#8208;CuO Janus structure (average particle size = 3.8 nm) with ultrathin CuO layer (0.5 nm thickness) via a bimetal in&#8208;situ activation and separation strategy. The resulting Au&#8208;CuO interfacial sites prominently enhance isopropanol adsorption and decrease the energy barrier of &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond scission from 1.44 to 0.01 eV due to the strong affinity between O atom of CuO and H atom of isopropanol, compared with Au sites alone, thereby achieving ultrahigh acetone selectivity (99.3%) over 1.1 wt% AuCu0.75/Al2O3 at 100 oC and atmospheric pressure with 97.5% isopropanol conversion. Furthermore, Au&#8208;CuO Janus structures supported on SiO2, TiO2 or CeO2 exhibit remarkable catalytic performance, and great promotion in activity and acetone selectivity is achieved as well for other reducible oxides derived from Fe, Co, Ni and Mn. This study helps for developing strategies for maximized interfacial sites construction and structure optimization for &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond efficient activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of High Energy A node s  for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State  L ithium Batteries Based on Sulfide Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSBs) promise better performance and higher safety than those of the current liquidbased Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Sulfide ASSBs have been extensively studied and considerably advanced in recent decades. Currently, research on identifying suitable cathode material for sulfide ASSBs is frequently conducted, with great progress being made in the commercialization of layered&#8208;cathodes in the liquidbased LIBs. Research on anode materials for sulfide ASSBs is of great importance for enhancing the battery energy density. However, there seems to be a lack of works that summarize studies of anode materials for sulfide ASSBs and suggest future research directions. Thus, within this minireview, we aim to provide an overview of the previous and current research focused on anode materials for sulfide ASSBs and to suggest a future research direction for developing suitable anode systems for sulfide ASSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Prodrug Activation by an Affibody&#8211;Ruthenium Catalyst Hybrid for HER2&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalysts exhibit great potential as therapeutic agents to inhibit tumor growth. However, the precise delivery and in situ catalysis are challenging in the catalytic medicine. Herein, we report an anti&#8208;HER2 affibody&#8208;ruthenium catalyst hybrid, named as  Ru&#8208;HER2  for selective and effective killing of cancer cells.  Ru&#8208;HER2  binds to HER2 receptor on tumor cell and in situ catalyzes the activation of gemcitabine prodrug, resulting in enhanced selectivity in suppression of tumor growth and reduction of side effects. Immunoblotting reveals that  Ru&#8208;HER2  in combination with gemcitabine prodrug can not only induce DNA damage, but also effectively block the HER2 signaling pathway in cancer cells. Therefore, the HER2&#8208;targeted chemotherapy exhibits substantially high anticancer activity toward HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In a word, we report the first affibody&#8208;ruthenium catalyst hybrid and reveal its potential for effective HER2&#8208;targeted cancer chemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cochlearol B by an Approach Based on a Catellani Reaction and Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Enabled [2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 14&#8208;step synthesis of (+)&#8208;cochlearol B is reported. This renoprotective meroterpenoid features a unique core structure containing a densely substituted cyclobutane ring with three stereocenters. Our strategy employed an organocatalytic Kabbe condensation in route to the key chromenyl triflate. A subsequent Catellani reaction incorporated the remaining carbon atoms featured in the skeleton of cochlearol B. An ensuing visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated&#160;[2+2] photocycloaddition closed the cyclobutane and formed the central bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane core. Notably, careful design and tuning of the Catellani and photocycloaddition reactions proved crucial in overcoming undesired reactivity, including cyclopropanation reactions and [4+2] cycloadditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Introduction of Endo&#8208;Binding Sites in Macrocycle Cavity&#160;towards Selective Recognition of Neutral Azacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles with functionalized interior, which is a general cavity feature of bioreceptors, are hard to synthesize, although functional substituents can be conveniently attached to the macrocycle periphery. Here we report a versatile and modular strategy to customize diverse  endo  &#8208;binding sites in the macrocycle cavity. Only two steps are needed. First, one V&#8208;shaped functional module bearing embedded binding site and two 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyls as reaction modules are connected by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling. Then Friedel&#8208;Crafts condensation of the resulting monomer and paraformaldehyde directly produces designed macrocycle. V&#8208;shaped monomers are deliberately used to guarantee the binding sites equatorially directing inward into the cavity and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphenyls standing axially as macrocycle sidewalls. More than a dozen of  endo  &#8208;functionalized macrocyclic receptors have been constructed.&#160; Host&#8208;guest complexation studies show that macrocycle BP1 decorated interior OH moieties could strongly encapsulate neutral guests by forming inner hydrogen bonds, giving a high association constant of 4.59&#215;10  4  M  &#8208;1  in non&#8208;polar media.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain of supramolecular interactions in single&#8208;stacking junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular electronics provide opportunities to integrate molecular building blocks into electronic circuits, and investigations of the mechanical properties of the non&#8208;covalent interactions are necessary to understand the role of the assembly configuration in the electronic coupling among different assembly blocks. However, the mechanical characterization of supramolecular interactions remains experimentally challenging.  We investigated the strain distribution of the supramolecular interactions through a series of single&#8208;stacking junctions. The alpha values exhibit a clear odd&#8208;even effect versus the numbers of thiophene rings. The theoretical calculations demonstrated that a larger rotational barrier of the single&#8208;stacking junctions with an even number of thiophene rings leads to limited torsional freedom and thus a smaller strain distribution.  These results provide new insights into the control of supramolecular interactions by the design of the basic molecular building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Main&#8208;Group Sb Atomic Sites for Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic activity of main&#8208;group metal is hard to be&#160;motivated since the intrinsic lack of host orbitals available to&#160;be combined. Here, under the guidance of theoretical predictions, we find&#160;the atom&#8208;dispersed antimony sites (Sb&#8208;N4&#160;moieties) can be&#160;activated to achieve high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#160;activity through the functional group regulation strategy.&#160;Correspondingly, we manage to synthesize&#160;main&#8208;group Sb single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) that comprises Sb&#8208;N4&#160;active moieties&#160;functionalized by epoxy groups in the second microenvironment and incorporated in N&#8208;doped graphene. The electron&#8208;rich epoxy group can adjust the electronic structure of Sb&#8208;N4&#160;active moieties, thereby optimizing the adsorption of the intermediate to a reasonable strength. The Sb SACs are comparable to industrial Pt/C under alkaline conditions. This discovery provides new opportunities to manipulate&#160;and improve&#160;the catalytic activity of main&#8208;group electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a lateral sodiation of alkyl(hetero)arenes using on&#8208;demand generated hexane soluble (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium (  1  ) in the presence of TMEDA. (2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium (  1  ) is prepared via a sodium packed&#8208;bed reactor and used for metalations at ambient temperature in batch as well as in continuous flow. The resulting benzylic sodium species are subsequently trapped with various electrophiles including carbonyl compounds, epoxides, oxetane, allyl/benzyl chlorides, alkyl halides and alkyl tosylates. Wurtz&#8208;type couplings with secondary alkyl halides and tosylates proceed under complete inversion of stereochemistry. Furthermore, the utility of this lateral sodiation is demonstrated in the synthesis of pharmaceutical relevant compounds. Thus, fingolimod is prepared from  p  &#8208;xylene applying the lateral sodiation twice. In addition, 7&#8208;fold isotopically labeled salmeterol&#8208;  d  7  and fenpiprane as well as precursors to super linear alkylbenzene (SLAB) surfactants are prepared.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;I&#8208;Responsive Single&#8208;Band Upconversion Emission through Energy Migration in Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Shell Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a new strategy to tune both excitation and emission peaks of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) into the first infrared biowindow (NIR&#8208;I, 650&#8208;900 nm) with high NIR&#8208;I&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;I upconversion efficiency. By introducing the sensitizer Nd  3+  , activator Er  3+  , energy migrator Yb  3+  and energy manipulator Mn  2+  into specific region to construct proposed energy migration processes in the designed core&#8208;shell&#8208;shell nanoarchitecture, back energy transfer (BET) from activator to sensitizer or migrator can be greatly blocked and the NIR&#8208;to&#8208;red upconversion emission can be efficiently promoted. Consequently, BET&#8208;induced photon quenching and the undesired green&#8208;emitting radiative transition are entirely eliminated, leading to high&#8208;efficiency single&#8208;band red upconversion emission upon 808 nm NIR&#8208;I laser excitation. Our findings provide insights into fundamental lanthanide interactions and advance the development of UCNPs for bioapplications with techniques that overturn traditional limitations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The dinuclear Ru(II) complex [(Ru(phen)  2  )  2  (tpphz)]  4+  (phen = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, tpphz = tetrapyridophenazine) &#8220;RuRuPhen&#8221; blocks the transformation of G&#8208;actin to F&#8208;actin filaments with no disassembly of pre&#8208;formed F&#8208;actin. Molecular docking studies indicate multiple RuRuPhen molecules bind to the surface of G&#8208;actin but not the binding pockets of established actin polymerisation inhibitors. In cells, addition of RuRuPhen causes rapid disruption to actin stress fibre organisation, compromising actomyosin contractility and cell motility, due to this effect RuRuPhen interferes with late&#8208;stage cytokinesis.

         <title>Sequential Allylic Alcohol Formation by a Multifunctional Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase with Rare Redox Partners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Caryoynencin is a toxic and antifungal fatty acid derivative produced by a number of plant&#8208;pathogenic and insect&#8208;protective bacteria (Trinickia caryophylli and Burkholderia spp.). In addition to the reactive tetrayne unit, the presence of an allylic alcohol moiety is critical for antimicrobial activities. By a combination of mutational analyses, heterologous expression and in vitro reconstitution experiments we show that the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CayG catalyzes the complex transformation of a saturated carbon backbone into an allylic alcohol. Unexpectedly, CayG employs a ferritin&#8208;like protein (CayK) or a rubredoxin (CayL) component for electron transport. A desaturation&#8208;hydroxylation sequence was deduced from a time&#8208;course study and in vitro biotransformations with pathway intermediates, substrate analogues, protegencin congeners from Pseudomonas protegens Pf&#8208;5, and synthetic derivatives. This unusual multifunctional oxygenase may inspire future biocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Interconversions of Single Molecules Probed by&#160;Recognition Tunneling at Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Functionalized&#160;Supramolecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a versatile recognition tunneling technique using doubly cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;functionalized electrodes to form supramolecular junctions that capture analytes dynamically by host&#8208;guest complexation. This results in characteristic changes in their single&#8208;molecule conductance. For structurally related drug molecules (camptothecin, sanguinarine, chelerythrine, and berberine) and mixtures thereof, we observed distinct current switching signals related to their intrinsic conductance properties as well as pH&#8208;dependent effects which can be traced back to their different states (protonated&#160;  versus  &#160;neutral). The conductance variation of a single molecule with pH shows a sigmoidal distribution, allowing us to extract a p  K  a  &#160;value for reversible protonation, which is consistent with the reported macroscopic results. The new electronic method allows the characterization of unmodified drug molecules and showcases the transfer of dynamic supramolecular chemistry principles to single molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Transfer of Axial Chirality to the Nanoscale Endows Carbon Nanodots with Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis, purification and characterization of chiral carbon nanodots starting from atropoisomeric precursors. The obtained atropoisomeric carbon nanodots are soluble in organic solvents and have good thermal stability, which are desirable features for technological applications. The synthetic protocol is robust, as it supports a number of variations in terms of molecular doping agents. Remarkably, the combination of axially chiral precursors and 1,4&#8208;benzoquinone as doping agent results in green&#8208;emissive carbon dots displaying circularly polarized luminescence. Dissymmetry factors of |3.5|&#183;10  &#8208;4  are obtained in solution, without the need of any additional element of chirality. Introducing axial chirality expands the strategies available to tailor the properties of carbon nanodots, paving the way for carbon nanoparticles that combine good processability in organic solvents with engineered advanced chiroptical properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial photosynthesis for hydrogen production is an important element in the search for green energy sources. The incorporation of photoactive units into mechanically stable 2D materials paves the way toward the realization of ultrathin membranes as mimics for leaves. Here we present and compare two concepts to introduce a photoactive Ru(II) polypyridine complex into ~1 nm thick carbon nanomembranes (CNMs) generated by low&#8208;energy electron irradiation induced cross&#8208;linking of aromatic self&#8208;assembled monolayers. The photoactive units are either directly incorporated into the CNM scaffold or covalently grafted to its surface. We characterize Ru(II) CNMs using X&#8208;ray photoelectron, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman, photothermal deflection spectroscopy, atomic force, scanning electron microscopy, and study their photoactivity in graphene field&#8208;effect devices. Therewith, we explore the applicability of low&#8208;energy electron irradiation of metal complexes for photosensitizer nanosheet formation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Tris(pentafluorophenyl)methylium Cation: Isolation and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present two different routes for the synthesis of the perfluorinated trityl cation, which allowed the handling of the free, uncoordinated species in organic solvents for the first time. The usage of the weakly coordinating anion [Al(OTeF5)4]&#8722; and its derivatives allows the characterization of this species by NMR, vibrational spectroscopy, and most importantly by single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction. The high hydride ion affinity of the cation is shown by hydrogen abstraction from isobutane. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry reveals its oxidative potential which is supported by the reaction with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)amine, giving rise to the formation of the ammoniumyl radical cation, also known as &#8220;magic blue&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Trapping X&#8208;ray Radiation Damage from Homolytic Se&#8211;C Bond Cleavage in BnSeSeBn Crystals (Bn=benzyl, CH2C6H5)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Irradiation of dibenzyl diselenide BnSeSeBn with X&#8208;ray or UV&#8208;light cleaves the Se&#8208;C and the Se&#8208;Se bonds, inducing stable and metastable radical states. They are inevitably important to all natural and life sciences. Structural changes due to X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced Se&#8208;C bond&#8208;cleavage could be pin&#8208;pointed in various high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments for the first time. Extended DFT methods were applied to characterize the solid&#8208;state structure and support the refinement of the observed residuals as contributions from the BnSeSe  &#8226;  radical species. The X&#8208;ray or UV&#8208;irradiated crystalline samples of BnSeSeBn were characterized by solid&#8208;state EPR. This paper provides insight that in the course of X&#8208;ray structure analysis of selenium compounds not only organo&#8208;selenide radicals like RSe  &#8226;  may occur, but also organo diselenide BnSeSe  &#8226;  radicals and organic radicals R  &#8226;  are generated, particularly important to know in structural biology.</dc:description>

         <title>A Noncovalent Photoswitch for&#160;Photochemical Regulation of Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical regulation provides a promising approach for controlling enzyme activity on demand owing to its high spatiotemporal resolution. However, reversible regulation of the enzyme activity by light usually requires genetic mutations and covalent modifications of the target enzymes, which may lead to irreversible changes in the enzyme structure and subsequent loss of the enzymatic activity. Herein, we have developed a novel strategy based on a polymeric inhibitor&#8208;encapsulated enzyme, which noncovalently anchors the azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitors to the enzyme active site, thereby achieving reversible control of the activity of native enzymes using light. As neither genetic mutation nor chemical modification of enzymes is required for this method, negligible loss of the enzymatic activity was observed for the encapsulated enzymes compared to their native counterparts. Thus, this approach has demonstrated a promising strategy for achieving reversible regulation of the activity of native enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Four&#8208;Electron Redox Systems Based on Bipyridine and Phenanthroline Carbene Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel four&#8208;electron redox&#8208;systems featuring up to five isolable oxidation states are presented. The synthesis is modular and based on the combination of diquat or phenanthrolinium salts with stable carbenes. The different oxidation states can be isolated and feature diradical and mixed valence states. Charge/discharge experiments confirm that these redox systems are promising new lead structures for two&#8208;electron anolyte materials.







Abstract
Novel organic redox systems that display multistage redox behaviour are highly sought&#8208;after for a series of applications such as organic batteries or electrochromic materials. Here we describe a simple strategy to transfer well&#8208;known two&#8208;electron redox active bipyridine and phenanthroline architectures into novel strongly reducing four&#8208;electron redox systems featuring fully reversible redox events with up to five stable oxidation states. We give spectroscopic and structural insight into the changes involved in the redox&#8208;events and present characterization data on all isolated oxidation states. The redox&#8208;systems feature strong UV/Vis/NIR polyelectrochromic properties such as distinct strong NIR absorptions in the mixed valence states. Two&#8208;electron charge&#8211;discharge cycling studies indicate high electrochemical stability at strongly negative potentials, rendering the new redox architectures promising lead structures for multi&#8208;electron anolyte materials.

         <title>Under&#8208;5&#8208;Minute Immunoblot Assays by Vortex Fluidic Device Acceleration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The VFD&#8208;accelerated immunoblot assay (VAIA) improves conventional processing time from a hours&#8208;long process to &lt;5&#8197;minutes. Here, VAIA is performed with three major immunoassay formats with purified proteins and diluted biofluids.







Abstract
Unlocking the potential of personalized medicine in point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings requires a new generation of biomarker and proteomic assays. Ideally, assays could inexpensively perform hundreds of quantitative protein measurements in parallel at the bedsides of patients. This goal greatly exceeds current capabilities. Furthermore, biomarker assays are often challenging to translate from benchtop to clinic due to difficulties achieving and assessing the necessary selectivity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. To address these challenges, we developed an efficient (&lt;5&#8197;min), robust (comparatively lower CVs), and inexpensive (decreasing reagent use and cost by &gt;70&#8201;%) immunoassay method. Specifically, the immunoblot membrane is dotted with the sample and then developed in a vortex fluidic device (VFD) reactor. All assay steps&#8212;blocking, binding, and washing&#8212;leverage the unique thin&#8208;film microfluidics of the VFD. The approach can accelerate direct, indirect, and sandwich immunoblot assays. The applications demonstrated include assays relevant to both the laboratory and the clinic.

         <title>Tailored Pyridoxal Probes Unravel Novel Cofactor&#8208;Dependent Targets and Antibiotic Hits in Critical Bacterial Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented targets are needed to fight the bacterial pandemic. A suite of pyridoxal probes that infiltrate the cellular metabolism of critical pathogens and get incorporated in pyridoxal&#8208;phosphate dependent enzymes is applied. Chemoproteomics facilitated the functional characterization of previously unknown members and the identification of essential targets with antibiotic hit molecules.







Abstract
Unprecedented bacterial targets are urgently needed to overcome the resistance crisis. Herein we systematically mine pyridoxal phosphate&#8208;dependent enzymes (PLP&#8208;DEs) in bacteria to focus on a target class which is involved in crucial metabolic processes. For this, we tailored eight pyridoxal (PL) probes bearing modifications at various positions. Overall, the probes exceeded the performance of a previous generation and provided a detailed map of PLP&#8208;DEs in clinically relevant pathogens including challenging Gram&#8208;negative strains. Putative PLP&#8208;DEs with unknown function were exemplarily characterized via in&#8208;depth enzymatic assays. Finally, we screened a panel of PLP binders for antibiotic activity and unravelled the targets of hit molecules. Here, an uncharacterized enzyme, essential for bacterial growth, was assigned as PLP&#8208;dependent cysteine desulfurase and confirmed to be inhibited by the marketed drug phenelzine. Our approach provides a basis for deciphering novel PLP&#8208;DEs as essential antibiotic targets along with corresponding ways to decipher small molecule inhibitors.

Putative &lt;b&gt;PLP&lt;/b&gt;-DEs with unknown function were exemplarily characterized via in-depth enzymatic assays. Finally, we screened a panel of &lt;b&gt;PLP&lt;/b&gt; binders for antibiotic activity and unravelled the targets of hit molecules. Here, an uncharacterized enzyme, essential for bacterial growth, was assigned as &lt;b&gt;PLP&lt;/b&gt;-dependent cysteine desulfurase and confirmed to be inhibited by the marketed drug phenelzine. Our approach provides a basis for deciphering novel &lt;b&gt;PLP&lt;/b&gt;-DEs as essential antibiotic targets along with corresponding ways to decipher small molecule inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transport Polymers with Fluorine&#8208;Induced Favorable Molecular Stacking Enable Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) was explored, featuring fluorine&#8208;substituted pyrene and specific Pb&#8722;Se secondary interactions. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using PE10 as dopant&#8208;free HTM, afforded an excellent PCE of 22.3&#8201;%, positioning it among the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.







Abstract
A new class of polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) are explored by inserting a two&#8208;dimensionally conjugated fluoro&#8208;substituted pyrene into thiophene and selenophene polymeric chains. The broad conjugated plane of pyrene and &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; selenium atoms not only enhance the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of HTM molecules greatly but also render a strong interaction with the perovskite surface, leading to an efficient charge transport/transfer in both the HTM layer and the perovskite/HTM interface. Note that fluorine substitution adjacent to pyrene boosts the stacking of HTMs towards a more favorable face&#8208;on orientation, further facilitating the efficient charge transport. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing PE10 as dopant&#8208;free HTM afford an excellent efficiency of 22.3&#8201;% and the dramatically enhanced device longevity, qualifying it among the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.

         <title>Structurally Nontraditional Benzo[c]cinnoline&#8208;Based Electron&#8208;Transporting Materials with 3D Molecular Interaction Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;3D molecular interaction architecture&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design high&#8208;performance electron&#8208;transporting materials (ETMs). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a type of structurally nontraditional ETMs with the benzo[c]cinnoline (BZC) skeleton exhibit an exceedingly high glass transition temperature, a fast electron mobility and outstanding electroluminescent performances in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).







Abstract
The academically widely used electron&#8208;transporting materials (ETMs) typically suffer from low glass transition temperatures (Tg) that could lead to poor device stability. Considering practical applications, we herein put forward a &#8220;3D molecular interaction architecture&#8221; strategy to design high&#8208;performance ETMs. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a type of structurally nontraditional ETMs with the benzo[c]cinnoline (BZC) skeleton have been proposed and synthesized by the C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H homo&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;acylaniline as the key step. 2,9&#8208;diphenylbenzo[c]cinnoline (DPBZC) exhibits strong intermolecular interactions that feature a 3D architecture, which boosts Tg to exceedingly high 218&#8201;&#176;C with a fast electron mobility (&#956;e) of 6.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. DPBZC&#8208;based fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show outstanding electroluminescent performances with an external quantum efficiency of 20.1&#8201;% and a power efficiency as high as 70.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, which are superior to those of the devices with the commonly used ETMs.

         <title>An Integrated Carbon Nitride&#8208;Nickel Photocatalyst for the Amination of Aryl Halides Using Sodium Azide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous photocatalytic method is reported for the selective synthesis of primary anilines via cross&#8208;coupling of a wide range of aryl/heteroaryl halides with sodium azide using nickel deposited on a mesoporous carbon nitride material. This procedure removes the need for sophisticated ligands, precious metals, and elevated temperatures/pressures, and it takes place under mild reaction conditions with a recyclable catalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of primary anilines via sustainable methods remains a challenge in organic synthesis. We report a photocatalytic protocol for the selective synthesis of primary anilines via cross&#8208;coupling of a wide range of aryl/heteroaryl halides with sodium azide using a photocatalyst powder consisting of nickel(II) deposited on mesoporous carbon nitride (Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx). This heterogeneous photocatalyst contains a high surface area with a visible light&#8208;absorbing and adaptive &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; solid&#8208;state ligand for the integrated catalytic Ni site. The method displays a high functional group tolerance, requires mild reaction conditions, and benefits from easy recovery and reuse of the photocatalyst powder. Thereby, it overcomes the need of complex ligand scaffolds required in homogeneous catalysis, precious metals and elevated temperatures/pressures in existing protocols of primary anilines synthesis. The reported heterogeneous Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx holds potential for applications in the academic and industrial synthesis of anilines and exploration of other photocatalytic transformations.

A catalytic asymmetric P&#8208;arylation of H&#8208;phosphinate was developed via an interesting dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation. The copper&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling/cyclization provides a general method for the highly enantioselective synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic P&#8208;heterocycles. The copper complex was responsible for the racemization of the H&#8208;phosphinates. H&#8208;Phenylphosphinates, H&#8208;alkenylphosphinate and H&#8208;alkylphosphinates were examined and delivered the products in high yields and high ee values.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aryl C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling/cyclization reaction was successfully developed via dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) under mild conditions. This study provides a general and simple method for the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of stable six&#8208;, seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus heterocycles with excellent enantioselectivities and moderate to high yields. One&#8208;pot gram&#8208;scale asymmetric synthesis of the P&#8208;stereogenic P&#8208;heterocycle from commercially available materials was also successfully accomplished with excellent enantioselectivity and high yield.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of [3]&#8208;Ladderanol through Late&#8208;Stage Organocatalytic Desymmetrization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective desymmetrization route to [3]&#8208;ladderanol has been devised that is centered around an organocatalytic enantioselective formal C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of tetracyclic meso&#8208;cyclohexenedione. This strategy involving the late&#8208;stage introduction of chirality offers flexibility and enabled the facile synthesis of both enantiomers of [3]&#8208;ladderanol as well as an analogue.







Abstract
Ladderane phospholipids, with their unusual ladder&#8208;like arrangement of concatenated cyclobutane rings, represent an architecturally unique class of natural products. However, despite their fascinating structure and other necessary impetus, only a few synthetic studies of these molecules have been reported so far. We have now devised a concise total synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol, a component of natural ladderane phospholipids, using an organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing formal C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation. Our synthetic strategy rests on the late&#8208;stage introduction of chirality, thus allowing facile access to both enantiomers of [3]&#8208;ladderanol as well as an analogue. This is the first time a desymmetrization strategy is applied to the synthesis of [3]&#8208;ladderanol. The scope of this desymmetrizing C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of meso&#8208;cyclobutane&#8208;fused cyclohexenediones is also presented.

         <title>Counterion&#8208;Paired Bright Heptamethine Fluorophores with NIR&#8208;II Excitation and Emission Enable Multiplexed Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heptamethine cyanines (HCs) has absorption/emission maxima spanning from 1100 to 1600&#8197;nm. A counterion&#8208;paired strategy was explored to improve the brightness of HCs in aqueous solution by reducing aggregation and polarization. Profiting from enhanced brightness and well&#8208;shaped absorption spectra, dual&#8208;color imaging based on NIR&#8208;II excitation and emission was performed in living mice for the first time.







Abstract
Photon excitation and emission at the NIR&#8208;II spectral window enable high&#8208;contrast deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging. However, multiplexed imaging with NIR&#8208;II excitation and emission has been hampered by the limited chemical strategies to develop bright fluorophores with tunable absorption in this spectral regime. Herein, we developed a series of heptamethine cyanines (HCs) with varied absorption/emission maxima spanning from 1100 to 1600&#8197;nm through a physical organic approach. A bulky counterion paired to HCs was found to elicit substantial improvements in absorptivity (7&#8208;fold), brightness (14&#8208;fold), and spectral profiles in water, addressing a notorious quenching problem of NIR&#8208;II cyanines due to aggregation and polarization. We demonstrated the utilities of HC1222 and HC1342 for high&#8208;contrast dual&#8208;color imaging of circulatory system, lymphatic structures, tumor, and organ function in living mice under 1120&#8197;nm and 1319&#8197;nm excitation, showing HCs as a promising platform for non&#8208;invasive bioimaging.

         <title>BN&#8208;Anthracene for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Optoelectronic Materials through Periphery Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors based on classical BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAHs) have been achieved through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy. Remarkably, diphenyl&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;anthracene (DPBNA), with a highest hole mobility of 1.3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors and excellent performance in phototransistors, is the first BN&#8208;PAH that outperforms amorphous silicon.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable synthetic accomplishments in creating diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with B&#8722;N bonds (BN&#8208;PAHs), their optoelectronic applications have been less exploited. Herein, we report the achievement of high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors based on existing BN&#8208;PAHs through a &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy. Tetraphenyl&#8208; and diphenyl&#8208;substituted BN&#8208;anthracenes (TPBNA and DPBNA, respectively) are designed and synthesized. DPBNA exhibits the highest hole mobility of 1.3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, significantly outperforming TPBNA and all the reported BN&#8208;PAHs. Remarkably, this is the first BN&#8208;PAH with mobility over 1&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is a benchmark value for practical applications as compared with amorphous silicon. Furthermore, high&#8208;performance phototransistors based on DPBNA are also demonstrated, implying the high potential of BN&#8208;PAHs for optoelectronic applications when the &#8220;periphery engineering&#8221; strategy is implemented.

         <title>Sustained Release of a Synthetic Autoinducing Peptide Mimetic Blocks Bacterial Communication and Virulence In Vivo.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic peptide was found to block cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signalling, or quorum sensing, in bacteria and be highly bioavailable in mouse tissue. The controlled release of this agent from degradable polymeric microparticles strongly inhibited skin infection in a wound model at levels that far surpassed the potency of the peptide when delivered conventionally.







Abstract
There is significant interest in approaches to the treatment of bacterial infections that block virulence without creating selective pressures that lead to resistance. Here, we report the development of an &#8220;anti&#8208;virulence&#8221; strategy that exploits the activity of potent synthetic inhibitors of quorum sensing (QS) in Staphylococcus aureus. We identify peptide&#8208;based inhibitors of QS that are resistant to sequestration or degradation by components of murine tissue and demonstrate that encapsulation of a lead inhibitor in degradable polymer microparticles provides materials that substantially inhibit QS in vitro. Using a murine abscess model, we show that this inhibitor attenuates methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) skin infections in vivo, and that sustained release of the inhibitor from microparticles significantly improved outcomes compared to mice that received a single&#8208;dose bolus. Our results present an effective and modular approach to controlling bacterial virulence in vivo and could advance the development of new strategies for skin infection control.

         <title>A Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Stacked Porous Organic Molecular Framework for Selective Separation of Aromatics and Cyclic Aliphatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust &#960;&#8208;stacked porous organic molecular framework selectively separates aromatics over cyclic aliphatics.







Abstract
Selective separation using porous adsorbents is an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to traditional separation techniques. Stacked porous organic molecular frameworks (POMFs) capable of noncovalent &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions are emerging as a new kind of adsorbents that facilitate green separation. Here we report a robust porous molecular crystal (TAPM&#8208;1), which is stabilized by multiple intermolecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. With its long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;stacking, TAPM&#8208;1 has excellent hydrophobicity, thermostability, recyclability, and high selectivity for aromatics over the corresponding cyclic aliphatics. This enables TAPM&#8208;1 to serve as the stationary phase in the high&#8208;resolution gas chromatographic separation of benzene and cyclohexane or toluene and methylcyclohexane.

         <title>Diastereoselective Transfer of Tri(di)fluoroacetylsilanes&#8208;Derived Carbenes to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective cyclopropanation reaction of alkenes is usually achieved by metal complexes via singlet&#8208;metal&#8208;carbene intermediates. However, previous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes with acylsilanes afforded low diastereoselectivity. Herein, we report the first visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cyclopropanation reaction of terminal alkenes with trifluoroacetylsilanes and difluoroacetylsilanes. Both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes as well as electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are suitable substrates for the highly  cis  &#8208;selective [2+1] cyclization reaction. A combination of experimental and computational studies identified triplet carbenes as being key intermediates in this transformation. The gram scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization demonstrated the synthetic potential of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Alteration of the Catalytic Reaction Trajectory of a Vicinal Oxygen Chelate Enzyme by Directed Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) metalloenzyme superfamily catalyzes a highly diverse set of reactions with the mechanism characterized by the bidentate coordination of vicinal oxygen atoms to metal ion centers, but there remains a lack of a platform to steer the reaction trajectories, especially for&#160;  o  &#8208;quinone metabolizing pathways. Herein, we present the directed&#8208;evolution&#8208;enabled bifunctional turnover of ChaP, which is a homotetramer and represents an unprecedented VOC enzyme class. Unlike the ChaP catalysis of extradiol&#8208;like&#160;  o  &#8208;quinone cleavage and concomitant &#945;&#8208;keto acid decarboxylation, a group of ChaP variants (CVs) catalyze intradiol&#8208;like&#160;  o  &#8208;quinone deconstruction and CO2  liberation from the resulting&#160;o&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid scaffolds with high regioselectivity. Enzyme crystal structures, labeling experiments and computational simulations corroborated that the D49L mutation allows the metal ion to change its coordination with the tyrosine phenoxy atoms in different monomers, thereby altering the reaction trajectory with the regiospecifity further improved by the follow&#8208;up replacement of the Y92 residue with any of alanine, glycine, threonine, and serine. The study highlights the unpredicted catalytic versatility and enzymatic plasticity of VOC enzymes with biotechnological significance.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydroalkylation of racemic allylic alcohols has been developed for the synthesis of chiral amino acid derivatives with two remote chiral centers by borrowing hydrogen catalysis. The stereoselectivities are controlled by a single chiral Ru catalyst via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process and an interesting diastereoselectivity amplification process of the product. The method could be used for the synthesis of several types of biologically important molecules, including stereodivergent synthesis of chiral pyrrolidine derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed Supramolecular Assemblies using Orthogonal Pairs of Heterodimeric Coiled Coil Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent progress, it remains challenging to program biomacromolecules to assemble into discrete nanostructures with pre&#8208;determined sizes and topologies. We report here a novel strategy to address this challenge. By using two orthogonal pairs of heterodimeric coiled coils as the building blocks, we constructed six discrete supramolecular assemblies, each composed of a prescribed number of coiled coil components. Within these assemblies, different coiled coils were connected via end&#8208;to&#8208;side covalent linkages strategically pre&#8208;installed between the non&#8208;complementary pairs. The overall topological features of two highly complex assemblies, a &#8220;barbell&#8221; and a &#8220;quadrilateral&#8221; form, were characterized experimentally and were in good agreement to the designs. This work expands the design paradigms for peptide&#8208;based discrete supramolecular assemblies and will provide a route for de novo fabrication of functional protein materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Demanding Flexible Phosphoric Acids for Constructing Efficient and Multi&#8208;Purpose Asymmetric Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a novel approach for various asymmetric transformations of cyclic enones. The combination of readily accessible chiral diamines and sterically demanding flexible phosphoric acids resulted in a simple and highly tunable catalyst framework. The careful optimization of the catalyst components led to the identification of a particularly powerful and multi&#8208;purpose organocatalyst, which was successfully applied for asymmetric epoxidations, aziridinations, aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated cyclizations, as well as for a novel Robinson&#8208;like Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure/aldol cyclization. High catalytic activities and excellent stereocontrol was observed for all four reaction types, indicating the excellent versatility of our catalytic system. Furthermore, a simple change in the diamine&#8217;s configuration provided easy access to both product antipodes in all cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Selective Monitoring of Subcellular Enzyme Dynamics in Response to Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tracking spatial and temporal dynamics of bioactive molecules such as enzymes responding to therapeutic treatment is highly important for understanding of the related functions. However, in situ molecular imaging at subcellular level during photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been hampered by the limitations of existing methods. Herein, we present a multifunctional nanoplatform (termed as UR&#8208;HAPT) that is able to simultaneously monitor subcellular dynamics of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) during the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated PDT. UR&#8208;HAPT was constructed by the combination of an upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;based PDT design and a mitochondria&#8208;targeting strategy with an APE1&#8208;responsive DNA reporter. Benefiting from the gain&#8208;of&#8208;function approach, activatable mitochondrial accumulation of APE1 in response to the oxidative stress was observed during the NIR light&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted PDT process. We envision that this nanoplatform can be applicable to screen and evaluate potential enzyme inhibitors to improve the PDT efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Avoiding Structural Collapse to Reduce Lead Leakage in Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a promising candidate for the next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies. As an essential element for high&#8208;efficiency PSCs however, the heavy metal Pb is soluble in water, showing a serious threat to the environment and human health. Due to the weak ionic bonding in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite, drastic structure decomposition occurred when immersing perovskite film in water, which accelerates the leakage of lead. By introducing the chemically stable Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskite at the 3D perovskite surface, the film dissolution is significantly slowed down, which retards lead leakage and thus extends the time period for damaged device recycling. As a result, the Pb contamination is dramatically reduced under various extreme conditions. In addition, the PSCs device deliver a PCE of 23.6% and retain over 95% of their initial PCE after the maximum power point tracking for over 1100 h.</dc:description>

By introducing the chemically stable Dion-Jacobson (DJ) 2D perovskite at the 3D perovskite surface, the film dissolution is significantly slowed down, which retards lead leakage and thus extends the time period for damaged device recycling. As a result, the Pb contamination is dramatically reduced under various extreme conditions. In addition, the PSCs device deliver a PCE of 23.6% and retain over 95% of their initial PCE after the maximum power point tracking for over 1100 h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heavy Atom&#8208;Free, Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted, and Activatable Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy with Real&#8208;Time In&#8208;Situ Therapeutic Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing mechanism, two heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (PSs)  BDP1  /  BDP2  with absorption maxima at 506 nm/660 nm were constructed for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The long triplet state lifetimes and large singlet oxygen quantum yields, coupled with the mitochondria&#8208;targeted feature, made them highly phototoxic toward cancer cells. Moreover, the PDT&#8208;promoted cell apoptosis could be monitored by an obvious fluorescence off&#8208;on response of the two PSs due to the concomitant activation of extensive mitophagy, thus facilitating timely therapeutic feedback to avoid under&#8208; or over&#8208;treatment. Importantly, such design allows the activatable PSs  Glu&#8208;BDP1  /  Glu&#8208;BDP2  to be fabricated by attaching g&#8208;glutamyl, a substrate of g&#8208;glutamyltranspeptidase, to the alkoxyaniline unit of  BDP1  /  BDP2,  and their ability in either selectively killing cancer cells over normal cells or in ablating implanted tumour without damage to healthy tissue was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Mushroom Polyketide Synthases Produce the Universal Anthraquinone Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Pre&#8208;)Anthraquinones are a diverse class of bioactive natural products. Dissimilar to plants, molds, and bacteria, the webcaps, one of the most species&#8208;rich genera of mushrooms, use an evolutionarily distinct class of remarkably small polyketide synthases to produce atrochyrsone carboxylic acid, the universal precursor of (pre&#8208;)anthraquinones. These enzymes represent an outstanding example of convergent evolution of biosynthetic capacities.







Abstract
(Pre&#8208;)anthraquinones are widely distributed natural compounds and occur in plants, fungi, microorganisms, and animals, with atrochrysone (1) as the key biosynthetic precursor. Chemical analyses established mushrooms of the genus Cortinarius&#8212;the webcaps&#8212;as producers of atrochrysone&#8208;derived octaketide pigments. However, more recent genomic data did not provide any evidence for known atrochrysone carboxylic acid (4) synthases nor any other polyketide synthase (PKS) producing oligocyclic metabolites. Here, we describe an unprecedented class of non&#8208;reducing (NR&#8208;)PKS. In vitro assays with recombinant enzyme in combination with in vivo product formation in the heterologous host Aspergillus niger established CoPKS1 and CoPKS4 of C.&#160;odorifer as members of a new class of atrochrysone carboxylic acid synthases. CoPKS4 catalyzed both hepta&#8208; and octaketide synthesis and yielded 6&#8208;hydroxymusizin (6), along with 4. These first mushroom PKSs for oligocyclic products illustrate how the biosynthesis of bioactive natural metabolites evolved independently in various groups of life.

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented Ru&#8208;catalyzed direct asymmetric reductive amination of &#945;&#8208;keto amides with ammonium salts has been achieved. This protocol provides an efficient and practical way for the synthesis of diverse enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208; or alkyl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;unprotected unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and N&#8208;unprotected &#946;&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Further follow&#8208;up transformations enable access to drug intermediates, peptides, and organocatalysts/ligands.







Abstract
An unprecedented highly enantioselective Ru&#8208;catalyzed direct asymmetric reductive amination of &#945;&#8208;keto amides with ammonium salts has been disclosed, efficiently offering valuable enantioenriched N&#8208;unprotected unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives bearing a broad range of aryl or alkyl &#945;&#8208;substituents. This protocol features easily accessible substrates, good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent enantiocontrol, making it a good complementary approach to the known methods. Moreover, this method is also applicable to the preparation of N&#8208;unprotected unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives containing an additional stereogenic center at the &#946;&#8208;position through a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process. Convenient transformations of the obtained products into chiral N&#8208;unprotected unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, drug intermediates, peptides, and organocatalysts/ligands further showcase the utility of this method.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Confined Single&#8208;Atom Fe1S x  on Mesoporous TiO2 for Boosting Ambient Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimicking natural nitrogenase to create highly efficient single atom catalysts (SACs) for ambient N  2  fixation is highly desired, but still challenging. Herein, S coordinated Fe SACs on mesoporous TiO  2  have been constructed by a lattice&#8208;confined strategy. The extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra demonstrate that Fe atoms are anchored in TiO  2  lattice  via  the FeS  2  O  2  coordination configuration. Theoretical calculations reveal that FeS  2  O  2  sites are the active centers for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Moreover, the finite element analysis shows that confinement of opened and ordered mesopores can facilitate the mass transport and offer an enlarged active surface area for NRR. As a result, this catalyst delivers a favorable NH  3  yield rate of 18.3 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  mg  cat.  &#8208;1  with a high faradic efficiency of 17.3% at &#8208;0.20 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Most importantly, this lattice&#8208;confined strategy is universal and can also be applied to Ni  1  S  x  @TiO  2  , Co  1  S  x  @TiO  2  , Mo  1  S  x  @TiO  2  , and Cu  1  S  x  @TiO  2  SACs. Our study provides new hints for design and biomimetic synthesis of highly efficient NRR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Tetradeuteration of Straight&#8208;Chain Fatty Acids: Synthesis, Application, and Insight&#160;into the Metabolism of Oxidized Linoleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a concise and reliable protocol for the precisely controlled tetradeuteration of straight&#8208;chain fatty acids (FAs) at the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions that is generally applicable to a variety of FAs, including&#160;  trans&#8208;FAs, polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), and their oxidized derivatives. The precisely controlled introduction of four deuterium atoms into the FAs enables their persistent and quantitative tracking by LC&#8211;MS/MS analysis based on their molecular structures. In addition, the phosphatidylcholine (PC) species prepared from the tetradeuterated FAs thus obtained give a diagnostic peak, namely, a phosphocholine fragment that contains deuterium, in the LC&#8211;MS/MS analysis. With these features, the metabolism of a representative oxidized linoleic acid, that is, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), was investigated, leading to the identification of acyltransferases that transfer the acyl moiety derived from HODE to lysophosphatidylcholine.</dc:description>

         <title>A Well&#8208;Defined Anionic Dicopper(I) Monohydride Complex that Reacts like a Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;nuclearity copper hydrides are rare and few well&#8208;defined dicopper hydrides have been reported. Herein, we describe the first example of a structurally characterized anionic dicopper hydride complex. This complex does not display typical reactivity associated with low&#8208;nuclearity copper hydrides, such

as alcoholysis or insertion reactions. Instead, its stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity is akin to that of copper hydride clusters. The distinct reactivity is ascribed to the robust dinuclear core that is bound tightly within the dinucleating ligand scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Sodium Borates: Expanding the Electrolyte Selection for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising grid&#8208;level storage technology due to the abundance and low cost of sodium. The development of new electrolytes for SIBs is imperative since it impacts battery life and capacity. Currently, sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) is used as the benchmark salt, but is highly hygroscopic and generates toxic HF. This work describes the synthesis of a series of sodium borate salts, with electrochemical studies revealing that Na[B(hfip)4]&#183;DME (hfip = hexafluoroisopropyloxy, OiPrF) and Na[B(pp)2] (pp = perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4) have excellent electrochemical performance. The [B(pp)2]&#8722; anion also exhibits a high tolerance to air and water. Both electrolytes give more stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces than conventionally used NaPF6, as demonstrated by impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, they give greater cycling stability and comparable capacity to NaPF6 for SIBs, as shown in commercial pouch cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation and Release of OH Radicals from the Reaction of H2O with O2 over Soot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conventional view is that particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere is a major sink of OH radicals. By contrary, Xiao Cheng&#8197;Zeng, Joseph&#8197;S. Francisco, Hong He et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202201638) that water and O2&#160;react on carbonaceous soot surface and give rise to gaseous OH radicals under irradiation. This new chemical mechanism for the generation of OH radicals indicates the airborne soot particles possess important catalytic oxidation capacity.

         <title>Synthesis of Atropisomeric Two&#8208;Axis Systems by the Catalyst&#8208;Controlled syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;Selective Arene&#8208;Forming Aldol Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complete stereochemical addressability for all atropisomeric enantio&#8208; and diastereomers is viable by converting diketo substrates with simultaneous control over two configurationally stable stereogenic axes. The atropisomeric two&#8208;axis systems were prepared by the direct catalyst&#8208;controlled arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based ion&#8208;pairing catalyst with up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.







Abstract
Simultaneous control over the configuration of multiple stereocenters is accomplished by numerous catalytic methods, providing a reliable basis for the synthesis of stereochemically complex targets in isomerically defined form. In contrast, addressing the configurations of multiple stereogenic axes with diastereodivergent catalyst control is thus far only possible by stepwise approaches. Herein we now describe that all four stereoisomers of atropisomeric two&#8208;axis systems are directly tractable by assembling a central aromatic unit of teraryls through an arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation. By using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based ion&#8208;pairing catalysts, the four feasible reaction pathways are differentiated from identical substrates under defined basic conditions without preactivation, thus enabling complete stereodivergence with enantioselectivities of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.

         <title>Cofactor&#8208;Driven Cascade Reactions Enable the Efficient Preparation of Sugar Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar nucleotides are essential glycosylation donors in carbohydrate metabolism. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115696), Liuqing Wen and co&#8208;workers developed a general strategy for the efficient preparation of rare sugar nucleotides. Complex de&#8197;novo biosynthesis of rare sugar nucleotides was recognized as cascade reactions. The cascade reactions were driven toward the formation of the target sugar nucleotides through cofactor regeneration system (CRS), thus resulting in a clean conversion.

The Ugi&#8208;4 component reaction was applied by Andreas Herrmann, Thorben Cordes et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202112959) to synthesize a library of linker molecules (illustrated as the ESA space gateway) to link biological targets (the space&#8208;shuttle) to commercially available fluorescent dyes (the Orion service modules). The modular design of the Ugi&#8208;4 reaction allows addition of different functional groups to linkers, which in turn alter the properties of the fluorophore. Functional groups were introduced that turned a variety of fluorophores into highly stable self&#8208;healing dyes or metal&#8208;chelating dyes during bio&#8208;labeling.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Transamidation of Unactivated Tertiary Amides by Electrophilic N&#8722;C(O) Activation by Amide&#8208;to&#8208;Acyl Iodide Re&#8208;routing</title>

         <dc:description>
The challenging transamidation of unactivated tertiary amides using equivalent amounts of amines has been accomplished via cooperative acid/iodide catalysis. The method provides a novel manifold to re&#8208;route the reactivity of unactivated and unreactive N,N&#8208;dialkyl amides through reactive acyl iodide intermediates, representing a powerful new activation mode of unactivated amide bonds.







Abstract
The challenging transamidation of unactivated tertiary amides has been accomplished via cooperative acid/iodide catalysis. Most crucially, the method provides a novel manifold to re&#8208;route the reactivity of unactivated N,N&#8208;dialkyl amides through reactive acyl iodide intermediates, thus reverting the classical order of reactivity of carboxylic acid derivatives. This method provides a direct route to amide&#8208;to&#8208;amide bond interconversion with excellent chemoselectivity using equivalent amounts of amines. The combination of acid and iodide has been identified as the essential factor to activate the amide C&#8722;N bond through electrophilic catalytic activation, enabling the production of new desired transamidated products with wide substrate scope of both unactivated amides and amines, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex APIs (&gt;80&#8197;examples). We anticipate that this powerful activation mode of unactivated amide bonds will find broad&#8208;ranging applications in chemical synthesis.

         <title>Selective Extraction of Transition Metals from Spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 Cathode via Regulation of Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deep eutectic solvent composed of choline chloride and oxalic acid was prepared. After leaching at 120&#8201;&#176;C for 10&#8197;hours, the nickel oxalate dihydrate and the filtrate containing other metal elements are separated. Then the filtrate is diluted with water to precipitate the cobalt oxalate dihydrate. Finally, manganese compounds were separated by adjusting pH.







Abstract
The complexity of chemical compounds in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) results in great difficulties in the extraction of multiple transition metals, which have similar physicochemical characteristics. Here, we propose a novel strategy for selective extraction of nickel, cobalt, and manganese from spent LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (NCM) cathode through the regulation of coordination environment. Depending on adjusting the composition of ligand in transition metal complexes, a tandem leaching and separation system is designed and finally enables nickel, cobalt, and manganese to enrich in the form of NiO, Co3O4, and Mn3O4 with high recovery yields of 99.1&#8201;%, 95.1&#8201;%, and 95.3&#8201;%, respectively. We further confirm that the combination of different transition metals with well&#8208;designed ligands is the key to good selectivity. Through our work, fine&#8208;tuning the coordination environment of metal ions is proved to have great prospects in the battery recycling industry.

The use of strained bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanyl alcohols (BCP&#8722;OH) for the synthesis of a library of cyclobutanone and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;enone scaffolds through palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective C&#8722;C activation is described. Both experimental and DFT studies provided insights into the crucial stabilizing effect of base additives on the palladium&#8208;carbon intermediates.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective coupling of readily available bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanyl alcohols (BCP&#8722;OH) with various halides is reported, which offers expedient approaches to a wide range of cyclobutanone and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;enone skeletons via single or double C&#8722;C activation. The chemistry shows a broad substrate scope in terms of both the range of BCP&#8722;OH and halides including a series of natural product derivatives. Moreover, dependency of reaction chemodivergence on base additive has been investigated through experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies, which is expected to significantly enrich the reaction modes and increase the synthetic potential of BCP&#8722;OH in preparing more complex molecules.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Construction of 1,4&#8208;Diamines via Cascade Hydroamination of Methylene Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of methylene cyclopropanes allowed the synthesis of a wide range of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamine derivatives in high yields and enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The structure complexity of 1,4&#8208;diamines was further increased by using two different functionalized amino agents. Mechanistic studies show a potential pathway involving the hydroamination ring&#8208;opening with &#946;&#8208;C elimination followed by a cascade hydroamination sequence.







Abstract
Despite the widespread existence of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines in bioactive molecules and their applications in asymmetric catalysis, the catalytic and asymmetric synthesis of such structures from readily accessible substrates remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydroamination protocol to construct a wide range of chiral 1,4&#8208;diamine derivatives in high yields with excellent enatioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The use of two hydroxylamine esters containing different functionalized amino groups allowed us to increase the complexity of the final 1,4&#8208;diamine structures. The desired products could be easily transformed into chiral 1,4&#8208;diamines and chiral NH2&#8208;Terfenadine. Mechanistic study demonstrates that this reaction proceeds through hydroamination ring&#8208;opening and cascade hydroamination sequence.

         <title>A General Strategy for Kilogram&#8208;Scale Preparation of Highly Crystal&#8208;line Covalent Triazine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general polyphosphoric acid (H6P4O13)&#8208;catalyzed strategy is developed to synthesize a series of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with high specific surface areas at the kilogram level for the first time. The polymerization mechanism study reveals a much higher catalytic activity of H6P4O13 than its analogues such as P2O5 and H3PO4. Crystalline porous CTFs can be practically used as a highly efficient adsorbent for large&#8208;scale antibiotic removal.

Scalable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of crystalline porous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) is essential to realize their broad industrial applications but remains a great challenge, which requires the fundamental understanding of the two&#8208;dimensional polymerization mechanism. Herein, we report a universal polyphosphoric acid (H6P4O13)&#8208;catalyzed nitrile trimerization route to synthesize a series of highly crystalline CTFs with high specific surface areas. This new strategy enables the cost&#8208;effective large&#8208;scale fabrication of crystalline CTFs at kilogram level for the first time. Through density functional theory calculation and detailed controlled experiments, we reveal that the polyphosphate acid show much higher catalytic activity for trimerization reaction than its analogues such as P2O5 and H3PO4. Furthermore, the crystalline CTFs with regular porosity and abundant triazine groups exhibit ultrahigh removal efficiency of micropollutants, indicating its great potential in environment remediation.

         <title>Decarbonylative Transfer Hydrochlorination of Alkenes and Alkynes Based on a B(C6F5)3&#8208;Initiated Grob Fragmentation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B(C6F5)3 initiates the Grob fragmentation of cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted acyl chlorides into a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight arene, carbon monoxide and HCl. In the presence of &#960;&#8208;basic substrates such as alkenes and alkynes, HCl is transferred stepwise to afford the corresponding hydrochlorination products. The overall reaction is a decarbonylative transfer hydrochlorination driven by aromatization and carbon&#8208;monoxide release.







Abstract
Readily available cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;ylcarbonyl chloride derivatives are introduced as bench&#8208;stable HCl surrogates for transfer hydrochlorination of terminal and internal alkenes as well as selected alkynes. The stepwise Grob fragmentation of those acyl chlorides into chloride, carbon monoxide, a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight arene, and a proton is promoted by B(C6F5)3. This decarbonylative transfer process enables the addition of HCl across C&#8722;C double and triple bonds with Markovnikov selectivity at room temperature.

         <title>Direct Amination of Benzene with Molecular Nitrogen Enabled by Plasma&#8208;Liquid Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular N2 was directly fixed into arylamines in a plasma&#8211;liquid system at ambient temperature and pressure without transition metal mediation, which provides a green alternative to the hazardous multistep processes as practiced in the traditional method for large&#8208;scale arylamine production.







Abstract
Nitrogen fixation is industrially realized by mass production of ammonia, the principal intermediate nitrogen source for N&#8208;containing organic molecules. Instead, direct C&#8722;N bond formation from dinitrogen (N2) is of great interest but remains a challenge. Here, by virtue of unique plasma&#8211;liquid interactions, we developed an environmentally benign one&#8208;pot approach to directly couple benzene and N2, two naturally abundant yet chemically inert molecules, into value&#8208;added arylamines. Under the optimal conditions, an amination yield of 45&#8201;% was rapidly achieved, far better than the reported benzene amination efficiency using ammonia. A tentative reaction mechanism was proposed involving the long&#8208;lived N2 (A3
) and N2+ species, as evidenced by the key intermediates detected. With a deeper mechanistic understanding and by further optimizing the plasma reactor, the realization of cost&#8208;effective electrical amination of benzene with N2 could become reality.

         <title>Photocatalytic Abstraction of Hydrogen Atoms from Water Using Hydroxylated Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Hydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using water as hydrogen donor is very challenging for hydrogen atom transfer reaction. Compared with gCN, the surface hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride (gCN&#8722;OH) shows the activation of H&#8722;O bonds in water under visible light irradiation, thus rendering water as hydrogen donor for multiple reductions involving a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step and the oxidation of water to H2O2.







Abstract
Employing pure water, the ultimate green source of hydrogen donor to initiate chemical reactions that involve a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step is fascinating but challenging due to its large H&#8722;O bond dissociation energy (BDEH&#8208;O=5.1&#8197;eV). Many approaches have been explored to stimulate water for hydrogenative reactions, but the efficiency and productivity still require significant enhancement. Here, we show that the surface hydroxylated graphitic carbon nitride (gCN&#8722;OH) only requires 2.25&#8197;eV to activate H&#8722;O bonds in water, enabling abstraction of hydrogen atoms via dehydrogenation of pure water into hydrogen peroxide under visible light irradiation. The gCN&#8722;OH presents a stable catalytic performance for hydrogenative N&#8722;N coupling, pinacol&#8208;type coupling and dehalogenative C&#8722;C coupling, all with high yield and efficiency, even under solar radiation, featuring extensive impacts in using renewable energy for a cleaner process in dye, electronic, and pharmaceutical industries.

         <title>[FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase: Defined Lysate&#8208;Free Maturation Reveals a Key Role for Lipoyl&#8208;H&#8208;Protein in DTMA Ligand Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aminomethyl&#8208;lipoyl&#8208;H&#8208;protein (Hmet) of the glycine cleavage system (GCS) is shown to play a key role in maturation of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase. Including Hmet, or Hmet plus other components of the GCS, allows maturation by purified HydE, HydF, and HydG in the absence of cell lysate for the first time.







Abstract
Maturation of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase (HydA) involves synthesis of a CO, CN&#8722;, and dithiomethylamine (DTMA)&#8208;coordinated 2Fe subcluster that is inserted into HydA to make the active hydrogenase. This process requires three maturation enzymes: the radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzymes HydE and HydG, and the GTPase HydF. In vitro maturation with purified maturation enzymes has been possible only when clarified cell lysate was added, with the lysate presumably providing essential components for DTMA synthesis and delivery. Here we report maturation of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase using a fully defined system that includes components of the glycine cleavage system (GCS), but no cell lysate. Our results reveal for the first time an essential role for the aminomethyl&#8208;lipoyl&#8208;H&#8208;protein of the GCS in hydrogenase maturation and the synthesis of the DTMA ligand of the H&#8208;cluster. In addition, we show that ammonia is the source of the bridgehead nitrogen of DTMA.

         <title>A Strategy Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Ratiometric Emission to Differentiate Molecular Weight of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through introducing fluorophores based on aggregation&#8208;induced ratiometric emission into supramolecular monomers, the molecular weight and fluorescence color of supramolecular polymers can be linked. In this system, with the increasing molecular weight, the fluorescence color changed from dark blue to yellow&#8208;green concurrently, thus enabling the visual differentiation of the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Molecular weight has an important bearing on the properties of supramolecular polymers. However, the intuitive differentiation of the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers remains challenging. Given this situation, establishing a reliable relationship between fluorescence properties and molecular weight may be a promising strategy. Herein, we prepared a supramolecular monomer M1 with aggregation&#8208;induced ratiometric emission characteristics. With the increasing M1 concentration (0.100&#8211;100&#8197;mM), the average degree of polymerization (DPDOSY) rose from 1.00 to 293. Meanwhile, the color changed from dark blue to cyan, finally to yellow&#8208;green in the same concentration range. Hence, the intuitive relationship between DPDOSY and fluorescence colors was constructed, allowing the visual differentiation of molecular weight. Moreover, the fluorescence color could be regulated by introducing a competitive molecule to induce the depolymerization of supramolecular polymers.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Endocyclic Allenes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Annulation Followed by Cope Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A relay strategy merging Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloaddition and enyne&#8208;Cope rearrangement is disclosed, affording chiral 9&#8208;membered endocyclic allenes with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Experimental and DFT calculation results rationalized the Cope rearrangement that allowed for the complete central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral endocyclic allenes remains a challenge in allene chemistry owing to unfavored tension and complex chirality. Here, we present a new relay strategy merging Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulation with enyne&#8208;Cope rearrangement, providing a facile route to chiral 9&#8208;membered endocyclic allenes with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Moreover, theoretical calculations and experimental studies were performed to illustrate the critical, but unusual Cope rearrangement that allows for the complete central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.

         <title>Well&#8208;Controlled Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylenes in Water: Synthesis of Water&#8208;Soluble Stereoregular Telechelic Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Well&#8208;controlled living polymerization of water&#8208;soluble phenylacetylene derivatives in water was achieved for the first time using a multicomponent catalytic system consisting of [Rh(nbd)Cl]2, an aryl boronic acid, diphenylacetylene having carboxy groups, a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, and a water&#8208;soluble triphenylphosphine. This catalytic system enables a direct synthesis of various water&#8208;soluble  cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetyelene)s having a narrow molecular weight distribution, the molecular weight of which can be controlled by the initial feed ratio of the monomer to the catalyst. Moreover, the syntheses of water&#8208;soluble telechelic poly(phenylacetylene)s having various functional groups at both chain ends as well as a water&#8208;soluble block copolymer were achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Triarylamine/Bithiophene Copolymer with Enhanced Quinoidal Character as Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polytriarylamine is a popular hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) despite its suboptimal conductivity and significant recombination at the interface in a solar cell setup. Having noted insufficient conjugation among the triarylamine units along the polymer backbone, we inserted a bithiophene unit between two triarylamine units through iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H/C&#8211;H coupling of a triarylamine/thiophene monomer so that two units conjugate effectively  via  four quinoidal rings when the molecule functions as HTM. The obtained triarylamine/bithiophene copolymer (  TABT  ) used as HTM showed a high&#8208;performance in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI  3  ) solar cells. Mesityl substituted  TABT  forms a uniform film, shows high hole&#8208;carrier mobility, and has an ionization potential (IP = 5.40 eV) matching that of MAPbI  3  . We fabricated a solar cell device with a power conversion efficiency of 21.3% and an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.15 V, which exceeds the performance of devices using reference standard such as poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (  PTAA  ) and  Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD  .</dc:description>

         <title>Adsorption in Reversed Order of C2 Hydrocarbons on an Ultramicroporous Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks have been widely studied in the separation of C  2  hydrocarbons, which usually preferentially bind unsaturated hydrocarbons with the order of acetylene (C  2  H  2  ) &gt; ethylene (C  2  H  4  ) &gt; ethane (C  2  H  6  ). Herein, we report an ultramicroporous fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework Zn&#8208;FBA (H  2  FBA = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid)), shows a reversed adsorption order characteristic for C  2  hydrocarbons, that the uptake for C  2  hydrocarbons of the framework and the binding affinity between the guest molecule and the framework follows the order C  2  H  6  &gt; C  2  H  4  &gt; C  2  H  2  . Density&#8208;functional theory calculations confirm that the completely reversed adsorption order behavior is attributed to the close van der Waals interactions and multiple cooperative C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F hydrogen bonds between the framework and C  2  H  6  . Moreover, Zn&#8208;FBA exhibits a high selectivity of about 2.9 for C  2  H  6  over C  2  H  4  at 298 K and 1 bar. The experimental breakthrough studies show that the high&#8208;purity C  2  H  4  can be obtained from C  2  H  6  and C  2  H  4  mixtures in one step.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Chemical Mediators Regulating Specialized Metabolism in a Symbiotic Cyanobacterium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Genomes of cyanobacteria feature a variety of cryptic biosynthetic pathways for complex natural products, but the peculiarities limiting the discovery and exploitation of the metabolic dark matter are not well understood. Here we describe the discovery of two cell density&#8208;dependent chemical mediators, nostoclide and nostovalerolactone, in the symbiotic model strain&amp;nbsp;&lt;italic&gt;Nostoc punctiforme&lt;/italic&gt;, and demonstrate their pronounced impact on the regulation of specialized metabolism. Through transcriptional, bioinformatic and labeling studies we assigned two adjacent biosynthetic gene clusters to the biosynthesis of the two polyketide mediators. Our findings provide insight into the orchestration of specialized metabolite production and give lessons for the genomic mining and high&#8208;titer production of cyanobacterial bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H Amination of Cyclic Amine Scaffolds Enabled by Polar&#8208;Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a polar&#8208;radical relay strategy for  &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H amination of cyclic amines with  N&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;sodio&#8208;carbamates. The relay is initiated by in situ generation of cyclic iminium intermediate using  N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) oxidant as an initiator, which then operates through a series of polar (addition and elimination) and radical (homolysis, hydrogen&#8208; and halogen atom transfer) reactions to enable the challenging C&#8211;N bond formation in a controlled manner. A broad range of  &#945;&#8208;amino cyclic amines were readily accessed with excellent regioselectivity, and the superb applicability was further demonstrated by functionalization of biologically relevant compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Decorating Bacteria with Triple Immune Nanoactivators Generates Tumor&#8208;Resident Living Immunotherapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach of decorating bacteria with triple immune nanoactivators is reported to develop tumor&#8208;resident living immunotherapeutics. Under a cytocompatible condition, tumor&#8208;specific antigens and checkpoint blocking antibodies are simultaneously conjugated onto bacterial surface by forming polydopamine nanoparticles via in&#8208;situ dopamine polymerization. In addition to a linker role, photothermal effect of polydopamine can repolarize tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to a pro&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. The linked antigens promote the maturation of dendritic cells and generate tumor&#8208;specific immune responses, while the anchored antibodies block immune checkpoints and activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Decorated bacteria show spatiotemporal tumor retention and proliferation&#8208;dependent drug release, achieving potent antitumor effects in two antigen&#8208;overexpressing tumor models. This work provides a versatile platform to prepare multimodal and long&#8208;acting therapeutics for cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Sb3+&#8208;Er3+&#8208;Codoped Cs2NaInCl6 for Emitting Blue and Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cs  2  NaInCl  6  double perovskite is stable, environmentally benign, and can be prepared easily. But it has high band gap (5.1 eV), and therefore, does not show optical and optoelectronic properties in the visible and short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region. Here we introduce such functionalities in Cs  2  NaInCl  6  by codoping Sb  3+  (  s  &#8208;electron doping) and Er  3+  (  f  &#8208;electron doping). Sb  3+  doping introduces optically allowed 5  s  2  &#8594; 5  s  1  5  p  1  electronic absorption at the sub band gap level, which then emit blue light with ~93% photoluminescence quantum yield. On the other hand,  f&#8208;f  electronic absorption of Er  3+  is parity forbidden. Codoping Sb  3+  &#8208;Er  3+  , leads to transfer of excitation energy from Sb  3+  to Er  3+  , yielding SWIR emission at 1540 nm that falls in the optical fiber communication region. Temperature (6 to 300 K) dependent photoluminescence measurements elucidate the excitation mechanism in the codoped Cs  2  NaInCl  6  . Further, we have fabricated phosphor converted light emitting diode (pc&#8208;LED) by coating the codoped sample on commercial ultraviolet LED chips. The pc&#8208;LED emit stable blue and SWIR radiation over prolonged operation (over 84 hours) at 5.1 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of a Novel Tubulin Inhibitor with a Unique Mechanism of Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we capitalized on our previously performed crystallographic fragment screen and developed the antitubulin small molecule Todalam with only two rounds of straightforward chemical synthesis. Todalam binds to a novel tubulin site, disrupts microtubule networks in cells, arrests cells in G2/M, induces cell death, and synergizes with vinblastine. The compound destabilizes microtubules by acting as a molecular plug that sterically inhibits the curved&#8208;to&#8208;straight conformational switch in the &#945;&#8208;tubulin subunit, and by sequestering tubulin dimers into assembly incompetent oligomers. Our results describe for the first time the generation of a fully rationally designed small molecule tubulin inhibitor from a fragment, which displays a unique molecular mechanism of action. They thus demonstrate the usefulness of tubulin&#8208;binding fragments as valuable starting points for innovative antitubulin drug and chemical probe discovery campaigns.</dc:description>

         <title>The Influence of Nanoconfinement on Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of nanoparticles and nanostructured electrodes are abundant in electrocatalysis. These nanometric systems contain elements of nanoconfinement in different degrees depending on the geometry, which can have a much greater effect on activity and selectivity than often considered. In this review, we firstly identify the systems containing different degrees of nanoconfinement and how they can affect the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions. Then we follow with a fundamental understanding of how electroche&#173;mistry and electrocatalysis are affected by nanoconfinement, which thanks to the development of new, atomically precise manufacturing and fabrication techniques, and advances in theoretical modelling, is beginning to be uncovered. The aim of this review is to help us look beyond using nanoconfinement as just a way to increase surface area, but also to break the scaling relations imposed on electrocatalysis by thermodynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;locked Activatable Phototheranostic Probe for Biomarkers Regulated Photodynamic and Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activatable phototheranostics holds promise for precision cancer treatment owing to the &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; signals and therapeutic effects. However, most activatable phototheranostic probes only possess photodynamic therapy (PDT) or photothermal therapy (PTT), which suffer from poor therapeutic efficacy due to deficient cellular oxygen and complex tumor microenvironment. We herein report a dual&#8208;locked activatable phototheranostic probe that activates near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) signals in tumor, triggers PDT in response to a tumor&#8208;periphery biomarker, and switches from PDT to PTT upon detecting a tumor&#8208;core&#8208;hypoxia biomarker.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Activatable phototheranostics holds promise for precision cancer treatment owing to the &#8220;turn-on&#8221; signals and therapeutic effects. However, most activatable phototheranostic probes only possess photodynamic therapy (PDT) or photothermal therapy (PTT), which suffer from poor therapeutic efficacy due to deficient cellular oxygen and complex tumor microenvironment. We herein report a dual-locked activatable phototheranostic probe that activates near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) signals in tumor, triggers PDT in response to a tumor-periphery biomarker, and switches from PDT to PTT upon detecting a tumor-core-hypoxia biomarker. This PDT-PTT auto-regulated probe exhibits complete tumor ablation under the photoirradiation of a single laser source by producing cytotoxic singlet oxygen at the tumor periphery and generating hyperthermia at tumor-core where is too hypoxic for PDT. This dual-locked probe represents a promising molecular design approach towards precise cancer phototheranostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropane&#8208;fused  N&#8208;heterocycles are featured in various biologically active compounds and represent attractive scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. However, synthesis routes to access structurally diverse and functionally complex cyclopropane&#8208;fused  N&#8208;heterocycles remain underexplored. Leveraging novel &#945;&#8208;diazo acylating agents, we report a general approach for the direct and modular synthesis of cyclopropane&#8208;fused lactams from unsaturated amines. The operationally simple transformation, which proceeds through successive acylation, (3+2) cycloaddition and fragmentation, tolerates a broad range of functional groups and yields a wide spectrum of complex molecular scaffolds, including fused, bridged and spiro ring systems. We demonstrate the utility of this transformation in the concise syntheses of therapeutic agents milnaciprane and amitifadine.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Site&#8208;Selective Asymmetric Protoboration of Unactivated Alkenes Enabled by Bimetallic Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal bimetallic relay catalytic strategy capable of enantioselectively imbedding a boryl functionality at a remote, less&#8208;activated site of aryl alkenes is disclosed. This approach was applicable to unactivated terminal and internal alkenes, as well as a mixture of olefin isomers, thus leading to the corresponding chiral products with a boryl&#8208;substituted stereogenic center &#946; to a functional group.







Abstract
A remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond asymmetric borylation of unactivated alkenes was achieved by bimetallic relay catalysis. The reaction proceeded through reversible and consecutive &#946;&#8208;H elimination/olefin insertion promoted by CoH species generated in situ, followed by copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric protoboration. The use of this synergistic Co/Cu catalysis protocol allowed the enantioselective protoboration of various unactivated terminal alkenes and internal alkenes, as well as an unrefined mixture of olefin isomers, at the distal less&#8208;reactive &#946;&#8208;position to a functional group, leading to chiral organoboronates.

The generation of an active [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, the most efficient enzyme for H2 production, requires the synthesis of a complex metal center, the H&#8208;cluster, which is responsible for the reversible reduction of protons to H2. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202203413), Joan&#8197;B. Broderick and co&#8208;workers show that the last step of this synthesis, which consists of the assembly of the azadithiolate bridging molecule, involves the aminomethyl&#8208;lipoyl&#8208;H&#8208;protein from the glycine cleavage system.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical properties of nanogels influence their cellular fate. Inspired by the natural ability of the cells to sense stiffness, Smriti Singh et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202116653) developed highly hydrophilic soft nanogels and show that the passive engulfment of the soft nanogels by the immune cells was drastically reduced compared to the stiffer counterpart. The delayed uptake resulted in an enhanced circulation time of the nanogels, an important criterion for drug delivery applications.

         <title>Boosting the Productivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products by Enhancing CO2 Diffusion through a Porous Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic cages (POCs) were used as an additive to enhance the CO2 diffusion in flow cell catalyst layers, thus boosting the productivity of the CO2 electroreduction reaction. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products reached 76.1&#8201;% when Cu&#8208;nanorod/CC3 (one of the POCs) was used. The diffusion of CO2 through CC3 to the nanocatalyst surface is easier than in liquid electrolyte, therefore more CO2 molecules make contact with the nanocatalyst.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into valuable fuels and feedstocks offers a promising way for CO2 utilization. However, the commercialization is limited by the low productivity. Here, we report a strategy to enhance the productivity of CO2 electroreduction by improving diffusion of CO2 to the surface of catalysts using porous organic cages (POCs) as an additive. It was noted that the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could reach 76.1&#8201;% with a current density of 1.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 when Cu&#8208;nanorod(nr)/CC3 (one of the POCs) was used, which were much higher than that using Cu&#8208;nr. Detailed studies demonstrated that the hydrophobic pores of CC3 can adsorb a large amount of CO2 for the reaction, and the diffusion of CO2 in the CC3 to the nanocatalyst surface is easier than that in the liquid electrolyte. Thus, more CO2 molecules make contact with the nanocatalysts in the presence of CC3, enhancing CO2 reduction and inhibiting generation of H2.

The diffusion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through CC3 to the nanocatalyst surface is easier than in liquid electrolyte, therefore more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules make contact with the nanocatalyst.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into valuable fuels and feedstocks offers a promising way for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization. However, the commercialization is limited by the low productivity. Here, we report a strategy to enhance the productivity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction by improving diffusion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the surface of catalysts using porous organic cages (POCs) as an additive. It was noted that the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could reach 76.1&#8201;% with a current density of 1.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; when Cu-nanorod(nr)/CC3 (one of the POCs) was used, which were much higher than that using Cu-nr. Detailed studies demonstrated that the hydrophobic pores of CC3 can adsorb a large amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the reaction, and the diffusion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the CC3 to the nanocatalyst surface is easier than that in the liquid electrolyte. Thus, more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules make contact with the nanocatalysts in the presence of CC3, enhancing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and inhibiting generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning an Imine Reductase for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Azacycloalkylamines by Concise Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;guided engineering of an imine reductase IR&#8208;G36 gave a final variant M5 for reductive amination, enabling the asymmetric synthesis of a series of azacycloalkylamines with up to 47&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 substrate loadings and up to 99&#8201;% conversion and &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Crystal structures of IR&#8208;G36 and computational studies shed light on the structural basis for the performance improvement.







Abstract
Although imine reductases (IREDs) are emerging as attractive reductive aminases (RedAms), their substrate scope is still narrow, and rational engineering is rare. Focusing on hydrogen bond reorganization and cavity expansion, a concise strategy combining rational cavity design, combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST), and thermostability engineering was designed, that transformed the weakly active IR&#8208;G36 into a variant M5 with superior performance for the synthesis of (R)&#8208;3&#8208;benzylamino&#8208;1&#8208;Boc&#8208;piperidine, with a 4193&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency, a 16.2&#8201;&#176;C improvement in Tm, and a significant increase in the e.e. value from 78&#8201;% (R) to &gt;99&#8201;% (R). M5 exhibits broad substrate scope for the synthesis of diverse azacycloalkylamines, and the reaction was demonstrated on a hectogram&#8208;scale under industrially relevant conditions. Our study provides a compelling example of the preparation of versatile and efficient IREDs, with exciting opportunities in medicinal and process chemistry as well as synthetic biology.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Mediated Biosynthesis of Semiconductor Nanocrystals for Photocatalytic NAD(P)H Regeneration and Chiral Amine Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A size&#8208;controlled, homogeneous, and ordered biosynthesis of CdS NPs in a bioengineered protein cavity is presented. The formed nano&#8208;bio hybrid facilitates outstanding photocatalytic NADPH regeneration that can be utilized for the photo&#8208;induced activation of redox enzymes. The nano&#8208;bio hybrid presented superior long&#8208;term stereoselective production of a chiral amine that is essential for the pharmaceutical industry.







Abstract
The use of predesigned bioengineered proteins for self&#8208;grown nanomaterials is a promising strategy that opens new scientific directions for biotic&#8208;abiotic nano&#8208;bio hybrid configurations. The unique properties of nanomaterials can alter the original biological paradigm to allow novel metabolic routes or new activation triggers. In this work, we present a synthetic methodology for self&#8208;grown cadmium sulfide quantum dots in a 12&#8208;mer bioengineered stable protein 1 under ambient conditions. The sized controlled crystalline QDs are characterized and utilized for NADPH regeneration that is in turn used for the activation of the imine reductase enzyme. The presented nano&#8208;bio hybrid system enables the production of a single enantiomeric product that is required for the pharmaceutical industry. Our designed system presents superior activity and can continuously operate for at least 22&#8197;hrs with 82&#8201;% conversion efficiency. The obtained results may lay the foundations for future nano&#8208;bio hybrid systems that can operate both in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Tuning the Elasticity of Nanogels Improves Their Circulation Time by Evading Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small changes in the elasticity of the inherently soft radiolabeled nanogels show major differences in its in vivo circulation half&#8208;life. Longer circulation life renders a higher possibility for nanogels to accumulate in the tumor microenvironment by enhanced permeation and retention effect.







Abstract
Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is used to treat solid tumors by locally delivering radiation. However, due to nephro&#8208; and hepato&#8208;toxicity, it is limited by its dosage. To amplify radiation damage to tumor cells, radiolabeled nanogels can be used. We show that by tuning the mechanical properties of nanogels significant enhancement in circulation half&#8208;life of the gel could be achieved. We demonstrate why and how small changes in the mechanical properties of the nanogels influence its cellular fate. Nanogels with a storage modulus of 37&#8197;kPa were minimally phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages compared to nanogels with 93&#8197;kPa modulus. Using PET/CT a significant difference in the blood circulation time of the nanogels was shown. Computer simulations affirmed the results and predicted the mechanism of cellular uptake of the nanogels. Altogether, this work emphasizes the important role of elasticity even for particles that are inherently soft such as nano&#8208; or microgels.

         <title>Metal&#8594;Carbon Dative Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ambiphilic system containing a phosphine and a carbenium ion as an L&#8208;type andZ&#8208;type ligand, respectively, readily complexes zero&#8208;valent Group 10 metals to form complexes featuring M&#8594;Ccarbenium dative bonds. The formation of these dative bonds is supported by structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies which show that, out of three metals, palladium is the least metallobasic.







Abstract
As part of our interest in unusual bonding situations, we are now targeting complexes featuring metal&#8594;carbon dative bonds. Here, we report on the formation of such linkages in a series of Group 10 complexes featuring a triarylphosphine ligand functionalized at the &#947; position by a carbenium ion. Through combined synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies, we show that the M&#8594;Ccarbenium interaction present in these complexes scales with the basicity of the donor, confirming its dative nature.

The first single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal reversible [2+2] photo&#8208;oligomerization of conjugated dienones under visible light is reported.







Abstract
The synthesis of reversible oligomer/polymers is fascinating both from the perspective of the fundamental understanding as well as their applications, ranging from biomedical to self&#8208;healing smart materials. On the other hand, the reactions that occur in single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) fashion offer great details of the structure, geometry and stereochemistry of the product. However, SCSC [2+2] oligomerization is rather difficult and rare. Further, till date there are no reports for a reversible [2+2] oligomerization in SCSC fashion. In this work, four halogen&#8208;substituted acrylic dienone molecules were deliberately designed and their ability to participate in [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in solid state was studied under visible light. Despite of having the required alignment of double bonds of dienes in all four crystal structures, they were found to exhibit variable reactivities given the differences in their weak intermolecular interactions such as halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;halogen, halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of reversible oligomer/polymers is fascinating both from the perspective of the fundamental understanding as well as their applications, ranging from biomedical to self-healing smart materials. On the other hand, the reactions that occur in single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) fashion offer great details of the structure, geometry and stereochemistry of the product. However, SCSC [2+2] oligomerization is rather difficult and rare. Further, till date there are no reports for a reversible [2+2] oligomerization in SCSC fashion. In this work, four halogen-substituted acrylic dienone molecules were deliberately designed and their ability to participate in [2+2] cycloaddition reaction in solid state was studied under visible light. Despite of having the required alignment of double bonds of dienes in all four crystal structures, they were found to exhibit variable reactivities given the differences in their weak intermolecular interactions such as halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;halogen, halogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions.

         <title>A Bacteria&#8208;Responsive Porphyrin for Adaptable Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic porphyrin that can respond to specific bacteria followed by adaptable photodynamic/photothermal therapy is reported. It can be reduced to phlorin by reductive facultative anaerobes in hypoxic environments, possessing NIR photothermal conversion ability and demonstrating excellent antimicrobial activity by photothermal therapy. With aerobic bacteria, it functions as an efficient antibacterial photosensitizer by photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
We report a cationic porphyrin 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TMPyP) that can respond to specific bacteria, followed by adaptable photodynamic/photothermal therapy processes. TMPyP could be reduced to phlorin by facultative anaerobes with a strong reducing ability such as E.&#8197;coli and S.&#8197;typhimurium in hypoxic environments, possessing strong NIR absorption and remarkable photothermal conversion capacity, thus demonstrating excellent antimicrobial activity (&gt;99&#8201;%) by photothermal therapy. While in an aerobic environment with aerobic bacteria, TMPyP functioned as a typical photosensitizer that killed bacteria effectively (&gt;99.9&#8201;%) by photodynamic therapy. By forming a host&#8211;guest complex with cucurbit[7]uril, the biocompatibility of TMPyP significantly improved. This kind of bacteria&#8208;responsive porphyrin shows specificity and adaptivity in antimicrobial treatment and holds potential in non&#8208;invasive treatments of bacterial infections.

         <title>Sequencing of Uniform Multifunctional Oligoesters via Random Chain Cleavages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the determination of the monomer order of sequence&#8208;defined macromolecules by making use of ESI&#8208; or LC&#8211;MS is described. This approach, which relies on the introduction of random chain cleavages within the macromolecular backbone, enabled the rapid chemical sequencing of abiotic macromolecules.







Abstract
Sequence&#8208;defined polymers have been the object of many fascinating studies that focus on their implementation in both material and life science applications. In parallel, iterative synthetic methodologies have become more efficient, whereas the structure elucidation of these molecules is generally dependent on MS/MS analysis. Here, we report an alternative, simple strategy for the determination of the monomer order of uniform oligo(thioether ester)s. This approach, which relies on random cleavages of ester units within the macromolecular backbone via a basic treatment, enables the swift characterization of these macromolecules without the need for MS/MS. Consequently, this method can be used for decoding any information stored within the primary structure of oligoesters by means of ESI&#8208; or LC&#8211;MS. Finally, we speculate that a range of structurally diverse backbones could be susceptible towards this approach, which could promptly expand the library of chemically sequenceable macromolecules.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Nanolayer for Copper Film Oxidation Mitigation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti rust carbenes: A 2&#8197;nm thick nanolayer was deposited on a Cu film by selective electrochemical deposition and on&#8208;surface polymerization of an alkyne&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. Nanolayer formation inhibited copper oxidation under elevated temperatures and alkaline conditions.







Abstract
The wide use of copper is limited by its rapid oxidation. Main oxidation mitigation approaches involve alloying or surface passivation technologies. However, surface alloying often modifies the physical properties of copper, while surface passivation is characterized by limited thermal and chemical stability. Herein, we demonstrate an electrochemical approach for surface&#8208;anchoring of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nanolayer on a copper electrode by electro&#8208;deposition of alkyne&#8208;functionalized imidazolium cations. Water reduction reaction generated a high concentration of hydroxide ions that induced deprotonation of imidazolium cations and self&#8208;assembly of NHCs on the copper electrode. In addition, alkyne group deprotonation enabled on&#8208;surface polymerization by coupling surface&#8208;anchored and solvated NHCs, which resulted in a 2&#8197;nm thick NHC&#8208;nanolayer. Copper film coated with a NHC&#8208;nanolayer demonstrated high oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures and under alkaline conditions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic methodology was established by diminishing the differences in reduction rates for the precursor systems to prepare homogeneous RhxPd1&#8722;x solid solutions as a dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalyst. The Rh&#8722;Pd dual&#8208;atom sites in Pd0.1Rh0.9 and Pd0.3Rh0.7 could activate CO and NO in three&#8208;way catalytic reactions, and showed superior activities over pure Rh.







Abstract
This study provided an effective strategy to construct dual&#8208;atom sites by solid&#8211;solution alloying. A slow synthesis methodology was established for the solid&#8211;solution preparations as dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts. The atomic&#8208;level homogeneous PdxRh1&#8722;x dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts were successfully synthesized over the whole composition range, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscope energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy mapping measurements. The challenging morphology formation in the immiscible alloys was achieved by an energy&#8208;controlling process as the octahedral Rh&#8208;rich alloys. The Pd0.3Rh0.7 dual&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalyst had unique surface states to activate the key reactants of CO and NO in the complex three&#8208;way catalytic reactions, and it performed significantly better than pure Rh.
