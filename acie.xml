      <title>Ferroelectricity&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Powered Ultraviolet Photodetection with Strong Polarization&#8208;Sensitivity in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Hybrid Perovskite</title>
      <dc:description>Polarization&#8208;sensitive ultraviolet (UV) photodetection is highly indispensable in military and civilian applications and has been demonstrated with various wide&#8208;band photodetectors. However, it still remains elusive to achieve the self&#8208;powered devices, which can be operated in the absence of external bias. Herein, for the first time, ferroelectricity&#8208;driven self&#8208;powered photodetection towards polarized UV light was successfully demonstrated in a 2D wide&#8208;bandgap hybrid ferroelectric (BPA)  2  PbBr  4  (BPA = 3&#8208;bromopropylammonium) (  1  ). We found that the prominent spontaneous polarization in  1  results in a bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) of 0.85 V, that independently drives photoexcited carriers separation and transport and thus supports self&#8208;powered ability. Emphatically, this self&#8208;powered detector show a strong polarization&#8208;sensitivity to the linearly polarized UV illumination with an impressive polarization ratio up to 6. 8, which is greatly superior to that of previously reported UV&#8208;polarized photodetectors (  e.g.  ZnO, GaN and GeS  2  ). As pioneering work, this work presents a paradigm for achieving self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodetection with strong polarization&#8208;sensitivity by integrating ferroelectricity into hybrid halide perovskites.</dc:description>

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE): A Historical Perspective</title>
      <dc:description>
An old phenomenon in a new light: In this brief Essay, the currently highly recognized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) phenomenon is discussed in a broader perspective by illustrating its roots in earlier work.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) has attracted considerable interest over the last twenty years. In contrast to the large number of available reviews focusing specifically on AIE, this Essay discusses the AIE phenomenon from a broader perspective, with an emphasis on early observations related to AIE made long before the term was coined. Illustrative examples are highlighted from the 20th century where fluorescence enhancement upon rigidification of dyes in viscous or solid environments or J&#8208;aggregate formation was studied. It is shown that these examples already include typical AIE luminogens such as tetraphenylethylene (TPE) as well as stilbenes and oligo&#8208; or polyphenylenevinylenes and &#8208;ethynylenes, which became important fluorescent solid&#8208;state materials in OLED research in the 1990s. Further examples include cyanine dyes such as thiazole orange (TO) or its dimers (TOTOs), which have been widely applied as molecular probes in nucleic acid research. The up to 10&#8201;000&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement of such dyes upon intercalation into double&#8208;stranded DNA, attributable to the restricted intramolecular motion (RIM) concept, afforded commercial products for bioimaging and fluorescence sensing applications already in the early 1990s.

      <title>Dual&#8208;functionalisation of fluorophores for the preparation of targeted and selective probes</title>
      <dc:description>A key current challenge in biological research is the elucidation of the that roles chemicals and chemical reactions play in cellular function and dysfunction.

      <title>A Synergistic Enhancement Strategy for Realizing Ultralong and Efficient Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>Reported here is a synergistic enhancement strategy for realizing ultralong bright room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), involving polymerization between phosphor monomers and acrylamide and host&#8208;guest complexation interaction between phosphors and  cucurbit[6, 7, 8]urils  (CB[6, 7, 8]). The non&#8208;phosphorescent monomers exhibit 2.46 s ultralong lifetime after copolymerizing with acrylamide. The immense improvement is because of the rich hydrogen bond and carbonyl within the polymers which promote intersystem crossing (ISC), suppress nonradiative relaxation and shield quenchers effectively. By tuning the ratio of chromophores, a series of phosphorescent copolymers with different lifetimes and quantum yields are prepared. Significantly, the complexation of macrocyclic hosts CB[6, 7, 8] promote the RTP of polymers by blocking aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ), and offsetting the losses of aforementioned interaction provided by polymer. Moreover, multiple lifetime&#8208;encoding for digit and character encryption are achieved by utilizing the difference of their lifetimes, demonstrating great potential in anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This synergistic enhancement strategy provides a new approach for realizing high&#8208;performance RTP.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Deuteration of Halides with D2O as the Deuterium Source over a Copper Nanowire Arrays Cathode</title>
      <dc:description>Precise deuterium incorporation with controllable deuterated sites and amount is extremely desirable. Here, a facile and efficient electrocatalytic deuterodehalogenation of halides using heavy water (D  2  O) as the deuteration reagent and electrochemical in situ formed copper nanowire arrays (Cu NWAs) as the cathode was demonstrated. A cross&#8208;coupling of carbon and deuterium free radicals might be involved for this ipso&#8208;selective deuteration. This method exhibited excellent chemoselectivity and high compatibility with the easily reducible functional groups such as C=C, C&#8801;C, C=O, C=N, and C&#8801;N bonds. The C&#8211;H to C&#8211;D transformations were successfully achieved with high yields and deuterium ratios through a one&#8208;pot halogenation&#8208;deuterodehalogenation process. Efficient deuteration of less&#8208;active bromide substrates, specific deuterium incorporation into top&#8208;selling pharmaceuticals, and oxidant&#8208;free paired anodic synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals with low energy input highlighted the potential practicality.</dc:description>

      <title>Evolution of the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction Mechanism Since the 1930s:
Woodward, Houk with Woodward, and the Influence of Computational Chemistry on Understanding Cycloadditions</title>
      <dc:description>The first Cope Award was presented in 1973 to R. B. Woodward and Roald Hoffmann (the only shared Cope Award). In his award lecture, Woodward described his fascination in his early teens with the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Beginning in the late 1930s with his B.S. and Ph.D. theses and extending throughout his career, Woodward studied the mechanism of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and used it extensively in his total syntheses. This article describes the evolution of Woodward&#8217;s mechanistic thinking, beginning in the late 1930s and early 1940s with his proposal of a charge&#8208;transfer mechanism for the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, eventually leading to the Woodward&#8208;Katz two&#8208;stage concerted mechanism in 1959, and then to its mechanistic solution in terms of orbital symmetry control. There was much debate in the chemical literature about the validity of Woodward&#8217;s early mechanisms, especially with Michael Dewar. However, as discussed in this paper, many of Woodward&#8217;s mechanistic hypotheses have turned out to be valid. Modern calculations with quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations have shown that Woodward indeed had perfectly described not only the cyclopentadiene dimerization mechanism, but a new class of transition states now known as ambimodal or bis&#8208;pericyclic transition states. This mechanistic type was first discovered in 2002 by the late Pierluigi Caramella from Pavia, Italy. In recent years, the Houk group has found that ambimodal reactions are operative in the [6+4] cycloaddition that Woodward and Hoffmann predicted in 1965, and that Houk studied experimentally as a graduate student. Molecular dynamics simulations of many Diels&#8208;Alder and ambimodal cycloadditions, in solvents and in enzymes, provide a time&#8208;resolved picture of how Woodward&#8217;s favorite reactions occur. &#160; Lastly, Roald Hoffmann provides a Coda in which he describes his joy in &#8220;being taken along the journey&#8221; of the cycloaddition story from Woodward&#8217;s youth to today&#8217;s trajectory simulations.</dc:description>

Molecular dynamics simulations of many Diels&#8208;Alder and ambimodal cycloadditions, in solvents and in enzymes, provide a time&#8208;resolved picture of how Woodward&#8217;s favorite reactions occur. &#160; Lastly, Roald Hoffmann provides a Coda in which he describes his joy in &#8220;being taken along the journey&#8221; of the cycloaddition story from Woodward&#8217;s youth to today&#8217;s trajectory simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Dearomatization/Debromination Strategy for the [4+1] Spiroannulation of Bromophenols with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Imines</title>
      <dc:description>A novel [4+1] spiroannulation of o&#8208; &amp; p&#8208;bromophenols with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines has been developed for the direct synthesis of a new family of azaspirocyclic molecules. Notably, several other halophenols (X = Cl, I) were also applicable for this transformation. Moreover, a catalytic asymmetric version of the reaction was realized with 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols by using a chiral Sc(III)/Py&#8208;Box catalyst. Mechanistic studies revealed that this domino reaction proceeded through electrophile&#8208;triggered dearomatization of phenol derivatives at their halogenated positions and followed by halogen&#8208;displacement with N&#8208;nucleophiles via a radical&#8208;based SRN1 mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Imidazole&#8208;based Synthetic Lipidoids for In Vivo mRNA Delivery into Primary T Lymphocytes</title>
      <dc:description>Engineering T lymphocytes is an emerging approach in a variety of biomedical applications. However, delivering large biologics to primary T lymphocytes directly  in vivo  is technically challenging due to the low transfection efficacy. In this paper, we investigated a library of synthetic lipid&#8208;like molecules (lipidoids) for their capability of delivering mRNA into primary T lymphocytes both  ex vivo  and  in vivo  . We initially conducted a library screening with large structural variety of lipidoids  ex vivo  and identified imidazole&#8208;containing lipidoids that are particularly potent in T lymphocytes transfection. We further optimized lipidoid structures through constructing and screening a detailed lipidoid library containing imidazole or imidazole analogues to perform a structure&#8208;activity correlation analysis. Using the lead lipidoid as a delivery vehicle for Cre mRNA  in vivo  through intravenous injection, we obtained ~8.2% of gene recombination in mouse T lymphocytes.</dc:description>

      <title>Proapoptotic Peptide Brush Polymer Nanoparticles via Photoinitiated Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report photoinitiated polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (photo&#8208;PISA) of spherical micelles consisting of proapoptotic peptide&#8208;polymer amphiphiles. The one&#8208;pot synthetic approach yielded micellar nanoparticles at high concentrations and at scale (150 mg/mL) with tunable peptide loadings up to 48 wt. %. The size of the micellar nanoparticles was tuned by varying the lengths of hydrophobic and hydrophilic building blocks. Critically, the peptide&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles imbued the proapoptotic &#8220;KLA&#8221; peptides (amino acid sequence: KLAKLAKKLAKLAK) with two key properties otherwise not inherent to the sequence: 1) proteolytic resistance compared to the oligopeptide alone; 2) significantly enhanced cell uptake permeability by multivalent display of KLA peptide brushes. The result was demonstrated improved apoptosis efficiency in HeLa cells. These results highlight the potential of photo&#8208;PISA in the large&#8208;scale synthesis of functional, proteolytically resistant peptide&#8208;polymer conjugates for intracellular delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Rigid Arrangements of Ionic Charge in Zeolite Frameworks Conferred by Specific Al Distributions Preferentially Stabilize Alkanol Dehydration Transition States</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolite reactivity depends on the solvating environments of their micropores and the proximity of their Br&#248;nsted acid sites. Turnover rates (per H+) for methanol and ethanol dehydration increase with the fraction of H+ sites sharing six&#8208;membered rings of chabazite (CHA) zeolites.

Certain Al distributions yield rigid arrangements of anionic charge that stabilize cationic intermediates and transition states via H&#8208;bonding to decrease barriers. This is a key feature of acid catalysis in zeolite solvents, which lack the isotropy of liquid solvents. The sensitivity of polar transition states to specific arrangements of charge in their solvating environments and the ability to position such charges in zeolite lattices with increasing precision herald rich catalytic diversity among zeolites of varying Al arrangement.</dc:description>

Gas&#8208;Phase Chemistry The fleeting existence of [V2O]+ as a reactive intermediate in the oxidation of [V2]+ by CO2 is described by J. Li, H.

      <dc:description>
Simple substrates, all commercially available, lead to previously unknown aminopentazole derivatives. By using Na15N3, the heterocyclic product with six&#8208;fold 15N labelling is easily accessible, which enabled structure identification by 15N&#8197;NMR spectroscopy without comparison with known data.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simple substrates &lt;/b&gt;, all commercially available, lead to previously unknown aminopentazole derivatives. By using Na&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the heterocyclic product with six&#8208;fold &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N labelling is easily accessible, which enabled structure identification by &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N&#8197;NMR spectroscopy without comparison with known data.

      <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of Mineral Respiration: How Iron Hemes Synchronize Electron Transfer Rates</title>
      <dc:description>
The bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens requires extracellular metal salts for respiration. Each microorganism produces 5&#215;105 electrons per second, which reduce the metal ions bound to the outer membrane cytochromes. With iron heme cofactors of c&#8208;type cytochromes, the electron flow is independent of the concentration and type of oxidant. This results in ATP homeostasis.







Abstract
Anaerobic microorganisms of the Geobacter genus are effective electron sources for the synthesis of nanoparticles, for bioremediation of polluted water, and for the production of electricity in fuel cells. In multistep reactions, electrons are transferred via iron/heme cofactors of c&#8208;type cytochromes from the inner cell membrane to extracellular metal ions, which are bound to outer membrane cytochromes. We measured electron production and electron flux rates to 5&#215;105&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1 per G.&#8197;sulfurreducens. Remarkably, these rates are independent of the oxidants, and follow zero order kinetics. It turned out that the microorganisms regulate electron flux rates by increasing their Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios in the multiheme cytochromes whenever the activity of the extracellular metal oxidants is diminished. By this mechanism the respiration remains constant even when oxidizing conditions are changing. This homeostasis is a vital condition for living systems, and makes G.&#8197;sulfurreducens a versatile electron source.

      <title>Automated, Accelerated Nanoscale Synthesis of Iminopyrrolidines</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthesis of iminopyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives using chiral glutamine, oxo components, and isocyanide building blocks in an unprecedented Ugi 3&#8208;component reaction is described. I&#8208;DOT was used to prepare more than 1000 different derivatives in a fully automated fashion. The reaction is stereoselective, proceeds in good yields, and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups.







Abstract
Miniaturization and acceleration of synthetic chemistry is an emerging area in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials research and development. Herein, we describe the synthesis of iminopyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives using chiral glutamine, oxo components, and isocyanide building blocks in an unprecedented Ugi&#8208;3&#8208;component reaction. We used I&#8208;DOT, a positive&#8208;pressure&#8208;based low&#8208;volume and non&#8208;contact dispensing technology to prepare more than 1000 different derivatives in a fully automated fashion. In general, the reaction is stereoselective, proceeds in good yields, and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups. We exemplify a pipeline of fast and efficient nanomole&#8208;scale scouting to millimole&#8208;scale synthesis for the discovery of a useful novel reaction with great scope.

      <title>Spherical Supramolecular Structures Constructed via Chemically Symmetric Perylene Bisimides: Beyond Columnar Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Like other discotic molecules, self&#8208;assembled supramolecular structures of perylene bisimides (PBIs) are commonly limited to columnar or lamellar structures due to their distinct &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds and unique rectangular shape of perylene cores. The discovery of PBIs with supramolecular structures beyond layers and columns may expand the scope of PBI&#8208;based materials. Herein, we report a series of unconventional spherical packing phases in PBIs including A15 phase, &#963; phase, dodecagonal quasicrystalline (DQC) phase, and body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) phase. By the functionalization of perylene core with several polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) cages, our strategy successfully achieves spherical assemblies of PBIs, instead of columnar assemblies, due to the significantly increased steric hindrance at the periphery. This strategy may also be employed for the discovery of unconventional spherical assemblies in other related discotic molecules by the introduction of similar bulky functional groups at their periphery. In addition, an unusual inverse phase transition sequence from BCC phase to &#963; phase by increasing annealing temperature is observed.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Spatial organization of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) supramolecular assembly is critical to the photophysical processes involved in solar energy conversion systems. Subtle variation in geometry, i.e. D&#8208;A distance and transition dipole arrangement can influence kinetics and thermodynamics of the electron transfer (ET) process.

      <title>Universal Access to Two&#8208;Dimensional Mesoporous Heterostructures via Micelle&#8208;Directed Interfacial Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) mesoporous heterostructures combining ultrathin nanosheet morphology, periodic porous surface structures and diverse hybrid compositions have recently emerged and become increasingly important for renewable energy storage and electronics. However, it remains a great challenge to develop a universal method to prepare 2D mesoporous heterostructures. Here, we report a composite micelle&#8208;directed interfacial assembly method to synthesize vertical heterostructures with ultrathin 2D material and two surrounding mesoporous monolayers assembled on both sides. To demonstrate the concept, we first fabricate a new sandwich&#8208;like carbon@MXene@carbon mesoporous heterostructure through self&#8208;assembly of MXene nanosheets and block copolymer F127/melamine&#8208;formaldehyde resin composite micelles as well as a subsequent thermal treatment. We also show that this approach can be applied to other 2D materials (for example, graphene oxide, potassium niobate nanosheets, and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. Finally, we demonstrate that the carbon@MXene@carbon mesoporous heterostructured nanosheets manifest remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance as cathode for lithium sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Coupling Wireless Bipolar Ultramicroelectrode with Nano&#8208;electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry: Insights into the Ultrafast Initial Step of Electrochemical Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>We report a new mass spectrometric method for detecting electrogenerated intermediates. This approach is based on simultaneous activation of electrospray ionization and redox reaction on a wireless bipolar ultramicroelectrode, which is fabricated in the tip of a quartz nanopipette. The hollow structure of the ultramicroelectrode permits rapid transferring the transient species from electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces into gas phase for mass spectrometric identification on the time scale of microseconds. The long&#8208;sought fleeting intermediates including TPrA&#9679;+, whose lifetime in solution is only 200 &#956;s, and catecholamine o&#8208;semiquinone radicals, whose second&#8208;order rate constant is typically ~109 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1, were successfully identified, helping clarify the previously hidden reaction pathways. Accordingly, our method may have wide applicability in exploring the dynamics of many electrochemical reactions, especially their ultrafast initial steps.</dc:description>

      <title>Synergy of Electrostatic and &#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions in the Realization of Nanoscale Artificial Photosynthetic Model Systems</title>
      <dc:description>In the scientific race to build up photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems with increasing efficiencies, little is known about the interplay of their building blocks when integrated into supramolecular nanoscale arrays, particularly in aqueous environments. Here, we describe an aqueous donor&#8208;acceptor ensemble whose emergence as a nanoscale material renders it remarkably stable and efficient. We have focused on a tetracationic zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) featuring pyrenes, which shows an unprecedented mode of aggregation, driven by subtle cooperation between electrostatic and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. Our studies demonstrate monocrystalline growth in solution and a symmetry&#8208;breaking intermolecular charge transfer between adjacent ZnPcs upon photoexcitation. Immobilizing a negatively charged fullerene (C  60  ) as electron acceptor onto the monocrystalline ZnPc assemblies was found to enhance the overall stability, and to suppress the energy&#8208;wasting charge recombination found in the absence of C  60  . Overall, the resulting artificial photosynthetic model system exhibits a high degree of preorganization, which facilitates efficient charge separation and subsequent charge transport.</dc:description>

      <title>Atomic Insights into Aluminium&#8208;Ion Insertion in Defective Anatase for Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Aluminium batteries constitute a safe and sustainable high&#8211;energy&#8208;density electrochemical energy&#8208;storage solution. Viable Al&#8208;ion batteries require suitable electrode materials that can readily intercalate high&#8208;charge Al  3+  ions. Here, we investigate the Al  3+  intercalation chemistry of anatase TiO  2  and how chemical modifications influence the accommodation of Al  3+  ions. We use fluoride&#8208; and hydroxide&#8208;doping to generate high concentrations of titanium vacancies. The coexistence of these hetero&#8208;anions and titanium vacancies leads to a complex insertion mechanism, attributed to three distinct types of host sites: native interstitials sites, single vacancy sites, and paired vacancy sites. We demonstrate that Al  3+  induces a strong local distortion within the modified TiO  2  structure, which affects the insertion properties of the neighbouring host sites. Overall, specific structural features induced by the intercalation of highly&#8208;polarizing Al  3+  ions should be considered when designing new electrode materials for multivalent batteries.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Gastrin&#8208;releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) plays proliferative and inflammatory roles in living systems. Here, we report a highly selective GRPr antagonist (JMV594)&#8208;tethered iridium(III) complex for probing GRPr in living cancer cells and immune cells. This probe not only exhibited desirable photophysical properties, but also displayed negligible cytotoxicity, overcoming the inherent toxicity of the iridium(III) complex.

This probe selectively visualized living cancer cells via specific binding to GRPr, while it also modulated the function of GRPr on TNF&#8208;&#945; secretion in immune cells. To our knowledge, this is the first peptide&#8208;conjugated iridium(III) complex developed as a GRPr bioimaging probe and modulator of GRPr activity.

Herein, we report the construction of a class of precisely aligned flexible&#8208;on&#8208;rigid hybrid&#8208;phase MOFs with unique rods&#8208;on&#8208;octahedron morphology. We demonstrated that hybrid&#8208;phase MOFs can be constructed based on two prerequisites: the partially matched topology at the interface of the two frameworks, and the structural flexibility of MOFs with  acs  topology, which can compensate for the differences in lattice parameters. Furthermore, we achieved domain selective loading of multiple guest molecules into the hybrid&#8208;phase MOF, as observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8211;energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectrometry elemental mapping. Most importantly, we successfully applied the constructed hybrid&#8208;phase MOF to develop a dual&#8208;drug delivery system with controllable loading ratio and release kinetics.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing the design rationale of a high&#8208;performing faujasitic zeotype engineered with hierarchical porosity and moderated acidity</title>

Probing the physicochemical characteristics of an acidic zeotype framework at the molecular level can provide valuable insights in understanding intrinsic reaction pathways, for affording structure&#8208;activity relationships.

      <title>Titanium defective sites in TS&#8208;1: structural insights by combining spectroscopy and simulation</title>
      <dc:description>Ti silicates, and in particular Titanium Silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1), are nowadays important catalysts for several partial oxidation reactions in the presence of aqueous H  2  O  2  as oxidant.

      <title>An Ultrastable, Small {Ag7}5+ Nanocluster within a Triangular Hollow Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
      <dc:description>
You got the silver: An ultrastable, small {Ag7}5+ nanocluster was synthesized within an unprecedented triangular hollow polyoxometalate (POM) framework [Si3W27O96]18&#8722;. The cluster showed unique {Ag7}5+&#8208;to&#8208;POM charge transfer bands in both visible&#8208; and UV&#8208;light regions.







Abstract
Small Agn nanoclusters (n&lt;10) have been emerging as promising materials as sensing, biolabeling, and catalysis because of their unique electronic states and optical properties. However, studying synthesis, structure determination, and exploration of their properties remain major challenges as a result of the low stability of small Ag nanoclusters. Herein, we synthesized an atomically precise face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic&#8208;type small {Ag7}5+ nanocluster supported by a novel triangular hollow polyoxometalate (POM) framework [Si3W27O96]18&#8722;. The cluster showed unique {Ag7}5+&#8208;to&#8208;POM charge transfer bands in both visible and UV light regions. Furthermore, this small {Ag7}5+ nanocluster exhibited an unprecedented ultrastability in solution, despite having exposed Ag sites that can be accessed by small molecules, such as O2, water, and solvents.

      <title>Revealing the A&#8208;site effect of lead&#8208;free A3Sb2Br9 perovskite in photocatalytic C (sp3)&#8208;H bonds activation</title>
      <dc:description>Lead&#8208;free halide perovskite of A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  is utilized as photocatalyst for the first time to C (sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds activation.  A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  nanoparticles (A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  NPs) with different ratios of Cs and MA show different photocatalytic activity for toluene oxidation and the photocatalytic performance  is enhanced when increasing the amount of Cs. We reveal that the octahedron distortion caused by A&#8208;site cations can change the electronic property of X&#8208;site ions and further affect the electron transfer from toluene molecules to Br sites.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lead&#8208;free halide perovskite of A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  is utilized as photocatalyst for the first time to C (sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds activation.  A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  nanoparticles (A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  NPs) with different ratios of Cs and MA show different photocatalytic activity for toluene oxidation and the photocatalytic performance  is enhanced when increasing the amount of Cs. We reveal that the octahedron distortion caused by A&#8208;site cations can change the electronic property of X&#8208;site ions and further affect the electron transfer from toluene molecules to Br sites. After the regulation of A&#8208;site cations, the photocatalytic activity is higher with A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  NPs than that with some classic photocatalysts (TiO  2  , WO  3  and CdS).

      <title>Functional genome mining reveals a novel class V lanthipeptide containing a D&#8208;amino acid introduced by an F420H2&#8208;dependent reductase</title>
      <dc:description>Lantibiotics are a type of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (termed lanthipeptides) with often potent antimicrobial activity. Herein, we report the discovery of a new lantibiotic, lexapeptide, using the Library EXpression Analysis System (LEXAS) approach. Lexapeptide has rare structural modifications, including N&#8208;terminal (N,N)&#8208;dimethyl phenylalanine, C&#8208;terminal (2&#8208;aminovinyl)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;cysteine, and D&#8208;Ala. The characteristic lanthionine moiety in lexapeptide is formed by three proteins (LxmK, LxmX, and LxmY), which are distinct from enzymes known to be involved in lanthipeptide biosynthesis. Furthermore, a novel F420H2&#8208;dependent reductase (LxmJ) from the lexapeptide biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) is identified to catalyze the reduction of dehydroalanine to install D&#8208;Ala. Our findings suggest that lexapeptide is the founding member of a new class of lanthipeptides that we designate as class V. We also identified further class V lanthipeptide BGCs in actinomycetes and cyanobacteria genomes, implying that other class V lantibiotics await discovery.</dc:description>

      <title>Beyond polysulfides shuttle and Li dendrite formation: addressing the sluggish S redox kinetics for practical high energy Li&#8208;S batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Electrolyte modulation has been reported to simultaneously suppress polysulfide shuttle effect and lithium dendrite formation of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. However, the sluggish S redox kinetics, especially under high S loading and lean electrolyte operation, has been intensively ignored, which dramatically limits the cycle life and energy density of practical Li&#8208;S pouch cells. Herein, we demonstrate that a rational combination of selenium doping, core&#8208;shell hollow host structure, and fluorinated ether electrolytes enables ultrastable Li stripping/plating and essentially no polysulfide shuttle as well as fast redox kinetics. Thus, high areal capacity (&gt;4 mAh cm  &#8208;2  ) with excellent cycle stability and Coulombic effiency were both demonsrated in Li&#160; metal&#160; anode and thick S cathode (4.5 mg cm  &#8208;2  ) &#160;with a&#160; low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (10 &#181;L mg  &#8208;1  ). This research further demonstrates a durable Li&#8208;Se/S pouch cell with high specific capacity, validating the potential practical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Continuous Synthesis of Aryl Amines from Phenols Utilizing Integrated Packed&#8208;Bed Flow Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Flow with it: Dehydrative amination of phenols under continuous&#8208;flow conditions has been developed. In an integrated packed&#8208;bed flow system containing heterogeneous Pd catalysts, phenols reacted with amines to obtain aryl amines and small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products. The method has high product selectivity and excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance, so that variously substituted aryl amines can be selectively prepared in high yields.







Abstract
Aryl amines are important pharmaceutical intermediates among other numerous applications. Herein, an environmentally benign route and novel approach to aryl amine synthesis using dehydrative amination of phenols with amines and styrene under continuous&#8208;flow conditions was developed. Inexpensive and readily available phenols were efficiently converted into the corresponding aryl amines, with small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products (i.e., H2O and alkanes), in multistep continuous&#8208;flow reactors in the presence of heterogeneous Pd catalysts. The high product selectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance of this method allowed aryl amines with diverse functional groups to be selectively obtained in high yields over a continuous operation time of one week.

      <title>Degradation of Structurally Defined Graphene Nanoribbons by Myeloperoxidase and Photo&#8208;Fenton Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>As an emerging member of the graphene family, structurally defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have shown promising applications in various fields. The evaluation of the degradability of GNRs is particularly important for assessing the persistence level and risk of these materials in living organisms and the environment. However, there is a void in the study of the degradation of GNRs. Here, we report the degradation behavior of GNRs in the presence of human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) or treated with photo&#8208;Fenton (PF) reaction. With the assistance of potassium hydroxide or imidazole, which facilitates the dispersion of GNRs in the aqueous solution, GNRs underwent only partial degradation after 25&#8208;hour incubation with hMPO, while, the PF reaction degraded GNRs almost completely after 120 hours. These results indicate that structurally precise GNRs can be efficiently degraded under suitable conditions, providing more opportunities for future applications in different fields.</dc:description>

      <title>Interfacially Bridging Covalent Network Yields Hyperstable and Ultralong Virus&#8208;based Fibers for Engineering Functional Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Virus and virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) are very attractive biological subjects for self&#8208;assembly manipulation and templated synthesis of nanomaterials. However, the fundamental studies and applications are often constrained by problems associated with their structural weakness. Here we present a strategy of interfacially bridging covalent network within tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) VLPs to bring outstanding structural properties and functionalities. We arranged T103C cysteine to laterally conjugate adjacent subunits. In the axis direction, we set A74C mutation and systematically investigated candidate from E50C to P54C as the other thiol function site, for forming longitudinal disulfide bond chains. Significantly, the T103C&#8208;TMV&#8208;E50C&#8208;A74C shows the highest robustness in assembly capability and structural stability with the largest length, for TMV VLP to date. The fibers with lengths from several to a dozen of micrometers even survive under pH 13. The robust nature of this TMV VLP allows for reducer&#8208;free synthesis of excellent electrocatalysts for application in harshly alkaline hydrogen evolution. This study, therefore, presents significant progress to develop existing VLP with unprecedented structural properties and the applications thereof.</dc:description>

      <title>Unravelling the Enigma of Nonoxidative Conversion of Methane on Iron Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The direct, nonoxidative conversion of methane on silica&#8208;confined single&#8208;atom iron catalyst (Fe  1  &#169;SiO  2  ) by Bao  et al  . (  Science  , 2014,  344  , 616) is a landmark discovery in catalysis science. However, the initially proposed gas&#8208;phase reaction mechanism has been much debated. Here, we report a surface reaction mechanism by comprehensive computational modelling and simulations. It is demonstrated that the activation of methane occurs at the single iron site, whereas the dissociated methyl disfavours desorption into gas phase under the reactive conditions. In contrast, the dissociated methyl prefers transferring to adjacent carbon sites of the active centre (Fe  1  &#169;SiC  2  ), followed by C&#8722;C coupling and hydrogen transfer to produce the main product (ethylene) via a key &#8722;CH&#8722;CH  2  intermediate. We find a quasi&#8208;Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen (quasi&#8208;MvK) surface reaction mechanism involving extracting and refilling the surface carbon atoms for the nonoxidative conversion of methane on Fe  1  &#169;SiO  2  and this new surface process is identified to be more plausible than the alternative gas&#8208;phase reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Exploiting Two&#8208;Dimensional Bi2O2Se for Trace Oxygen Detection</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials host great potential for environmental gaseous molecules detection in the age of emerging Internet of things owing to their fascinating electronic properties, large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and feasibility to high integration. However, it remains a challenge to develop trace oxygen sensing 2D materials and devices with low detection limit at sub&#8208;ppm range. Here, we exploit a high&#8208;preforming resistive&#8208;type trace oxygen sensor based on 2D high&#8208;mobility semiconducting Bi  2  O  2  Se nanoplates. Scanning tunneling microscopy combined with first&#8208;principle calculations proves an amorphous Se atomic layer formed on the surface of 2D Bi  2  O  2  Se exposed to oxygen, which contributes to larger specific surface area and abundant active adsorption sites. Such 2D Bi  2  O  2  Se oxygen sensors have remarkable oxygen&#8208;adsorption induced variations of carrier density/mobility, and exhibit an ultrahigh sensitivity featuring minimum detection limit of 0.25 ppm, long&#8208;term stability, high durativity, and wide&#8208;range response to concentration up to 400 ppm at room temperature. Moreover, 2D Bi  2  O  2  Se arrayed sensors integrated in parallel form are found to possess an oxygen detection minimum of sub&#8208;0.25 ppm ascribed to an enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio.

      <dc:description>The Zintl anion (Ge  2  As  2  )  2&#8722;  represents an isostructural and isoelectronic binary counterpart of yellow arsenic, yet without being studied with the same intensity so far. Upon introducing [(PPh  3  )AuMe] into the 1,2&#8208;diaminoethane (en) solution of (Ge  2  As  2  )  2&#8722;  , the heterometallic cluster anion [Au  6  (Ge  3  As)(Ge  2  As  2  )  3  ]  3&#8722;  is obtained as its salt [K(crypt&#8208;222)]  3  [Au  6  (Ge  3  As)(Ge  2  As  2  )  3  ]&#183;en&#183;2tol (  1  ). The anion represents a rare example of a superpolyhedral Zintl cluster, and it comprises the largest number of Au atoms relative to main group (semi)metal atoms in such clusters. The overall supertetrahedral structure is based on a (non&#8208;bonding) octahedron of six Au atoms that is face&#8208;capped by four (Ge  x  As  4&#8722;x  )  x&#8722;  (x = 2, 3) units. The Au atoms bind to four main group atoms in a rectangular manner, and this way hold the four units together to form this unprecedented architecture. The presences of one (Ge  3  As)  3&#8722;  unit besides three (Ge  2  As  2  )  2&#8722;  units as a consequence of an exchange reaction in solution was verified by detailed quantum chemical (DFT) calculations, which ruled out all other compositions besides [Au  6  (Ge  3  As)(Ge  2  As  2  )  3  ]  3&#8722;  . Reactions of the heavier homologues (Tt  2  Pn  2  )  2&#8722;  (Tt = Sn, Pb; Pn = Sb, Bi) did not yield clusters corresponding to that in  1  , but dimers of ternary nine&#8208;vertex clusters, {[AuTt  5  Pn  3  ]  2  }  4&#8722;  (in  2  &#8211;  4  ; Tt/Pn = Sn/Sb, Sn/Bi, Pb/Sb), since the underlying  pseudo  &#8208;tetrahedral units comprising heavier atoms do not tend to undergo the said exchange reactions as readily as (Ge  2  As  2  )  2&#8722;  , according to the DFT calculations.</dc:description>

While the orange emissive  Eu&#8208;2  showed a maximum luminance of 30620 cd&#183;m  &#8208;2  , and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.5%, corresponding to an exciton utilization efficiency around 100% in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).

      <dc:description>2&#8208;Pyrroline and 2&#8208;azetine are useful synthons for the synthesis of pyrrolidines and azetidines that widely exist in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. But efficient methods for dicarbofuntionalization of these cyclic alkenes are limited. Particularly, the dicarbofunctionalization of endocyclic enecarbamates to achieve fluorinated compounds remains an unsolved issue, despite of the wide applications of organofluorinated molecules in life and materials science. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed  trans  &#8208;selective dicarbofunctionalization of  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;pyrroline and  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;azetine, a class of endocyclic enecarbamates previously unexplored by transition&#8208;metal catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization. The reaction can also extend to six and seven membered endocyclic enamides. A variety of arylzinc reagents and bromodifluoroacetate and its derivatives are applicable to the reaction, providing a straightforward and efficient access to an array of pyrrolidine&#8208; and azetidine&#8208;containing fluorinated amino acids and oligopeptides, which may have applications in life science. Specifically, this protocol paves a new way to the efficient synthesis of functionalized azetidines that are of great interest in pharmacological studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Micron&#8208;sized zeolite Beta single crystals featuring intracrystal interconnected ordered macro&#8208;meso&#8208;microporosity displaying superior catalytic performance</title>
      <dc:description>Serious diffusional limitations are frequently observed for the conversion of bulky molecules over conventional zeolite Beta crystals, which invoke for hierarchical structure to improve the mass transportation property and the accessibility to reactive sites. Zeolite single crystals with intracrystalline hierarchical porosity at macro&#8208;, meso&#8208; and micro&#8208;length scales is of great significance and provides the best solution . However, the construction of large zeolite Beta single crystals with such intracrystalline hierarchical porosity remains a critical challenge. We report here the successful synthesis of hierarchically ordered macro&#8208;mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline zeolite Beta (OMMS&#8208;Beta) with a rare micron&#8208;scale crystal size by an  in&#8208;situ  bottom&#8208;up confined zeolite crystallization strategy. The fully interconnected intracrystalline macro&#8208;meso&#8208;microporous hierarchy and the unique micron&#8208;sized single crystalline nature of OMMS&#8208;Beta lead to highly improved accessibility to active sites and outstanding (hydro)thermal stability, contributing to unprecedentedly high catalytic performances in both gas&#8208;phase and liquid&#8208;phase acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving bulky molecules compared to commercial Beta and nanosized Beta zeolites. All these unprecedented properties of our hierarchically porous micron&#8208;scale zeolite Beta single crystals with excellent stability can be fully exploited in various catalytic reactions with high catalytic activity, selectivity and reusability. Most importantly, our  in&#8208;situ  bottom&#8208;up confined crystallization strategy to hierarchically porous zeolite single crystal is highly universal and has been extended to the successful synthesis of other zeolitic materials, including ZSM&#8208;5, TS&#8208;1 and SAPO&#8208;34. Such novel zeolite single crystals with excellent properties can be applied to many other industrial catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

Most importantly, our  in&#8208;situ  bottom&#8208;up confined crystallization strategy to hierarchically porous zeolite single crystal is highly universal and has been extended to the successful synthesis of other zeolitic materials, including ZSM&#8208;5, TS&#8208;1 and SAPO&#8208;34. Such novel zeolite single crystals with excellent properties can be applied to many other industrial catalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Correlating Glycoforms of DC&#8208;SIGN with Stability Using a Combination of Enzymatic Digestion and Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry
</title>
      <dc:description>
Uncovering stability of DC&#8208;SIGN glycoforms with native mass spectrometry: A combined strategy of exoglycosidase sequencing, native mass spectrometry, ion mobility, and gas&#8208;phase unfolding uncovered the occupancy and structural detail of O&#8208;glycans present on the carbohydrate binding domain of DC&#8208;SIGN. Collision&#8208;induced unfolding by ion mobility revealed differences in stability among glycoforms, independent of glycoprotein mass.







Abstract
The immune scavenger protein DC&#8208;SIGN interacts with glycosylated proteins and has a putative role in facilitating viral infection. How these recognition events take place with different viruses is not clear and the effects of glycosylation on the folding and stability of DC&#8208;SIGN have not been reported. Herein, we report the development and application of a mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;based approach to both uncover and characterise the effects of O&#8208;glycans on the stability of DC&#8208;SIGN. We first quantify the Core&#8197;1 and 2 O&#8208;glycan structures on the carbohydrate recognition and extracellular domains of the protein using sequential exoglycosidase sequencing. Using ion mobility mass spectrometry, we show how specific O&#8208;glycans, and/or single monosaccharide substitutions, alter both the overall collision cross section and the gas&#8208;phase stability of the DC&#8208;SIGN isoforms. We find that rather than the mass or length of glycoprotein modifications, the stability of DC&#8208;SIGN is better correlated with the number of glycosylation sites.
