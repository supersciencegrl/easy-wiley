         <title>Metalla&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement in Gold&#8208;Catalyzed [4 + 2] Reaction: A New Elementary Reaction Suggested for Future Reaction Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here computational evidence for a metalla&#8208;Claisen rearrangement (MCR) in the case of gold&#8208;catalyzed [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of yne&#8208;dienes. The [4 + 2] reaction starts from exo cyclopropanation, followed by MCR and reductive elimination. The cyclopropane moiety formed in the first step is crucial for a low barrier of the MCR step. In addition, the importance of an appropriate combination of the tether group and the terminal substituent on alkyne in the yne&#8208;diene substrates was studied. The mechanism of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4 + 2] reaction of yne&#8208;dienes was also investigated to see whether an MCR mechanism is involved or not. The findings and new understanding hereby reported represent an important advance in the catalysis field.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient and Dissipative Host&#8211;Guest Hydrogels Regulated by Consumption of a Reactive Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transient self&#8208;assembly of molecules under the direction of a consumable fuel source is fundamental to biological processes like cellular organization and motility. Such biomolecular assemblies exist in an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium state, requiring continuous consumption of high energy molecules. At the same time, the creation of bioinspired supramolecular hydrogels has traditionally focused on associations occurring at the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Here, hydrogels are prepared from cucurbit[7]uril host&#8211;guest supramolecular interactions through transient physical crosslinking driven by the consumption of a reactive chemical fuel. Upon action from this fuel, the affinity and dynamics of CB[7]&#8211;guest recognition are altered. In this way, the lifetime of transient hydrogel formation and the dynamic modulus obtained are governed by fuel consumption, rather than being directed by equilibrium complex formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Spin States in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and stable transition metal oxides catalysts for energy conversion processes such as oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction is one of the key measures to solve the problem of energy shortage. The spin state of transition metal oxides is strongly correlated with their catalytic activities. In an octahedral structure of transition metal oxides, the spin state of active centers could be regulated by adjusting the splitting energy and the electron pairing energy. Regulating spin state of active centers could directly modulate the d orbitals occupancy, which influence the strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds and the adsorption behavior of the intermediates. In this review, we clarified the significance of regulating spin state of the active centers. Subsequently, we discussed several characterization technologies for spin state and some recent strategies to regulate the spin state of the active centers. Finally, we put forward some views on the future research direction of this vital field.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photoacoustic Probe with Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier Crossing Ability for Imaging Oxidative Stress Dynamics in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporal assessment of the oxidative stress dynamics in the brain is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing oxidative stress probes have poor blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability or poor penetration depth, making them unsuitable for brain imaging. Herein, we developed a photoacoustic probe that enables real&#8208;time imaging of oxidative stress dynamics in the mouse brain. The probe not only responds to oxidative stress in a reversible and ratiometric manner, but it can also cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier of the mouse brain. Notably, the probe displayed excellent photoacoustic imaging of oxidative stress dynamics in the brains of Parkinson's disease mouse models. In addition, we investigated the antioxidant properties of natural polyphenols in the brain of a Parkinson's disease mouse model using the probe as an imaging agent and suggested the potential of the probe for screening anti&#8208;oxidative stress agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of 1,3&#8208;Chiral Centers via Tandem Asymmetric Conjugate Addition and Allylic Substitution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a synthesis of cyclohexanones bearing multi&#8208;continuous stereocenters by combining copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of dialkylzinc reagents to cyclic enones with iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reaction. Good to excellent yields, diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity can be obtained. Unlike the stereodivergent construction of adjacent stereocenters (1,2&#8208;position) reported in the literature, the current reaction can achieve the stereodivergent construction of nonadjacent stereocenters (1,3&#8208;position) by a proper combination of two chiral catalysts with different enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of an Annulated 1,4&#8208;Distibabenzene Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first 1,4&#8208;distibinine&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide compound [(ADC)Sb]2 (5) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC) (ADC = PhC{N(Dipp)C}2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) is reported as a bordeaux&#8208;red solid. Compound 5, featuring a central six&#8208;membered C4Sb2 ring with formally Sb(I) atoms may be regarded as a base&#8208;stabilized cyclic bis&#8208;stibinidene in which each of the Sb atoms bears two lone&#8208;pairs of electrons. 5 undergoes 2e&#8208;oxidation with Ph3C[B(C6F5)4] to afford [(ADC)Sb]2&#173;[B(C6F5)4]2 (6) as a brick&#8208;red solid. Each of the Sb atoms of 6 has an unpaired electron and a lone&#8208;pair. The broken&#8208;symmetry open&#8208;shell singlet diradical solution for (6)2+ is calculated to be 2.13 kcal/mol more stable than the closed&#8208;shell singlet. The diradical character of (6)2+ according to SS&#8208;CASSCF (state&#8208;specific complete active space self&#8208;consistent field) and UHF (unrestricted Hartree&#8208;Fock) methods amounts to 39% and 36%, respectively. Treatments of 6 with (PhE)2 yield [(ADC)Sb(EPh)]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (7&#8208;E) (E = S or Se). Reaction of 5 with (cod)Mo(CO)4 affords [(ADC)Sb]2&#173;Mo(CO)4 (8).</dc:description>

         <title>Facilitated Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aerobic Environment on a Copper&#8208;Porphyrin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein,&#160;we fabricated a &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking hybrid photocatalyst by combining two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials: g&#8208;C3N4 and a Cu&#8208;porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). After an aerobic photocatalytic pretreatment, this hybrid catalyst exhibited an unprecedented ability to photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO and CH4 under the typical level (20%) of O2 in the air. Intriguingly, the presence of O2 did not suppress CO2 reduction; instead, a fivefold increase compared with that in the absence of O2 was observed. Structural analysis indicated that during aerobic pretreatment, the Cu node in the 2D&#8208;MOF moiety was hydroxylated by the hydroxyl generated from the reduction of O2.&#160;Then the formed hydroxylated Cu node maintained its structure during aerobic CO2 reduction, whereas it underwent structural alteration and was reductively devitalized in the absence of O2. Theoretical calculations further demonstrated that CO2 reduction, instead of O2 reduction, occurred preferentially on the hydroxylated Cu node.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein,&#160;we fabricated a &#960;-&#960; stacking hybrid photocatalyst by combining two two-dimensional (2D) materials: g-C3N4 and a Cu-porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). After an aerobic photocatalytic pretreatment, this hybrid catalyst exhibited an unprecedented ability to photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO and CH4 under the typical level (20%) of O2 in the air. Intriguingly, the presence of O2 did not suppress CO2 reduction; instead, a fivefold increase compared with that in the absence of O2 was observed.

         <title>Optimized Sieving Effect for Ethanol/Water Separation by Ultramicroporous MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;purity ethanol is a promising renewable energy resource, however separating ethanol from trace amount of water is extremely challenging. Herein, two ultramicroporous MOFs (UTSA&#8208;280 and Co&#8208;squarate) were used as adsorbents. A prominent water adsorption and a negligible ethanol adsorption identify perfect sieving effect on both MOFs. Co&#8208;squarate exhibits a surprising water adsorption capacity at low pressure that surpassing the reported MOFs. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations reveal that such prominent performance of Co&#8208;squarate derives from the optimized sieving effect through pore structure adjustment. Co&#8208;squarate with larger rhombohedral channel is suitable for zigzag water location, resulting in reinforced guest&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;framework interactions. Ultrapure ethanol (99.9%) can be obtained directly by ethanol/water mixed vapor breaking through the columns packed with Co&#8208;squarate, contributing to a potential for fuel&#8208;grade ethanol purification.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can act as cytotoxic radicals to directly kill tumor cells and concurrently elicits immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect to well achieve the combined photodynamic immunotherapy. Thus motivated, we herein present one ROS super&#8208;generator PMIC&#8208;NC that not only arouses hypoxia&#8208;activated type&#8208;I ROS burst aided by proton transients but also triggers type&#8208;I/II ROS production by electron or energy transfer under near infrared light (NIR) irradiation as well as elicits strong ICD effect. More interesting, mitochondria&#8208; and lung&#8208;specific distribution of PMIC&#8208;NC also boosts the therapeutic efficiency towards cancer. As a result, PMIC&#8208;NC afforded NIR&#8208;triggered photodynamic therapy and hypoxia&#8208;activated chemotherapy as well as ICD&#8208;induced immunotherapy on primary tumor and pulmonary metastasis featured by 3.7&#8208;fold and 3&#8208;fold enhancement in efficiency compared to positive control Ce6 group. This work thus contributes the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of perylene as integrated theraputic platform that efficiently realize the synergistic trimodal anticancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Engineering of a Cage&#8208;like MOF Pore Aperture for the Efficient Separation of Isomeric C4 paraffins under Humid Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isomeric C4 paraffins separation is an important task in petrochemical while current adsorbents undergo a trade&#8208;off relationship between selectivity and adsorption capacity. In this work, the pore aperture of a cage&#8208;like Zn&#8208;bzc (bzc = pyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) is tuned by stepwisely installing methyl groups on its narrow aperture to achieve both molecular&#8208;sieving separation and high n&#8208;C4H10 uptake. Notably, the resulting Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;2CH3 (bzc&#8208;2CH3 = 3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) can sensitively capture n&#8208;C4H10 and exclude iso&#8208;C4H10, affording molecular&#8208;sieving n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation and high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity (54.3 cm3 g&#8208;1). Breakthrough test proves n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 can be efficiently separated and high&#8208;purity iso&#8208;C4H10 (99.99%) can be collected. Importantly, the hydrophobic microenvironment created by the introduced methyl groups greatly improves the stability of Zn&#8208;bzc and significantly eliminates the negative effect of water vapor on gas separation under humid conditions, indicating Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;2CH3 is a new benchmark for n&#8208;C4H10/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Reactivation of Dead Li2S for Li&#8208;S Batteries in Non&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of non&#8208;solvating, or as&#8208;called sparingly&#8208;solvating, electrolytes (NSEs), is regarded as one of the most promising solutions to the obstacles to the practical applications of Li&#8208;S batteries. However, it remains a puzzle that long&#8208;life Li&#8208;S batteries have rarely, if not never, been reported with NSEs, despite their good compatibility with Li anode. Here, we find the capacity decay of Li&#8208;S batteries in NSEs is mainly due to the accumulation of the dead Li2S at the cathode side, rather than the degradation of the anodes or electrolytes. Based on this understanding, we propose an electrochemical strategy to reactivate the accumulated Li2S and revive the dead Li&#8208;S batteries in NSEs. With such a facile approach, Li&#8208;S batteries with significantly improved cycling stability and accelerated dynamics are achieved with diglyme&#8208;, acetonitrile&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane&#8208;based NSEs. Our finding may rebuild the confidence in exploiting non&#8208;solvating Li&#8208;S batteries with practical competitiveness.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tri&#64258;uoromethyl&#8208;bearing 5&#8208;membered ring structures are prevalent in bioactive molecules, but modular approaches to these compounds by functionalization of robust sp3 hybridized C&#8211;H bonds in a direct and selective manner are extremely challenging. Herein we report the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene insertion into a broad range of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds to access 7 types of CF3&#8208;bearing saturated 5&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. The reaction is particularly effective for benzylic C&#8211;H insertion exerting good site&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol, and applicable to access chiral CF3 analogues of bioactive molecules.

         <title>Nitrogen Plasma Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Atomic Layer Deposition of Magnesium Phosphorus Oxynitride (MgPON) Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) that use solid electrolytes instead of flammable liquid electrolytes have the potential to generate higher specific capacity and offer better safety. Magnesium (Mg) based SSBs with Mg metal anode are considered to be one of the most promising energy storage candidates, because it gives high theoretical volumetric capacities of 3830 mAh cm&#8208;3. Here, we demonstrate an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process with a double nitrogen plasma process that successfully produces nitrogen&#8208;incorporated magnesium phosphorus oxynitride (MgPON) solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) thin films at a low deposition temperature of 125 oC. The ALD MgPON SSEs exhibit an ionic conductivity of 0.36 and 1.2 &#956;S cm&#8208;1 at 450 and 500 &#176;C, respectively. The proposed ALD strategy shows the ability of conformal deposition nitrogen&#8208;doped SSEs on pattered substrates and is attractive for using nitride ion&#8208;conducing films as protective or wetting interlayers in solid&#8208;state Mg and Li batteries.</dc:description>

Here, we demonstrate an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process with a double nitrogen plasma process that successfully produces nitrogen-incorporated magnesium phosphorus oxynitride (MgPON) solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) thin films at a low deposition temperature of 125 oC. The ALD MgPON SSEs exhibit an ionic conductivity of 0.36 and 1.2 &#956;S cm-1 at 450 and 500 &#176;C, respectively. The proposed ALD strategy shows the ability of conformal deposition nitrogen-doped SSEs on pattered substrates and is attractive for using nitride ion-conducing films as protective or wetting interlayers in solid-state Mg and Li batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Catalytic Method for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Ketones, &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical method for the efficient and enantioselective preparation of versatile ketones and aldehydes that contain an &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter is described. Reactions utilize simple carboxylic acid or ester starting materials, a monodentate chiral phosphine, and afford a variety of aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and alkyl&#8208;substituted ketone and aldehyde products in 25&#8211;94% yield and 90:10 to &gt;99:1 enantiomeric ratio. Reactions proceed by acyl substitution with in situ formed chiral allylic nucleophiles, and display selectivity and conversion dependence on a protic additive. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through several product transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Aminopeptidase N&#8208;Responsive Conjugates with Tunable Charge&#8208;Reversal Properties for Highly Efficient Tumor Accumulation and Penetration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor enzyme&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;reversal carriers can induce efficient transcytosis and lead to efficient tumor infiltration and potent anticancer efficacy. However, the correlations of molecular structure with charge&#8208;reversal property, tumor penetration, and drug delivery efficiency are unknown. Herein, aminopeptidase N (APN)&#8208;responsive conjugates were synthesized to investigate these correlations. We found that the monomeric unit structure and the polymer chain structure determined the enzymatic hydrolysis&#160;and charge&#8208;reversal rates, and accordingly, the transcytosis and tumor accumulation and penetration of the APN&#8208;responsive conjugates. The conjugate with moderate APN responsiveness balanced the in vitro transcytosis and in vivo overall drug delivery process and achieved the best tumor delivery efficiency, giving potent antitumor efficacy. This work provides new insight into the design of tumor enzyme&#8208;responsive charge&#8208;reversal nanomedicines for efficient cancer drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Hybridization for Electro&#8208;reforming Waste Glycerol into Isolable Oxalate and Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electro&#8208;reforming of glycerol is an emerging technology of simultaneous hydrogen production and biomass valorization. However, its complex reaction network and limited catalyst tunability restrict the precise steering toward high selectivity. Herein, we incorporated the chelating phenanthrolines into the bulk nickel hydroxide and tuned the electronic properties by installing functional groups, yielding tunable selectivity toward formate (max 92.7%) and oxalate (max 45.3%) with almost linear correlation with the Hammett parameters. Further combinatory study of intermediate analysis and various spectroscopic techniques revealed the electronic effect of tailoring the valence band that balances between C&#8208;C cleavage and oxidation through the key glycolaldehyde intermediate. A two&#8208;electrode electro&#8208;reforming setup using the 5&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;nickel hydroxide catalyst was further established to convert crude glycerol into pure H2 and isolable sodium oxalate with high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Allenes with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Adjacent Central Chiralities Empowered by Synergistic Pd/Cu Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereodivergent synthesis of allene compounds bearing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;adjacent central chiralities has been realized via the Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric alkylation of racemic allenylic esters. The matched reactivity of bimetallic catalytic system enables the challenging reaction of racemic aryl&#8208;substituted allenylic acetates with sterically crowded aldimine esters smoothly under mild reaction conditions. Various chiral non&#8208;natural amino acids bearing a terminal allenyl group are easily synthesized in high yields and with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, &gt;99% ee). Importantly, all four stereoisomers of the product can be readily accessed by switching the configurations of the two chiral metal catalysts. Furthermore, the easy interconversion between the uncommon &#951;3&#8208;butadienyl palladium intermediate featuring a weak C=C/Pd coordination bond and a stable Csp2&#8208;Pd bond is beneficial for the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process (DyKAT).</dc:description>

Compared to the widely studied oxycarbene metal complexes bearing Group 6 metals, the synthetic and catalytic applications of oxycarbenes beyond Group 6 Fischer carbene complexes are less explored because of the difficulty in the control of their reactivity and the need to use stoichiometric amount of pre&#8208;synthesized Group 6 metal carbene complex as the starting material. This Minireview summarizes the early synthetic and catalytic applications of late transition metal oxycarbene complexes and highlights recent advances in free oxycarbene reactions and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving oxycarbenes.

         <title>Electrochemical Kinetics Support a Second Coordination Sphere Mechanism in Metal&#8208;Based Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic mechanism of Mo/W formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) is debated because the metal ion of the active site is 6&#8208;coordinated, leaving no coordination site open for substrate binding. We have used direct electrochemistry to investigate the catalytic cycle of two homologous FDHs: our results strongly support a &#8220;second coordination sphere&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based formate dehydrogenases are molybdenum or tungsten&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze the interconversion between formate and CO2. According to the current consensus, the metal ion of the catalytic center in its active form is coordinated by 6&#8201;S (or 5&#8201;S and 1&#8201;Se) atoms, leaving no free coordination sites to which formate could bind to the metal. Some authors have proposed that one of the active site ligands decoordinates during turnover to allow formate binding. Another proposal is that the oxidation of formate takes place in the second coordination sphere of the metal. Here, we have used electrochemical steady&#8208;state kinetics to elucidate the order of the steps in the catalytic cycle of two formate dehydrogenases. Our results strongly support the &#8220;second coordination sphere&#8221; hypothesis.

         <title>Boosting Electroreduction of CO2 over Cationic Covalent Organic Frameworks: Hydrogen Bonding Effects of Halogen Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen bonding strategy for achieving high electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction performance over an imidazolium&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework (Co&#8208;iBFBim&#8208;COF&#8722;X) is reported by Yuan&#8208;Biao Huang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215687). The halogen anions can form hydrogen bonds with intermediates (*COOH) and thus lower the energy barrier to the formation of CO. Moreover, the water&#8211;anion interactions can repel the contact of water with the active centers, thus inhibiting the occurrence of HER.

&lt;p&gt;A hydrogen bonding strategy for achieving high electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction performance over an imidazolium-functionalized covalent organic framework (Co-iBFBim-COF&#8722;X) is reported by Yuan-Biao Huang and co-workers in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202215687"&gt;10.1002/anie.202215687&lt;/a&gt;). The halogen anions can form hydrogen bonds with intermediates (*COOH) and thus lower the energy barrier to the formation of CO. Moreover, the water&#8211;anion interactions can repel the contact of water with the active centers, thus inhibiting the occurrence of HER.

         <title>Electrochemical Cell&#8208;Free Biosensors for Antibody Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits which, upon recognition of a target antibody, trigger the cell&#8208;free transcription of an RNA sequence that can be consequently detected with a disposable electrochemical sensor, were designed by Sara Bracaglia, Simona Ranallo, and Francesco Ricci in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202216512). The cell&#8208;free electrochemical biosensor allows the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of different antibodies in blood serum.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different electronic effects on the starting anthracene&#8208;containing polyphenylene substrate (bottom) afford two different nanographenes under Scholl reaction conditions, namely, spironanographenes (R=H) on the left, and a helically arranged molecular nanographene having two orthogonal aromatic moieties linked by an octafluoroanthracene core (R=F) on the right. The different stability of the intermediate trityl cation and the concomitant gain of aromaticity decide the fate of the reaction, as explained by Israel Fern&#225;ndez, Nazario Mart&#237;n et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215655).

         <dc:description>
Multilayered ceramic membranes with ion conducting dense thin layers are essential platforms for solid state electrochemical devices, gas separation membranes and sensors. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202210485), Heqing Jiang et&#8197;al. develop a new interface&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced reassembly approach for the direct fabrication of zirconia&#8208; or ceria&#8208;based dense thin layers rooted in multilayered ceramic membranes that show robust and practical performance for upgrading fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen.

The DNA templated bio&#8208;orthogonal synthesis of macrocyclic gene modulators is illustrated in the cover picture accompanying the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215245) by Jyotirmayee Dash and co&#8208;workers. DNA secondary structures present in the telomere and oncogene promoter proximally orient bi&#8208;functional alkyne and azide fragments, enabling bond formation via Cu&#8208;free azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition in live cells. The high&#8208;affinity DNA binding macrocyclic ligand efficiently suppresses oncogene expression in cancer cells.

         <title>Evidence of Al(II) Radical Addition to Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic Al(III) species have long dominated the aluminum reactivity towards arenes. Recently, nucleophilic low&#8208;valent Al(I) aluminyl anions have showcased oxidative additions towards arenes C&#8208;C and/or C&#8208;H bonds. Herein, we communicate compelling evidence of an Al(II) radical addition reaction to the benzene ring. The electron reduction of a ligand stabilized precursor with KC8 in benzene furnishes a double addition to the benzene ring instead of a C&#8208;H bond activation, producing the corresponding cyclohexa&#8208;1,3(orl,4)&#8208;dienes as Birch&#8208;type reduction product. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT results suggest this unprecedented reactivity proceeds through a stable Al(II) radical intermediate, whose stability is a consequence of a rigid scaffold in combination with strong steric protection.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), a rising star in the post&#8208;graphene era, are fundamentally and technologically intriguing for photocatalysis. Their extraordinary electronic, optical, and chemical properties endow them as promising materials for effectively harvesting light and catalyzing the redox reaction in photocatalysis. Here, we present a tutorial&#8208;style review of the field of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis to educate researchers (especially the new&#8208;comers), which begins with a brief introduction of the fundamentals of 2D TMDs and photocatalysis along with the synthesis of this type of material, then look deeply into the merits of 2D TMDs as co&#8208;catalysts and active photocatalysts, followed by an overview of the challenges and corresponding strategies of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis, and finally look ahead this topic.</dc:description>

Here, we present a tutorial-style review of the field of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis to educate researchers (especially the new-comers), which begins with a brief introduction of the fundamentals of 2D TMDs and photocatalysis along with the synthesis of this type of material, then look deeply into the merits of 2D TMDs as co-catalysts and active photocatalysts, followed by an overview of the challenges and corresponding strategies of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis, and finally look ahead this topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerated Transfer and Spillover of Carbon Monoxide through Tandem Catalysis for Kinetics&#8208;boosted Ethylene Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been widely applied in electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2ER) to produce multicarbon (C2+) feedstocks (e.g., C2H4). However, the high energy barriers for CO2 activation on the Cu surface is a challenge for a high catalytic efficiency and product selectivity. Herein, we developed an in&#8208;situ *CO generation and spillover strategy by engineering single Ni atoms on a pyridinic N&#8208;enriched carbon support with a sodalite (SOD) topology (Ni&#8208;SOD/NC) that acted as a donor to feed adjacent Cu nanoparticles (NPs) with *CO intermediate. As a result, a high C2H4 selectivity of 62.5% and an industrial&#8208;level current density of 160 mA cm&#8208;2 at a low potential of &#8208;0.72 V were achieved. Our studies revealed that the isolated NiN3 active sites with adjacent pyridinic N species facilitated the *CO desorption and the massive *CO intermediate released from Ni&#8208;SOD/NC then overflowed to Cu NPs surface to enrich the *CO coverage for improving the selectivity of CO2ER to C2H4.</dc:description>

         <title>Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cell Using a Fluoride&#8208;Assisted Surface Gradient Passivation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wide&#8208;bandgap (1.68 eV) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are important components of perovskite/Si tandem devices. However, the efficiency of wide bandgap PSCs has been limited by their huge open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit due to non&#8208;radiative recombination. Deep&#8208;level acceptor defects are identified as the major killers of VOC, and they can be effectively improved by passivation with ammonium salts. Theoretical calculation predicts that increasing the distance between F and &#8208;NH3+ of fluorinated ammonium can dramatically enhance the electropositivity of &#8208;NH3+ terminals, thus providing strong adsorption onto the negatively charged IA and IPb anti&#8208;site defects. Characterizations further confirm that surface gradient passivation employing p&#8208;FPEAI demonstrates the most efficient passivation effect. Consequently, a record&#8208;efficiency of 21.63% with the smallest VOC deficit of 441 mV is achieved for 1.68 eV&#8208;bandgap inverted PSCs. Additionally, a flexible PSC and 1 cm2 opaque device also deliver the highest PCEs of 21.02% and 19.31%, respectively.</dc:description>

Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with fast&#8208;charge capability and long lifespan could be applied in various sustainable energy storage systems, from personal devices to grid storage. Inspired by the disordered Rubik's cube, here, we report that the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept can lead to a very substantial improvement in the sodium storage properties of hexacyanoferrate (HCF). An example of HE&#8208;HCF has been synthesized as a proof of concept, which has achieved impressive cycling stability over 50&#8201;000&#8197;cycles and an outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability up to 75&#8197;C. Remarkable air stability and all&#8208;climate performance are observed. Its quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain reaction mechanism and high sodium diffusion coefficient have been measured and analyzed by multiple in situ techniques and density functional theory calculations. This strategy provides new insights into the development of advanced electrodes and provides the opportunity to tune electrochemical performance by tailoring the atomic composition.

         <title>Amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanosheets@Crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 Nanorods for High Current&#8208;density Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 nanocomposites were synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step strategy. The catalysts display efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for HER and OER, as well as for water splitting in neutral solution. The amorphous structure abundant unsaturated sites altered the local electronic structure of metallic sites and optimized the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (O* to OOH*).







Abstract
It is vitally important to develop highly active, robust and low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in neutral solution especially at large current density. In this work, amorphous Mo&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheets@crystalline NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorods (Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5) was synthesized using a facil one&#8208;step strategy. In phosphate buffer saline solution, the Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 shows tiny overpotentials of 48 and 209&#8197;mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 238 and 514&#8197;mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 delivers excellent stability for at least 300&#8197;h without obvious degradation. Theoretical calculations revealed that the Ni sites in the defect&#8208;rich amorphous structure of Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS0.5Se0.5 owns higher electron state density and strengthened the binding energy of H2O, which will optimize H adsorption/desorption energy barriers and reduce the adsorption energy of OER determining step.

&lt;p&gt;Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposites were synthesized by a simple one-step strategy. The catalysts display efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for HER and OER, as well as for water splitting in neutral solution. The amorphous structure abundant unsaturated sites altered the local electronic structure of metallic sites and optimized the energy barrier for the rate-determining step (O* to OOH*).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is vitally important to develop highly active, robust and low-cost transition metal-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in neutral solution especially at large current density. In this work, amorphous Mo-doped NiS&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets@crystalline NiS&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; nanorods (Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;) was synthesized using a facil one-step strategy. In phosphate buffer saline solution, the Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; shows tiny overpotentials of 48 and 209&#8197;mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 238 and 514&#8197;mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Moreover, Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; delivers excellent stability for at least 300&#8197;h without obvious degradation. Theoretical calculations revealed that the Ni sites in the defect-rich amorphous structure of Am&#8722;Mo&#8722;NiS&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; owns higher electron state density and strengthened the binding energy of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which will optimize H adsorption/desorption energy barriers and reduce the adsorption energy of OER determining step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emerging Materials for Interfacial Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on solar&#8208;driven water purification has grown rapidly over the past years and emerging materials such as polymers, MOFs and COFs have been employed in this field recently. This minireview gives an overview of the basic concepts and principles for solar evaporation systems and on the development of novel photothermal materials.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water purification is considered as an effective and sustainable technology for water treatment using green solar energy. One major goal for practical applications is to improve the solar evaporation performance by the design of novel photothermal materials, with optimized heat localization and water transport pathways to achieve reduced energy consumption for water vaporization. Recently, some emerging materials like polymers, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and also single molecules were employed to construct novel solar evaporation systems. In this minireview, we present an overview of the recent efforts on materials development for water purification systems. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications of these emerging materials for solar&#8208;driven water treatment, including desalination, wastewater purification, sterilization and energy production, are also summarized.

         <title>A New PETase from the Human Saliva Metagenome and Its Functional Modification via Genetic Code Expansion in Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery and engineering of new plastic degrading enzymes is an important challenge in chemical biotechnology to enable transition to a more sustainable and circular plastics economy. This field has so far yielded a range of enzymes and microbial pathways for the recycling and valorization of plastic waste. New research from Uttamapinant&#160;et al.&#160;reports the discovery of a novel PET hydrolase from the human saliva metagenome that displays improved properties and catalytic performance over previously characterized PETases. The authors also demonstrate the site&#8208;specific incorporation of a photocaged unnatural amino acid, pDAP, which upon photodecaging enables covalent binding of DAP to the PET surface. Together, this work highlights metagenomic datasets as an untapped source of new PET degrading enzymes and the chemical modification of PETases via genetic code expansion to produce new biotechnologies for the circular plastics economy.</dc:description>

         <title>Light Alters the NH3 vs N2H4 Product Profile in Iron&#8208;catalyzed Nitrogen Reduction via Dual Reactivity from an Iron Hydrazido (Fe=NNH2) Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas synthetically catalyzed nitrogen reduction (N2R) to produce ammonia is widely studied, catalysis to instead produce hydrazine (N2H4) has received less attention despite its considerable mechanistic interest. Herein, we disclose that irradiation of a trisphosphine&#8208;borane (P3B) Fe catalyst, P3BFe+, significantly alters its product profile to increase N2H4 versus NH3; P3BFe is otherwise known to be highly selective for NH3. We posit a key terminal hydrazido intermediate, P3BFe=NNH2, as selectivity&#8208;determining. Whereas its singlet ground state undergoes protonation to liberate NH3, a low&#8208;lying triplet excited state leads to reactivity at N&#945; and formation of N2H4. Associated electrochemical and spectroscopic studies establish that N2H4 lies along a unique product pathway; NH3 is not produced from N2H4. Our findings are distinct from the canonical mechanism for hydrazine formation, which proceeds via a diazene (HN=NH) intermediate and showcase light as a tool to tailor selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Photophysics in Hydrazone&#8208;Based Hierarchical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As hibiscus flowers bloom in the morning and close at night, hydrazone derivatives exhibit photoresponsive behavior as a function of an excitation wavelength. While hydrazone &#8220;flowers&#8221; wilt in the wrong environment, they blossom in a MOF &#8220;vase&#8221;. Thus, integration of hydrazone&#8208;photoswitches in proper 3D environments cultivates solution&#8208;like photophysical properties in solid&#8208;state materials and allows for modulation of energy transfer processes.







Abstract
Confinement&#8208;imposed photophysics was probed for novel stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrazone&#8208;based compounds demonstrating a conceptual difference in their behavior within 2D versus 3D porous matrices for the first time. The challenges associated with photoswitch isomerization arising from host interactions with photochromic compounds in 2D scaffolds could be overcome in 3D materials. Solution&#8208;like photoisomerization rate constants were realized for sterically demanding hydrazone derivatives in the solid state through their coordinative immobilization in 3D scaffolds. According to steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photophysical measurements and theoretical modeling, this approach provides access to hydrazone&#8208;based materials with fast photoisomerization kinetics in the solid state. Fast isomerization of integrated hydrazone derivatives allows for probing and tailoring resonance energy transfer (ET) processes as a function of excitation wavelength, providing a novel pathway for ET modulation.

         <title>Conformational Control of Organocatalyst in Strongly Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acidic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enantioselective Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Reticulation of chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenol&#8208;based imidodiphosphoric acid (IDP) into two Dy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) allows controlling the organocatalyst conformations and local chiral microenvironments. The MOF containing the 4&#8208;connected IDPs has a less compact shape and can be an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst for the challenging asymmetric O,O&#8208;acetalization of diol and aldehyde with up to 96&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Chiral imidodiphosphates (IDPs) have emerged as strong Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts for many enantioselective processes. However, the dynamic transformation between O,O&#8208;syn and O,O&#8208;anti conformers typically results in low enantioselectivity. Here we demonstrate that topologies of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be exploited to control IDP conformations and local chiral microenvironments for enantioselective catalysis. Two porous Dy&#8208;MOFs with different topologies are obtained from an enantiopure 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenol IDP&#8208;based tetracarboxylate ligand. While the ligand adopts a 4&#8208; or 3&#8208;connected (c) binding mode, all IDPs are rigidified to get only a single O,O&#8208;syn conformation and display greatly enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity relative to the free IDP. The MOF with the 4&#8208;c IDP that has a relatively less compact shape than the 3&#8208;c IDP can be an efficient and recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid catalysing the challenging asymmetric O,O&#8208;acetalization reaction with up to 96&#8201;% enantiomeric excess.

         <title>An Antitumor Dual&#8208;Responsive Host&#8208;Guest Supramolecular Polymer Based on Hypoxia&#8208;Cleavable Azocalix[4]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A host&#8211;guest dual&#8208;response supramolecular polymer was prepared based on a dimeric hypoxia&#8208;responsive azocalixrene and GSH&#8208;cleavable CPT dimer (D&#8208;CPT), which further self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles and exhibits excellent antitumor therapy performance.







Abstract
The exploitation of specific guests which can respond to external stimuli is the main approach for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular polymers (SPs) based on host&#8211;guest interactions. Most functional guests, however, fail to manifest stimuli&#8208;responses. Herein, a hypoxia&#8208;responsive dimeric azocalixarene (D&#8208;SAC4A) with outstanding hosting properties was used as the macrocyclic building block for the preparation of host stimuli&#8208;responsive SPs. Since azocalixarenes can also be compatible with stimuli&#8208;responsive guests, an antitumor drug, camptothecin (CPT), was chosen and linked via a disulfide&#8208;containing linker to afford a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive ditropic guest (D&#8208;CPT). A unique dual&#8208;responsive SP was obtained by 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixing of D&#8208;SAC4A and D&#8208;CPT in water, which further assembled into SP nanoparticles (DSPNs). DSPNs displayed outstanding stability against dilution and biological interferants, as well as precise CPT&#8208;release under GSH and hypoxia conditions. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the good biosafety and tumor&#8208;suppressive effects of DSPNs.

         <title>Economical Access to Diverse Enantiopure Tetrahydropyridines and Piperidines Enabled by Catalytic Borrowing Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented, economical one&#8208;pot access to enantiopure N&#8722;H tetrahydropyridines is achieved by coupling a few readily available substrates with commercially available 1,3&#8208;amino alcohols via catalytic borrowing hydrogen. Highly diastereoselective functionalizations of tetrahydropyridines also result in a general access to enantiopure di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted piperidines, which rank among the most frequent N&#8208;heterocycles in commercial drugs.







Abstract
We disclose herein a catalytic borrowing hydrogen method that enables an unprecedented, economical one&#8208;pot access to enantiopure tetrahydropyridines with minimal reagent use or waste formation. This method couples a few classes of readily available substrates with commercially available 1,3&#8208;amino alcohols, and delivers the valuable tetrahydropyridines of different substitution patterns free of N&#8208;protection. Such transformations are highly challenging to achieve, as multiple redox steps need to be realized in a cascade and numerous side reactions including a facile aromatization have to be overcome. Highly diastereoselective functionalizations of tetrahydropyridines also result in a general access to enantiopure di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted piperidines, which ranks the topmost frequent N&#8208;heterocycle in commercial drugs.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Based TREM2 Inhibitor Suppresses Tumors by Remodeling the Immunosuppressive Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum complex OPA shows a potent chemoimmunotherapeutic effect on tumors by impeding DNA replication and inhibiting the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells&#8208;2 (TREM2). OPA promotes the polarization of macrophages from immunosuppressive M2 to tumoricidal M1 phenotype, and stimulates dendritic, cytotoxic T, and natural killer cells to restrain cancer cells. By transforming the tumor microenvironment, OPA overcomes the tumor resistance to platinum drugs.







Abstract
Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells&#8208;2 (TREM2) is a key pro&#8208;tumorigenic marker of tumor&#8208;infiltrating macrophages, showing potent immunosuppressive activity in tumor microenvironment. A platinum(IV) complex OPA derived from oxaliplatin (OP) and artesunate (ART) exhibited direct cytotoxicity against human colon cancer cells and immunomodulatory activity to inhibit TREM2 on macrophages in vitro and vivo. Furthermore, OPA deterred the tumor growth in mouse models bearing MC38 colorectal tumor by reducing the number of CD206+ and CX3CR1+ immunosuppressive macrophages; it also promoted the expansion and infiltration of immunostimulatory dendritic, cytotoxic T, and natural killer cells. OPA is the first small&#8208;molecular TREM2 inhibitor capable of relieving immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhancing chemical anticancer efficiency of a platinum drug, thus showing typical characteristics of a chemoimmunotherapeutic agent.

         <title>Mutability&#8208;Landscape&#8208;Guided Engineering of l&#8208;Threonine Aldolase Revealing the Prelog Rule in Mediating Diastereoselectivity of C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Prelog rule in l&#8208;threonine aldolase holds that when the C&#945; anion of PLP&#8208;Gly attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of the aldehyde from the re&#8208;face, the (2S,3S)&#8208;configured product is formed, whereas attack from the si&#8208;face forms the (2S,3R)&#8208;configured product. Guided by this rule, mutants of LTA with improved diastereoselectivity of 99.2&#8201;%syn and 97.4&#8201;%anti were obtained.







Abstract
l&#8208;threonine aldolase (LTA) catalyzes C&#8722;C bond synthesis with moderate diastereoselectivity. In this study, with LTA from Cellulosilyticum sp (CpLTA) as an object, a mutability landscape was first constructed by performing saturation mutagenesis at substrate access tunnel amino acids. The combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test/iterative saturation mutation (CAST/ISM) strategy was then used to tune diastereoselectivity. As a result, the diastereoselectivity of mutant H305L/Y8H/V143R was improved from 37.2&#8201;%syn to 99.4&#8201;%syn. Furthermore, the diastereoselectivity of mutant H305Y/Y8I/W307E was inverted to 97.2&#8201;%anti. Based on insight provided by molecular dynamics simulations and coevolution analysis, the Prelog rule was employed to illustrate the diastereoselectivity regulation mechanism of LTA, holding that the asymmetric formation of the C&#8722;C bond was caused by electrons attacking the carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate aldehyde from the re or si face. The study would be useful to expand LTA applications and guide engineering of other C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes.

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 Bonds Bearing Vicinal Stereocenters by Synergistic Palladium and Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>

A stereodivergent Csp3&#8722;Csp3 coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes with oxindoles was achieved by synergizing a palladium and a chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalyst in a biphasic system. Both the syn and anti products, which have vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters, could be selectively achieved in good yields with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. This is the first stereodivergent synthesis via metal/phase&#8208;transfer catalysis.







Abstract
Synergistic catalysis has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for stereodivergent formation of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds bearing vicinal stereocenters. Despite the many successes that have been achieved in this field, stereodivergent Csp3&#8722;Csp3 coupling reactions involving stabilized nucleophiles remain challenging because of the competing single&#8208;catalysis pathway. Herein, we report a synergistic palladium/phase&#8208;transfer catalyst system that enables diastereodivergent Csp3&#8722;Csp3 coupling reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes with stabilized nucleophile oxindoles. Both the syn and anti coupling products, bearing quaternary and tertiary vicinal stereocenters, could be selectively produced in good yields with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. Non&#8208;covalent activation of the stabilized nucleophile via chiral ion pair in a biphasic system is a crucial success factor in achieving diastereodivergence.

         <title>Electronic Effect&#8208;Modulated Enhancements of Proton Conductivity in Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic polymers with improved proton conductivity were prepared by modulating substituents with different electronic effects. The sulfonated materials showed top&#8208;tier conductivity, excellent long&#8208;term stability, and low activation energy.







Abstract
We proposed a new strategy to maximize the density of acidic groups by modulating the electronic effects of the substituents for high&#8208;performance proton conductors. The conductivity of the sulfonated 1&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S with methyl group corresponds to 2.29&#215;10&#8722;1&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8201;% relative humidity, remarkably an 22100&#8208;fold enhancement over the nonsulfonated 1&#8208;MeL40. 1&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S maintains long&#8208;term conductivity for one month. We confirm that this synthetic method is generalized to the extended version POPs, 2&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S and 3&#8208;MeL40&#8208;S. In particular, the conductivities of the POPs compete with those of top&#8208;level porous organic conductors. Moreover, the activation energy of the POPs is lower than that of the top&#8208;performing materials. This study demonstrates that systematic alteration of the electronic effects of substituents is a useful route to improve the conductivity and long&#8208;term durability of proton&#8208;conducting materials.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence at the Single&#8208;Nanoparticle Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An array of well&#8208;controlled Au single particles or oligomers was printed on an electrode surface, and used as a high&#8208;throughput platform to investigate the plasmon enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) at the single&#8208;nanoparticle level. This ECL microscopy can visualize and quantify the electrochemical reactions of multiple individual NPs from wide&#8208;field imaging simultaneously.







Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) at the single&#8208;nanoparticle (NP) level was investigated by ECL microscopy. The Au NPs were assembled into an ordered array, providing a high&#8208;throughput platform that can easily locate each NP in sequential characterizations. A strong dependence of ECL intensity on Au NP configurations was observed. We demonstrate for the first time that at the single&#8208;particle level, the ECL of Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;TPrA was majorly quenched by small Au NPs (&lt;40&#8197;nm), while enhanced by large Au ones (&gt;80&#8197;nm) due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Notably, the ECL intensity was further increased by the coupling effect of neighboring Au NPs. Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations conformed well with the experimental results. This plasmon enhanced ECL microscopy for arrayed single NPs provides a reliable tool for screening electrocatalytic activity at a single particle.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens for In Vivo Theranostics of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) probe, DNTPH, was designed by balancing hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties. DNTPH displays excellent blood&#8211;brain barrier permeability and binds to &#946;&#8208;amyloid A&#946;42 fibrils selectively. Remarkably, DNTPH exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on A&#946; fibrosis, thus attenuating A&#946;&#8208;induced neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. DNTPH serves as the first AIE in vivo theranostic agent for near&#8208;infrared imaging of A&#946;42 plaques and AD therapy.







Abstract
Optimized theranostic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain almost absent from bench to clinic. Current probes and drugs attempting to prevent &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) fibrosis encounter failures due to the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetration challenge and blind intervention time window. Herein, we design a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) probe, DNTPH, via balanced hydrophobicity&#8208;hydrophilicity strategy. DNTPH binds selectively to A&#946; fibrils with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. In vivo imaging revealed its excellent BBB permeability and long&#8208;term tracking ability with high&#8208;performance AD diagnosis. Remarkably, DNTPH exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on A&#946; fibrosis and promotes fibril disassembly, thereby attenuating A&#946;&#8208;induced neurotoxicity. DNTPH treatment significantly reduced A&#946; plaques and rescued learning deficits in AD mice. Thus, DNTPH serves as the first AIE in vivo theranostic agent for real&#8208;time NIR imaging of A&#946; plaques and AD therapy simultaneously.

         <title>Mixed Matrix Membrane with Penetrating Subnanochannels: A Versatile Nanofluidic Platform for Selective Metal Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the unique structure of cell membranes, a mixed&#8208;matrix membrane (MMM) with penetrating subnanochannels was developed based on a soft&#8208;substrate assisted solution casting method for selective conduction of monovalent metal ions. Thanks to the diversity of nanoporous materials and polymer matrix, we expect that the penetrating MMMs could be developed into a versatile nanofluidic platform and offer new possibilities for practical applications.







Abstract
Biological ion channels penetrated through cell membrane form unique transport pathways for selective ionic conductance. Replicating the success of ion selectivity with mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) will enable new separation technologies but remains challenging. Herein, we report a soft substrate&#8208;assisted solution casting method to develop MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels for selective metal ion conduction. The MMMs are composed of penetrating Prussian white (PW) microcubes with subnanochannels in dense polyimide (PI) matrices, achieving selective monovalent metal ion conduction. The ion selectivity of K+/Mg2+ is up to 14.0, and the ion conductance of K+ can reach 45.5&#8197;&#956;S with the testing diameter of 5&#8197;mm, which can be further improved by increasing the testing area. Given the diversity of nanoporous materials and polymer matrices, we expect that the MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels could be developed into a versatile nanofluidic platform for various emerging applications.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Light Probes Excited&#8208;State Delocalization in Rectangular Ladder&#8208;type Pentaphenyl Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rectangular &#960;&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers of one particular handedness provide a square answer to the question of delocalization of their lowest&#8208;energy photoexcitation: the coupling to vibrations makes the excitation shaky. Exciton localization is a dynamic process and the excitation &#8220;breathes&#8221; in concert with the zero&#8208;point vibrational motion.







Abstract
Ladder&#8208;type pentaphenyl chromophores have a rigid, planar &#960;&#8208;system and show bright fluorescence featuring pronounced vibrational structure. Such moieties are ideal for studying interchromophoric interactions and delocalization of electronic excitations. We report the synthesis of helical polymers with a rigid square structure based on spiro&#8208;linked ladder&#8208;type pentaphenyl units. The variation of circular dichroism with increasing chain length provides direct evidence for delocalization of electronic excitations over at least 10 monomeric units. The change in the degree of circular polarization of the fluorescence across the vibronic side bands shows that vibrational motion can localize the excitation dynamically to almost one single unit through breakdown of the Born&#8208;Oppenheimer approximation. The dynamic conversion between delocalized and localized excited states provides a new paradigm for interpreting circular dichroism in helical polymers such as proteins and polynucleic acids.

         <title>Structural Evolution of Anatase&#8208;Supported Platinum Nanoclusters into a Platinum&#8208;Titanium Intermetallic Containing Platinum Single Atoms for Enhanced Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt clusters of 1.5&#8197;nm supported on anatase TiO2 transform exclusively into CsCl&#8208;type PtTi intermetallic compound particles that grow epitaxially along the TiO2 (101) planes after H2 reduction at 700&#8201;&#176;C. The formation of PtTi occurs through migration of reduced metallic Ti atoms into Pt clusters. The thermally stable PtTi intermetallic exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and promoted catalytic durability for CO oxidation.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interactions characteristic of the encapsulation of metal particles by oxide overlayers have been widely observed on large metal nanoparticles, but scarcely occur on small nanoclusters (&lt;2&#8197;nm) for which the metal&#8208;support interactions remain elusive. Herein, we study the structural evolution of Pt nanoclusters (1.5&#8197;nm) supported on anatase TiO2 upon high&#8208;temperature H2 reduction. The Pt nanoclusters start to partially evolve into a CsCl&#8208;type PtTi intermetallic compound when the reduction temperature reaches 400&#8201;&#176;C. Upon 700&#8201;&#176;C reduction, the PtTi nanoparticles are exclusively formed and grow epitaxially along the TiO2 (101) crystal faces. The thermodynamics of the formation of PtTi via migration of reduced Ti atoms into Pt cluster is unraveled by theoretical calculations. The thermally stable PtTi intermetallic compound, with single&#8208;atom Pt isolated by Ti, exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and promoted catalytic durability for CO oxidation.

         <title>A Far&#8208;Red Molecular Rotor Fluorogenic Trehalose Probe for Live Mycobacteria Detection and Drug&#8208;Susceptibility Testing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a novel trehalose&#8208;based fluorogenic probe that features a molecular rotor turn&#8208;on fluorophore with exceptionally bright far&#8208;red emission is described (RMR&#8208;Tre). RMR&#8208;Tre enables rapid, no&#8208;wash, low&#8208;background fluorescence detection and drug&#8208;susceptibility evaluation of live mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis.







Abstract
Increasing the speed, specificity, sensitivity, and accessibility of mycobacteria detection tools are important challenges for tuberculosis (TB) research and diagnosis. In this regard, previously reported fluorogenic trehalose analogues have shown potential, but their green&#8208;emitting dyes may limit sensitivity and applications in complex settings. Here, we describe a trehalose&#8208;based fluorogenic probe featuring a molecular rotor turn&#8208;on fluorophore with bright far&#8208;red emission (RMR&#8208;Tre). RMR&#8208;Tre, which exploits the unique biosynthetic enzymes and environment of the mycobacterial outer membrane to achieve fluorescence activation, enables fast, no&#8208;wash, low&#8208;background fluorescence detection of live mycobacteria. Aided by the red&#8208;shifted molecular rotor fluorophore, RMR&#8208;Tre exhibited up to a 100&#8208;fold enhancement in M.&#8197;tuberculosis labeling compared to existing fluorogenic trehalose probes. We show that RMR&#8208;Tre reports on M.&#8197;tuberculosis drug resistance in a facile assay, demonstrating its potential as a TB diagnostic tool.

         <title>Communication and Cross&#8208;Regulation between Chemically Fueled Sender and Receiver Reaction Networks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chemical&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven non&#8208;equilibrium DNA&#8208;based enzymatic reaction networks have been coupled with a RNA transcription system to achieve cross&#8208;regulation and feedback between each other. This approach gives different types of signal outputs, including repression, promotion, repression&#8208;recovery, and promotion&#8208;stop.







Abstract
Nature connects multiple fuel&#8208;driven chemical/enzymatic reaction networks (CRNs/ERNs) via cross&#8208;regulation to hierarchically control biofunctions for a tailored adaption in complex sensory landscapes. Herein, we introduce a facile example of communication and cross&#8208;regulation among two fuel&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;based ERNs regulated by a concatenated RNA transcription regulator. ERN1 (&#8220;sender&#8221;) is designed for the fuel&#8208;driven promoter formation for T7 RNA polymerase, which activates RNA transcription. The produced RNA can deactivate or activate DNA in ERN2 (&#8220;receiver&#8221;) by toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, leading to a communication between two ERNs. The RNA from ERN1 can repress or promote the fuel&#8208;driven state of ERN2; ERN2 in turn feedbacks to regulate the lifetime of ERN1. Furthermore, the incorporation of RNase H allows for RNA degradation and enables the autonomous recovery of ERN2. We believe that concatenation of multiple CRNs/ERNs provides a basis for the design of more elaborate autonomous regulatory mechanisms in systems chemistry and synthetic biology.

         <title>Hierarchical Integration of Organic Core/Shell Microwires for Advanced Photonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a series of organic charge transfer cocrystals with structural similarity and physicochemical tunability, we demonstrate the precise construction of various types of hierarchical organic microwires. Branch microwires with multichannel waveguide and core/shell microwires with multicolor waveguide performance can be integrated into branch core/shell microwires for realizing optical logic gates with multi&#8208;encoding functions.







Abstract
The combination of multiple components or structures into integrated micro/nanostructures for practical application has been pursued for many years. Herein, a series of hierarchical organic microwires with branch, core/shell (C/S), and branch C/S structures are successfully constructed based on organic charge transfer (CT) cocrystals with structural similarity and physicochemical tunability. By regulating the intermolecular CT interaction, single microwires and branch microstructures can be integrated into the C/S and branch C/S structures, respectively. Significantly, the integrated branch C/S microwires, with multicolor waveguide behavior and branch structure multichannel waveguide output characteristics, can function as an optical logic gate with multiple encoding features. This work provides useful insights for creating completely new types of organic microstructures for integrated optoelectronics.

Branch microwires with multichannel waveguide and core/shell microwires with multicolor waveguide performance can be integrated into branch core/shell microwires for realizing optical logic gates with multi-encoding functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of multiple components or structures into integrated micro/nanostructures for practical application has been pursued for many years. Herein, a series of hierarchical organic microwires with branch, core/shell (C/S), and branch C/S structures are successfully constructed based on organic charge transfer (CT) cocrystals with structural similarity and physicochemical tunability. By regulating the intermolecular CT interaction, single microwires and branch microstructures can be integrated into the C/S and branch C/S structures, respectively. Significantly, the integrated branch C/S microwires, with multicolor waveguide behavior and branch structure multichannel waveguide output characteristics, can function as an optical logic gate with multiple encoding features. This work provides useful insights for creating completely new types of organic microstructures for integrated optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programming Non&#8208;Nucleic Acid Molecules into Computational Nucleic Acid Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With utilization of conformationally controlled ligand converters, different kinds of non&#8208;nucleic acid molecules, including both small molecules and proteins, can be integrated into nucleic acid computation to construct circuitries with increased complexity and scalability and to even perform algorithmic calculations. This hybridized system establishes a universal platform for molecular computation.







Abstract
Nucleic acid (NA) computation has been widely developed in the past years to solve kinds of logic and mathematic issues in both information technologies and biomedical analysis. However, the difficulty to integrate non&#8208;NA molecules limits its power as a universal platform for molecular computation. Here, we report a versatile prototype of hybridized computation integrated with both nucleic acids and non&#8208;NA molecules. Employing the conformationally controlled ligand converters, we demonstrate that non&#8208;NA molecules, including both small molecules and proteins, can be computed as nucleic acid strands to construct the circuitry with increased complexity and scalability, and can be even programmed to solve arithmetical calculations within the computational nucleic acid system. This study opens a new door for molecular computation in which all&#8208;NA circuits can be expanded with integration of various ligands, and meanwhile, ligands can be precisely programmed by the nuclei acid computation.

         <title>Highly Luminescent One&#8208;Dimensional Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Double&#8208;Perovskite&#8208;Inspired Materials for Single&#8208;Component Warm White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

We report on a new class of 1D double perovskite&#8208;inspired materials (DFPD)2MIInBr6 (DFPD=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium, MI=K+ and Rb+), which exhibit an intrinsic warm&#8208;white light emission. Further enhancement is achieved by 0.3&#8201;% Sb3+ doping, which boosts PLQY to &#8776;92&#8201;%. Warm white light&#8208;emitting diodes based on single component (DFPD)2KInBr6:Sb are fabricated.







Abstract
Double perovskites (DPs) are one of the most promising candidates for developing white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) owing to their intrinsic broadband emission from self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). Translation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DPs to one&#8208;dimensional (1D) analogues, which could break the octahedral tolerance factor limit, is so far remaining unexplored. Herein, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a series of highly luminescent 1D DP&#8208;inspired materials, (DFPD)2MIInBr6 (DFPD=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium, MI=K+ and Rb+). Highly efficient warm&#8208;white photoluminescence quantum yield of 92&#8201;% is achieved by doping 0.3&#8201;% Sb3+ in (DFPD)2KInBr6. Furthermore, single&#8208;component warm&#8208;WLEDs fabricated with (DFPD)2KInBr6:Sb yield a luminance of 300 cd/m2, which is one of the best&#8208;performing lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halides WLEDs reported so far. Our study expands the scope of In&#8208;based metal&#8208;halides from 3D to 1D, which exhibit superior optical performances and broad application prospects.

         <title>Catalytic Properties of High Nitrogen Content Carbonaceous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon materials are attractive alternatives to metal catalysts in terms of price and reduced environmental impact. However, the influence of structural modifications on the catalytic activity of carbon materials is poorly understood. General trends in the catalytic activity of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons are identified using a holistic approach to carbocatalysis.







Abstract
The influence of structural modifications on the catalytic activity of carbon materials is poorly understood. A collection of carbonaceous materials with different pore networks and high nitrogen content was characterized and used to catalyze four reactions to deduce structure&#8211;activity relationships. The CO2 cycloaddition and Knoevenagel reaction depend on Lewis basic sites (electron&#8208;rich nitrogen species). The absence of large conjugated carbon domains resulting from the introduction of large amounts of nitrogen in the carbon network is responsible for poor redox activity, as observed through the catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene with hydrazine and the catalytic oxidation of 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine using hydroperoxide. The material with the highest activity towards Lewis acid catalysis (in the hydrolysis of (dimethoxymethyl)benzene to benzaldehyde) is the most effective for small molecule activation and presents the highest concentration of electron&#8208;poor nitrogen species.

         <title>Aptamer Inhibits Tumor Growth by Leveraging Cellular Proteasomal Degradation System to Degrade c&#8208;Met in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new mechanism where aptamer leverages cellular proteasomal degradation system to degrade protein for cancer treatment. A DNA aptamer binds to extracellular domain of mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;Met), and induces c&#8208;Met phosphorylation at Y1003 and Y1349. The phosphorylation of Y1003 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B&#8208;lineage lymphoma (c&#8208;cbl), which causes c&#8208;Met ubiquitination and degradation in proteasome.







Abstract
Current action mechanisms for aptamer&#8208;based therapeutics depend on occupancy&#8208;driven pharmacology to mediate protein functions. We report a new mechanism where aptamers leverage cellular proteasomal degradation system to degrade proteins for cancer treatment. A DNA aptamer (hereinafter referred to as c&#8208;Met&#8208;Ap) binds to the extracellular domain of mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition factor (c&#8208;Met) and selectively induces c&#8208;Met phosphorylation at Y1003 and Y1349. The phosphorylation of Y1003 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B&#8208;lineage lymphoma, causing c&#8208;Met ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Furthermore, c&#8208;Met&#8208;Ap can induce a decrease in the heterodimeric partner proteins of c&#8208;Met and the downstream effector proteins in the c&#8208;Met signal axis, effectively inhibiting tumor growth in A549 tumor&#8208;bearing BALB/c mice. Our study uncovers a novel, actionable mechanism for aptamer therapeutics and opens a new avenue for developing highly efficient anticancer drugs.

         <title>High Power&#8208; and Energy&#8208;Density Supercapacitors through the Chlorine Respiration Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an unprecedentedly high power&#8208; and energy&#8208;density supercapacitor through the chlorine respiration in porous carbon materials. Both electrochemical results and theoretical calculations show that porous carbon with pore size around 3&#8197;nm delivers the best chlorine evolution and adsorption performance.







Abstract
Supercapacitor represents an important electrical energy storage technology with high&#8208;power performance and superior cyclability. However, currently commercialized supercapacitors still suffer limited energy densities. Here we report an unprecedentedly respiring supercapacitor with chlorine gas iteratively re&#8208;inspires in porous carbon materials, that improves the energy density by orders of magnitude. Both electrochemical results and theoretical calculations show that porous carbon with pore size around 3&#8197;nm delivers the best chlorine evolution and adsorption performance. The respiring supercapacitor with multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotube as the cathode and NaTi2(PO4)3 as the anode can store specific energy of 33&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with negligible capacity loss over 30&#8201;000 cycles. The energy density can be further improved to 53&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 by replacing NaTi2(PO4)3 with zinc anode. Furthermore, thanks to the extraordinary reaction kinetics of chlorine gas, this respiring supercapacitor performs an extremely high&#8208;power density of 50&#8201;000&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Retarding the Shuttling Ions in the Electrochromic TiO2 with Extensive Crystallographic Imperfections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct sites for ion accommodation are found in an electrochromic transition&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide (ETMO) nanowire film by the galvanostatic transmittance evolution: the normal site and the abnormal site. Ions at the abnormal sites contribute little to coloration but retard the shuttling rate. These findings give a clear picture of the ion shuttling process, allowing the electrochromic performance to be enhanced for the design of efficient smart windows.







Abstract
To understand the role of structure imperfections on the performance of electrochromic transition metal oxide (ETMO) is challenging for the design of efficient smart windows. Herein, we investigate the performance evolution with tunable crystallographic imperfections for rutile TiO2 nanowire film (TNF). Structure imperfections, originating mainly from the copious oxygen deficiency, are apt to cumulatively retard the shuttling ions, resulting in the response rate for raw TNF being less than the half that of TNF annealed at 500&#8201;&#176;C. We describe ion accommodation sites as a convolution of normal site and abnormal site, in which the normal site performs reversible coloration but the abnormal site contributes only to charge storage, which gives a rationale for the non&#8208;linear coloration and rate capability loss. These findings give a clear picture of the ion shuttling process, which is insightful for enhancing the electrochromic performance via structure reprogramming.

         <title>Bioconjugation via Hetero&#8208;Selective Clamping of Two Different Amines with ortho&#8208;Phthalaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple ortho&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent enables a facile and broadly applicable bioconjugation strategy via hetero&#8208;selective clamping of two different endogenous amino handles such as &#1013;&#8208;NH2 of lysine and &#945;&#8208;NH2 of &#945;&#8208;amino acids without any pre&#8208;functionalization.







Abstract
Amino groups are common in both natural and synthetic compounds and offer a very attractive class of endogenous handles for bioconjugation. However, the ability to differentiate two types of amino groups and join them with high hetero&#8208;selectivity and efficiency in a complex setting remains elusive. Herein, we report a new method for bioconjugation via one&#8208;pot chemoselective clamping of two different amine nucleophiles using a simple ortho&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent. Various &#945;&#8208;amino acids, aryl amines, and secondary amines can be crosslinked to the &#1013;&#8208;amino side chain of lysine on peptides or proteins with high efficiency and hetero&#8208;selectivity. This method offers a simple and powerful means to crosslink small molecule drugs, imaging probes, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, and even virus particles without any pre&#8208;functionalization.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Laser Emission from Homochiral Superstructures based on Achiral Molecules with Conformal Flexibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a rational strategy to clamp the molecular conformation and facilitate parallel packing of achiral D&#8208;A molecules. This leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking during crystallization. When this emergent homochirality is coupled with the optical gain of the molecules, the homochiral crystals can be explored as excellent circularly polarized micro&#8208;lasers with low lasing threshold (16.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high dissymmetry factor glum (0.9).







Abstract
Without external chiral intervention, it is a challenge to form homochirality from achiral molecules with conformational flexibility. We here report on a rational strategy that uses multivalent noncovalent interactions to clamp the molecular conformations of achiral D&#8208;A molecules. These interactions overcome the otherwise dominant dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and thus disfavor their symmetric antiparallel stacking. It in turn facilitates parallel packing, leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking during crystallization and thus the formation of homochiral conglomerates. When this emergent homochirality is coupled with optical gain characteristics of the molecules, the homochiral crystals are explored as excellent circularly polarized micro&#8208;lasers with low lasing threshold (16.4&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and high dissymmetry factor glum (0.9). This study therefore provides a facile design strategy for supramolecular chiral materials and active laser ones without the necessity of intrinsic chiral element.

         <title>The Role of Discrepant Reactive Intermediates on Ru&#8208;Ru2P Heterostructure for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) performance of Ru&#8208;Ru2P/C heterostructure is explored in the whole pH range. Unexpectedly, a non&#8208;monotonous relationship between the HOR activities and the pH of electrolytes is observed. Moreover, its HOR performance in alkaline media is much higher than that in acidic media, highlighting the role of discrepant intermediates for pH&#8208;universal HOR.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline media is essential for the commercialization of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC). However, the kinetics of HOR in alkaline media is complicated, resulting in orders of magnitude slower than that in acid, even for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C. Here, we find that Ru&#8208;Ru2P/C heterostructure shows HOR performance with a non&#8208;monotonous variation in a whole pH region. Unexpectedly, an inflection point located at pH&#8776;7 is observed, showing an anomalous behavior that HOR activity under alkaline media surpasses acidic media. Combining experimental results and theoretical calculations, we propose the roles of discrepant reactive intermediates for pH&#8208;universal HOR, while H* and H2O* adsorption strengths are responsible for acidic HOR, and OH* adsorption strength is essential for alkaline HOR. This work not only sheds light on fundamentally understanding the mechanism of HOR but also provides new designing principles for pH&#8208;targeted electrocatalysts.

         <title>Darobactins Exhibiting Superior Antibiotic Activity by Cryo&#8208;EM Structure Guided Biosynthetic Engineering
</title>

Structural evaluation of the Bam complex with darobactin 9 using cryo&#8208;EM combined with bioactivity evaluation led to biosynthetic engineering of novel derivatives with enhanced activity against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens, including clinically relevant isolates. The currently most promising derivative darobactin 22 verified the structure and activity guided approach, exhibiting up to 128&#8208;fold increased activity compared to natural darobactin A.







Abstract
Over recent decades, the pipeline of antibiotics acting against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is running dry, as most discovered candidate antibiotics suffer from insufficient potency, pharmacokinetic properties, or toxicity. The darobactins, a promising new small peptide class of drug candidates, bind to novel antibiotic target BamA, an outer membrane protein. Previously, we reported that biosynthetic engineering in a heterologous host generated novel darobactins with enhanced antibacterial activity. Here we utilize an optimized purification method and present cryo&#8208;EM structures of the Bam complex with darobactin 9 (D9), which served as a blueprint for the biotechnological generation of twenty new darobactins including halogenated analogs. The newly engineered darobactin 22 binds more tightly to BamA and outperforms the favorable activity profile of D9 against clinically relevant pathogens such as carbapenem&#8208;resistant Acinetobacter baumannii up to 32&#8208;fold, without observing toxic effects.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Chiral Open [60]Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimethylaminocarbene&#8208;mediated orifice expansion gave the first near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing chiral open [60]fullerenes. The introduced aminomethylidene moiety is well&#8208;conjugated with the fullerene cage, thus considerably elevating the HOMO level as supported by the electrochemical analysis. The optical resolution revealed a large dissymmetry factor of gabs=&#177;0.12 at 820&#8197;nm in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene.







Abstract
Though [60]fullerene is an achiral molecular nanocarbon with Ih symmetry, it could attain an inherent chirality depending upon a functionalization pattern. The conventional chiral induction of C60 relies mainly upon a multiple addition affording a mixture of achiral and chiral isomers while their chiral function would be largely offset by the existence of pseudo&#8208;mirror plane(s). These are major obstacles to proceed further study on fullerene chirality and yet leave its understanding elusive. Herein, we showcase a carbene&#8208;mediated synthesis of C1&#8208;symmetric chiral open [60]fullerenes showing an intense far&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared absorption. The large dissymmetry factor of |gabs|=0.12 was achieved at &#955;=820&#8197;nm for circular dichroism in benzonitrile. This is, in general, unachievable by other small chiral organic molecules, demonstrating the potential usage of open [60]fullerenes as novel types of chiral chromophores.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroamination of Arylalkenes with Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An excellent enantioselective hydroamination of arylalkenes with Lewis basic secondary amines was developed, via an elegant cobalt&#8208;hydride mediated oxidative hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) process, leading to the synthesis of a series of valuable &#945;&#8208;chiral tertiary amines in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric hydroamination of alkenes with Lewis basic amines is of great interest but remains a challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we developed a Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of arylalkenes directly using commercially accessible secondary amines. This process enables the efficient access to valuable &#945;&#8208;chiral tertiary amines in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction includes a CoH&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) with arylalkenes, followed by a pivotal catalyst controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated electrophilic cationic alkylcobalt(IV) species and free amines. This radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy not only provides a straightforward and alternative approach for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, but also underpins the substantial opportunities in developing asymmetric radical functionalization of alkenes with various free nucleophiles in oxidative MHAT catalysis.

         <title>Combining Deep Eutectic Solvents with TEMPO&#8208;based Polymer Electrodes: Influence of Molar Ratio on Electrode Performance
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable battery technology: The combination of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with TEMPO&#8208;based electrodes opens a new way to environmentally friendly energy storage in all&#8208;organic batteries. Especially the eutectic mixture of the DES composed of sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and N&#8208;methylacetamide enables stable and efficient cycling of the polymer electrodes.







Abstract
For sustainable energy storage, all&#8208;organic batteries based on redox&#8208;active polymers promise to become an alternative to lithium ion batteries. Yet, polymers contribute to the goal of an all&#8208;organic cell as electrodes or as solid electrolytes. Here, we replace the electrolyte with a deep eutectic solvent (DES) composed of sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) and N&#8208;methylacetamide (NMA), while using poly(2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl&#8208;oxyl methacrylate) (PTMA) as cathode. The successful combination of a DES with a polymer electrode is reported here for the first time. The electrochemical stability of PTMA electrodes in the DES at the eutectic molar ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;6 is comparable to conventional battery electrolytes. More viscous electrolytes with higher salt concentration can hinder cycling at high rates. Lower salt concentration leads to decreasing capacities and faster decomposition. The eutectic mixture of 1&#8201;:&#8201;6 is best suited uniting high stability and moderate viscosity.

         <title>Aggregation of Electrochemically Active Conjugated Organic Molecules and Its Impact on Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox organic molecules feature reversible redox&#8208;tuned discrete&#8208;aggregate conversion in solution. The resultant aggregation&#8208;regulated electrochemistry (ARE) offers a new mechanism to optimize the flow battery's performance.







Abstract
Molecule aggregation in solution is acknowledged to be universal and can regulate the molecule's physiochemical properties, which however has been rarely investigated in electrochemistry. Herein, an electrochemical method is developed to quantitatively study the aggregation behavior of the target molecule methyl viologen dichloride. It is found that the oxidation state dicationic ions stay discrete, while the singly&#8208;reduced state monoradicals yield a concentration&#8208;dependent aggregation behavior. As a result, the molecule's energy level and its redox potential can be effectively regulated. This work does not only provide a method to investigate the molecular aggregation, but also demonstrates the feasibility to tune redox flow battery's performance by regulating the aggregation behavior.

This work does not only provide a method to investigate the molecular aggregation, but also demonstrates the feasibility to tune redox flow battery's performance by regulating the aggregation behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthetic Monosaccharide Channels: Size&#8208;Selective Transmembrane Transport of Glucose and Fructose Mediated by Porphyrin Boxes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;persistent organic cages, porphyrin boxes (PBs), have been used to construct synthetic monosaccharide channels. These cages facilitate the transmembrane transport of glucose and fructose through their windows, while impeding the transport of larger sized sugars because of the limited size of the cage windows, thus facilitating size&#8208;selective transport. Live cells treated with the PBs show glucose uptake and enhanced cell viability.







Abstract
Here we report synthetic monosaccharide channels built with shape&#8208;persistent organic cages, porphyrin boxes (PBs), that allow facile transmembrane transport of glucose and fructose through their windows. PBs show a much higher transport rate for glucose and fructose over disaccharides such as sucrose, as evidenced by intravesicular enzyme assays and molecular dynamics simulations. The transport rate can be modulated by changing the length of the alkyl chains decorating the cage windows. Insertion of a linear pillar ligand into the cavity of PBs blocks the monosaccharide transport. In vitro cell experiment shows that PBs transport glucose across the living&#8208;cell membrane and enhance cell viability when the natural glucose transporter GLUT1 is blocked. Time&#8208;dependent live&#8208;cell imaging and MTT assays confirm the cyto&#8208;compatibility of PBs. The monosaccharide&#8208;selective transport ability of PBs is reminiscent of natural glucose transporters (GLUTs), which are crucial for numerous biological functions.

         <title>Synthesis of Twisted [n]Cycloparaphenylene by Alkene Insertion</title>

Mono&#8208;alkene&#8208;inserted [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPP) 1 with n=6, 8, and 10, mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;inserted [6]CPP 2, and di&#8208;alkene&#8208;inserted [n]CPP with n=4, 6, and 8 were synthesized by inserting alkene or ortho&#8208;phenylene units into a CPP skeleton. 1 and 2 exhibited a M&#246;bius topology only in the solid state, but mono&#8208;alkene&#8208;inserted [6]CPP with eight 1&#8208;pyrrolyl groups preserved the M&#246;bius topology even in solution.







Abstract
Mono&#8208;alkene&#8208;inserted [n]cycloparaphenylenes 1 [(ene)&#8208;[n]CPP] with n=6, 8, and 10, mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;inserted [6]CPP 2, and di&#8208;alkene&#8208;insertved [n]CPP 3 [(ene)2&#8208;[n]CPP] with n=4, 6, and 8 were synthesized by fusing CPP precursors and alkene or ortho&#8208; phenylene groups through coupling reactions. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that the strips formed by the &#960;&#8208;surfaces of 1 and 2 exhibited a M&#246;bius topology in the solid state. While the M&#246;bius topology in the parent 1 and 2 in solution was lost due to the free rotation of the paraphenylene unit even at low temperatures, ene&#8208;[6]CPP 4 with eight 1&#8208;pyrrolyl groups preserved the M&#246;bius topology even in solution. Despite a twist, 1 has in&#8208;plane conjugation and possesses a unique size dependence of the electronic properties: namely, the opposite size dependency of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy relative to conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.

         <title>Interparticle Charge&#8208;Transport&#8208;Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence of Quantum&#8208;Dot Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term ambiguity in mechanistic understanding of charge&#8208;transfer routes toward electrochemiluminescence generation has been deciphered in this study through the design of highly tunable quantum dot aerogels as novel luminophores. The interparticle charge&#8208;transfer route has been explicitly demonstrated and selectively enhanced based on the strong electronic coupling of quantum dot aerogels.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) represents a widely explored technique to generate light, in which the emission intensity relies critically on the charge&#8208;transfer reactions between electrogenerated radicals. Two types of charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms have been postulated for ECL generation, but the manipulation and effective probing of these routes remain a fundamental challenge. Here, we demonstrate the design of quantum dot (QD) aerogels as novel ECL luminophores via a versatile water&#8208;induced gelation strategy. The strong electronic coupling between adjacent QDs enables efficient charge transport within the aerogel network, leading to the generation of highly efficient ECL based on the selectively improved interparticle charge&#8208;transfer route. This mechanism is further verified by designing CdSe&#8208;CdTe mixed QD aerogels, where the two mechanistic routes are clearly decoupled for ECL generation. We anticipate our work will advance the fundamental understanding of ECL and prove useful for designing next&#8208;generation QD&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Controlling Selectivity in Shuttle Hetero&#8208;difunctionalization Reactions: Electrochemical Transfer Halo&#8208;thiolation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shuttle catalysis is emerging as a potent strategy to unleash unprecedented synthetic flexibility in organic synthesis. Herein, we disclose a rare example of shuttle hetero&#8208;difunctionalization to transfer two distinct functional groups between &#946;&#8208;halosulfides and alkynes with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity via a paired electrolysis process. This unfolds new opportunities for selective shuttle difunctionalization reactions.







Abstract
Shuttle hetero&#8208;difunctionalization reaction, in which two chemically distinct functional groups are transferred between two molecules, has long been an unmet goal due to the daunting challenges in controlling the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. Herein, we disclose an electrochemistry enabled shuttle reaction (e&#8208;shuttle) to selectively transfer one RS&#8722; and one X&#8722; group between &#946;&#8208;halosulfides and unsaturated hydrocarbons via a consecutive paired electrolysis mechanism. The preferential anodic oxidation of one anion over the other, which is controlled by their distinct redox potentials, plays a pivotal role in controlling the high chemoselectivity of the process. This easily scalable methodology enables the construction of a myriad of densely functionalized &#946;&#8208;halo alkenyl sulfides in unprecedented chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity using benign surrogates, e.g., 2&#8208;bromoethyl sulfide, avoiding the handling of corrosive and oxidative RS&#8211;Br reagents. In a broader context, these results open up new strategies for selective shuttle difunctionalization reactions.

         <title>Chiral Frustrated Lewis Pair@Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a New Platform for Heterogeneous Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active heterogeneous chiral frustrated Lewis pair system has been achieved for the first time via incorporating rationally designed bifunctional chiral FLP molecules into a MOF under the guidance of computational studies; the afforded CFLP@MOF demonstrated superb catalysis performances in heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation with excellent recyclability/regenerability.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation, a seminal strategy for the synthesis of chiral molecules, remains largely unmet in terms of activation by non&#8208;metal sites of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, as demonstrated by combined computational and experimental studies, we present a general strategy for integrating rationally designed molecular chiral frustrated Lewis pair (CFLP) with porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to construct the catalyst CFLP@MOF that can efficiently promote the asymmetric hydrogenation in a heterogeneous manner, which for the first time extends the concept of chiral frustrated Lewis pair from homogeneous system to heterogeneous catalysis. Significantly, the developed CFLP@MOF, inherits the merits of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, with high activity/enantio&#8208;selectivity and excellent recyclability/regenerability. Our work not only advances CFLP@MOF as a new platform for heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation, but also opens a new avenue for the design and preparation of advanced catalysts for asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Mechanoredox Catalysis Enables a Sustainable and Versatile Reversible Addition&#8208;Fragmentation Chain Transfer Polymerization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling mechanochemistry and single&#8208;electron transfer processes in a ball mill facilitates an efficient reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer polymerization reaction. A versatile mechanoredox process is developed to synthesize macromolecules with good molar mass control. This method serves as an alternative to access complex polymers that may be difficult to access using traditional solution&#8208;state processes.







Abstract
The sustainable synthesis of macromolecules with control over sequence and molar mass remains a challenge in polymer chemistry. By coupling mechanochemistry and electron&#8208;transfer processes (i.e., mechanoredox catalysis), an energy&#8208;conscious controlled radical polymerization methodology is realized. This work explores an efficient mechanoredox reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization process using mechanical stimuli by implementing piezoelectric barium titanate and a diaryliodonium initiator with minimal solvent usage. This mechanoredox RAFT process demonstrates exquisite control over poly(meth)acrylate dispersity and chain length while also showcasing an alternative to the solution&#8208;state synthesis of semifluorinated polymers that typically utilize exotic solvents and/or reagents. This chemistry will find utility in the sustainable development of materials across the energy, biomedical, and engineering communities.

         <title>A Multifunctional Polymer as an Interfacial Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multifunctional polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide), was designed and utilized to synergistically passivate the under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+ and anchor the I&#8208; of the [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedron on the surface of a perovskite film. This passivation leads to an enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12 to 1.22&#8197;V and improved stability in solar cell devices, with the device maintaining 95&#8201;% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 1000&#8197;h of maximum power point tracking. Additionally, a large&#8208;area solar cell device was fabricated using this approach, achieving a PCE of 20.64&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;cation defects and halogen&#8208;anion defects in perovskite films are critical to the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a random polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide) (PMMA&#8208;AM), was synthesized to serve as an interfacial passivation layer for synergistically passivating the under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+ and anchor the I&#8208; of the [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedron. Additionally, the interfacial PMMA&#8208;AM passivation layer cannot be destroyed during the hole transport layer deposition because of its low solubility in chlorobenzene. This passivation leads to an enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12 to 1.22&#8197;V and improved stability in solar cell devices, with the device maintaining 95&#8201;% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 1000&#8197;h of maximum power point tracking. Additionally, a large&#8208;area solar cell module was fabricated using this approach, achieving a PCE of 20.64&#8201;%.

         <title>Enabling Photo&#8208;Crosslinking and Photo&#8208;Sensitizing Properties for Synthetic Fluorescent Protein Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work discovered that fluorescence protein chromophore analogs can undergo triplet excitation, enabling photo&#8208;crosslinking and photo&#8208;sensitizing chemistries. Exploration of these synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores resulted in photo&#8208;crosslinkers for biomolecules, photo&#8208;catalysts for organic reactions, and photosensitizers for chromophore&#8208;assisted light inactivation and photodynamic therapies.







Abstract
Synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores have been reported for their singlet state fluorescence properties and applications in bioimaging, but rarely for the triplet state chemistries. Herein, we enabled their photo&#8208;sensitizing and photo&#8208;crosslinking properties through rational modulations. Extension of molecular conjugation and introduction of heavy atoms promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species. Unlike other photosensitizers, these chromophores selectively photo&#8208;crosslinked aggregated proteins and uncovered the interactome profiles. We also exemplified their general applications in chromophore&#8208;assisted light inactivation, photodynamic therapy and photo induced polymerization. Theoretical calculation, pathway analysis and transient absorption spectroscopy provided mechanistic insights for this triplet state chemistry. Overall, this work expands the function and application of synthetic fluorescent protein chromophores by enabling their triplet excited state properties.

         <title>Skeleton&#8208;Reorganizing Coupling Reactions of Cycloheptatriene and Cycloalkenones with Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual catalytic coupling reaction of cycloheptatriene and cycloalkenones with amines proceeds through a skeleton&#8208;reorganization process for the selective synthesis of fused 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reactions proceed through a retro&#8208;Mannich&#8208;type ring&#8208;opening and a subsequent intramolecular Povarov process.







Abstract
Skeletal reorganization reactions have emerged as an intriguing tool for converting readily available compounds into complicated molecules inaccessible by traditional methods. Herein, we report a unique skeleton&#8208;reorganizing coupling reaction of cycloheptatriene and cycloalkenones with amines. In the presence of Rh/acid catalysis, cycloheptatriene can selectively couple with anilines to deliver fused 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinoline products. Mechanistic studies indicate that the retro&#8208;Mannich type ring&#8208;opening and subsequent intramolecular Povarov reaction account for the ring reorganization. Our mechanistic studies also revealed that skeleton&#8208;reorganizing amination between anilines and cycloalkenones can be achieved with acid. The synthetic utilization of this skeleton&#8208;reorganizing coupling reaction was showcased with a gram&#8208;scale reaction, synthetic derivatizations, and the late&#8208;stage modification of commercial drugs.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable Electroluminescent Elastomers with Self&#8208;Confinement Effect for Highly Efficient Non&#8208;Blended Stretchable OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving high&#8208;performance electroluminescence under large deformation remains a grand challenge. In this contribution, a general concept based on the self&#8208;confinement effect has been proposed for the design and synthesis of non&#8208;blended intrinsically stretchable electroluminescent elastomers (ISEEs). High&#8208;performance non&#8208;blended stretchable OLEDs have been constructed based on the resulting ISEEs.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;flexible stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are emerging as a basic component of flexible electronics and human&#8208;machine interfaces. However, the brightness and efficiency of stretchable OLEDs remain still far inferior to their rigid counterparts, owing to the scarcity of satisfactory stretchable electroluminescent materials. Herein, we explore a general concept based on the self&#8208;confinement effect to dramatically improve the stretchability of elastomers, without affecting electroluminescent properties. The balanced rigid/flexible chain dynamics under self&#8208;confinement significantly reduces the modulus of the elastomers, resulting in the maximum strain reaching 806&#8201;%. Ultra&#8208;flexible stretchable OLEDs have been constructed based on the resulting ISEEs, achieving unprecedented high&#8208;performance non&#8208;blended stretchable OLEDs. The results suggest an effective molecular design strategy for highly deformable stretchable displays and flexible electronics.

         <title>Infrared Diffusion&#8208;Ordered Spectroscopy Reveals Molecular Size and Structure
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infrared diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy is a simple and cost&#8208;effective way to simultaneously characterize size and chemical structure of molecules, molecular aggregates/complexes, or small particles.







Abstract
Inspired by ideas from NMR, we have developed Infrared Diffusion&#8208;Ordered Spectroscopy (IR&#8208;DOSY), which simultaneously characterizes molecular structure and size. We rely on the fact that the diffusion coefficient of a molecule is determined by its size through the Stokes&#8211;Einstein relation, and achieve sensitivity to the diffusion coefficient by creating a concentration gradient and tracking its equilibration in an IR&#8208;frequency resolved manner. Analogous to NMR&#8208;DOSY, a two&#8208;dimensional IR&#8208;DOSY spectrum has IR frequency along one axis and diffusion coefficient (or equivalently, size) along the other, so the chemical structure and the size of a compound are characterized simultaneously. In an IR&#8208;DOSY spectrum of a mixture, molecules with different sizes are nicely separated into distinct sets of IR peaks. Extending this idea to higher dimensions, we also perform 3D&#8208;IR&#8208;DOSY, in which we combine the conformation sensitivity of femtosecond multi&#8208;dimensional IR spectroscopy with size sensitivity.

         <title>An Amorphous n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymer with an Ultra&#8208;Rigid Planar Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous conjugated polymers represent another kind of polymer semiconductor with a different charge transporting mechanism. An n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with rigid, straight and planar backbone has now been designed and synthesized. It is amorphous in a thin film but exhibits an electron mobility of 0.34&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
High charge carrier mobility polymer semiconductors are always semi&#8208;crystalline. Amorphous conjugated polymers represent another kind of polymer semiconductors with different charge transporting mechanism. Here we report the first near&#8208;amorphous n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with decent electron mobility, which features a remarkably rigid, straight and planar polymer backbone. The molecular design strategy is to copolymerize two fused&#8208;ring building blocks which are both electron&#8208;accepting, centrosymmetrical and planar. The polymer is the alternating copolymer of double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit and benzobisthiazole (BBTz) unit. It shows a decent electron mobility of 0.34&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. The excellent electron transporting property of the polymer is possibly due to the ultrahigh backbone stiffness, small &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance, and high molecular weight.

         <title>Selecting Better Biocatalysts by Complementing Recoded Bacteria
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in vivo selection strategy is presented, in which bacteria addicted to non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are complemented by enzymes that can yield these building blocks from synthetic precursors. As growth rates under selective conditions correlate with enzyme activities, serial passaging elicited better biocatalysts from populations harboring enzyme libraries. The platform was used to improve the activity of carbamoylases for ncAA&#8208;precursors.







Abstract
In vivo selections are powerful tools for the directed evolution of enzymes. However, the need to link enzymatic activity to cellular survival makes selections for enzymes that do not fulfill a metabolic function challenging. Here, we present an in vivo selection strategy that leverages recoded organisms addicted to non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) to evolve biocatalysts that can provide these building blocks from synthetic precursors. We exemplify our platform by engineering carbamoylases that display catalytic efficiencies more than five orders of magnitude higher than those observed for the wild&#8208;type enzyme for ncAA&#8208;precursors. As growth rates of bacteria under selective conditions correlate with enzymatic activities, we were able to elicit improved variants from populations by performing serial passaging. By requiring minimal human intervention and no specialized equipment, we surmise that our strategy will become a versatile tool for the in vivo directed evolution of diverse biocatalysts.

         <dc:description>
A polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) composite cathode is employed for high&#8208;voltage (&gt;3&#8197;V) rechargeable Mg and Ca batteries based on the tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy) borate [B(hfip)4] anion storage chemistry. Mechanistic studies elucidate the unique redox mechanism of the amine moieties in the active cathode material. The dual&#8208;ion batteries exhibit both high energy and high power&#8208;density and long cycle&#8208;life.







Abstract
Multivalent batteries show promising prospects for next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage applications. Herein, we report a polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) composite cathode capable of highly reversible storage of tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy) borate [B(hfip)4] anions in both Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) battery systems. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal the redox reaction mechanism of the PTPAn cathode material. The Mg and Ca cells exhibit a cell voltage &gt;3&#8197;V, a high&#8208;power density of &#8764;&#8764;3000&#8197;W kg&#8722;1 and a high&#8208;energy density of &#8764;&#8764;300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, the combination of the PTPAn cathode with a calcium&#8208;tin (Ca&#8722;Sn) alloy anode could enable a long battery&#8208;life of 3000&#8197;cycles with a capacity retention of 60&#8201;%. The anion storage chemistry associated with dual&#8208;ion electrochemical concept demonstrates a new feasible pathway towards high&#8208;performance divalent ion batteries.

         <title>Characterization of a Ferryl Flip in Electronically Tuned Nonheme Complexes. Consequences in Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isomerization of pairs of electronically tuned oxoiron(IV) geometrical isomers is described, as a model for the &#8220;ferryl flip&#8221; observed in non&#8208;heme enzymes. The position of the oxo ligand in the coordination sphere of the iron center has a strong impact on the hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) activity of the oxoiron(IV) compounds, while electronic effects do not play a significant role in HAT reactions.







Abstract
Two oxoiron(IV) isomers (R2a and R2b) of general formula [FeIV(O)(RPyNMe3)(CH3CN)]2+ are obtained by reaction of their iron(II) precursor with NBu4IO4. The two isomers differ in the position of the oxo ligand, cis and trans to the pyridine donor. The mechanism of isomerization between R2a and R2b has been determined by kinetic and computational analyses uncovering an unprecedented path for interconversion of geometrical oxoiron(IV) isomers. The activity of the two oxoiron(IV) isomers in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions shows that R2a reacts one order of magnitude faster than R2b, which is explained by a repulsive noncovalent interaction between the ligand and the substrate in R2b. Interestingly, the electronic properties of the R substituent in the ligand pyridine ring do not have a significant effect on reaction rates. Overall, the intrinsic structural aspects of each isomer define their relative HAT reactivity, overcoming changes in electronic properties of the ligand.

&lt;p&gt;The isomerization of pairs of electronically tuned oxoiron(IV) geometrical isomers is described, as a model for the &#8220;ferryl flip&#8221; observed in non-heme enzymes. The position of the oxo ligand in the coordination sphere of the iron center has a strong impact on the hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) activity of the oxoiron(IV) compounds, while electronic effects do not play a significant role in HAT reactions.

         <title>Umpolung Asymmetric 1,5&#8208;Conjugate Addition via Palladium Hydride Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional umpolung protocol was demonstrated for novel 1,5&#8208;conjugate additions via palladium hydride catalyst. Three catalytic reaction modes including 1,5&#8208;addition cascade with inter&#8208; and intramolecular [3+2] cyclization and migratory 1,5&#8208;addition were established via palladium or palladium/organo&#8208;cocatalysis.







Abstract
Electronically matched nucleophilic 1,6&#8208;conjugate addition has been well studied and widely applied in synthetic areas. In contrast, nucleophilic 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition represents an electronically forbidden process and is considered unfeasible. Here, we describe modular protocols for 1,5&#8208;conjugate addition reactions via palladium hydride catalysis. Both palladium and synergistic Pd/organocatalyst systems are developed to catalyze 1,5&#8208;conjugate reaction, followed by inter&#8208; or intramolecular [3+2] cyclization. A migratory 1,5&#8208;addition protocol is established to corroborate the feasibility of this umpolung concept. The 1,5&#8208;addition products are conveniently transformed into a series of privileged enantioenriched motifs, including polysubstituted tetrahydrofuran, dihydrofuran, cyclopropane, cyclobutane, azetidine, oxetane, thietane, spirocycle and bridged rings. Preliminary mechanistic studies corroborate the involvement of palladium hydride catalysis.

         <title>Toward Precise Antitumoral Photodynamic Therapy Using a Dual Receptor&#8208;Mediated Bioorthogonal Activation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The internalization of two bioorthogonal components mediated by the corresponding receptors, followed by inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction leads to specific activation of the photodynamic action inside the target cells. This dual receptor&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal activation approach works as an AND logic device that can greatly enhance the precision of antitumoral photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Targeted delivery and specific activation of photosensitizers can greatly improve the treatment outcome of photodynamic therapy. To this end, we report herein a novel dual receptor&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal activation approach to enhance the tumor specificity of the photodynamic action. It involves the targeted delivery of a biotinylated boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizer, which is quenched in the native form by the attached 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine unit, and an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeting cyclic peptide conjugated with a bicycle[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne moiety. Only for cancer cells that overexpress both the biotin receptor and EGFR, the two components can be internalized preferentially where they undergo an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, leading to restoration of the photodynamic activity of the BODIPY core. By using a range of cell lines with different expression levels of these two receptors, we have demonstrated that this stepwise &#8220;deliver&#8208;and&#8208;click&#8221; approach can confine the photodynamic action on a specific type of cancer cells.

         <title>Triflylpyridinium Enables Rapid and Scalable Controlled Reduction of Carboxylic Acids to Aldehydes using Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and scalable synthesis of aldehydes from carboxylic acids is achieved by employing pinacolborane as a reducing agent and a triflylpyridinium as an activating reagent. Theoretical studies exhibit that the reduction of acylpyridinium requires a lower activation free energy than that of product aldehyde. This method features a wide substrate scope. Flow synthesis and the synthesis of deuterated aldehydes are achieved.







Abstract
Building up new and efficient methods for the controlled conversion of carboxylic acids to aldehydes is important. Herein, we report a rapid, modular and scalable method for the conversion of carboxylic acids to aldehydes using pinacolborane at ambient temperature, in which a triflylpyridinium reagent is used. The conversion of carboxylic acid to intermediate acylpyridinium by triflylpyridinium is new. A binary pyridine&#8208;coordinated boronium complex is generated after reduction. The unprecedented reduction of the acylpyridinium by HBpin opens up a practically direct synthesis of aldehydes from carboxylic acids. Theoretical studies indicate that the reduction of acylpyridinium requires a lower activation free energy than that of the product aldehyde. The synthetic advantage of this protocol is further highlighted by the scalable synthesis of aldehyde via continuous flow process. Configuration retention for chiral acids are presented in those syntheses.

         <title>Alternately &#960;&#8208;Stacked Systems Assisted by o&#8208;Carborane: Dual Excimer Emission and Color Modulation by Bcage&#8208;Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely designed dual&#8208;excimer emissive crystals have been synthesized in which two types of &#960;&#8208;stacking patterns coexist alternately in the crystalline state. Consequently, two kinds of excimer emission are observed in the different wavelength regions. Moreover, the steric hindrance of the methyl substituent perturbs the intensity ratio of the two excimer emissions and the fluorescence color can be tuned.







Abstract
Herein, we report the unique solid&#8208;state excimer emission of three types of acridine&#8208;tethered o&#8208;carboranes with variable degrees of methylation at the o&#8208;carborane unit. They all showed columnar packing structures based on dimer formation, and two types of &#960;&#8208;overlapping motifs were alternately stacked. From the photoluminescence (PL) measurements on the crystalline samples, it was found that three types of luminescence bands can simultaneously appear: monomer emission, excimer emission from the moderately &#960;&#8208;stacked intra&#8208;dimer unit, and excimer emission from the widely &#960;&#8208;stacked inter&#8208;dimer unit. Consequently, the PL colors were drastically changed by the steric effect of the methyl groups, with a strong correlation found between the &#960;&#8208;overlapping and excimer character. In addition, variable&#8208;temperature PL measurements revealed that these PL species should be in thermal equilibrium at room temperature, with the intensity ratios sensitive toward temperature changes.

     alt="Alternately &#960;-Stacked Systems Assisted by o-Carborane: Dual Excimer Emission and Color Modulation by Bcage-Methylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precisely designed dual-excimer emissive crystals have been synthesized in which two types of &#960;-stacking patterns coexist alternately in the crystalline state. Consequently, two kinds of excimer emission are observed in the different wavelength regions. Moreover, the steric hindrance of the methyl substituent perturbs the intensity ratio of the two excimer emissions and the fluorescence color can be tuned.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the unique solid-state excimer emission of three types of acridine-tethered &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carboranes with variable degrees of methylation at the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carborane unit. They all showed columnar packing structures based on dimer formation, and two types of &#960;-overlapping motifs were alternately stacked. From the photoluminescence (PL) measurements on the crystalline samples, it was found that three types of luminescence bands can simultaneously appear: monomer emission, excimer emission from the moderately &#960;-stacked intra-dimer unit, and excimer emission from the widely &#960;-stacked inter-dimer unit. Consequently, the PL colors were drastically changed by the steric effect of the methyl groups, with a strong correlation found between the &#960;-overlapping and excimer character. In addition, variable-temperature PL measurements revealed that these PL species should be in thermal equilibrium at room temperature, with the intensity ratios sensitive toward temperature changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Off&#8208;center Mechanophore Activation in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atypical force distribution along block copolymer (BCP) chains is seen when these are mechanically stressed. Mechanophores are more efficiently activated in a segment in a BCP that is far from the chain center than when in a fully loaded multi&#8208;mechanophore homopolymer.







Abstract
Block copolymers (BCPs) are used in numerous applications in modern materials science. Yet, like homopolymers, BCPs can undergo covalent bond scission when mechanically stressed (mechanochemistry), which could lead to unexpected consequences in such applications. BCPs&#8217; heterogeneity may affect force transduction, perhaps changing force distribution and localization. To verify this, a gem&#8208;dichlorocyclopropane (gDCC) embedded linear chain is prepared and extended with a poly(methyl methacrylate) block. When stressed in solution, the mechanochemical ring&#8208;opening of gDCC is accelerated compared to homopolymers, even though the mechanophores are at the chain ends. Moreover, a higher mechanophore activation selectivity is obtained. These results indicate that mechanochemical response outside, and even far from the chain center is quite prominent in BCPs, and that forces along the polymer chain can efficiently activate multi&#8208;mechanophores regions, even when far from the polymer midchain.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Cyclisation Reaction for the Synthesis of Highly&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydroquinolines and Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild one&#8208;pot condensation/light&#8208;mediated cyclisation reaction leading to a diverse range of densely functionalised tetrahydroquinoline and quinoline products is described, proceeding via divergent electrocyclisation and photoredox pathways, respectively. Thorough exploration of the reaction substrate scope, reaction intermediates and mechanistic pathways uncovers the key driving forces for the observed reactivity and stereochemistry.







Abstract
Condensation of 2&#8208;vinylanilines and conjugated aldehydes followed by an efficient light&#8208;mediated cyclisation selectively yields either substituted tetrahydroquinolines with typically high dr, or in the presence of an iridium photocatalyst the synthesis of quinoline derivatives is demonstrated. These atom economical processes require mild conditions, with the substrate scope demonstrating excellent site selectivity and functional group tolerance, including azaarene&#8208;bearing substrates. A thorough experimental mechanistic investigation explores multiple pathways and the key role that imine and iminium intermediates play in the absorption of visible light to generate reactive excited states. The synthetic utility of the reactions is demonstrated on gram scale quantities in both batch and flow, alongside further manipulation of the medicinally relevant products.

Give your chemistry classroom a green overhaul with resources from the American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute, Beyond Benign, and the Center for Green Chemistry &amp; Green Engineering at Yale. Many green chemistry online resources, journals, and textbooks for classroom and laboratory are available. Urgent adoption of these resources is needed.







Abstract
Full integration of green chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum is a necessity to prepare our students for a sustainable future. We discuss the reasons for the need to change the curriculum, the institutions in North America, Europe, and Asia that are leading the way towards integration with classroom resources, and the published textbooks that are currently available for both classroom and laboratory. We plead for more time for hard&#8208;pressed college professors to revamp the curriculum, and for these efforts to be valued. We feel compelled by the urgency of this need to implore the chemistry education community to participate in these efforts now.

Unique solid&#8208;state emission from three types of acridine&#8208;tethered boron clusters, o&#8208;carboranes, with variable degrees of methylation, is reported by Kazuo Tanaka et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202214397). It is found that monomer emission, excimer emission from the &#960;&#8208;stacked intra&#8208;dimer unit, and excimer emission from the &#960;&#8208;stacked inter&#8208;dimer unit can be simultaneously obtained. Consequently, not only drastic luminescent color changes but also thermochromic luminescence properties were observed.

Darobactins bind to the novel antibiotic target BamA in the outer membrane BAM&#8208;complex of Gram&#8208;negative pathogens. The renewal of the outer membrane proteins is prevented and bacteria are lysed. The new derivative D22 was created through cryo&#8208;EM structure&#8208; and activity&#8208;guided biosynthetic engineering as described by Thomas C. Marlovits, Jennifer Herrmann, Rolf M&#252;ller, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202214094), and showed superior potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant clinical isolates, for which most antibiotics on the market are no longer effective.

e&#8208;Shuttle catalysis is a promising tool to transfer functional groups between molecules back and forth via a consecutive paired electrolysis mechanism. A rare example of shuttle hetero&#8208;difunctionalization to transfer two distinct functional groups between &#946;&#8208;halosulfides and unsaturated hydrocarbons is shown by Siegfried&#8197;R. Waldvogel, Bill Morandi, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202213630). The preferential anodic oxidation of one anion over the other is a key technique to ensure high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity in this process.

Double perovskites are one of the most promising candidates for developing white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes owing to their intrinsic broadband emission from self&#8208;trapped excitons. In their Research Article (e202213240), Feng Liu, Bin Yang, and co&#8208;workers report a novel highly luminescent one&#8208;dimensional double&#8208;perovskite&#8208;inspired material with a warm&#8208;white photoluminescence quantum yield of 92&#8201;%. Furthermore, single&#8208;component warm&#8208;white light emitting diodes were fabricated by using this material.

         <dc:description>
A recent report from Leitch, Browne and co&#8208;workers demonstrated how a programmable jar heater delivers an efficient methodology for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type cross coupling reaction of aryl sulfamates and aryl boronic acid species. This methodology can be readily upscaled 200&#8208;fold using twin&#8208;screw extrusion methodologies, demonstrating scalability of mechanochemical catalytic processes.







Abstract
Several mechanochemically heated processes have been published in recent years. However, precise control over the mechanochemical catalysed coupling reactions remained elusive. A recent report from Leitch, Browne and co&#8208;workers demonstrated how a programmable jar heater manifold delivers an efficient methodology for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type cross coupling reaction of aryl sulfamates and aryl boronic acid species.

&lt;p&gt;A recent report from Leitch, Browne and co-workers demonstrated how a programmable jar heater delivers an efficient methodology for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura-type cross coupling reaction of aryl sulfamates and aryl boronic acid species. This methodology can be readily upscaled 200-fold using twin-screw extrusion methodologies, demonstrating scalability of mechanochemical catalytic processes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several mechanochemically heated processes have been published in recent years. However, precise control over the mechanochemical catalysed coupling reactions remained elusive. A recent report from Leitch, Browne and co-workers demonstrated how a programmable jar heater manifold delivers an efficient methodology for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura-type cross coupling reaction of aryl sulfamates and aryl boronic acid species. This methodology can be readily upscaled 200-fold using twin-screw extrusion methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spectro&#8208;Microscopic Techniques for Studying Nanoplastics in the Environment and in Organisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoplastics (NPs) pose a threat to the environment and human health but are challenging to detect and characterize in environmental samples. This Minireview covers established imaging and characterization techniques, with a focus on micro&#8208;spectroscopic techniques. More exotic advanced techniques to measure NP morphology and chemical fingerprints simultaneously are discussed, and challenges in detection of NPs using high&#8208;resolution imaging are outlined.







Abstract
Nanoplastics (NPs), small (&lt;1&#8197;&#956;m) polymer particles formed from bulk plastics, are a potential threat to human health and the environment. Orders of magnitude smaller than microplastics (MPs), they might behave differently due to their larger surface area and small size, which allows them to diffuse through organic barriers. However, detecting NPs in the environment and organic matrices has proven to be difficult, as their chemical nature is similar to these matrices. Furthermore, as their size is smaller than the (spatial) detection limit of common analytical tools, they are hard to find and quantify. We highlight different micro&#8208;spectroscopic techniques utilized for NP detection and argue that an analysis procedure should involve both particle imaging and correlative or direct chemical characterization of the same particles or samples. Finally, we highlight methods that can do both simultaneously, but with the downside that large particle numbers and statistics cannot be obtained.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Annulation to Access High&#8208;Valued N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>

Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative annulation is a unique concept that has provided a new dimension for the construction of high&#8208;valued nitrogen heterocycles. This Review highlights the denitrogenative annulation concept applied to various 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazoles.







Abstract
Over the past few years, the development of efficient methods to construct high&#8208;valued N&#8208;heterocyclic molecules have received massive attention owing to their extensive application in the areas of medicinal chemistry, drug discovery, natural product synthesis and so on. To access those high&#8208;valued N&#8208;heterocycles, many methods have been developed. In this context, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative annulation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazoles has appeared as a powerful synthetic tool because it offers a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical route for the preparation of the nitrogen&#8208;rich molecules. Compared with the denitrogenative annulation of various 1,2,3&#8208;triazole frameworks, annulation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazole remains more challenging due to the inertness of the tetrazole moiety. This Review summarizes the significant achievements made in the field of denitrogenative annulation of various 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazoles including some pioneering examples in this area of research. We anticipate that this denitrogenative annulation reaction will find broad applications in the pharmaceutical industry, drug discovery and other fields of medicinal chemistry.

Thermocells are a type of battery that produces electricity from a temperature difference between the two electrodes. Recent studies have shown various molecular technologies can be effectively used in thermocells to increase the voltage. This Minireview provides a thorough comparison of four basic strategies&#8212;redox entropy, molecular recognition, phase separation, and phase transition&#8212;for boosting the thermoelectric efficiency.







Abstract
Thermocells are a thermoelectric conversion technology that utilizes the shift in an electrochemical equilibrium arising from a temperature difference. This technology has a long history; however, its low conversion efficiency impedes its practical usage. Recently, an increasing number of reports have shown drastic improvements in thermoelectric conversion efficiency, and thermocells could arguably represent an alternative to solid thermoelectric devices. In this Minireview, we regard thermocells as molecular systems consisting of successive molecular processes responding to a temperature change to achieve energy generation. Various molecular technologies have been applied to thermocells in recent years, and could stimulate diverse research fields, including supramolecular chemistry, physical chemistry, electrochemistry, and solid&#8208;state ionics. These research approaches will also provide novel methods for achieving a sustainable society in the future.

Copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl bromides with organoboronate esters is developed to access synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams. The success of this work relies on the utilization of chiral N,N,N&#8208;ligands to forge the sterically congested C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent radical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary &#945;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactams with organoboronate esters could provide the synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#946;&#8208;lactams. The challenge arises mainly from the construction of sterically congested quaternary stereocenters between the tertiary alkyl radicals and chiral copper(II) species. Herein, we describe our success in achieving such transformations through the utilization of a copper/hemilabile N,N,N&#8208;ligand catalyst to forge the sterically congested chiral C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond via a single&#8208;electron reduction/transmetalation/bond formation catalytic cycle. The synthetic potential of this approach is shown in the straightforward conversion of the corresponding products into many valuable building blocks. We hope that the developed catalytic cycle would open up new vistas for more enantioconvergent cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>Empowering Zn Electrode Current Capability Along Interfacial Stability by Optimizing Intrinsic Safe Organic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical performances of Zn metal anodes are adjusted using functionalized ionic liquid and phosphate&#8208;based safe organic solvents, resulting in high Columbic efficiency (CE) of over 99&#8201;%, long cycle life up to 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and large areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The interface derived from ionic liquid effectively accelerates the Zn nucleation, ensures smooth deposition, and reduces side reactions.

Metallic Zn is one of the most promising anodes, but its practical application has been hindered by dendritic growth and serious interfacial reactions in conventional electrolytes. Herein, ionic liquids are adopted to prepare intrinsically safe electrolytes via combining with TEP or TMP solvents. With this synergy effect, the blends of TEP/TMP with an IL fraction of &#8776;25&#8197;wt% are found to be promising electrolytes, with ionic conductivities comparable to those of standard phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes while electrochemical stabilities are considerably improved; over 1000&#8197;h at 2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and &#8776;350&#8197;h at 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a large areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The use of functionalized IL turns out to be a key factor in enhancing the Zn2+ transport due to the interaction of Zn2+ ions with IL&#8208;zincophilic sites resulting in reduced interfacial resistance between the electrodes and electrolyte upon cycling leading to spongy&#8208;like highly porous, homogeneous, and dendrite&#8208;free zinc as an anode material.

&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical performances of Zn metal anodes are adjusted using functionalized ionic liquid and phosphate-based safe organic solvents, resulting in high Columbic efficiency (CE) of over 99&#8201;%, long cycle life up to 5.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and large areal capacity of 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Fine Pore&#8208;Structure Engineering by Ligand Conformational Control of Naphthalene Diimide&#8208;Based Semiconducting Porous Coordination Polymers for Efficient Chemiresistive Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated 3D naphthalene diimide (NDI) based conductive porous coordination polymers (PCPs) with tunable conductivity and pore structure are developed as chemiresistors for room&#8208;temperature gas sensors. The Zn&#8722;pyNDI can serve as a room&#8208;temperature operable chemiresistive sensor selective to acetone.







Abstract
Exploring new porous coordination polymers (PCPs) that have tunable structure and conductivity is attractive but remains challenging. Herein, fine pore structure engineering by ligand conformation control of naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;based semiconducting PCPs with &#960; stacking&#8208;dependent conductivity tunability is achieved. The &#960; stacking distances and ligand conformation in these isoreticular PCPs were modulated by employing metal centers with different coordination geometries. As a result, three conjugated PCPs (Co&#8722;pyNDI, Ni&#8722;pyNDI, and Zn&#8722;pyNDI) with varying pore structure and conductivity were obtained. Their crystal structures were determined by three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction. The through&#8208;space charge transfer and tunable pore structure in these PCPs result in modulated selectivity and sensitivity in gas sensing. Zn&#8722;pyNDI can serve as a room&#8208;temperature operable chemiresistive sensor selective to acetone.

         <title>Electrophoresis&#8208;Assisted Multilayer Assembly of Nanoparticles for Sensitive Lateral Flow Immunoassay
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a universal approach for reducing the limit of detection of lateral flow immunoassay. This approach utilizes electrophoresis&#8208;driven migration of biotin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles for layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of aggregates directly on the test strip. As a result, a 60&#8208;times lower limit of detection of hepatitis B antigen is achieved.







Abstract
Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a rapid, simple, and inexpensive point&#8208;of&#8208;need method. A major limitation of LFIA is a high limit of detection (LOD), which impacts its diagnostic sensitivity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a signal&#8208;enhancement procedure that is performed after completing LFIA and involves controllably moving biotin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles by electrophoresis. The nanoparticles link to immunocomplexes forming multilayer aggregates on the test strip, thus, enhancing the signal. Here, we demonstrate lowering the LOD of hepatitis B surface antigen from approximately 8 to 0.12&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1, making it clinically acceptable. Testing 118 clinical samples for hepatitis B showed that signal enhancement increased the diagnostic sensitivity of LFIA from 73&#8201;% to 98&#8201;% while not affecting its 95&#8201;% specificity. Electrophoresis&#8208;driven enhancement of LFIA is universal (antigen&#8208;independent), takes two minutes, and can be performed by an untrained person.

         <title>Inlaying Bismuth Nanoparticles on Graphene Nanosheets by Chemical Bond for Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Aqueous Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reinforcing bismuth nanoparticles on laser&#8208;induced graphene nanosheets were introduced for an electrically rechargeable aqueous sodium&#8208;ion battery for the first time, which could achieve long&#8208;term operation stability based on a chemical anchoring effect.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) are rising as an important alternative to lithium ion batteries, owing to their safety and low cost. Metal anodes show a high theoretical capacity and nonselective hydrated ion insertion for ASIBs, yet their large volume expansion and sluggish reaction kinetics resulted in poor electrochemical stability. Herein, we demonstrate an electrode cyclability enhancement mechanism by inlaying bismuth (Bi) nanoparticles on graphene nanosheets through chemical bond, which is achieved by a unique laser induced compounding method. This anchored metal&#8208;graphene heterostructure can effectively mitigate volume variation, and accelerate the kinetic capability as the active Bi can be exposed to the electrolyte. Our method can achieve a reversible capacity of 122&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a large current density of 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for over 9500 cycles. This finding offers a desirable structural design of other metal anodes for aqueous energy storage systems.

         <title>Reversible Dihydrogen Activation and Catalytic H/D Exchange with Group 10 Heterometallic Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a hexagonal planar palladium complex having a [PdMg3H3] core with H2 is reversible and leads to the formation of a new [PdMg2H4] tetrahydride species. DFT calculations support a mechanism for H2 activation involving a ligand&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to Pd. These findings were exploited to develop a catalytic protocol for H/D exchange into magnesium hydride and zinc hydride bonds.







Abstract
Reaction of a hexagonal planar palladium complex featuring a [PdMg3H3] core with H2 is reversible and leads to the formation of a new [PdMg2H4] tetrahydride species alongside an equivalent of a magnesium hydride co&#8208;product [MgH]. While the reversibility of this process prevented isolation of [PdMg2H4], analogous [PtMg2H4] and [PtZn2H4] complexes could be isolated and characterised through independent syntheses. Computational analysis (DFT, AIM, NCIPlot) of the bonding in a series of heterometallic tetrahydride compounds (Ni&#8211;Pt; Mg and Zn) suggests that these complexes are best described as square planar with marginal metal&#8208;metal interactions; the strength of which increases slightly as group 10 is descended and increases from Mg to Zn. DFT calculations support a mechanism for H2 activation involving a ligand&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to Pd. These findings were exploited to develop a catalytic protocol for H/D exchange into magnesium hydride and zinc hydride bonds.

         <title>Intertwining Olefin Thianthrenation with Kornblum/Ganem Oxidations: Ene&#8208;type Oxidation to Furnish &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free double oxidation of unactivated alkenes has been developed to deliver unsaturated conjugated carbonyls. This practical procedure allows valorization of the olefinic feedstock with high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity as demonstrated by the syntheses of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access building blocks and industrially relevant pheromones and kairomones.







Abstract
A widely applicable, practical, and scalable synthetic method for efficient ene&#8208;type double oxidation of alkenes is reported via a two&#8208;step alkenyl thianthrenium umpolung/Kornblum&#8208;Ganem oxidation strategy. This chemo&#8208; and stereoselective procedure allows easy access to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls that may be otherwise difficult or cumbersome to synthesize by conventional methods. For &#945;&#8208;olefins, this metal&#8208;free transformation can be tuned according to synthetic needs to produce either the elusive (Z)&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes or their (E) counterparts. Moreover, this strategy has enabled streamlined synthesis of distinct butadienyl pheromones and kairomones.

         <title>A Highly Compatible Phototrophic Community for Carbon&#8208;Negative Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly compatible phototrophic community (HCPC) was developed through the integration of a CO2 sequestration module and a super&#8208;coupled module, V. natriegens. Based on the HCPC platform, various chemicals could be directly synthesized from CO2, enabling the overall release of &#8722;22.27 to &#8722;606.59&#8197;kgCO2e&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in the end products. This study provides design guidance for photosynthetic communities and new opportunities for carbon&#8208;negative production.







Abstract
CO2 sequestration engineering is promising for carbon&#8208;negative biosynthesis, and artificial communities can solve more complex problems than monocultures. However, obtaining an ideal photosynthetic community is still a great challenge. Herein, we describe the development of a highly compatible photosynthetic community (HCPC) by integrating a sucrose&#8208;producing CO2 sequestration module and a super&#8208;coupled module. The cyanobacteria CO2 sequestration module was obtained using stepwise metabolic engineering and then coupled with the efficient sucrose utilization module Vibrio natriegens. Integrated omics analysis indicated that enhanced photosynthetic electron transport and extracellular vesicles promote intercellular communication. Additionally, the HCPC was used to channel CO2 into valuable chemicals, enabling the overall release of &#8722;22.27 to &#8722;606.59&#8197;kgCO2e&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in the end products. This novel light&#8208;driven community could facilitate circular economic implementation in the future.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Presodiation with Sodium Diphenyl Ketone towards Ultra&#8208;stable Hard Carbon Anodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium diphenyl ketone is applied as a reducing reagent to compensate irreversible Na uptake at oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups and react with defective carbon for quasi&#8208;metallic Na to initiate robust SEI. It leads to ICE of 99.2&#8201;% and capacity retention of &#8776;100&#8201;% for 700&#8197;cycles in the full cells of presodiated hard carbon//Na3V2(PO4)3.







Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) is a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, yet still suffers from low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, sodium diphenyl ketone (Na&#8208;DK) is applied to realize dual&#8208;function presodiation for HC anodes. It compensates the irreversible Na uptake at the oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups and reacts with carbon defects of five/seven&#8208;membered rings for quasi&#8208;metallic sodium in HC. The as&#8208;formed sodium induces robust NaF&#8208;rich SEI on HC in 1.0&#8197;M NaPF6 in diglyme, favoring the interfacial reaction kinetics and stable Na+ insertion and extraction. This renders the presodiated HC (pHC) with high ICE of &#8776;100&#8201;% and capacity retention of 82.4&#8201;% after 6800&#8197;cycles. It is demonstrated to couple with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes in full cells to show high capacity retention of &#8776;100&#8201;% after 700&#8197;cycles. This work provides in&#8208;depth understanding of chemical presodiation and a new strategy for highly stable sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Deaminative Hydroxylation of Aminoheterocycles and Electron&#8208;Deficient Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 2, January 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a user friendly, scalable and safe procedure to convert aminoheterocycles to their hydroxylated analogues with a pyrylium tetrafluoroborate salt in combination with a hydroxamic acid. The protocol is characterized by a broad functional group tolerance, permitting the selective modification of biorelevant molecules. Mechanistic experiments allowed the identification of key intermediates involved throughout the transformation.







Abstract
Among the tools available to chemists for drug design of bioactive compounds, the bioisosteric replacement of atoms or groups of atoms is the cornerstone of modern strategies. Despite the undeniable interest in amino&#8208;to&#8208;hydroxyl interchange, enzymatic deaminative hydroxylation remains unmatched. Herein, we report a user friendly and safe procedure to selectively convert aminoheterocycles to their hydroxylated analogues by means of a simple pyrylium tetrafluoroborate salt. The hydroxylation step relies on a Lossen&#8208;type rearrangement under mild conditions thus avoiding the use of strong hydroxide bases. In addition to biorelevant heterocycles, the deaminative hydroxylation of electron&#8208;deficient anilines was also demonstrated. Finally, mechanistic experiments allowed the identification of the key intermediates, thus unveiling a rather unusual mechanism for this formal aromatic substitution.

     alt="Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Hasubanan Alkaloids: Periglaucines A&#8211;C, N,O-Dimethyloxostephine and Oxostephabenine"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric total synthesis of the hasubanan alkaloids periglaucines A&#8211;C, &lt;i&gt;N,O&lt;/i&gt;-dimethyloxostephine and oxostephabenine is described. The key strategies include: 1)&#8197;a Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed regio- and diastereoselective Hayashi-Miyaura reaction; 2)&#8197;an intramolecular photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (PEDA) reaction; and 3)&#8197;bio-inspired intramolecular Michael addition and transannular acetalization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein the asymmetric total synthesis of periglaucines A&#8211;C, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-dimethyloxostephine and oxostephabenine. The key strategies used include: 1)&#8197;a Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed regio- and diastereoselective Hayashi-Miyaura reaction to connect two necessary fragments; 2)&#8197;an intramolecular photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (PEDA) reaction to construct the highly functionalized tricyclic core skeleton bearing a quaternary center; 3)&#8197;a bio-inspired intramolecular Michael addition and transannular acetalization to generate the aza[4.4.3]propellane and the tetrahydrofuran ring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Surface Electric Conductivity for High&#8208;Rate LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cathode materials work as the host framework for both Li+ diffusion and electron transport in Li&#8208;ion batteries. The Li+ diffusion property is always the research focus, while the electron transport property is less studied. Herein, we propose a unique strategy to elevate the rate performance through promoting the surface electric conductivity. Specifically, a disordered rock&#8208;salt phase was coherently constructed at the surface of LiCoO2, promoting the surface electric conductivity by over one magnitude. It increased the effective voltage (Veff) imposed in the bulk, thus driving more Li+ extraction/insertion and making LiCoO2exhibit superior rate capability (154 mA h g&#8208;1 at 10 C), and excellent cycling performance (93% after 1000 cycles at 10 C). The universality of this strategy was confirmed by another surface design and a simulation. Our findings provide a new angle for developing high&#8208;rate cathode materials by tuning the surface electron transport property.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Kinetics via Intermediates by Time&#8208;Dependent Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Facile evaluation of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics for massive electrocatalysts is critical for sustainable fuel cells development and industrial H2O2 production. Despite great success in ORR studies by mainstream strategies, such as membrane electrode assembly, rotation electrode technique and advanced surfacesensitive spectroscopy, the time and spatial distribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) intermediates in the diffusion layer is still unknown. By time&#8208;dependent electrochemiluminescence (Td&#8208;ECL), here we report an intermediate&#8208;oriented methodology for ORR kinetics analysis. Thanks to multiple ultra&#8208;sensitive stoichiometric reactions between ROS and the ECL emitter, except for electron transfer numbers and rate constants, the potential&#8208;dependent time and spatial distribution of ROS was successfully obtained for the first time. Such uncovered exclusive information would guide electrocatalysts for fuel cells and H2O2 production with maximized activity and durability. This work would pave the exploration of not only the fundamentals of unambiguous ORR mechanism but also the durability of electrocatalysts for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen&#8208;deficient molybdenum oxide (MoOX) nanomaterials are prepared as novel nanosensitizers and TME&#8208;stimulants for ultrasound (US)&#8208;enhanced cancer metallo&#8208;immunotherapy. After PEGylation, MoOX&#8208;PEG exhibits efficient capability for US&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Under US irradiation, MoOX&#8208;PEG generates massive ROS to induce cancer cell damage and strong immunogenic cell death (ICD), which can effectively suppress tumor growth. More importantly, MoOX&#8208;PEG itself further stimulated the dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and triggered the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to enhance the immunological effect. Due to the robust ICD induced by SDT and efficient DC maturation stimulated by MoOX&#8208;PEG, the combination treatment of MoOX&#8208;triggered SDT and aCTLA&#8208;4 further amplifies anti&#8208;tumor therapy, inhibits cancer metastases, and elicits robust immune responses to effectively defeat abscopal tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Frozen Electrolyte Structure with Colloidal Dispersion for Low Temperature Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte freezing under low temperatures is a critical issue for the development of aqueous batteries (ABs). While lowering the freezing point of the electrolyte has caught major research efforts, limited attention has been paid to the structural evolution during the electrolyte freezing process and regulating the frozen electrolyte structure for low temperature ABs. Here, we reveal the formation process of interconnected liquid regions for ion transport in frozen electrolytes with various in situ variable&#8208;temperature technologies. More importantly, the low&#8208;temperature performance of ABs was significantly improved with the colloidal electrolyte design using graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs), which effectively inhibits the growth of ice crystals and expands the interconnected liquid regions for facial ion transport. This work provides new insights and a promising strategy for the electrolyte design of low&#8208;temperature ABs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The Night Watch, painted in 1642 and on view in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, is considered Rembrandt&#8217;s most famous work. X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (XRPD) mapping at multiple length scales revealed the unusual presence of lead(II) formate, Pb(HCOO)2, in several areas of the painting. Until now, this compound was never reported in historical oil paints. In order to get insights into this phenomenon, one possible chemical pathway was explored thanks to the preparation and micro&#8208;analysis of model oil paint media prepared by heating linseed oil and lead(II) oxide (PbO) drier as described in 17th century recipes. Synchrotron radiation based micro&#8208;XRPD (SR&#8208;&#181;&#8208;XRPD) and infrared microscopy were combined to identify and map at the micro&#8208;scale various neo&#8208;formed lead&#8208;based compounds in these model samples. Both lead(II) formate and lead(II) formate hydroxide Pb(HCOO)(OH) were detected and mapped, providing new clues regarding the reactivity of lead driers in oil matrices in historical paintings.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Asymmetric Core Optimizes Crystal Packing to Enable Selenophene&#8208;based Acceptor with Over 18% Efficiency in Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Side&#8208;chain tailoring is a promising method to optimize the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, asymmetric alkyl chain&#8208;based small molecular acceptors (SMAs) are still difficult to afford. Herein, we adopted a novel asymmetric n&#8208;nonyl/undecyl substitution strategy and synthesized two A&#8208;D1A&#8217;D2&#8208;A double asymmetric isomeric SMAs with asymmetric selenophene&#8208;based central core for OSCs. Crystallographic analysis indicates that AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl forms a more compact and order intermolecular packing compared to AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl, which contributed to higher electron mobility in neat AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl film. Moreover, the PM6:AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl blend film shows a better morphology with appropriate phase separation and distinct face&#8208;on orientation than PM6:AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl. The OSCs with PM6:AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl obtain a superior PCE of 18.12% compared to PM6:AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl (17.52%), which is the best efficiency for the selenium&#8208;incorporated SMAs in binary BHJ OSCs. Our findings elucidate that the promising double asymmetric strategy with isomeric alkyl chains precisely modulates the crystal packing and enhances the photovoltaic efficiency of selenophene&#8208;incorporated SMAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Gaseous Nitrogen Oxides Catholyte for Rechargeable Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a strong interest in finding highly soluble redox compounds to improve the energy density of redox flow batteries (RFBs). Nonetheless, the performance of electrolytes is often negatively influenced by high solute concentration due to the accelerated cross&#8208;contamination and increased viscosity. Herein, we designed a high&#8208;potential (0.5 V vs Ag/Ag+) catholyte for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries, where the charged and discharged species are both gaseous (N2O3 and NO&#8226;). In principle, these species can be liberated from the liquid electrolyte and stored in a separate gas container, allowing scale&#8208;up of storage capacity without increasing the volume of solvents or the concentration of the redox&#8208;active solute. Electrochemical and spectroscopic studies confirm that (a) the oxidation of NO&#8226; in the presence of NO3&#8208; electrolyte affords N2O3, and (b) reduction of N2O3 regenerates NO&#8226; and NO3&#8208;. The combination of these two half&#8208;reactions afford a rechargeable NOx electrode reaction: NO3&#8208; + 3NO &#8652; 2 N2O3 + e&#8208; with a low mass/charge ratio of 152 grams per mole of stored electron. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept NOx symmetric H&#8208;cell shows 200 stable cycles over 400 hours with &gt;97% Coulombic efficiency and negligible capacity decay.</dc:description>

         <title>Urethanases for the enzymatic hydrolysis of low molecular weight carbamates and the recycling of polyurethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic degradation and recycling can reduce the environmental impact of plastics. Despite decades of research, no enzymes for the efficient hydrolysis of polyurethanes have been reported. Whereas the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in polyester&#8208;polyurethanes by cutinases is known, the urethane bonds in polyether&#8208;polyurethanes have remained inaccessible to biocatalytic hydrolysis. Here we report the discovery of urethanases from a metagenome library constructed from soil that had been exposed to polyurethane waste for many years. We then demonstrate the use of a urethanase in a chemoenzymatic process for polyurethane foam recycling. The urethanase hydrolyses low molecular weight dicarbamates resulting from chemical glycolysis of polyether&#8208;polyurethane foam, making this strategy broadly applicable to diverse polyether&#8208;polyurethane wastes.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Probe of Electrochemical Pseudocapacitive pH Jump at a Graphene Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular&#8208;level insight into interfacial water at a buried electrode interface is essential in electrochemistry, but spectroscopic probing of the interface remains challenging. Here, using surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detected sum&#8208;frequency generation (HD&#8208;SFG) spectroscopy, we directly access the interfacial water in contact with the graphene electrode supported on calcium fluoride (CaF2). We find phase transition&#8208;like variations of the HD&#8208;SFG spectra vs. applied potential, which arises not from the charging/discharging of graphene but from the charging/discharging of the CaF2 substrate through the pseudocapacitive process. The potential&#8208;dependent spectra are nearly identical to the pH&#8208;dependent spectra, evidencing that the pseudocapacitive behavior is associated with a substantial local pH change induced by water dissociation between the CaF2 and graphene. Our work evidences the local molecular&#8208;level effects of pseudocapacitive charging at an electrode/aqueous electrolyte interface.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by a Fluorinated Cyclic Ether with a Low Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte engineering is crucial for developing high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMB). Here, we synthesized two cosolvents methyl bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (MFSI) and 3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorotetrahydrofuran (TFF) with significantly different reduction potentials and add them into LiFSI&#8208;DME electrolytes. The LiFSI/TFF&#8208;DME electrolyte gave an average Li Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.41% over 200 cycles, while the average Li CEs for MFSI&#8208;based electrolyte is only 98.62%. Additionally, the TFF&#8208;based electrolytes exhibited a more reversible performance than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fluorinated 1,4&#8208;dimethoxylbutane electrolyte in both Li||Cu half&#8208;cell and anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full cell. More importantly, the decomposition product from bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion could react with ether solvent, which destroyed the SEI, thus decreasing cell performance. These key discoveries provide new insights into the rational design of electrolyte solvents and cosolvents for LMB.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction of Sulfur Dioxide to Sulfur Monoxide by Ferrous Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of SO2 to fixed forms of sulfur can address the growing concerns regarding its detrimental effect on health and environment as well as enable its valorization into valuable chemicals. The naturally occurring heme enzyme sulfite reductase (SiR) is known to reduce SO2 to H2S and is an integral part of the global sulfur cycle. However, its action is not yet mimicked in artificial systems outside of the protein matrix even after several decades of structural elucidation of the enzyme. While the coordination of SO2 to transition metals are documented, its reduction using molecular catalysts has remained elusive. Here reduction of SO2 by iron (II) tetraphenyl porphyrin is demonstrated. A combination of spectroscopic data backed up by theoretical calculations indicate that FeIITPP reduces SO2 by 2e&#8208;/2H+ to form an intermediate [FeIII&#8208;SO]+ species, also proposed for SiR, which releases SO. The SO obtained from the chemical reduction of SO2 could be evidenced in the form of a cheletropic adduct of butadiene resulting in an organic sulfoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>SASSY NMR: Simultaneous Solid and Solution spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergism between different phases gives rise to chemical, biological or environmental reactivity, thus it is increasingly important to study samples intact. Here, SASSY (SimultAneous Solid and Solution spectroscopY) is introduced to simultaneously observe (and differentiate) all phases in multiphase samples using standard, solid&#8208;state NMR equipment. When monitoring processes, the traditional approach of studying solids and liquids sequentially, can lead to information in the non&#8208;observed phase being missed. SASSY solves this by observing the full range of materials, from crystalline solids, through gels, to pure liquids, at full sensitivity in every scan. Results are identical to running separate 13C CP&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state and 13C solution&#8208;state experiments back&#8208;to&#8208;back but requires only a fraction of the spectrometer time. After its introduction, SASSY is applied to process monitoring and finally to detect all phases in a living freshwater shrimp. SASSY is simple to implement and thus should find application across all areas of research.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries are promising candidates for safe energy&#8208;storage systems due to non&#8208;flammable solid electrolytes and the possibility to use metallic lithium as an anode. Thus, there is a challenge to design new solid electrolytes and to understand the principles of ion conduction on an atomic scale. We report on a new concept for compounds with high lithium ion mobility based on a rigid open&#8208;framework boron structure. The host&#8208;guest structure Li6B18(Li3N) com&#173;prises large hexagonal pores filled with Li7N] strands that represent a perfect cutout from the structure of a&#8208;Li3N. Variable&#8208;temperature 7Li NMR spectroscopy reveals a very high Li mobility in the template phase with a remarkably low activation energy below 19&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1 and thus much lower than pristine Li3N. The formation of the solid solution of Li6B18(Li3N) and Li6B18(Li2O) over the complete compositional range allows the tuning of lithium defects in the template structure that is not possible for pristine Li3N and Li2O.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Formation Mechanism and Optimizing the Synthesis Conditions of Layered Double Hydroxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), whose formation is strongly related to OH&#8208; concentration, have attracted significant interest in various fields. However, the effect of the real&#8208;time change of OH&#8208; concentration on LDHs&#8217; formation has not been fully explored due to the unsuitability of the existing synthesis methods for in situ characterization. Here, the deliberately designed combination of NH3 gas diffusion and in situ pH measurement provides a solution to the above problem. The obtained results revealed the formation mechanism and also guided us to synthesize a library of LDHs with the desired attributes in water at room temperature without using any additives. After evaluating their oxygen evolution reaction performance, we found that FeNi&#8208;LDH with a Fe/Ni ratio of 25/75 exhibits one of the best performances so far reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Robust Microporous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Ethylene Purification under&#160;Dry and Humid Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two C2H6&#8208;selective metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents with ultrahigh stability, high surface areas, and suitable pore size have been designed and synthesized for one&#8208;step separation of ethane/ethylene (C2H6/C2H4) under humid conditions to produce polymer&#8208;grade pure C2H4. Experimental results reveal that these two MOFs not only adsorb a high amount of C2H6 but also display good C2H6/C2H4 selectivity verified by fixed bed column breakthrough experiments. Most importantly, the good water stability and hydrophobic pore environments make these two MOFs capable of efficiently separating C2H6/C2H4 under humid conditions, exhibiting the benchmark performance among all reported adsorbents for separation of C2H6/C2H4 under humid conditions. Moreover, the affinity sites and their static adsorption energies were successfully revealed by single crystal data and computation studies. Adsorbents described in this work can be used to address major chemical industrial challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrete Molecular Copper(II) Complex for Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Above Room&#8208;Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing robust, wearable, and biocompatible energy harvesting devices with bulk oxides (ceramics and perovskites) is extremely hard to achieve due to their zero mechanical flexibility, heavy metal toxicity, and tunability of properties. Alternatively, discrete inorganic complexes can be an excellent choice to overcome the above&#8208;stated issues, thanks to appropriate molecular engineering. Herein, we report an above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric discrete molecular complex [Cu(L&#8208;phe)(bpy)(H2O)]PF6.H2O (1) which is suitable for piezoelectric energy harvesting due to its large values of piezoelectric co&#8208;efficient (d33= 10 pm/V) and spontaneous polarization (Ps= 1.3 &#956;C/cm2). Among the devices prepared with the composite films of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and various weight % composition of 1, the 10 Wt % composite shows the highest output voltage of 8 V, a power density of 0.85 &#956;W/cm2, and output current of 5 &#956;A, which is highest for any discrete inorganic complex reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Biochemical Characterization, and Genetic Encoding of a 1,2,4&#8208;Triazole Amino Acid as an Acetyllysine Mimic for Bromodomains of the BET Family</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine acetylation is a charge&#8208;neutralizing post&#8208;translational modification of proteins bound by bromodomains (Brds). A 1,2,4&#8208;triazole amino acid (ApmTri) was established as acetyllysine (Kac) mimic recruiting Brds of the BET family in contrast to glutamine commonly used for simulating this modification. Optimization of triazole substituents and side chain spacing allowed BET Brd recruitment to ApmTri&#8208;containing peptides with affinities similar to native substrates. Crystal structures of ApmTri&#8208;containing peptides in complex with two BET Brds revealed the binding mode which mirrored that of Kac ligands. ApmTri was genetically encoded and recombinant ApmTri&#8208;containing proteins co&#8208;enriched BRD3(2) from cellular lysates. This interaction was blocked by BET inhibitor JQ1. With genetically encoded ApmTri, biochemistry is now provided with a stable Kac mimic reflecting charge neutralization and Brd recruitment, allowing new investigations into BET proteins in vitro and in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Doping in Flexible Organic Crystals for Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic single crystals (OSCs) with excellent flexible behavior and unique optical properties are of great importance due to their broad applicability in optical/optoelectronic devices and sensors. Nevertheless, fabricating flexible OSCs with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains a great challenge. Herein, we propose a host&#8208;guest doping strategy to achieve both the RTP and flexible properties of OSCs. The single&#8208;stranded crystal is highly bendable upon external force and able to immediately return to its original straight shape after the removal of stress, impressively emitting bright deep&#8208;red phosphorescence. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the bright RTP arises from F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the triphenylene molecules to the dopants. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a universal approach for the preparation of flexible OSCs with RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>Charges&#8208;Enhanced Molybdenum Disulfide Nanozyme Activity for Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Cascade&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deficient catalytic activity of nanozyme and insufficient endogenous H2O2 in tumor microenvironment (TME) are major obstacles for nanozyme&#8208;mediated catalytic tumor therapy. Herein, since electron transfer is the basic essence of catalysis&#8208;mediated redox reaction, we explored the contributing factors of enzymatic activity based on positive and negative charges, which are experimentally and theoretically demonstrated to enhance the peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity of MoS2 nanozyme. Hence, an acidic TME&#8208;responsive and ultrasound&#8208;mediated cascade nanocatalyst (BTO/MoS2@CA) is presented by making few&#8208;layer MoS2 nanosheets grown on the surface of piezoelectric tetragonal barium titanate (T&#8208;BTO) and modified with pH&#8208;responsive cinnamaldehyde (CA). The integration of pH&#8208;responsive CA&#8208;mediated H2O2 self&#8208;supply, ultrasound&#8208;mediated charges enhanced enzymatic activity and GSH depletion enables out&#8208;of&#8208;balance redox homeostasis, leading to effective tumor ferroptosis with minimal side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermally Triggered Copper Payload Release for Cuproptosis&#8208;Promoted Cancer Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cuproptosis is a new form of programmed cell death and exhibits enormous potential in cancer treatment. However, reducing the undesirable Cu ion release in normal tissue and maximizing the Cu&#8208;induced therapeutic effect in cancer sites are two main challenges. Herein, we constructed a photothermally triggered nanoplatform (Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF) to realize the on&#8208;demand delivery for synergistic therapy. The released DSF chelated with Cu2+ in situ to generate the high cytotoxic bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)&#8208;copper (CuET) causing cell apoptosis and formed Cu+ species promoting toxic mitochondrial protein aggregation, leading to cell cuproptosis. Synergistic with photothermal therapy, the Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF could effectively kill the tumor cell and inhibit tumor growth (inhibition rate up to 80.1%). These results provide a promising perspective for potential cancer treatment based on cuproptosis, and also inspire the design of advanced nano&#8208;therapeutic platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>A Collaboration for Guiding the Rational Design of Multielement Solid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;After finishing two weeks of quarantine during a typical Finnish winter &#8230; we succeeded to have the setup working and perform a wide range of studies &#8230; Overall, the visits of Nina turned out to be challenging due to the special times, but also rewarding from a professional as well as cultural and social point of life.&#8221; Find out more about the collaboration of Bert Weckhuysen and his co&#8208;workers in their Team Profile.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis group, Department of Chemistry, University of Utrecht, the Netherlands; X&#8208;ray Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Helsinki, Finland; Laboratory of Inorganic Chemistry, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Z&#252;rich, Switzerland; Center for Materials Science and Nanotechnology, Department of Physics, University of Oslo, Norway; and Catalysis Research Center, Department of Chemistry, University of Oslo, Norway.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Laboratory of Electrochemistry, Electroanalytic, and Sensor Development (LEEDS), Department of Analytical Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas, Brazil. They recently published an article about the origin of the zeta potential on an aqueous graphite dispersion prepared without passivating agents, with a minimal number of functional groups, and using concentrated ammonium hydroxide. Ammonia transfers electrons to graphite and raises the Fermi level of the carbon material above the original value. This electron excess generates the negative zeta potential, therefore it accounts for colloidal stability. &#8220;The Electronic Origin of the Zeta Potential is Supported by the Redox Mechanism on an Aqueous Dispersion of Exfoliated Graphite&#8221;, J.&#8197;P.&#8197;V.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immobilization of porphyrin complexes into crystalline metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) enables high exposure of porphyrin active sites for CO2 electroreduction. Herein, well&#8208;dispersed iron&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based MOF (PCN&#8208;222(Fe)) on carbon&#8208;based electrodes revealed optimal turnover frequencies for CO2 electroreduction to CO at 1 wt.% catalyst loading, beyond which the intrinsic catalyst activity declined due to CO2 mass transport limitations. In situ Raman suggested that PCN&#8208;222(Fe) maintained its structure under electrochemical bias, permitting mechanistic investigations. These revealed a stepwise electron transfer&#8211;proton transfer mechanism for CO2 electroreduction on PCN&#8208;222(Fe) electrodes, which followed a shift from a rate&#8208;limiting electron transfer to CO2 mass transfer as the potential increased from &#8208;0.6 V to &#8208;1.0 V vs. RHE. Our results demonstrate how intrinsic catalytic investigations and in situ spectroscopy are needed to elucidate CO2 electroreduction mechanisms on PCN&#8208;222(Fe) MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning Informs RNA&#8208;Binding Chemical Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecule targeting of RNA has emerged as a new frontier in medicinal chemistry, but compared to the protein targeting literature our understanding of chemical matter that binds to RNA is limited. In this study, we reported Repository Of BInders to Nucleic acids (ROBIN), a new library of nucleic acid binders identified by small molecule microarray (SMM) screening. The complete results of 36 individual nucleic acid SMM screens against a library of 24,572 small molecules were reported (including a total of 1,627,072 interactions assayed). A set of 2,003 RNA&#8208;binding small molecules was identified, representing the largest fully public, experimentally derived library of its kind to date. Machine learning was used to develop highly predictive and interpretable models to characterize RNA&#8208;binding molecules. This work demonstrates that machine learning algorithms applied to experimentally derived sets of RNA binders are a powerful method to inform RNA&#8208;targeted chemical space.</dc:description>

The biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 is identified and the pathway is characterized by heterologous expression. We characterized a haloacid dehalogenase&#8208;like terpene cyclase AncC that biosynthesizes the drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;albicanol (2) from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Biochemical characterization of AncC, including kinetic studies and mutagenesis, demonstrated the functions of two domains &#8211; a terpene cyclase (TC) and a pyrophosphatase (PPase). The TC domain first cyclizes FPP to albicanoyl pyrophosphate and the PPase domain then removes the pyrophosphate forming 2. Intriguingly, AncA (94% sequence identity to AncC), in the same gene cluster, converts FPP to (R)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#947;&#8208;monocyclofarnesol instead of 2. Notably, Y283/F375 in the TC domain of AncA serve as a gatekeeper in controlling the formation of cyclofarnesoid rather than drimane&#8208;type scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Circular upcycling of bottlebrush thermosets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inability to re&#8208;process thermosets hinders their utility and sustainability. An ideal material should be able to combine both closed&#8208;loop recycling and upcycling capabilities, thus providing a circular materials platform. This concept is realized in bottlebrush thermosets through dynamic covalent crosslinking. The polydimethylsiloxane networks described herein use thermoreversible Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions to demonstrate their ability to both reversibly disassemble into a polymer melt and/or reconfigure on&#8208;demand to an elastomer of either lower or higher stiffness. To accomplish these functions, the crosslink density was tuned by loading the functionalized networks with a controlled fraction of dormant crosslinkers and crosslinker scavengers, such as furan&#8208;capped bis&#8208;maleimide and anthracene, respectively. The resulting modulus variations precisely followed the stoichiometry of activated furan and maleimide moieties, demonstrating the lack of deleterious side reactions during reprocessing. The presented circularity concept is independent from the backbone or side chain chemistry, making it potentially applicable to a wide range of brush&#8208;like polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics and Proton Conduction of Heterogeneously Confined Imidazole in Porous Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nanoconfinement of proton carrier molecules may contribute to the lowing of their proton dissociation energy. However, the free proton transportation does not occur as easily as in liquid due to the restricted molecular motion from surface attraction. To resolve the puzzle, herein, imidazole is confined in the channels of porous coordination polymers with tunable geometries, and their electric/structural relaxations are quantified. Imidazole confined in a square&#8208;shape channels exhibits dynamics heterogeneity of core&#8208;shell&#8208;cylinder model. The core and shell layer possess faster and slower structural dynamics, respectively, when compared to the bulk imidazole. The dimensions and geometry of the nanochannels play an important role in both the shielding of the blocking effect from attractive surfaces and the frustration filling of the internal proton carrier molecules, ultimately contributing to the fast dynamics and enhanced proton conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical Training Enabled Reinforcement of Polyrotaxane&#8208;Containing Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many strategies have been developed for constructing anisotropic hydrogels, however, it remains a challenge to fabricate hydrogels with anisotropic nanocrystalline domains from intrinsically soft networks. Here, we report a naphthotube&#8208;based polyrotaxane&#8208;containing hydrogel that can be reinforced via mechanical training. During the training process, the hydrogel can adopt reorientation of polymer chains to form anisotropic structures driven by external uniaxial force. Due to the multiple hydrogen bonding sites and movable feature of naphthotube, the sliding of naphthotube on PEG chains simultaneously inducing the zipping of adjacent polymer chains to form densely anisotropic nanocrystalline domains through hydrogen bonded networks. Thus, the trained hydrogel exhibits an enhanced tension stress of ~110 kPa, which realize a remarkable enhancement of ~10 times compare to initial state. This study provides a new tactic for improving the mechanical performance of soft materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic K+ Channels Constructed by Rebuilding the Core Modules of Natural K+ Channels in an Artificial System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different types of natural K+ channels share similar core modules and cation permeability characteristics. In this study, we have developed novel artificial K+ channels by rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in artificial systems. All the channels displayed high selectivity for K+ over Na+ and exhibited a selectivity sequence of K+ &#8776; Rb+ during the transport process, which is highly consistent with the cation permeability characteristics of natural K+ channels. More importantly, these artificial channels could be efficiently inserted into cell membranes and mediate the transmembrane transport of K+, disrupting the cellular K+ homeostasis and eventually triggering the apoptosis of cells. These findings demonstrate that, by rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in artificial systems, the structures, transport behaviors, and physiological functions of natural K+ channels can be mimicked in synthetic channels.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Detection of Fe(VI) Water Oxidation Intermediates in an Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In situ detection of highly&#8208;oxidized metal intermediates is the key to identifying the active center of an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, but it remains challenging for NiFe&#8208;based catalysts in an aqueous solution under working conditions. Here, by utilizing the dynamic stability of the Fe(VI)O42&#8208; intermediates in a self&#8208;healing water oxidation cycle of NiFe&#8208;based catalyst, the highly&#8208;oxidized Fe(VI) intermediates leached into the electrolyte are directly detected by simple spectroelectrochemistry. Our results provide direct evidence that Fe is the active center in NiFe&#8208;based OER catalysts. Furthermore, it is revealed that the incorporation of Co into NiFe&#8208;based catalyst facilitates the formation of Fe(VI) active species, thus enhancing the OER activity of NiCoFe&#8208;based catalyst. The insights into the mechanisms for the sustainable generation of Fe(VI) active species in these NiFe&#8208;based catalysts lay the foundation for the design of more efficient and stable OER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;Based Chromophores with B&#8211;O&#8211;B Bridge: Facile Synthesis and Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is essential to create organic compounds that exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. Helicene&#8208;type emitters possess appealing chiroptical features, however, such NIR molecules are scarce due to a paucity of synthetic strategies. Herein, we developed a series of helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;based B&#8211;O&#8211;B bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY analogs that were synthesized conveniently. The reaction of diimino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;isoindigo with a heteroaromatic amine produced a restricted ligand cavity, which triggered off the generation of a B&#8211;O&#8211;B bridge. The B&#8211;O&#8211;B bridge led to distorted conformations that satisfy the helical requirements, resulting in excellent spectroscopic and chiroptical properties. Tunable CPL with the highest luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and a CPL brightness (BCPL = 11.5 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1) in the NIR region was achieved. This synthetic approach is expected to offer a new opportunity to chiral chemistry and increase flexibility for chiroptical tuning.</dc:description>

         <title>Propargyl Alcohols as Bifunctional Reagents for Divergent Annulations of Biphenylamines via Dual C&#8208;H Functionalization/Dual Oxidative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum leap in the field of C&#8208;H functionalization has expediently provided comprehensive solutions to access valuable molecules that previously required convoluted synthetic attempts. Dual C&#8208;H functionalization, unsymmetrically, with a single bifunctional reagent is an incisive tactic. Propargyl alcohols (PAs), despite containing reactive C&#8801;C bond, were not however explored as building blocks via oxidative cleavage. Annulations via C&#8208;H activation orchestrate versatile and synthetically attractive strategies. In this unprecedented work, we disclose PA as a new bifunctional reagent for unsymmetrical dual C&#8208;H functionalization of biphenylamine for regioselectively annulated outcomes. On tuning conditions, the annulation bifurcated towards an unusual dual oxidative cyclization. The methodology accommodates a wide range of PAs and showcases late&#8208;stage diversification of some natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Highly Regioselective Fungal Peroxygenase for the Synthesis of Hydroxy Fatty Acids</title>

         <dc:description>The hydroxylation of fatty acids&#160;is an appealing reaction in synthetic chemistry, although the lack of selective catalysts hampers its industrial implementation. Here, we have engineered a highly regioselective fungal peroxygenase for the&#160;w&#8208;1 hydroxylation of fatty acids with quenched stepwise over&#8208;oxidation. One single mutation&#160;near the Phe catalytic tripod narrowed the heme cavity, promoting a dramatic shift toward sub&#8208;terminal hydroxylation with a drop in the over&#8208;oxidation activity. While crystallographic soaking experiments and molecular dynamic simulations shed light on this unique oxidation pattern, the selective biocatalyst was produced by&#160;Pichia pastoris&#160;at 0.4 g/L in a fed&#8208;batch bioreactor and used in the&#160;preparative synthesis of 1.4 g of (w&#8208;1)&#8208;hydroxytetradecanoic acid with 95% regioselectivity and 83%&#160;ee&#160;through the (S)&#8208;enantiomer.The hydroxylation of fatty acids&#160;is an appealing reaction in synthetic chemistry, although the lack of selective catalysts hampers its industrial implementation.

         <title>Dearomatization of Biaryls through Polarity Mismatched Radical Spirocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;neutral dearomatization transforms biaryls into complex spirocycles commonly found in bioactive natural products. This polarity mismatched radical spirocyclization tolerates diverse functional groups and is applied in the regioselective synthesis of 2,4&#8208; and 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones. The first synthesis of denobilone A, a cytotoxic plant metabolite, showcases its utility to access underexplored three&#8208;dimensional chemical space.







Abstract
Dearomatization reactions involving radical cyclizations can facilitate the synthesis of complex polycyclic systems that find applications in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis. Here we employ redox&#8208;neutral photocatalysis to affect a radical spirocyclization that transforms biaryls into spirocyclic cyclohexadienones under mild reaction conditions. In a departure from previously reported methods, our work demonstrates the polarity mismatched addition of a nucleophilic radical to an electron rich arene, and allows the regioselective synthesis of 2,4&#8208; or 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones with broad functional group tolerance. By transforming biaryls into spirocycles, our methodology accesses underexplored three&#8208;dimensional chemical space, and provides an efficient means of creating quaternary spirocenters that we apply to the first synthesis of the cytotoxic plant metabolite denobilone A.

         <title>Water&#8208;Harvesting Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Gigantic Al24 Units and their Deconstruction into Molecular Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;linkage strategy to make single crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) gives porous solids with gigantic Al24 units. Selective linkage replacement rigidifies the MOFs resulting in outstanding water&#8208;harvesting behaviour. The selective linkage dissociation of the MOF provides a new route to prepare highly symmetrical clusters.







Abstract
In contrast to the vast Al&#8208;oxo molecular cluster chemistry, Al&#8208;based building units for metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) construction are limited in structural diversity and complexity. Synthesis of single crystalline MOFs based on this &#8220;hard&#8221; metal is further complicated by the poor reversibility of the Al&#8208;organic coordination linkages. Here, a strategy to employ two kinds of linkages with distinct strength&#8212;strong Al&#8208;carboxylate linkage and weak Cu&#8208;pyrazol N linkage&#8212;gives FDM&#8208;91 (FDM=Fudan Materials) with gigantic Al24&#8208;based units. After replacing the weak moieties with organic linkers post&#8208;synthetically, two new stable MOFs with exceptional water harvesting capacity (up to 0.53&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cycling performance are developed. Linkage&#8208;selective dissociation of FDM&#8208;91 further leads to the isolation of the Al24 molecular clusters. The versatile chemistry performed here to reinforce or deconstruct MOFs provides a new way to make important extended and discrete structures.

         <title>Achievements, Challenges, and Perspectives on Nitrogen Electrochemistry for Carbon&#8208;Neutral Energy Technologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed nitrogen cycle utilizing electrochemical processes can be established between N2, NH3, and HNO3. Four essential reactions constitute an overall picture of the nitrogen transformation system, which facilitates the realization of a global carbon&#8208;free green energy network, and remedies the unbalanced natural nitrogen cycle, along with the concomitant environmental crisis.







Abstract
Unrestrained anthropogenic activities have severely disrupted the global natural nitrogen cycle, causing numerous energy and environmental issues. Electrocatalytic nitrogen transformation is a feasible and promising strategy for achieving a sustainable nitrogen economy. Synergistically combining multiple nitrogen reactions can realize efficient renewable energy storage and conversion, restore the global nitrogen balance, and remediate environmental crises. Here, we provide a unique aspect to discuss the intriguing nitrogen electrochemistry by linking three essential nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds (i.e., N2, NH3, and NO3&#8722;) and integrating four essential electrochemical reactions, i.e., the nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR), nitrogen oxidation reaction (N2OR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), and ammonia oxidation reaction (NH3OR). This minireview also summarizes the acquired knowledge of rational catalyst design and underlying reaction mechanisms for these interlinked nitrogen reactions. We further underscore the associated clean energy technologies and a sustainable nitrogen&#8208;based economy.

         <title>Increasing Molecular Planarity through Donor/Side&#8208;Chain Engineering for Improved NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence Imaging and NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Therapy under 1064&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a simple strategy based on molecular planarity to design a high&#8208;performance donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;type conjugated small molecule with both intense NIR&#8208;II absorption and robust energy output. The resulting probe was used for 1064&#8197;nm laser&#8208;triggered NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging and dual&#8208;mode imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy in vivo.







Abstract
Developing conjugated small molecules (CSM) with intense NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) absorption for phototheranostic is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge due to a lack of reliable design guidelines. This study reports a high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II CSM for phototheranostic by tailoring molecular planarity. A series of CSM show bathochromic absorption extended to the NIR&#8208;II region upon the increasing thiophene number, but an excessive number of thiophene results in decreased NIR&#8208;IIa (1300&#8211;1400&#8197;nm) brightness and photothermal effects. Further introduction of terminal nonconjugated alkyl chain can enhance NIR&#8208;II absorption coefficient, NIR&#8208;IIa brightness, and photothermal effects. Mechanism studies ascribe this overall enhancement to molecular planarity stemming from the collective contribution of donor/side&#8208;chain engineering. This finding directs the design of NIR&#8208;II CSM by rational manipulating molecular planarity to perform 1064&#8197;nm mediated phototheranostic at high efficiency.

         <title>Highly Selective Transmembrane Transport of Exogenous Lithium Ions through Rationally Designed Supramolecular Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial Li+ channels composed of pore&#8208;forming small aromatic molecules show almost exclusive transport of exogenous lithium ions over major physiological cations, with a Li+/Na+ selectivity ratio of 23.0. This highly selective Li+ channel may become an important tool for studying the physiological role of intracellular lithium ions.







Abstract
Lithium ions have been applied in the clinic in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. In this work, we report artificial supramolecular lithium channels composed of pore&#8208;containing small aromatic molecules. By adjusting the lumen size and coordination numbers, we found that one of the supramolecular channels developed shows unprecedented transmembrane transport of exogenous lithium ions with a Li+/Na+ selectivity ratio of 23.0, which is in the same level of that of natural Na+ channels. Furthermore, four coordination sites inside channels are found to be the basic requirement for ion transport function. Importantly, this artificial lithium channel displays very low transport of physiological Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions. This highly selective Li+ channel may become an important tool for studying the physiological role of intracellular lithium ions, especially in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

         <title>Recent Advances in Oral and Transdermal Protein Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein and peptide therapies are expanding for disease treatment, and the development of non&#8208;invasive or mini&#8208;invasive delivery systems is essential to improve patient compliance and therapeutic outcomes. This review provides an overview of recent advances in materials, formulations, and technologies developed to overcome biological barriers to the oral and transdermal delivery of proteins.







Abstract
Protein and peptide drugs are predominantly administered by injection to achieve high bioavailability, but this greatly compromises patient compliance. Oral and transdermal drug delivery with minimal invasiveness and high adherence represent attractive alternatives to injection administration. However, oral and transdermal administration of bioactive proteins must overcome biological barriers, namely the gastrointestinal and skin barriers, respectively. The rapid development of new materials and technologies promises to address these physiological obstacles. This review provides an overview of the latest advances in oral and transdermal protein delivery, including chemical strategies, synthetic nanoparticles, medical microdevices, and biomimetic systems for oral administration, as well as chemical enhancers, physical approaches, and microneedles in transdermal delivery. We also discuss challenges and future perspectives of the field with a focus on innovation and translation.

         <title>Ligand Dilution Analysis Facilitates Aptamer Binding Characterization at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily implemented membrane&#8208;receptor&#8208;analysis method termed ligand dilution analysis, combining the concepts of single&#8208;molecule localization and random sampling, is reported. Aptamer binding characterization, including receptor density calculation, single&#8208;molecule colocalization, binding site determination, motion and fluctuation analysis, is performed with minimal probe and instrument requirements.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;specific aptamers offer a powerful tool to study membrane receptors at the single&#8208;molecule level. Most target receptors of aptamers are highly expressed on the cell surface, but difficult to analyze in situ because of dense distribution and fast velocity. Therefore, we herein propose a random sampling&#8208;based analysis strategy termed ligand dilution analysis (LDA) for easily implemented aptamer&#8208;based receptor study. Receptor density on the cell surface can be calculated based on a regression model. By using a synergistic ligand dilution design, colocalization and differentiation of aptamer and monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding on a single receptor can be realized. Once this is accomplished, precise binding site and detailed aptamer&#8208;receptor binding mode can be further determined using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The ligand dilution strategy also sets the stage for an aptamer&#8208;based dynamics analysis of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional motion and fluctuation of highly expressed receptors on the live cell membrane.

         <title>A Type 1 Aldolase, NahE, Catalyzes a Stereoselective Nitro&#8208;Michael Reaction: Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
The stereoselective Michael addition of pyruvate to &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes catalyzed by NahE, a type 1 aldolase, is reported. &#946;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric acids can be isolated after oxidative decarboxylation in high yields on a preparative scale, providing access to precursors of &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogues of demonstrated pharmacological activity.







Abstract
Michael addition reactions are highly useful in organic synthesis and are commonly accomplished using organocatalysts. However, the corresponding biocatalytic Michael additions are rare, typically lack synthetically useful substrate scope, and suffer from low stereoselectivity. Herein we report a biocatalytic nitro&#8208;Michael addition, catalyzed by NahE, that proceeds with low catalyst loading at room temperature in moderate to excellent enantioselectivity and high yields. A series of &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrenes reacted with pyruvate in the presence of NahE to give, after oxidative decarboxylation, &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitrobutyric acids in up to 99&#8201;% yield without need for chromatography, providing a simple preparative&#8208;scale route to chiral GABA analogues. This reaction represents the first example of an aldolase displaying promiscuous Michaelase activity and opens the use of nitroalkenes in place of aldehydes as substrates for aldolases.

         <title>Didepside Formation by the Nonreducing Polyketide Synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera Requires Interaction of Starter Acyl Transferase and Thioesterase Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ester&#8208;bond&#8208;forming dimerization to afford the didepside lecanoric acid is shown to require both the starter acyltransferase and the thioesterase domains of the nonreducing polyketide synthase Preu6 of the fungus Preussia isomera. These domains also engage in an unexpected, direct protein&#8211;protein interaction that must be considered when attempting combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural didepsides, depsidones, and diphenyl ethers.







Abstract
Orsellinic acid (OA) derivatives are produced by filamentous fungi using nonreducing polyketide synthases (nrPKSs). The chain&#8208;releasing thioesterase (TE) domains of such nrPKSs were proposed to also catalyze dimerization to yield didepsides, such as lecanoric acid. Here, we use combinatorial domain exchanges, domain dissections and reconstitutions to reveal that the TE domain of the lecanoric acid synthase Preu6 of Preussia isomera must collaborate with the starter acyl transferase (SAT) domain from the same nrPKS. We show that artificial SAT&#8208;TE fusion proteins are highly effective catalysts and reprogram the ketide homologation chassis to form didepsides. We also demonstrate that dissected SAT and TE domains of Preu6 physically interact, and SAT and TE domains of OA&#8208;synthesizing nrPKSs may co&#8208;evolve. Our work highlights an unexpected domain&#8211;domain interaction in nrPKSs that must be considered for the combinatorial biosynthesis of unnatural didepsides, depsidones, and diphenyl ethers.

         <title>Cadmium&#8208;Doped and Pincer Ligand&#8208;Modified Gold Nanocluster for Catalytic KA2 Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold nanocluster Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 with an icosahedral Au13 kernel, two PNP pincer ligands and two Au2Cd(SR)6 staple motifs has been developed as an efficient catalyst for the KA2 reaction. The cooperation between the three parts of the gold nanocluster has been verified as contributing to its high activity.







Abstract
A gold nanocluster Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 (PNP=2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphinomethyl)pyridine, SR=4&#8208;MeOPhS) consisting of an icosahedral Au13 kernel, two Au2CdS6 staple motifs, and two PNP pincer ligands has been designed, synthesized and well characterized. This cadmium and PNP pincer ligand co&#8208;modified gold nanocluster showed high catalytic efficiency in the KA2 reaction, featuring high TON, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope as well as catalyst recyclability. Comparison of the catalytic performance between Au17Cd2(PNP)2(SR)12 and the structurally similar single cadmium (or PNP) modified gold nanoclusters demonstrates that the co&#8208;existence of the cadmium and PNP on the surface is crucial for the high catalytic activity of the gold nanocluster. This work would be enlightening for developing efficient catalysts for cascade reactions and discovering the catalytic potential of metal nanoclusters in organic transformations.

         <title>Designing Solid Electrolyte Interfaces towards Homogeneous Na Deposition: Theoretical Guidelines for Electrolyte Additives and Superior High&#8208;Rate Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzene (1,2&#8208;DBB) electrolyte additive is developed to accelerate Na ion diffusion through the solid electrolyte interphase layer and induce spherical Na deposition for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal anode due to the derived NaBr with high ionic conductivity. As enabled by the 1,2&#8208;DBB additive, the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
Metallic Na is a promising metal anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Nevertheless, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and uncontrollable Na dendrite growth lead to disastrous short circuit and poor cycle life. Through phase field and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, we first predict that the sodium bromide (NaBr) with the lowest Na ion diffusion energy barrier among sodium halogen compounds (NaX, X=F, Cl, Br, I) is the ideal SEI composition to induce the spherical Na deposition for suppressing dendrite growth. Then, 1,2&#8208;dibromobenzene (1,2&#8208;DBB) additive is introduced into the common fluoroethylene carbonate&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte (the corresponding SEI has high mechanical stability) to construct a desirable NaBr&#8208;rich stable SEI layer. When the Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 cell utilizes the electrolyte with 1,2&#8208;DBB additive, an extraordinary capacity retention of 94&#8201;% is achieved after 2000&#8197;cycles at a high rate of 10&#8197;C. This study provides a design philosophy for dendrite&#8208;free Na metal anode and can be expanded to other metal anodes.

         <title>Correlating Oxidation State and Surface Ligand Motifs with the Selectivity of CO2 Photoreduction to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface oxidation state of titanium oxynitride photocatalysts influences C2 product selectivity in CO2 photoreduction. The surface Ti2+/Ti3+ ratio and the surface oxidation state can be regulated and controlled through the concentration of nitrogen dopant and oxygen vacancies.







Abstract
The design for non&#8208;Cu&#8208;based catalysts with the function of producing C2+ products requires systematic knowledge of the intrinsic connection between the surface state as well as the catalytic activity and selectivity. In this work, photochemical in situ spectral surface characterization techniques combined with the first principle calculations (DFT) were applied to investigate the relationships between the composition of surface states, coordinated motifs, and catalytic selectivity of a titanium oxynitride catalyst. When the catalyst mediates CO2 photoreduction, C2 product selectivity is positively correlated with the surface Ti2+/Ti3+ ratio and the surface oxidation state is regulated and controlled by coordinated motifs of N&#8722;Ti&#8208;O/V[O], which can reduce the potential dimerization energy barriers of *CO&#8722;CO* and promote spontaneous formation of the subsequent *CO&#8722;CH2* intermediate. This phenomenon provides a new perspective for the design of heterogeneous catalysts for photoreduction of CO2 into useful products.

         <title>Increased Surface Density of States at the Fermi Level for Electron Transport Across Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductance of molecular junctions bridged in Pt&#8208; or Pd&#8208;adlayer modified Au electrodes was investigated. The conductance on bimetallic electrodes was found 2&#8211;30 fold higher than that on Au electrodes. This was attributed to the increase in the local density of states by partially&#8208;filled d shells of the adlayer.







Abstract
Fermi's golden rule, a remarkable concept for the transition probability involving continuous states, is applicable to the interfacial electron&#8208;transporting efficiency via correlation with the surface density of states (SDOS). Yet, this concept has not been reported to tailor single&#8208;molecule junctions where gold is an overwhelmingly popular electrode material due to its superior amenability in regenerating molecular junctions. At the Fermi level, however, the SDOS of gold is small due to its fully filled d&#8208;shell. To increase the electron&#8208;transport efficiency, herein, gold electrodes are modified by a monolayer of platinum or palladium that bears partially filled d&#8208;shells and exhibits significant SDOS at the Fermi energy. An increase by 2&#8211;30 fold is found for single&#8208;molecule conductance of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hexanes bridged via common headgroups. The improved junction conductance is attributed to the electrode self&#8208;energy which involves a stronger coupling with the molecule and a larger SDOS participated by d&#8208;electrons at the electrode&#8208;molecule interfaces.

         <title>Pore Geometry and Surface Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Anhydrous Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three robust and porous covalent organic frameworks with rare concave dodecagonal nanopores were designed and synthesized via a pore engineering approach. The fine&#8208;tailored and functionalized pored can anchor H3PO4 molecules to form abundant proton hopping sites, thus affording high proton conductivity at anhydrous conditions.







Abstract
Developing new materials for anhydrous proton conduction under high&#8208;temperature conditions is significant and challenging. Herein, we create a series of highly crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via a pore engineering approach. We simultaneously engineer the pore geometry (generating concave dodecagonal nanopores) and pore surface (installing multiple functional groups such as &#8722;C=N&#8722;, &#8722;OH, &#8722;N=N&#8722; and &#8722;CF3) to improve the utilization efficiency and host&#8211;guest interaction of proton carriers, hence benefiting the enhancement of anhydrous proton conduction. Upon loading with H3PO4, COFs can realize a proton conductivity of 2.33&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 under anhydrous conditions, among the highest values of all COF materials. These materials demonstrate good stability and maintain high proton conductivity over a wide temperature range (80&#8211;160&#8201;&#176;C). This work paves a new way for designing COFs for anhydrous proton conduction applications, which shows great potential as high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membranes.

         <title>Evidence of Sulfur Non&#8208;Innocence in [CoII(dithiacyclam)]2+&#8208;Mediated Catalytic Oxygen Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comparison of the abilities of two CoII complexes bearing N4 and S2N2 ligations to mediate 2&#8201;e&#8722;/2&#8201;H+ O2 reduction to H2O2 reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the reactive intermediates point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
In many metalloenzymes, sulfur&#8208;containing ligands participate in catalytic processes, mainly via the involvement in electron transfer reactions. In a biomimetic approach, we now demonstrate the implication of S&#8208;ligation in cobalt mediated oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). A comparative study between the catalytic ORR capabilities of the four&#8208;nitrogen bound [Co(cyclam)]2+ (1; cyclam=1,5,8,11&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) and the S&#8208;containing analog [Co(S2N2&#8208;cyclam)]2+ (2; S2N2&#8208;cyclam=1,8&#8208;dithia&#8208;5,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;cyclotetradecane) reveals improved catalytic performance once the chalcogen is introduced in the Co coordination sphere. Trapping and characterization of the intermediates formed upon dioxygen activation at the CoII centers in 1 and 2 point to the involvement of sulfur in the O2 reduction process as the key for the improved catalytic ORR capabilities of 2.

         <title>Identification of the Active Sites on Metallic MoO2&#8722;x Nano&#8208;Sea&#8208;Urchin for Atmospheric CO2 Photoreduction Under UV, Visible, and Near&#8208;Infrared Light Illumination</title>

         <dc:description>
Metallic vacancy&#8208;rich MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin shows excellent light absorption property covering from UV to NIR light and exhibits greatly enhanced selective photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction on a dual active site (Mo&#8722;Vo&#8722;Mo).







Abstract
We report an oxygen vacancy (Vo)&#8208;rich metallic MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin with partially occupied band, which exhibits super CO2 (even directly from the air) photoreduction performance under UV, visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light illumination. The Vo&#8208;rich MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin displays a CH4 evolution rate of 12.2 and 5.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under full spectrum and NIR light illumination in concentrated CO2, which is ca. 7&#8208; and 10&#8208;fold higher than the Vo&#8208;poor MoO2&#8722;x, respectively. More interestingly, the as&#8208;developed Vo&#8208;rich MoO2&#8722;x nano&#8208;sea&#8208;urchin can even reduce CO2 directly from the air with a CO evolution rate of 6.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under NIR light illumination. Experiments together with theoretical calculations demonstrate that the oxygen vacancy in MoO2&#8722;x can facilitate CO2 adsorption/activation to generate *COOH as well as the subsequent protonation of *CO towards the formation of CH4 because of the formation of a highly stable Mo&#8722;C&#8722;O&#8722;Mo intermediate.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycosides by Silver&#8208;Assisted Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver&#8208;assisted gold catalysis was applied to alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors for the synthesis of purine, pyrimidine, quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one, and asparagine glycosides. It was demonstrated (40 examples) to be highly versatile for the synthesis of important types of N&#8208;glycosides. The method has been utilized for the synthesis of various 2&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides and the disaccharide dipeptide moiety of chloroviruses.







Abstract
The synthesis of N&#8208;glycosides from stable glycosyl donors in a catalytic fashion is still challenging, though they exist ubiquitously in DNA, RNA, glycoproteins, and other biological molecules. Herein, silver&#8208;assisted gold&#8208;catalyzed activation of alkynyl glycosyl carbonate donors is shown to be a versatile approach for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, asparagine glycosides and quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;one N&#8208;glycosides. Thus synthesized nucleosides were subjected to the oxidation&#8211;reduction sequence for the conversion of Ribf&#8208; into Araf&#8208; nucleosides, giving access to nucleosides that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. Furthermore, the protocol is demonstrated to be suitable for the synthesis of 2&#8217;&#8208;modified nucleosides in a facile manner. Direct attachment of an asparagine&#8208;containing dipeptide to the glucopyranose and subsequent extrapolation to afford the dipeptide disaccharide unit of chloroviruses is yet another facet of this endeavor.

         <title>A Telomerase&#8208;Assisted Strategy for Regeneration of DNA Nanomachines in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a smart DNA nanomachine that can perform regeneration operations via telomerase (TE)&#8208;aided track extension in living cells. By customizing apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) as the responsive module of the nanomachine, multiply augmented imaging of APE1 at the single&#8208;cell level could be implemented. By arranging the regenerative module, the nanomachine could provide the expression diversity of TE in different cell lines.







Abstract
DNA nanomachines have been engineered into diverse personalized devices for diagnostic imaging of biomarkers; however, the regeneration of DNA nanomachines in living cells remains challenging. Here, we report an ingenious DNA nanomachine that can implement telomerase (TE)&#8208;activated regeneration in living cells. Upon apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)&#8208;responsive initiation of the nanomachine, the walker of the nanomachine moves along tracks regenerated by TE, generating multiply amplified signals through which APE1 can be imaged in situ. Additionally, augmentation of the signal due to the regeneration of the nanomachines could reveal differential expression of TE in different cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the use of biomarkers to assist in the regeneration of nanomachines in living cells. This study offers a new paradigm for the development of more applicable and efficient DNA nanomachines.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries: Towards Harnessing their Full Power with Darwinian Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking cues from Darwinian evolution, is it possible to apply molecular evolution to drug&#8208;like molecules? This Review covers technologies for the synthesis of DNA&#8208;encoded libraries enabling translation of the DNA code into synthetic products, explores the different selection format, and discusses how these can be brought together to evolve synthetic molecules with Darwinian selection pressure.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technologies are transforming the drug discovery process, enabling the identification of ligands at unprecedented speed and scale. DEL makes use of libraries that are orders of magnitude larger than traditional high&#8208;throughput screens. While a DNA tag alludes to a genotype&#8211;phenotype connection that is exploitable for molecular evolution, most of the work in the field is performed with libraries where the tag serves as an amplifiable barcode but does not allow &#8220;translation&#8221; into the synthetic product it is linked to. In this Review, we cover technologies that enable the &#8220;translation&#8221; of the genetic tag into synthetic molecules, both biochemically and chemically, and explore how it can be used to harness Darwinian evolutionary pressure.

While a DNA tag alludes to a genotype&#8211;phenotype connection that is exploitable for molecular evolution, most of the work in the field is performed with libraries where the tag serves as an amplifiable barcode but does not allow &#8220;translation&#8221; into the synthetic product it is linked to. In this Review, we cover technologies that enable the &#8220;translation&#8221; of the genetic tag into synthetic molecules, both biochemically and chemically, and explore how it can be used to harness Darwinian evolutionary pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Schlenk's Legacy&#8212;Methyllithium Put under Close Scrutiny</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide contaminations of commercial methyllithium solutions (MeLi&#8208;c) can be simply removed by the use of K[N(SiMe3)2] as a halide&#8208;trapping reagent and solvent&#8208;dependent precipitation. 7Li&#8208;NMR spectroscopy is an efficient tool for quantifying the halide contaminations, which can effect solid&#8208;state structures as shown for monomeric [(Me3TACN)LiCH3].







Abstract
Commercially available stock solutions of organolithium reagents are well&#8208;implemented tools in organic and organometallic chemistry. However, such solutions are inherently contaminated with lithium halide salts, which can complicate certain synthesis protocols and purification processes. Here, we report the isolation of chloride&#8208;free methyllithium employing K[N(SiMe3)2] as a halide&#8208;trapping reagent. The influence of distinct LiCl contaminations on the 7Li&#8208;NMR chemical shift is examined and their quantification demonstrated. The structural parameters of new chloride&#8208;free monomeric methyllithium complex [(Me3TACN)LiCH3], ligated by an azacrown ether, are assessed by comparison with a halide&#8208;contaminated variant and monomeric lithium chloride [(Me3TACN)LiCl], further emphasizing the effect of halide impurities.

         <title>Morphology Optimization of the Photoactive Layer through Crystallinity and Miscibility Regulation for High&#8208;performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design principle of the third component is established to tackle the issue of excessive self&#8208;aggregation of Y6&#8208;derivatives during the film formation through crystallinity and miscibility regulation. With the addition of BTP&#8208;Th, the ternary device yielded a remarkable efficiency of 18.53&#8201;%, which is a significant improvement with regard to the efficiency of 17.22&#8201;% for the control reference binary device.







Abstract
On the premise of strongly crystalline materials involved, it is a challenge to control the phase separation of bulk&#8208;heterojunction donor/acceptor active layer to fabricate high&#8208;performance polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we develop a molecular design strategy of the third component to synthesize three guest materials (namely BTPT, BTP&#8208;Th, and BTP&#8208;2Th) to address this issue. We investigate and reveal the effect of crystallinity and miscibility of the third component in controlling the phase separation of Y6&#8208;derivatives&#8208;based blend film. As a result, a remarkable power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 18.53&#8201;% is obtained in the ternary PSC based on PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6 with BTP&#8208;Th as the third component, which is a significant improvement with regard to the efficiency of 17.22&#8201;% for the control binary device. Our study offers a molecular design strategy to develop a third component for building ternary PSCs in terms of crystallinity and miscibility regulation.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 Cathode Catalysts for Hydrogen Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed ZnNC catalysts with Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 moieties have been synthesized, and the ZnNC&#8208;based anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell not only presents an ultrahigh peak power density of 1.63&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 but also a long&#8208;term durability with more than 100&#8197;h operations in H2&#8208;O2 system. Density functional calculation further reveals that the Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 structure is the origin of high activity of as&#8208;synthesized ZnNC catalyst.







Abstract
To achieve practical application of fuel cell, it is vital to develop highly efficient and durable Pt&#8208;free catalysts. Herein, we prepare atomically dispersed ZnNC catalysts with Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 moieties and abundant mesoporous structure. The ZnNC&#8208;based anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) presents an ultrahigh peak power density of 1.63 and 0.83&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8208;O2 and H2&#8208;air (CO2&#8208;free), and also exhibits long&#8208;term stability with more than 120 and 100&#8197;h for H2&#8208;air (CO2&#8208;free) and H2&#8208;O2, respectively. Density functional calculations further unveil that the Zn&#8208;Pyrrolic&#8208;N4 structure is the origin of high activity of as&#8208;synthesized ZnNC catalyst, while the Zn&#8208;Pyridinic&#8208;N4 moiety is inactive for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which successfully explain the puzzle why most Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;organic framework &#8208;derived ZnNC catalysts in previous reports did not present good ORR activity because of their Zn&#8208;Pyridinic&#8208;N4 moieties. This work offers a new route for speeding up development of AEMFCs.

         <title>MOFs with Open Metal(III) Sites for the Environmental Capture of Polar Volatile Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimeric metal(III) carboxylate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) exhibit a preferential adsorption of polar volatile organic compounds (VOCs) over water through a direct binding of the VOC vapor on the open metal sites, paving the way for their utilization in indoor air quality control.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites (OMS) interact strongly with a range of polar gases/vapors. However, under ambient conditions, their selective adsorption is generally impaired due to a high OMS affinity to water. This led previously to the privilege selection of hydrophobic MOFs for the selective capture/detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Herein, we show that this paradigm is challenged by metal(III) polycarboxylates MOFs, bearing a high concentration of OMS, as MIL&#8208;100(Fe), enabling the selective capture of polar VOCs even in the presence of water. With experimental and computational tools, including single&#8208;component gravimetric and dynamic mixture adsorption measurements, in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory calculations we reveal that this adsorption mechanism involves a direct coordination of the VOC on the OMS, associated with an interaction energy that exceeds that of water. Hence, MOFs with OMS are demonstrated to be of interest for air purification purposes.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Nanoconfinement Effect on Nanoreactor via Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single nanoreactor electrochemiluminescence microscopy based on Ru@MSN realizes direct observation of nanoconfinement during electrochemical process which can bridges mesoporous nanoarchitectures and potential electrochemical applications. Long time decay and recover ability caused by nanoarchitecture are resolved. The nanoconfinement effects are stable even in complex biological conditions, offering excellent route for single biomolecule imaging.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement in mesoporous nanoarchitectures could dramatically change molecular transport and reaction kinetics during electrochemical process. A molecular&#8208;level understanding of nanoconfinement and mass transport is critical for the applications, but a proper route to study it is lacking. Herein, we develop a single nanoreactor electrochemiluminescence (SNECL) microscopy based on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle to directly visualize in situ nanoconfinement&#8208;enhanced electrochemical reactions at the single molecule level. Meanwhile, mass transport capability of single nanoreactor, reflected as long decay time and recovery ability, is monitored and simulated with a high spatial resolution. The nanoconfinement effects in our system also enable imaging single proteins on cellular membrane. Our SNECL approach may pave the way to decipher the nanoconfinement effects during electrochemical process, and build bridges between mesoporous nanoarchitectures and potential electrochemical applications.

Long time decay and recover ability caused by nanoarchitecture are resolved. The nanoconfinement effects are stable even in complex biological conditions, offering excellent route for single biomolecule imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoconfinement in mesoporous nanoarchitectures could dramatically change molecular transport and reaction kinetics during electrochemical process. A molecular-level understanding of nanoconfinement and mass transport is critical for the applications, but a proper route to study it is lacking. Herein, we develop a single nanoreactor electrochemiluminescence (SNECL) microscopy based on Ru(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle to directly visualize in situ nanoconfinement-enhanced electrochemical reactions at the single molecule level. Meanwhile, mass transport capability of single nanoreactor, reflected as long decay time and recovery ability, is monitored and simulated with a high spatial resolution. The nanoconfinement effects in our system also enable imaging single proteins on cellular membrane. Our SNECL approach may pave the way to decipher the nanoconfinement effects during electrochemical process, and build bridges between mesoporous nanoarchitectures and potential electrochemical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Inspired Polymers with Metal&#8208;Site&#8208;Regulated Ordered Conformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational regulation in poly(amino acid)s mediated by an exogenous ligand and metal ions. The polypeptides show controllable transitions between &#946;&#8208;sheet and &#945;&#8208;helix conformations as well as a conformation&#8208;driven vesicular expanding and shrinking phenomenon. Moreover, the metallopolymers self&#8208;assemble into ferritin&#8208;inspired nanovehicles for efficient brain delivery and long&#8208;lasting magnetic resonance imaging in vivo.







Abstract
Metal ions play critical roles in facilitating peptide folding and inducing conformational transitions, thereby impacting on the biological activity of many proteins. However, the effect of metal sites on the hierarchical structures of biopolymers is still poorly understood. Herein, inspired by metalloproteins, we report an order&#8208;to&#8208;order conformational regulation in synthetic polymers mediated by a variety of metal ions. The copolymers are decorated with clinically available desferrioxamine (DFO) as an exogenous ligand template, which presents a geometric constraint toward peptide backbone via short&#8208;range hydrogen bonding interactions, thus dramatically altering the secondary conformations and self&#8208;assembly behaviors of polypeptides and allowing for a controllable &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix transition modulated by metal&#8211;ligand interactions. These metallopolymers could form ferritin&#8208;inspired hierarchical structures with high stability and membrane activity for efficient brain delivery across the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and long&#8208;lasting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vivo.

         <title>Electronic Perturbation of Copper Single&#8208;Atom CO2 Reduction Catalysts in a Molecular Way</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise electronic perturbation of Cu single&#8208;atoms is achieved on graphdiyne derivates with electron&#8208;withdrawing/&#8208;donating groups (&#8722;F, &#8722;H, &#8722;OMe), rendering distinctive Cu&#948;+ valance and electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity. In situ spectroscopical and theoretical studies reveal that the positive Cu&#948;+ centers adjusted by the &#8722;F group decrease the pKa of adsorbed H2O, promoting the hydrogenation of intermediates toward a high CH4 production.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning electronic structures of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) plays a crucial role in harnessing their catalytic activities, yet challenges remain at a molecular scale in a controlled fashion. By tailoring the structure of graphdiyne (GDY) with electron&#8208;withdrawing/&#8208;donating groups, we show herein the electronic perturbation of Cu single&#8208;atom CO2 reduction catalysts in a molecular way. The elaborately introduced functional groups (&#8722;F, &#8722;H and &#8722;OMe) can regulate the valance state of Cu&#948;+, which is found to be directly scaled with the selectivity of the electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. An optimum CH4 Faradaic efficiency of 72.3&#8201;% was achieved over the Cu SAC on the F&#8208;substituted GDY. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that the positive Cu&#948;+ centers adjusted by the electron&#8208;withdrawing group decrease the pKa of adsorbed H2O, promoting the hydrogenation of intermediates toward the CH4 production. Our strategy paves the way for precise electronic perturbation of SACs toward efficient electrocatalysis.

         <title>Biodegradable High&#8208;Density Polyethylene&#8208;like Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While it resembles high density polyethylene with regard to its mechanical properties and solid&#8208;state structure and has a high melting point (Tm=96&#8201;&#176;C), the novel polyester&#8208;2,18 material at the same time fully hydrolyzes in in vitro enzymatic degradation studies and mineralizes under industrial composting conditions (ISO standard 14855&#8208;1) within two months.







Abstract
We report a novel polyester material generated from readily available biobased 1,18&#8208;octadecanedicarboxylic acid and ethylene glycol possesses a polyethylene&#8208;like solid&#8208;state structure and also tensile properties similar to high density polyethylene (HDPE). Despite its crystallinity, high melting point (Tm=96&#8201;&#176;C) and hydrophobic nature, polyester&#8208;2,18 is subject to rapid and complete hydrolytic degradation in in vitro assays with isolated naturally occurring enzymes. Under industrial composting conditions (ISO standard 14855&#8208;1) the material is biodegraded with mineralization above 95&#8201;% within two months. Reference studies with polyester&#8208;18,18 (Tm=99&#8201;&#176;C) reveal a strong impact of the nature of the diol repeating unit on degradation rates, possibly related to the density of ester groups in the amorphous phase. Depolymerization by methanolysis indicates suitability for closed&#8208;loop recycling.

         <title>Optical Spin Polarization of a Narrow&#8208;Linewidth Electron&#8208;Spin Qubit in a Chromophore/Stable&#8208;Radical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising approach to molecular qubits employs a photoexcited chromophore covalently linked to a deuterated stable radical (C&#8722;R&#8901;). Photoexcitation of the C within C&#8722;R&#8901; results in ultrafast intersystem crossing to produce the spin&#8208;polarized quartet state (Q) that decays to the spin&#8208;polarized ground state (D0). Both Q and D0 have narrow linewidths that allow facile addressability using microwave pulses.







Abstract
Photoexcited organic chromophores appended to stable radicals can serve as qubit and/or qudit candidates for quantum information applications. 1,6,7,12&#8208;Tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxy)&#8208;perylene&#8208;3,4&#8201;:&#8201;9,10&#8208;bis(dicarboximide) (tpPDI) linked to a partially deuterated &#945;,&#947;&#8208;bisdiphenylene&#8208;&#946;&#8208;phenylallyl radical (BDPA&#8208;d16) was synthesized and characterized by time&#8208;resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Photoexcitation of tpPDI&#8208;BDPA&#8208;d16 results in ultrafast radical&#8208;enhanced intersystem crossing to produce a quartet state (Q) followed by formation of a spin&#8208;polarized doublet ground state (D0). Pulse&#8208;EPR experiments confirmed the spin multiplicity of Q and yielded coherence times of Tm=2.1&#177;0.1&#8197;&#956;s and 2.8&#177;0.2&#8197;&#956;s for Q and D0, respectively. BDPA&#8208;d16 eliminates the dominant 1H hyperfine couplings, resulting in a single narrow line for both the Q and D0 states, which enhances the spectral resolution needed for good qubit addressability.

         <dc:description>
The first di&#8208; and multi&#8208;carbonylations of olefins with di&#8208; or polyols provide a general and straightforward access to a variety of di&#8208; or multiesters with high efficiency and selectivity. Representative diesters show potential performance (Tg) as novel plasticizers.







Abstract
Diesters are of fundamental importance in the chemical industry and are used for many applications, e.g. as plasticizers, surfactants, emulsifiers, and lubricants. Herein, we present a straightforward and efficient method for the selective synthesis of diesters via palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct carbonylation of di&#8208; or polyols with readily available alkenes. Key&#8208;to&#8208;success is the use of a specific palladium catalyst with the &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8208;base&#8221; ligand L16 providing esterification of all alcohols and a high n/iso ratio. The synthesized diesters were evaluated as potential plasticizers in PVC films by measuring the glass transition temperature (Tg) via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

         <title>Strong Coupling of Chiral Frenkel Exciton for Intense, Bisignate Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly coupled chiral Frenkel excitons yield intense circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with an intrinsic dissymmetry factor in emission glum as high as 0.08, measured through thin films of cyanine J&#8208;aggregate bundles. The bisignate, highly correlated dissymmetry factors in absorption gabs and in emission glum reveal a small Davydov splitting of the excited states and the anti&#8208;Kasha nature of the chiral emission.







Abstract
We show that chiral Frenkel excitons yield intense circularly polarized luminescence with an intrinsic dissymmetry factor in emission glum as high as 0.08. This outstanding value is measured through thin films of cyanine J&#8208;aggregates that form twisted bundles. Our measurements, obtained by a Mueller polarization analysis, are artifact&#8208;free and reveal a quasi&#8208;perfect correlation between the dissymmetry factors in absorption, gabs, and in emission glum. We interpret the bisignate dissymmetry factors as the signature of a strong coupling between chiral Frenkel excitons longitudinally excited along the bundles. We further resolve by polarimetry analysis the split in energy between the excited states with a Davydov splitting as small as 28&#8197;meV. We finally show the anti&#8208;Kasha nature of the chiral emission bands with opposite optical chirality. These mirror&#8208;imaged emissive chiroptical features emerge from the structural rigidity of the bundles that preserves the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state chirality.

         <title>ZnF2&#8208;Riched Inorganic/Organic Hybrid SEI: in situ&#8208;Chemical Construction and Performance&#8208;Improving Mechanism for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional FEC is introduced into aqueous electrolyte to produce a ZnF2&#8208;riched inorganic/organic hybrid SEI (ZHS) layer on Zn metal anode (ZMA) surface. The hydrolysate of FEC can favorably regulate the solvated structure of Zn2+ to restrict the H2O&#8208;related parasitic reactions. The in situ formed ZHS layer not only realize uniform Zn deposition, but also suppresses ZMA corrosion.







Abstract
Uncontrolled dendrites growth and serious parasitic reactions in aqueous electrolytes, greatly hinder the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery. On the basis of in situ&#8208;chemical construction and performance&#8208;improving mechanism, multifunctional fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is introduced into aqueous electrolyte to construct a high&#8208;quality and ZnF2&#8208;riched inorganic/organic hybrid SEI (ZHS) layer on Zn metal anode (ZMA) surface. Notably, FEC additive can regulate the solvated structure of Zn2+ to reduce H2O molecules reactivity. Additionally, the ZHS layer with strong Zn2+ affinity can avoid dendrites formation and hinder the direct contact between the electrolyte and anode. Therefore, the dendrites growth, Zn corrosion, and H2 evolution reaction on ZMA in FEC&#8208;included ZnSO4 electrolyte are highly suppressed. Thus, ZMA in such electrolyte realize a long cycle life over 1000&#8197;h and deliver a stable coulombic efficiency of 99.1&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed in numerous applications, including optics, biosensing and catalysis. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202212459), Petra&#8197;S. Dittrich et&#8197;al. demonstrate the stabilizer&#8208;free electrochemical synthesis of AuNPs inside nanoliter&#8208;sized reactors. AuNPs with sizes in the range of 30 to 100&#8197;nm were produced without the need of additional capping agents. This method opens the way to fine&#8208;tune the electrochemical production of gold nanoparticles.

Carbon&#8208;13 radiofrequency amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (C&#8208;13 RASER) is demonstrated on a bolus of liquid hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate, as reported by Thomas Theis, Eduard&#8197;Y. Chekmenev et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215678). Spontaneous RASER signal emissions were detected using a 1.4 T NMR spectrometer equipped with a standard radio&#8208;frequency detection coil for over 3 minutes. RASER detection enables new detection schemes for 13&#8197;C&#8208;hyperpolarized contrast agents and particular new opportunities for next&#8208;generation molecular imaging on clinical MRI scanners.

         <title>Shortwave Infrared Fluorofluorophores for Multicolor In Vivo Imaging
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorofluorophores (fluoro refers to fluorine and fluorescence) are chemical tools to study perfluorocarbons. To understand the biodistribution of perfluorocarbons in animals, fluorofluorophores that emit past 1000&#8197;nm are necessary. Here we describe the synthesis, characterization, and application of shortwave infrared (SWIR)&#8208;emissive fluorofluorophores towards understanding how to control the pharmacokinetics of perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions in mammals.







Abstract
Developing chemical tools to detect and influence biological processes is a cornerstone of chemical biology. Here we combine two tools which rely on orthogonality&#8211; perfluorocarbons and multiplexed shortwave infrared (SWIR) fluorescence imaging&#8211; to visualize nanoemulsions in real time in living mice. Drawing inspiration from fluorous and SWIR fluorophore development, we prepared two SWIR&#8208;emissive, fluorous&#8208;soluble chromenylium polymethine dyes. These are the most red&#8208;shifted fluorous fluorophores&#8211; &#8220;fluorofluorophores&#8221;&#8212;to date.

     alt="Shortwave Infrared Fluorofluorophores for Multicolor In Vivo Imaging**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorofluorophores (fluoro refers to fluorine and fluorescence) are chemical tools to study perfluorocarbons. To understand the biodistribution of perfluorocarbons in animals, fluorofluorophores that emit past 1000&#8197;nm are necessary. Here we describe the synthesis, characterization, and application of shortwave infrared (SWIR)-emissive fluorofluorophores towards understanding how to control the pharmacokinetics of perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions in mammals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing chemical tools to detect and influence biological processes is a cornerstone of chemical biology. Here we combine two tools which rely on orthogonality&#8211; perfluorocarbons and multiplexed shortwave infrared (SWIR) fluorescence imaging&#8211; to visualize nanoemulsions in real time in living mice. Drawing inspiration from fluorous and SWIR fluorophore development, we prepared two SWIR-emissive, fluorous-soluble chromenylium polymethine dyes. These are the most red-shifted fluorous fluorophores&#8211; &#8220;fluorofluorophores&#8221;&#8212;to date. After characterizing the dyes, their utility was demonstrated by tracking perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion biodistribution &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using an excitation-multiplexed approach to image two variables simultaneously, we gained insight into the importance of size and surfactant identity on biodistribution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overall Carbon&#8208;neutral Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 in Molten Salts using a Liquid Metal Sn Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overall carbon&#8208;neutral electrochemical reduction of CO2 in molten salts is established by using liquid metal Sn cathode due to enhanced CO2 conversion and excellent energy&#8208;storage capability of Sn@C.







Abstract
An overall carbon&#8208;neutral CO2 electroreduction requires enhanced conversion efficiency and intensified functionality of CO2&#8208;derived products to balance the carbon footprint from CO2 electroreduction against fixed CO2. A liquid Sn cathode is herein introduced into electrochemical reduction of CO2 in molten salts to fabricate core&#8211;shell Sn&#8722;C spheres (Sn@C). An in situ generated Li2SnO3/C directs a self&#8208;template formation of Sn@C. Benefitting from the accelerated reaction kinetics from the liquid Sn cathode and the core&#8211;shell structure of Sn@C, a CO2&#8208;fixation current efficiency higher than 84&#8201;% and a high reversible lithium&#8208;storage capacity of Sn@C are achieved. The versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by other low melting point metals, such as Zn and Bi. This process integrates energy&#8208;efficient CO2 conversion and template&#8208;free fabrication of value&#8208;added metal&#8208;carbon, achieving an overall carbon&#8208;neutral electrochemical reduction of CO2.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed formal [6+2] annulation of allenyl benzoxazinanones with terminal allenes has been developed, forming the challenging 8&#8208;membered cycles. Decent yields and excellent regioselectivity have been observed under mild conditions with a remarkable Z&#8208;stereoselectivity for the exo&#8208;cyclic C=C bonds.







Abstract
An efficient double allene protocol for the formation of benzazocines has been developed. The reaction constitutes a highly regioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed formal [6+2] annulation of allenyl benzoxazinanones with terminal allenes forming the challenging 8&#8208;membered cycles. Decent yields and excellent regioselectivity have been observed under mild conditions with a remarkable Z&#8208;stereoselectivity for the exo&#8208;cyclic C=C bonds.

         <title>Co&#8208;Dissolved Isostructural Polyoxovanadates to Construct Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Site Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dispersing nanosized [PtV9O28]7&#8722; clusters into a [V10O28]6&#8722; aqueous solution, the so&#8208;called co&#8208;dissolved strategy, ensures double separations resulting in the construction of Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The SAC with Pt/O synergism can efficiently boost CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
We explored a co&#8208;dissolved strategy to embed mono&#8208;dispersed Pt center into V2O5 support via dissolving [PtV9O28]7&#8722; into [V10O28]6&#8722; aqueous solution. The uniform dispersion of [PtV9O28]7&#8722; in [V10O28]6&#8722; solution allows [PtV9O28]7&#8722; to be surrounded by [V10O28]6&#8722; clusters via a freeze&#8208;drying process. The V centers in both [PtV9O28]7&#8722; and [V10O28]6&#8722; were converted into V2O5 via a calcination process to stabilize Pt center. These double separations can effectively prevent the Pt center agglomeration during the high&#8208;temperature conversion process, and achieve 100&#8201;% utilization of Pt in [PtV9O28]7&#8722;. The resulting Pt&#8208;V2O5 single&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts exhibit a CH4 yield of 247.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 25&#8197;times higher than that of Pt nanoparticle on the V2O5 support, which was accompanied by the lactic acid photooxidation to form pyruvic acid. Systematical investigations on this unambiguous structure demonstrate an important role of Pt&#8722;O atomic pair synergy for highly efficient CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Rational Positioning of Metal Ions to Stabilize Open Tin Sites in Beta Zeolite for Catalytic Conversion of Sugars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal ions such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ were positioned within Sn&#8208;Beta zeolite to form adjacent bimetallic catalytically active sites with stable open Sn sites. The Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta catalyst selectively converts glucose to methyl lactate and methyl vinyl glycolate in methanol in high yields of 71.2&#8201;% and 10.2&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
Via hydrothermal synthesis of Sn&#8208;Al gels, mild dealumination and ion exchange, a bimetallic Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta catalyst was prepared which can convert glucose to methyl lactate (MLA) and methyl vinyl glycolate (MVG) in methanol at yields of 71.2&#8201;% and 10.2&#8201;%, respectively. Results from solid&#8208;state magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, spectroscopic analysis, probe&#8208;temperature&#8208;programmed desorption, and density functional theory calculations conclusively reveal that the openness of the Sn sites, such as by the formation of [(SiO)3&#8722;Sn&#8722;OH] entities, is governed by an adjacent metal cation such as Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+. This relies on the low structure&#8208;defective pore channel, provided by the current synthesis scheme, and the specific silica hydroxyl anchor point is associated with the incorporation of Sn for additional and precise metal ion localization. The presence of metal cations significantly improved the catalytic performance of Sn&#8208;Ni&#8208;Beta for glucose isomerization and conversion to MLA of sugar compared with Sn&#8208;Beta.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Containing Passivation Layer via Surface Chelation for Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Surface treatment of inorganic perovskite film by trifluoroacetamidine featuring chelation configuration and multi&#8208;fluorine atoms allows record power conversion efficiency of inorganic perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Minimizing surface defect is vital to further improve power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed a passivator trifluoroacetamidine (TFA) to suppress CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx film defects. The amidine group of TFA can strongly chelate onto the perovskite surface to suppress the iodide vacancy, strengthened by additional hydrogen bonds. Moreover, three fluorine atoms allow strong intermolecular connection via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus constructing a robust shield against moisture. The TFA&#8208;treated PSCs exhibit remarkably suppressed recombination, yielding the record PCEs of 21.35&#8201;% and 17.21&#8201;% for 0.09&#8197;cm2 and 1.0&#8197;cm2 device areas, both of which are the highest for all&#8208;inorganic PSCs so far. The device also achieves a PCE of 39.78&#8201;% under indoor illumination, the highest for all&#8208;inorganic indoor photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, TFA greatly improves device ambient stability by preserving 93&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 960&#8197;h.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Catenane&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuI&#8208;complexed [2]catenane&#8208;based catalysts that can be activated &#8216;on&#8208;demand&#8217; through the controlled breakdown of the mechanical bond have been developed. Encapsulation of the CuI ion within the cavity formed by the two interlocked macrocycles inhibits its ability to catalyze the CuAAC reaction. However, the disassembly of the interlocked architecture by the opening of the macrocycles restores the capacity of the copper catalyst to form triazoles.







Abstract
Rotaxanes and molecular knots exhibit particular properties resulting from the presence of a mechanical bond within their structure that maintains the molecular components interlocked in a permanent manner. On the other hand, the disassembly of the interlocked architecture through the breakdown of the mechanical bond can activate properties which are masked in the parent compound. Herein, we present the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive CuI&#8208;complexed [2]catenanes as OFF/ON catalysts for the copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. The encapsulation of the CuI ion inside the [2]catenanes inhibits its ability to catalyze the formation of triazoles. In contrast, the controlled opening of the two macrocycles induces the breaking of the mechanical bond, thereby restoring the catalytic activity of the CuI ion for the CuAAC reaction. Such OFF/ON catalysts can be involved in signal amplification processes with various potential applications.

         <title>sn&#8208;1 Specificity of Lysophosphatidylcholine Acyltransferase&#8208;1 Revealed by a Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isomer&#8208;resolving mass spectrometry assay reveals that lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase&#8208;1 (LPCAT1) has an sn&#8208;1 specificity when catalyzing the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines (PCs). The specific link between PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 and the activity of LPCAT1 enables visualization of the boundaries between cancerous and normal regions in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue via desorption electrospray ionization (DESI).







Abstract
Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase&#8208;1 (LPCAT1) plays a critical role in the remodeling of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in cellular lipidome. However, evidence is scarce regarding its sn&#8208;selectivity, viz. the preference of assembling acyl&#8208;Coenzyme&#8197;A (CoA) at the C1 or C2&#8208;hydroxyl on a glycerol backbone because of difficulty to quantify the thus&#8208;formed PC sn&#8208;isomers. We have established a multiplexed assay to measure both sn&#8208; and acyl&#8208;chain selectivity of LPCAT1 toward a mixture of acyl&#8208;CoAs by integrating isomer&#8208;resolving tandem mass spectrometry. Our findings reveal that LPCAT1 shows exclusive sn&#8208;1 specificity regardless of the identity of acyl&#8208;CoAs. We further confirm that elevated PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 relative to its sn&#8208;isomer results from an increased expression of LPCAT1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue as compared to normal liver tissue. MS imaging via desorption electrospray ionization of PC 18&#8201;:&#8201;1/16:0 thus enables visualization of HCC margins in human liver tissue at a molecular level.

Encapsulation makes the difference! A &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based diphosphane ligand with metal confining properties is key in the stabilization of heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202214638), Nicola Armaroli, B&#233;atrice Delavaux&#8208;Nicot, Jean&#8208;Fran&#231;ois Nierengarten and Dominique Armspach show how encapsulation of the metal&#8208;bound diimine ligand moiety in the cyclodextrin cavity influences their electronic properties. In particular, flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state is largely prevented thus resulting in enhanced luminescent properties.

         <title>Approaching Dianionic Tetraoxadiborecine Macrocycles: 10&#8208;Membered Bora&#8208;Crown Ethers Incorporating Borafluorenate Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of dianionic tetraoxadiborecines are isolated via the reaction between 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanion and non&#8208;benzenoid quinones. Remarkably, the bora&#8208;crown ether ring is able to capture a sodium ion from sodium tetrakis[3.5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate. Additionally, the position and/or binding of the metal ions to the bora&#8208;crown are easily observable via specific color changes.







Abstract
The addition of non&#8208;benzenoid quinones, acenapthenequinone or aceanthrenequinone, to the 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanion (1) affords the first examples of dianionic 10&#8208;membered bora&#8208;crown ethers (2&#8211;5), which are characterized by multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 11B), X&#8208;ray crystallography, elemental analysis, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. These tetraoxadiborecines have distinct absorption profiles based on the positioning of the alkali metal cations. When compound 4, which has a vacant C4B2O4 cavity, is reacted with sodium tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate, a color change from purple to orange serves as a visual indicator of metal binding to the central ring, whereby the Na+ ion coordinates to four oxygen atoms. A detailed theoretical analysis of the calculated reaction energetics is provided to gain insight into the reaction mechanism for the formation of 2&#8211;5. These data, and the electronic structures of proposed intermediates, indicate that the reaction proceeds via a boron enolate intermediate.

         <title>Single Atom Ring Contraction of Peptide Macrocycles Using Cornforth Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The notion of late&#8208;stage, site&#8208;selective chemistry to modify chemical structures is of growing interest and utility. Here, we perform a single&#8208;atom ring contraction in macrocyclic backbones using the Cornforth rearrangement. This chemistry could be used to rapidly access unique chemical space which would be difficult to achieve using a standard building block approach.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective transformations of densely functionalized scaffolds have been a topic of intense interest in chemical synthesis. Herein we have repurposed the rarely used Cornforth rearrangement as a tool to effect a single&#8208;atom ring contraction in cyclic peptide backbones. Investigations into the kinetics of the rearrangement were carried out to understand the impact of electronic factors, ring size, and linker type on the reaction efficiency. Conformational analysis was undertaken and showed how subtle differences in the peptide backbone result in substrate&#8208;dependent reaction profiles. This methodology can now be used to perform conformation&#8208;activity studies. The chemistry also offers an opportunity to install building blocks that are not compatible with traditional C&#8208;to&#8208;N iterative synthesis of macrocycle precursors.

         <title>C&#8722;H Fluoromethoxylation of Arenes by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of [N&#8722;OCH2F] redox&#8208;active reagents were synthetized via electrodecarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;O coupling of N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazoles with fluoroacetic acid and subsequent alkylation. By irradiation with blue LEDs in the presence of a photosensitizer, these bench stable reagents allow the synthesis of monofluoromethyl aryl ethers via functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active N&#8208;(fluoromethoxy)benzotriazoles were made accessible from fluoroacetic acid and hydroxybenzotriazoles via electrodecarboxylative coupling. After alkylation, they become effective monofluoromethoxylation reagents, enabling the photocatalytic C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes. Thus, irradiation of 1&#8208;(OCH2F)&#8208;3&#8208;Me&#8208;6&#8208;(CF3)benzotriazolium triflate with blue LED light in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2] promotes the synthesis of diversely functionalized aryl monofluoromethyl ethers. This method allows the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically relevant structures without relying on ecologically problematic halofluorocarbons.
