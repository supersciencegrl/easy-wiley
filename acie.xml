         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Triggered Cascade Nanosystems for Spatiotemporally Controlled Gene&#8208;Silencing and Gas Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the tremendous potential of DNAzymes in gene therapy, achieving gene regulation with spatiotemporal precision and satisfactory efficacy remains a key challenge. Herein, we developed a near&#8208;infrared light (NIR)&#8208;triggered cascade effect system that enables precise spatiotemporal gene silencing and gas&#8208;synergistic cancer therapy. This nanoplatform was constructed using an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme, a nitric oxide (NO) precursor, and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The UCNPs act as light converters, facilitating the precursor to produce NO under NIR light irradiation, while the generated NO not only participates directly in gas therapy but also induces the upregulation of cytoplasmic APE1 level, resulting in enhanced DNAzyme activation and spatially controlled gene silencing. By leveraging this mechanism, cascade effects mediated gas&#8208;gene synergistic therapy is achieved through the combination of NIR light&#8208;controlled NO release and APE1&#8208;activatable gene therapy. We demonstrated that this nanoplatform enables enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. This strategy represents a critical step forward in the quest for highly targeted and efficient cancer treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Property Prediction of Bio&#8208;Derived Block Copolymer Thermoplastic Elastomers Using Graph Kernel Methods</title>

Abstract
Increasing the diversity of bio&#8208;based polymers is needed to address the combined problems of plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The magnitude of the problems necessitates rapid discovery of new materials; however, identification of appropriate chemistries maybe slow using current iterative methods. Machine learning (ML) methods could significantly expedite new material discovery and property identification. Here, PolyAGM, a ML algorithm using graph kernel methods, is introduced and used to predict the properties of block copolymers and identify the responsible structural &#8216;motifs&#8217;. It applies a &#8220;fingerprinting&#8221; method to convert Graph representations of polymers into numerical vectors. The Graphs explicitly encode the entire copolymer of atoms and bonds such that the sequencing of chemical features and polymer chain length are included, alongside relevant stereochemical information. PolyAGM gives predictions for both thermal and mechanical properties that are in good agreement with experimental measurements. This work focuses on predicting the properties of bio&#8208;derived ABA&#8208;block polymer thermoplastic elastomers, but the general fingerprinting technique of PolyAGM should be relevant to other application fields.

         <title>IrPdCuFeNiCoMo Based Core&#8208;Shell Icosahedron Nanocrystals and Nanocages for Efficient and Robust Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;shell structured icosahedron nanocrystals featured with PdCu core and IrPdCuFeNiCoMo high entropy alloy shell were deliberately designed and synthesized and sequential chemical etching of PdCu core results in IrPdCuFeNiCoMo high entropy alloy nanocages, which show robust performance towards acidic oxygen evolution reaction, delivering an overpotential of 235&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintain stable over 900&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.







Abstract
Facets engineering of high entropy alloy (HEA) nanocrystals might be achieved via shape&#8208;controlled synthesis, which is promising but remains challenging in designing Ir&#8208;based catalysts towards efficient and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic medium. Herein, icosahedra nanocrystals featured with PdCu core and IrPdCuFeNiCoMo shell were prepared by wet&#8208;chemical reduction in one&#8208;pot, ascribing to the initial formation PdCu core and subsequent deposition and diffusion of IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA shell. Sequential selective chemical etching of PdCu core results in IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA nanocages, delivering an overpotential of 235&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 51.0&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and 1624&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 at 1.50&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode in a conventional three electrode cell. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, it delivers a low cell voltage of 1.65 and 1.77&#8197;V at a current density of 1.0 and 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and maintains stable over 900&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations attribute the enhanced intrinsic activity to the broad distribution of the binding energy for OER intermediates on IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA, which breaks the linear scaling relationship and accelerates the OER process.

         <title>Unlocking the Ultrafast Deposition Kinetics within Bi&#8208;Tailored Core&#8208;Shell Structured Carbon Nanofibers for Highly Efficient and Ultrastable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous amorphous carbon nanofiber embedded with Bi nanoparticles in the void spaces (Bi@NC) serves as a core&#8211;shell structured Na metal host. The in&#8208;situ formed Na3Bi facilitates rapid nucleation and ion diffusion, enabling uniform Na plating within the cavities and a stable SEI outside the carbon nanofiber. This design ensures high&#8208;rate performance and cycle stability, thereby providing a testament to its suitability in Na metal anode chemistry.







Abstract
Sodium metal anodes (SMA), featuring high energy content, low electrochemical potential and easy availability, are a compelling option for sustainable energy storage. However, notorious sodium dendrite and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) have largely retarded their widespread implantation. Herein, porous amorphous carbon nanofiber embedded with Bi nanoparticles in nanopores (Bi@NC) was rationally designed as a 3D host for SMA. In situ and ex situ characterizations, along with theoretical simulations unlock that the in&#8208;situ formed Na&#8722;Bi alloy significantly accelerates sodium metal nucleation and sodium ion diffusion kinetics, enabling uniform sodium plating within the void spaces and a stable SEI outside the carbon nanofiber. Particularly, the Bi@NC electrode achieved a high coulombic efficiency of 99.99&#8201;% at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in half&#8208;cell tests, a cycle life of 1000&#8197;hours at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and sustained performance over 600 cycles under harsh conditions under 30&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 within symmetrical cells. The full battery assembled with a Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode and Bi@NC anode delivered long&#8208;term cyclability over 800 cycles, demonstrating its potential for flexible application of sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems. This work highlights the Bi@NC electrode as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance and flexible sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Amplified Cascade Catalysis for RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amplified cascade catalysis consisting of glucose oxidase (GOx) deoxygenation and Fenton reaction is reported and applied to reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The two catalysts used in this amplified cascade catalysis can interact with each other, enabling regeneration of ferrocene catalyst and thus enhancing hydroxyl radical production and polymerization rate. The concept of amplified cascade catalysis and the way how a biocatalyst recycles a chemical catalyst to enhance catalysis efficiency may inspire development of sustainable and ecofriendly catalytic methodologies for organic and material synthesis.







Abstract
We report a conceptually new amplified cascade catalysis that converts oxygen to hydroxyl radical for controlled RAFT polymerization. This catalysis consists of two sequential reactions, deoxygenation catalyzed by glucose oxidase and Fenton reaction catalyzed by ferrocene. The two catalysts can communicate with each other, leading to ferrocene recycling and hence amplification in radical generation. Ferrocene recycling was confirmed by UV/Vis spectroscopy, molecular docking simulation, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as polymerization studies. This catalysis was applied to RAFT polymerization of various monomers, yielding well&#8208;defined homopolymers and diblock copolymers with controlled molecular weights and low dispersities. Poly(N,N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide) with molecular weight over 1 million g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 was also successfully synthesized under ambient conditions. Ferrocene&#8208;functionalized microspheres were prepared and used as recyclable Fenton catalyst for five consecutive polymerizations with minimal declination in monomer conversion, which further improved the ecofriendly character of this polymerization methodology.

         <title>A Generally Applicable Method for Disentangling the Effect of Individual Noncovalent Interactions on the Binding Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fragment&#8208;pairwise Local Energy Decomposition (fp&#8208;LED) Scheme is introduced for precise quantification of individual interactions within complex molecular systems. Applications across diverse fields, encompassing protein&#8208;ligand binding energies and association energies in large biomolecular assemblies, showcase the versatility and broad applicability of this approach.







Abstract
We introduce the fragment&#8208;pairwise Local Energy Decomposition (fp&#8208;LED) scheme for precise quantification of individual interactions contributing to the binding energy of arbitrary chemical entities, such as protein&#8208;ligand binding energies, lattice energies of molecular crystals, or association energies of large biomolecular assemblies. Using fp&#8208;LED, we can assess whether the contribution to the binding energy arising from noncovalent interactions between pairs of molecular fragments in any chemical system is attractive or repulsive, and accurately quantify its magnitude at the coupled cluster level &#8208; commonly considered as the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; of computational chemistry. Such insights are crucial for advancing molecular and material design strategies in fields like catalysis and therapeutic development. Illustrative applications across diverse fields demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of this theoretical framework, promising profound implications for fundamental understanding and practical applications.

         <title>Precisely Tuning Band Gaps of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Based MOFs Toward Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research is the first example to introduce systematic substituents and large conjugated aromatic structure (13 benzene rings) into a long&#8208;range ordered framework simultaneously and achieved directionally modification of nanographene&#8208;containing MOFs. These twelve MOFs exhibited broad and tunable band gaps over 1.41&#8197;eV (ranging from 3.25&#8197;eV to 1.84&#8197;eV), and the photocatalytic CO2 conversion rate raised by 33.2&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Precise adjusting the band gaps in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is crucial for improving their visible&#8208;light absorption capacity during photocatalysis, presenting both a formidable challenge and a charming opportunity. This present study employed a symmetry&#8208;reduction strategy to pre&#8208;design six novel 4&#8208;connected ligands with systematic substituents (&#8722;NO2, &#8208;H, &#8208;tBu, &#8208;OCH3, &#8208;OH and &#8208;NH2) and synthesized the corresponding pillared&#8208;layer Zr&#8208;MOFs (NKM&#8208;668) retaining the hexaphenylbenzene fragment. Subsequently, the NKM&#8208;668 MOFs were transformed into large&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated hexabenzocoronene&#8208;based MOFs (pNKM&#8208;668) via the Scholl reaction. These twelve MOFs exhibited broad and tunable band gaps over 1.41&#8197;eV (ranging from 3.25&#8197;eV to 1.84&#8197;eV), and the photocatalytic CO2 conversion rate raised by 33.2&#8208;fold. This study not only enriches the type of hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;based MOFs, but also paves the way for nanographene&#8208;containing MOFs in the further application of photocatalysis.

         <title>mPatch: A Wearable Hydrogel Microneedle Patch for In Vivo Optical Sensing of Calcium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intradermal sensing platform featuring a handheld complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) sensor to detect fluorescence from aptamer&#8208;containing, transparent hydrogel embedded in the dermis. Aptamers conjugated to the hydrogel change fluorescence dynamically in response to the concentration of calcium ions in the interstitial fluid.







Abstract
This study presents an in vivo optical hydrogel microneedle platform that measures levels of analytes in interstitial fluid. The platform builds on a previously published technique for molding hydrogel microneedles by developing a composite hydrogel (i.e., PEGDA and polyacrylamide) that is sufficiently stiff to penetrate skin in the hydrated state and whose fluorescence changes dynamically&#8211;via a conjugated aptamer&#8211;depending on level of analyte. In a demonstration relevant to hypercalcemia, the hydrogel microneedle distinguished varying concentrations of calcium (within a range of 0 to 2&#8197;mM, which spans physiologically meaningful variations for hypoparathyroidism) within 10&#8197;minutes. In rats, a compact CMOS sensor measuring fluorescence from microneedles distinguished low hypercalcemic (1.7&#8197;mM) from high hypercalcemic (2.3&#8197;mM) ionized calcium levels as determined from reference blood measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates in vivo feasibility of a concept&#8211;which we call mPatch&#8211;for an optical hydrogel microneedle to measure small changes in levels of analytes in interstitial fluid, which does not rely on extraction of interstitial fluid out of the dermis.

         <title>Bridged Carbolong Modulating Interfacial Charge Transfer Enhancement for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridged Carbolong Modulating for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells: A bridged carbolong modulating strategy to regulate the perovskite/C60 to accelerate interfacial electron transfer, reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination and suppress ion migration. The photo&#8208; and thermal&#8208;stable devices reached 25.80% of efficiency and maintained 98% of its initial efficiency over 1400 h of illumination, and the efficiency of modules achieved 20.72% (25.25 cm2 active area) with robust operational stability.







Abstract
Efficient regulation of perovskite/C60 interface is crucial to improving the long&#8208;term stability of the inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, precise methods for controlling the perovskite/C60 interface have yet to be thoroughly explored. Herein, we develop a carbolong chemical manipulation strategy to improve the interface contact of perovskite/C60 due to versatile functional groups and excellent optoelectronic properties of carbolong metallaaromatics. And constructing an electron&#8208;transfer bridge enhances the interfacial interaction and accelerates interfacial electron transfer. The carbolong manipulation results in optimized energy level alignment, suppressed nonradiative recombination, and improved electronic contact. An impressive efficiency of 25.80% is demonstrated, with open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor of 1.19&#8201;V and 84.53&#8201;%, respectively. The unsealed devices retain more than 98&#8201;% of their original efficiency after 1400&#8197;h of maximum power point tracking under illumination and demonstrate remarkable thermal stability, maintaining 93&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2500&#8197;h at 85&#8201;&#176;C in a nitrogen atmosphere. And the encapsulated carbolong&#8208;modified module achieved a high efficiency of 20.72&#8201;% (active area of 25.25 cm2) with robust operation stability.

         <title>General and Fast Gas&#8211;Solid Synthesis of Functional MXenes and Derivatives on the Scale of Tens of Grams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;solid reaction system with high selectivity, controllability and compatibility enables fast etching, doping and transformation of MAX phases and the large&#8208;scale production of MXenes and their derivatives. The as&#8208;obtained samples exhibit excellent capability in effectively reducing the shutting effect of lithium polysulfides via chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion as evidenced by both of theoretical and experimental results.







Abstract
The rising of MXenes not only enriches the two&#8208;dimensional material family but also brings more opportunities for diverse functional applications. However, the controllable synthesis of MXenes is still unsatisfied via the common liquid&#8208;solid etching route, considering the unsolved problems like safety risk, time cost and easy oxidation. Herein, a facile yet efficient gas&#8208;solid (G&#8208;S) reaction methodology is devised by using hydrogen fluoride gas derived from fluorinated organics as the MAX etchant toward high&#8208;efficiency fabrication of multiple MXenes and their derivatives. The innovative G&#8208;S reaction strategy exhibits superb versatility to achieve different gram&#8208;level MXenes (V2C, Ti3C2, Nb2C, Ti2N, Ti3CN, (Mo2/3Y1/3)2C) in a very short time, and even realizes in situ heteroatom doping or synchronous phase conversion of MXenes directly from MAX phases. The obtained MXenes and their derivatives exhibit excellent structure stability and high electron/ion conductivity, making them promising materials for electrochemical applications. In particular, the N&#8208;doped V2C MXene shows superior adsorption and catalytic activity toward lithium polysulfides for advanced lithium sulfur batteries.

         <title>Asymmetric S&#8208;Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Axially Chiral Sulfilimines Enabled by Anionic Stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Cobalt(III) Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
An adaptive Cu/anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Co(III) complex combined catalysis is established for the enantioselective S&#8208;arylation of sulfenamides, precisely accessing various multi&#8208;chiral sulfilimines with excellent efficiencies and selectivity (67 examples, 12 possible isomers, up to 98&#8201;% ee). The S&#8208;arylation/pyramidal inversion sequence enables efficient stereodivegent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of multi&#8208;chiral sulfilimines.







Abstract
An efficient enantioselective coupling reaction between sulfenamides and cyclic diaryliodonium salts is established via adaptive Cu/anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Co(III) complex combined catalysis, precisely synthesizing a broad range of axially chiral sulfilimines with excellent enantioselectivities, diastereoselectivities, regioselectivities, and chemoselectivities (67 examples under same conditions, up to 98&#8201;% ee). The following thermodynamically controlled pyramidal inversion enables efficient stereodivegent synthesis of all four stereoisomers. Mechanistic studies suggest that anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III) complexes serve as counteranions of diaryliodonium and anionic ligand of Cu(I) catalyst simultaneously, which could be regarded as an explanation for outstanding selectivities.

         <title>Dual Zn5&#8208;NiS4 Sites in a Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enables Efficient Cascade Catalysis for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia (eNO3RR) offers a promising solution to both environmental pollution and the sustainable energy conversion. Here we propose an efficient cascade catalytic mechanism based on a dual Zn5&#8208;NiS4 sites, orderly assembled in a redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;organic framework structure, which separately promotes the reaction kinetics of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;nitrite and nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversions. Specifically, the Zn5 clusters adsorb and selectively reduce the NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;, whereas [NiS4] acts as an analogue to the ferredoxins, subsequently boosts the reduction of NO2&#8722; to produce NH3. To this end, the bimetallic Zn5&#8208;NiS4TP MOF was synthesized based on the redox&#8208;active ligand [Ni(C2S2(TPCOOH)2)2]. A maximum ammonia production rate of 23650.63 &#181;g&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;mg&#8722;1site and faradaic efficiency 92.57% was achived by Zn5&#8208;NiS4TP MOF under neutral conditions. To validate the critical role of dual Zn5&#8208;NiS4 sites, Mn5&#8208;NiS4TP and Cd2&#8208;NiS4TP were synthesized as control samples, together with Zn&#8208;TTFTB, Zn&#8208;NiS4Ph and other Zn5&#8208;cluster&#8208;based MOFs applied for the investigation of electrocatalytic nitrate reduction. Our results indicated that substitution by &#8208;thienyl instead of &#8208;phenyl group increases the S&#8208;heteroatom content, improves the conductivity and facilitates electron transfer. Furthermore, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of the energy changes for the reduction of each species could rationalize experimental results.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) relies on effectively managing the interface between the hole extraction layer and the light&#8208;absorbing perovskite layer. In this study, we have synthesised (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (MeS&#8208;4PACz), which forms a self&#8208;assembled monolayer on the fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode. The molecule's methylthio substituents generate a favourable interfacial dipole moment and interact with the perovskite layer. This interaction results in well&#8208;aligned energy levels among the FTO/SAM/perovskite layers, promoting efficient hole extraction and significantly reducing carrier recombination losses. Additionally, the methylthio groups passivate iodide vacancies and interact with Pb2+ ions of the perovskite, reducing defect&#8208;induced trap states and enhancing the crystalline growth of the perovskite layer. Consequently, inverted PSCs incorporating MeS&#8208;4PACz achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.13%, along with outstanding photostability.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Fused vs 575&#8208;Ringed Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;Systems: Selective Synthesis, Reactivity and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of heteroatoms and/or non&#8208;hexagonal rings into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can alter their intrinsic structures and physical properties. However, it is challenging to construct PAHs featuring boron/carbon composition and non&#8208;hexagonal combination. Herein, we disclose the selective synthesis of spiro&#8208;type and pentagon/heptagon&#8208;containing boron&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems by the Scholl reaction. Two spiro&#8208;fused organoboranes 1 and 2 and one 575&#8208;ringed boron&#8208;doped nanographene 3 were synthesized. The key point is that the boron&#8208;edged &#960;&#8208;system enabled unexpected spiro&#8208;formation via dearomatization, whereas the boron&#8208;centered &#960;&#8208;system enabled desired 575&#8208;ringed &#960;&#8208;extension via cyclodehydrogenation. The thus&#8208;obtained molecules exhibit the intriguing but fully distinct reactivity, electronic structures and properties, for instance, while 2 may react with Br&#248;nsted acid to display reversible chemochromism and further convert into 1, 3 possesses very broad absorption, short excited&#8208;state lifetime and no fluorescence nature. As disclosed, the boron atom together with the spirocycle region or 575&#8208;ringed structural motif significantly contribute to their characteristic properties. Thus, this study sheds light on control over the Scholl reaction using organoborane &#960;&#8208;systems and will promote the exploration of more sophisticated polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems as organic reactive and optical scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalysed 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalisation: Sulfoximines as N&#8208; and O&#8208;Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the nucleophilic oxidants employed in the gold&#8208;catalysed oxidation of alkynes, sulphur&#8208;based reagents have played a substantial role since the beginning, granting access to the respective gold carbene intermediates. Herein, we describe the first example of the substance class of sulfoximines being used as atom transfer reagents to alkynes in gold catalysis. Based on the transformation of N&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl) sulfoximines to 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones, it is demonstrated that the sulfoximine functionality is capable of selectively transferring first its nitrogen moiety to the alkyne, forming the &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene, which is then oxidised by the released sulfoxide moiety in a second step via a pseudo&#8208;intramolecular mechanism &#8211; a distinctive feature that differentiates this work mechanistically from earlier studies. A combination of extensive experimental and theoretical studies provides evidence for this mechanistic rationale. As no external reagents for the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalisation of the alkyne unit are required, a wide variety of functional groups are tolerated in the transformation, affording the desired 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones in mostly good yields. It was further also showcased that it is possible to combine our methodology with additional transformations of the 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;one core in one&#8208;pot procedures, allowing facile access to C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one structures.</dc:description>

Herein, we describe the first example of the substance class of sulfoximines being used as atom transfer reagents to alkynes in gold catalysis. Based on the transformation of N-(2-alkynylphenyl) sulfoximines to 3H-indol-3-ones, it is demonstrated that the sulfoximine functionality is capable of selectively transferring first its nitrogen moiety to the alkyne, forming the &#945;-imino gold carbene, which is then oxidised by the released sulfoxide moiety in a second step via a pseudo-intramolecular mechanism &#8211; a distinctive feature that differentiates this work mechanistically from earlier studies. A combination of extensive experimental and theoretical studies provides evidence for this mechanistic rationale. As no external reagents for the 1,2-difunctionalisation of the alkyne unit are required, a wide variety of functional groups are tolerated in the transformation, affording the desired 3H-indol-3-ones in mostly good yields. It was further also showcased that it is possible to combine our methodology with additional transformations of the 3H-indol-3-one core in one-pot procedures, allowing facile access to C2-quaternary indolin-3-one structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Control of Bilayer Transport through a Photoswitchable Membrane&#8208;Stiffening Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mobility of proteins in the bilayer membrane is affected by (local) changes in lipid environment, which is important to their biological functioning. Artificial molecular systems that &#8211; to some extent &#8211; imitate tasks of membrane&#8208;embedded proteins are increasingly developed, however, they are usually controlled through responsive units in their core structure. Here we present an alternative approach based on an amphiphilic stiff&#8208;stilbene derivative that enables control of membrane fluidity by light. The fluidity increase upon E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization is shown to enhance the activity of known synthetic anion transporters as a result of a higher mobility. The photoisomerization process is studied by UV&#8208;vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy in solution and in POPC vesicles, where the light&#8208;induced changes in fluidity and hence, activity of anion transporters, are monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Dynamic light&#8208;scattering (DLS) and cryo&#8208;EM studies show that vesicle integrity is not impaired by photoswitching. Our work introduces a versatile approach to control solute transport by carrier molecules. Moreover, the photocontrol over membrane fluidity and, with that, mobility could eventually be used for directed motion, which we expect to be key in achieving active transport in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Impact of Aromatic Linkers in Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers on the Performance of Monolithic Perovskite/Si Tandem Photovoltaic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic linker&#8208;constructed self&#8208;assembled monolayers (Ar&#8208;SAMs)&#160; can modulate the&#160;work function of indium tin oxide (ITO), thereby improving hole extraction/transport&#160;efficiency. However, the specific role of the aromatic linkers between the polycyclic&#160;head and the anchoring groups of SAMs in determining the performance of perovskite&#160;solar cells (PSCs) remains unclear. In this study, we developed a series of&#160;phenothiazine&#8208;based Ar&#8208;SAMs to investigate how different aromatic linkers could affect&#160;molecular stacking, the regulation of substrate work function, and charge carrier&#160;dynamics. When served as hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) in PSCs and monolithic
perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (P/S&#8208;TSCs), we found that the Ar&#8208;SAM with&#160;naphthalene linker along the 2,6&#8208;position axis (&#946;&#8208;Nap) could form dense and highly&#160;ordered HSLs, enhancing interfacial interactions and favoring optimal energy level&#160;alignment with the perovskite films. Using this strategy, the optimized wide&#8208;bandgap
PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.86% with&#160;negligible hysteresis, utilizing a 1.68 eV perovskite. Additionally, the encapsulated&#160;devices demonstrated enhanced stability under damp&#8208;heat conditions (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2, 50%&#160;RH, 65&#176;C) with a T91 of 1000 hours. Notably, the fabricated P/S&#8208;TSCs, based on&#160;solution&#8208;processed micron&#8208;scale textured silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells,&#160;achieved an efficiency of 28.89% with outstanding reproducibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Control of TRPM8 Channels with Photoswitchable Menthol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channels are well known as sensors for cold temperatures and cooling agents such as menthol and icilin and these channels are tightly regulated by the membrane lipid phosphoinositol&#8208;4,5&#8208;bisphosphate (PIP2). Since TRPM8 channels emerged as promising drug targets for treating pain, itching, obesity, cancer, dry eye disease, and inflammation, we aimed at developing a high&#8208;precision TRPM8 channel activator, to achieve spatiotemporal control of TRPM8 activity with light. In this study, we designed, synthesized and characterized the first photoswitchable TRPM8 activator azo&#8208;menthol (AzoM). AzoM enables optical control of endogenously and heterologously expressed TRPM8 channels with UV and blue light which is demonstrated by performing patch&#8208;clamp experiments. Moreover, AzoM facilitates the reliable determination of activation, inactivation, and deactivation kinetics thereby providing further insights into the channel gating. Using AzoM, the specific roles of individual amino acids for AzoM or PIP2 binding and for sensitization by PIP2 can be elucidated. Altogether, AzoM represents as a high&#8208;precision pharmaceutical tool for reversible control of TRPM8 channel function that enhances our biophysical understanding of TRPM8 channels and holds the potential to support the development of novel pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion by Limiting Interfacial Hydroxyl Radicals Using Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to ethanol with high selectivity is attractive but substantially challenging. The activation of inert C&#8211;H bonds at ambient conditions requires highly reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH), while the presence of those oxidative species also facilitates fast formation of C1 products, instead of the kinetically sluggish C&#8211;C coupling to produce ethanol. Herein, we developed a BiVO4 photocatalyst with surface functionalization of Au nanoparticles (BiVO4@Au), which not only enables photogeneration of &#183;OH to activate CH4 into &#183;CH3, but also in&#8208;situ consumes those &#183;OH species to retard their further attack on &#183;CH3, resulting in an enhanced &#183;CH3/&#183;OH ratio and facilitating C&#8211;C coupling toward ethanol. The &#183;CH3/&#183;OH ratio is further improved by transporting CH4 via a gas&#8208;diffusion layer to the photocatalytic interface, leading to even higher ethanol selectivity and production rates. At ambient conditions and without photosensitizers or sacrificial agents, the BiVO4@Au photocatalyst exhibited an outstanding CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion performance, including a peak ethanol yield of 680 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1, a high selectivity of 86%, and a stable photoconversion of &gt; 100 h, substantially exceeding most of the previous reports. Our work suggests an attractive approach of in&#8208;situ generation and modulation of the &#183;OH levels for photocatalytic CH4 conversion toward multi&#8208;carbon products.</dc:description>

         <title>General and Versatile Nanoarchitectonics for Amino Acid&#8208;Based Glasses via Co&#8208;Assembly of Organic Counterions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid&#8208;based biomolecular glasses represent an emerging material to meet the demand for sustainable development. However, most amino acids are difficult to vitrify due to their strong crystallization tendency, limiting further advancements of this field. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of counterions effectively suppresses crystallization, as hydrogen bonds within the system stabilize the disordered structures. Based on this, we propose a counterion co&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize a wide range of amino acid&#8208;based glasses. This strategy enables the facile fabrication of glass with customizable shapes, high mechanical rigidity, and tunable multicolor fluorescence, ranging from blue to red depending on the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, this strategy allows the integration and enhancement of counterion properties within the glass matrix. Through the co&#8208;assembly of phosphorescent counterions, we synthesized a series of long&#8208;persistent luminescent glasses with significantly extended afterglow lifetimes.

However, most amino acids are difficult to vitrify due to their strong crystallization tendency, limiting further advancements of this field. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of counterions effectively suppresses crystallization, as hydrogen bonds within the system stabilize the disordered structures. Based on this, we propose a counterion co-assembly strategy to synthesize a wide range of amino acid-based glasses. This strategy enables the facile fabrication of glass with customizable shapes, high mechanical rigidity, and tunable multicolor fluorescence, ranging from blue to red depending on the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, this strategy allows the integration and enhancement of counterion properties within the glass matrix. Through the co-assembly of phosphorescent counterions, we synthesized a series of long-persistent luminescent glasses with significantly extended afterglow lifetimes. This work presents an effective approach for the synthesis of amino acid-based glasses and provides insights into the development of supramolecular glasses with tailored functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halting Oxygen Evolution to Achieve Long Cycle Life in Sodium Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen redox chemistries at high voltage have materialized as a revolutionary paradigm for cathodes with high&#8208;energy density; however, they are plagued by the challenges of labile oxygen loss and rapid degradations upon cycling, even after concerted endeavors from the research community. Here we propose a multi&#8208;concentration stratagem propelled by entropy reinforcement to enhance the electronic structure disorder (ESD) at high desodiation states for impeding undesired oxygen mobility and ensuring controlled oxygen activity, elucidated by density functional theory calculations. The increased disorder strengthens the reversible electrochemistry of lattice oxygen redox, leading to effectively suppressed P&#8208;O structural evolution and highly stable localized TMO6 octahedral environments, as demonstrated by soft/hard X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, we reveal that a high&#8208;entropy state induced by cationic disordering has capacity to perturb cationic redox boundaries, significantly restraining the formation of detrimental P3' phases. As a consequence, the high&#8208;voltage cycling stability has been greatly enhanced, up to 4.4 V versus Na+/Na, with an impressive 90.1% capacity retention at 1C over 100 cycles and 76.1% capacity retention at 2C over 300 cycles. The resilient oxygen redox, enabled through the control of ESD, broadens the horizons for entropy engineering and lays the foundation for advancements in high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;cycling, safe batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote On&#8208;Paper Electrochemiluminescence&#8208;Based High&#8208;Safety and Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating needs in information protection underscore the urgency of developing advanced encryption strategies. Herein we report a novel chemical approach that enables information encryption by on&#8208;paper electrochemiluminescence (ECL). Dendritic porous silica nanospheres modified with polyetherimide and bovine serum albumin were prepared as the chemical ink to write the secret message on a paper. Attaching the paper to an electrode, immersing it in a solution containing tris(2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium (Ru(bpy)32+) and then applying a suitable voltage, a remote &#8220;catalytic route&#8221; electrochemical reaction produces ECL that functions as the key to decrypt and visualize the message by imaging. In addition, proteins can be also used as the biological ink to write the secret message, which is then decrypted by a combined use of immunochemistry and ECL imaging as two keys. We believe the ECL&#8208;based strategy holds great promise in high&#8208;safety and multilevel information encryption, as it is protected not only by encoding, like conventional invisible inks, but also by the unique ECL decoding approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Radical Mediated Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis in Conjugate&#8208;Enhanced Phenolic Resins with Ultrafast Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is essential for the development of highly efficient polymeric photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Nevertheless, the non&#8208;uniform molecular structures and sluggish reaction pathway of polymeric photocatalysts lead to low conversion efficiency. In this work, we report sulfur&#8208;contained phenolic resins with regulated conjugation for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Due to the substitution of sulfur for methylene in the phenolic resin structure, the conjugation degree of the material is adjusted, resulting in the formation of a built&#8208;in electric field. This effectively enhances the charge separation capability, enabling charge carriers to react faster with substrates. Through in&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical calculations, we have unveiled that the introduction of sulfur can modulate the reaction pathway of phenolic resin materials, enabling a dual&#8208;pathway photocatalytic H2O2 production mediated by non&#8208;radical species. Impressively, the sulfur&#8208;contained resin photocatalyst showcases exceptional H2O2 production activity with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.4% exceeding most reported systems, and generates 25 mmol m&#8208;2 of H2O2 under natural sunlight through large&#8208;scale equipment. This work provides a facile strategy to separate the photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs of polymer photocatalysts to achieve efficient artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Induced Spin&#8208;State Switching Based on Fe(II)&#8208;Hg(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of molecular switches with tunable properties has garnered considerable interest over several decades. A novel spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) material based on iron(II) complexes incorporating 4&#8208;acetylpyridine (4&#8208;acpy) and [Hg(SCN)4]2&#8208; anions was synthesized and formulated as [Fe(4&#8208;acpy)2][Hg(&#956;&#8208;SCN)4] (1). Compound 1 is crystallized in a three&#8208;dimensional network in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric orthorhombic space group Pna21 with two octahedral [Fe(4&#8208;acpy)2(NCS)4] entities featuring two distinct Fe centers (Fe1 and Fe2). Crystallographic, magnetic, and M&#246;ssbauer measurements reveal an incomplete SCO exclusively at Fe2, with transition temperature T1/2 &#8776; 102 K. Photomagnetic studies conducted at 10 K with lasers ranging from 405 to 1310 nm evidence light&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (LIESST) and reverse&#8208;LIESST effects, with a unique near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive LIESST phenomenon at 1064 and 1310 nm. Advanced photocrystallographic studies at 40 K provide precise structural evidence for these metastable states. The optical and vibrational properties consistently corroborate with magnetic and photomagnetic studies. Additionally, temperature&#8208; and light&#8208;dependent terahertz (THz) absorptions are associated with phonon vibrations around Fe2 centers, through SCO behavior, as supported by ab initio calculation. The Fe(II)&#8208;Hg(II) systems can be promising benchmarks for exploring synergistic switching effects in structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing Zn Growth with Biased Adsorption of Straight&#8208;chain Molecules for Superior Zn Anode Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), which have attracted attentions in the field of energy storage, is affected by dendrites and side reactions of Zn anode, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance of AZIBs. Herein, we propose a biased adsorption strategy mediated by straight&#8208;chain molecule (Scm) for stabilizing Zn anode. The dual polar termini of Scms guaranties securely anchor themselves in a parallel orientation upon the Zn anode surface. This provides a comprehensive coverage, effectively sequestering water molecules from the Zn anode and precipitating the formation of a water&#8208;depleted electric double layer (EDL). Furthermore, the Scms selectively adsorb along the (002) crystallographic planes, guiding the deposition of Zn2+. Consequently, the incorporation of these Scms successfully mitigates anode corrosion, HER, and dendrites. The Zn||Zn, Zn||Cu and Zn||V6O13 cells with Scms display significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, especially at elevated temperature of 60 &#176;C. This work highlights the potential of cost&#8208;effective, straight&#8208;chain electrolyte additives for enhancing Zn anode stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering d&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization in a Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating lithium salt dissociation kinetics by enhancing the interaction between inorganic fillers and lithium salts is vital for enhancing the ionic conductivity in solid&#8208;state composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). However, the influence of fillers&#8217; external electronic environments on lithium salt dissociation dynamics remains unclear. Here, we design single&#8208;atom sites in metal&#8208;organic framework fillers for poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based CPEs, boosting lithium salt dissociation through an electrocatalytic strategy. This strategy enhances lithium&#8208;ion conductivity by tuning the coupling strength between the d and p orbitals of the fillers, as captured by a newly identified descriptor (&#955;) via high&#8208;throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Regulating lithium salt dissociation kinetics by enhancing the interaction between inorganic fillers and lithium salts is vital for enhancing the ionic conductivity in solid-state composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). However, the influence of fillers&#8217; external electronic environments on lithium salt dissociation dynamics remains unclear. Here, we design single-atom sites in metal-organic framework fillers for poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based CPEs, boosting lithium salt dissociation through an electrocatalytic strategy. This strategy enhances lithium-ion conductivity by tuning the coupling strength between the d and p orbitals of the fillers, as captured by a newly identified descriptor (&#955;) via high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning. The optimal single atom (Ti) sites are incorporated into a ZIF-8 matrix for PEO-based CPEs, achieving an ionic conductivity exceeding 10&#8315;&#179; S cm&#8315;&#185; at 30 &#176;C. Additionally, the electrolyte forms a robust solid electrolyte interphase and is compatible with LiCoO&#8322;, LiNi&#8320;.&#8329;Co&#8320;.&#8320;&#8325;Mn&#8320;.&#8320;&#8325;O&#8322;, and sulfur cathodes. Consequently, the solid-state lithium metal battery with the electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability, maintaining performance over 5000 cycles at 10 C with LiFePO&#8324; cathodes and stable operation at -30 &#176;C. These findings highlight the transformative potential of engineering d-p orbital hybridization by incorporating single-atom sites into inorganic fillers for designing highly ion-conductive CPEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sabatier Optimal of Mn&#8208;N4 Single Atom Catalysts for Selective Oxidative Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Sabatier relationship was realized by a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalyst with metal single atoms for regulating adsorption energies of two reactants in selective oxidative desulfurization. This relationship revealed reactivity descriptors of H2S&#8208;ODH for high performance in a wide range of O2 concentrations.







Abstract
Understanding the relationship of competitive adsorption between reactants is the prerequisite for high activity and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis, especially the difference between the adsorption energies (Eads) of two reactive intermediates in Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (L&#8722;H) models. Using oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S&#8208;ODH) as a probe, we develop various metal single atoms on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (M&#8208;NDC) catalysts for controlling Eads&#8208;H2S, Eads&#8208;O2 and investigating the difference in activity and selectivity. Combining theoretical and experimental results, a Sabatier relationship between the catalytic performance and Eads&#8208;O2/Eads&#8208;H2S emerges. Mn&#8208;NDC as the optimal catalyst shows excellent H2S conversion (&gt;90&#8201;%) and sulfur selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;%) in a wide range of O2 concentrations over 100&#8197;h. Such a high&#8208;efficiency performance is attributed to appropriate Eads&#8208;H2S and Eads&#8208;O2 on Mn&#8208;N4 sites, boosting redox cycle between Mn2+ and Mn3+, as well as preferential formation of sulfur. This work provides a fundamental guidance for designing Sabatier optimal catalysts in L&#8722;H models.

         <title>Expedited SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Inhibitor Discovery through Modular &#8216;Direct&#8208;to&#8208;Biology&#8217; Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology workflows promise to accelerate hit optimisation for drug discovery. Here, we describe a direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology method for the efficient synthesis and screening of cysteine&#8208;reactive fragments and its application in the optimisation of a micromolar inhibitor of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease towards nanomolar covalent analogues. Additionally, we describe an under&#8208;reported switch from the covalent series to a potent, non&#8208;covalent series.







Abstract
Reactive fragment (RF) screening has emerged as an efficient method for ligand discovery across the proteome, irrespective of a target's perceived tractability. To date, however, the efficiency of subsequent optimisation campaigns has largely been low&#8208;throughput, constrained by the need for synthesis and purification of target compounds. We report an efficient platform for &#8216;direct&#8208;to&#8208;biology&#8217; (D2B) screening of cysteine&#8208;targeting chloroacetamide RFs, wherein synthesis is performed in 384&#8208;well plates allowing direct assessment in downstream biological assays without purification. Here, the developed platform was used to optimise inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (MPro), an established drug target for the treatment of COVID&#8208;19. An initial RF hit was developed into a series of potent inhibitors, and further exploration using D2B screening enabled a &#8216;switch&#8217; to a reversible inhibitor series. This example of ligand discovery for MPro illustrates the acceleration that D2B chemistry can offer for optimising RFs towards covalent inhibitor candidates, as well as providing future impetus to explore the evolution of RFs into non&#8208;covalent ligands.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalysts: From Model to Reality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively utilized in catalytic reactions due to their fully exposed active sites and special electronic structure. This review summarizes the progress of 2D materials from model studies to application in catalysis and illustrates how 2D materials serve as models to explore structure&#8211;activity relationships by combining theoretical calculations and surface research.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been utilized broadly in kinds of catalytic reactions due to their fully exposed active sites and special electronic structure. Compared with real catalysts, which are usually bulk or particle, 2D materials have more well&#8208;defined structures. With easily identified structure&#8208;modulated engineering, 2D materials become ideal models to figure out the catalytic structure&#8208;function relations, which is helpful for the precise design of catalysts. In this review, the unique function of 2D materials was summarized from model study to reality catalysis and application. It includes several typical 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, metal, and metal (hydr)oxide materials. We introduced the structural characteristics of 2D materials and their advantages in model researches. It emphatically summarized how 2D materials serve as models to explore the structure&#8208;activity relationship by combining theoretical calculations and surface research. The opportunities of 2D materials and the challenges for fundamentals and applications they facing are also addressed. This review provides a reference for the design of catalyst structure and composition, and could inspire the realization of two&#8208;dimensional materials from model study to reality application in industry.

         <title>Configuration&#8208;Mediated Efficient Non&#8208;Radiative Transition for R848&#8208;Assisted Photothermal Immunotherapy to Inhibit Tumor Growth and Metastasis by An In Situ Tumor Vaccine Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of configuration&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative transition was observed in two isomers, namely CZTBT and LVTBT. Upon combination with R848, LVTBT@R848 NPs&#8208;induced photothermal immunotherapy could serve as an in&#8197;situ tumor vaccine, effectively inhibiting the growth of both primary and distant tumors, as well as restricted lung metastasis by activating the overwhelming immune response.







Abstract
Cancer metastasis remains a critical factor contributing to the current limitations in cancer treatment. Photothermal immunotherapy has emerged as a safe and potent therapeutic approach, demonstrating the capability to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. While researchers have extensively investigated various structural modifications to enhance photothermal conversion performance, the influence of molecular configuration has received comparatively limited attention. In this study, we synthesized two isomers, CZTBT and LVTBT, which possessed distinct configurations. LVTBT, characterized by a flatter molecular configuration, exhibited an extended absorption wavelength and a higher molar extinction coefficient. Its excited state facilitated stronger rotation for non&#8208;radiative transitions, leading to a high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.3&#8201;%. When combined with R848, LVTBT@R848 nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;mediated photothermal immunotherapy functioned as an in&#8197;situ tumor vaccine, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), T cell infiltration, and the differentiation of natural killer (NK) cells and memory T cells, thereby activating the strong immune response. Consequently, it significantly inhibited the growth of both primary and distant tumors, while also limiting lung metastasis. In summary, this study proposed a configuration&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative transition strategy for efficient photothermal immunotherapy, advancing the frontiers of organic photothermal agents (OPTAs) design and synthesis.

         <title>Regioregular Poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane): A Strictly Alternating BN&#8208;Isostere of Poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inorganic poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) analogue with a strictly alternating arrangement of BN units along the chain was prepared by an AB&#8208;polymerization process. The polymer and monodisperse oligomers show emission from locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) states, respectively, which can be addressed by various stimuli, giving rise to solvatochromic, thermochromic, and reversible mechanochromic behavior.







Abstract
Incorporation of BN units into &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds, as substitutes for specific CC couples, often leads to new hybrid materials with modified physical and chemical properties. Poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane)s are derived from well&#8208;known poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) by replacement of the vinylene groups by B=N linking units. Herein, an unprecedented poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane) is presented that features a strictly alternating sequence of BN units along the main chain. The synthesis thereof was achieved by AB&#8208;type polymerization of a monomer featuring an N and a B terminus. Monodisperse oligomers with up to three BN units in the chain were additionally prepared and structurally characterized. Associated with the introduction of a dipole in the regioregular backbone structure, they display notable fluorescence already in solution and large Stokes shifts, distinct from their previously reported BBNN&#8208;sequenced congeners. All compounds show aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) properties. Computational studies provided evidence for emission from either locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) states. These processes can be optionally addressed by various stimuli, giving rise to dual emission, solvatochromic, thermochromic, and reversible mechanochromic behavior.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Sensitive Layered Hybrid Double Perovskites Driven by a Dual&#8208;Ion&#8208;Woven Supramolecular Framework for X&#8208;Ray Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RP&#8208;like DJ&#8208;phase layered hybrid double perovskites (LHDPs) constructed by an unprecedented dual&#8208;ion&#8208;woven supramolecular framework are developed to boost interlayer charge transport, achieving a record&#8208;high sensitivity of 5250&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 among all the reported LHDP materials. A large&#8208;area [00l]&#8208;oriented composite membrane is prepared to obtain a high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray tomography, showcasing superior next&#8208;generation radiographic potential.







Abstract
A promising candidate for X&#8208;ray detection is layered hybrid double perovskites (LHDPs) with excellent structural stability, but their sensitivity is generally limited by unsatisfactory interlayer charge transport. Herein, employing one ethylenediamine (EDA) chain as a structural inducer, we successfully obtain unusual Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) phase LHDPs, (EDABr)4AgBiBr8 and (EDABr)4CuBiBr8, featuring a Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper&#8208;like (RP&#8208;like) interlayer. Thanks to the bridging of bromine anions, organic cations are linked via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds, where two ionic spacers are orderly woven into a supramolecular framework. Consequently, the RP&#8208;like interlayer space is regulated by the dual&#8208;ion&#8208;woven supramolecular framework with embedded charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bond networks, remarkably enriching interlayer interactions and boosting charge transport. Through theoretical calculations, structural roles of the supramolecular framework are elucidated by extra orbital contribution and large diffusion barrier of Br anions. As proof of concept, the sensitivity of RP&#8208;like devices up to 5250&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is a record&#8208;high of LHDP&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors for now, while a low detection limit (91&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1) and outstanding radiation&#8208;resistant capability (50&#8197;Gyair) are achieved. Moreover, an oriented membrane device is prepared to demonstrate high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray tomography. These findings offer a brand&#8208;new interlayer&#8208;modulation strategy for the construction of sensitive and stable scintillation semiconductors.

         <title>Nuclear Quantum Effects Have a Significant Impact on UV/Vis Absorption Spectra of Chromophores in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures of the isolated indole molecule as well as indole dissolved in water were sampled with and without consideration of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). For each sampled structure, electronic excitation energies were calculated using a wavefunction&#8208;based method called ADC(2) for generating UV/Vis absorption spectra. Shapes and solvatochromism observed in the measured spectra were reproduced only when NQEs were considered in the sampling.







Abstract
Despite the broadly acknowledged importance of solvation effects on measured UV/Vis spectra in the context of solvatochromism or chemical reactions in solution, it is still an open challenge to calculate UV/Vis spectra with predictive accuracy. This is particularly true when it comes to the impact of nuclear quantum effects on these experimental observables. In the present work, we calculate the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of indole in aqueous solution with a combination of a correlated wavefunction method for computing electronic excitation energies and enhanced path integral simulations for rigorous sampling of nuclear configurations including the quantum effects in solution. After validating our approach based on gas&#8208;phase benchmarking, we demonstrate that the lineshape of the spectrum measured in aqueous solution is quantitatively recovered, without the application of any shifting, scaling, or broadening, only after including nuclear quantum effects in addition to thermal fluctuations and solvation at ambient conditions. Our findings demonstrate that nuclear quantum effects are &#8220;visible&#8221; in UV/Vis spectra of chromophores measured in solution even at room temperature and, therefore, that they must be considered computationally to achieve predictive accuracy.

         <title>Optically Modulated Nanofluidic Ionic Transistor for Neuromorphic Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanofluidic neuromorphic device based on metal&#8211;organic framework membrane (MOFM) was presented, which can be controllably modulated by the light stimulation for emulating biological synaptic behaviors. This work opens up an avenue toward advanced applications using nanofluidic iontronic systems, such as brain&#8208;mimicking computing and brain&#8208;computer interfaces.







Abstract
Neuromorphic systems that can emulate the behavior of neurons have garnered increasing interest across interdisciplinary fields due to their potential applications in neuromorphic computing, artificial intelligence and brain&#8208;machine interfaces. However, the optical modulation of nanofluidic ion transport for neuromorphic functions has been scarcely reported. Herein, inspired by biological systems that rely on ions as signal carriers for information perception and processing, we present a nanofluidic transistor based on a metal&#8211;organic framework membrane (MOFM) with optically modulated ion transport properties, which can mimic the functions of biological synapses. Through the dynamic modulation of synaptic weight, we successfully replicate intricate learning&#8208;experience behaviors and Pavlovian associate learning processes by employing sequential optical stimuli. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of the International Morse Code with the nanofluidic device using patterned optical pulse signals, showing its encoding and decoding capabilities in information processing process. This study would largely advance the development of nanofluidic neuromorphic devices for biomimetic iontronics integrated with sensing, memory and computing functions.

         <title>Mutual Dependence between Membrane Phase Separation and Bacterial Division Protein Dynamics in Synthetic Cell Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the mutual dependence of membrane phase separation and bacterial division protein dynamics. By reconstituting Min and Fts proteins inside phase separated GUVs, we observe interesting mode selection for protein dynamics and change in the reaction kinetics. We detect membrane deformations in the form of GUV blebs in synthetic cell models.







Abstract
Cell membranes in bacteria are laterally polarized to produce specific environments for membrane proteins, e.g., proteins involved in cell division which accumulate at mid&#8208;cell or the cell poles. An interesting result of such membrane&#8208;lipid interplay is the reorganization of lipid domains together with membrane&#8208;bound proteins at the onset of cell division, suggesting functional significance of membrane compartments in the cell cycle. Here, by adopting the key bacterial division proteins MinC, MinD, MinE, FtsA and FtsZ as an archetypal spatial patterning system, we present a simple vesicle&#8208;based in vitro model to explore the mutual dependence of protein pattern formation and membrane heterogeneity. Like many other peripheral membrane proteins, Min proteins exhibit preferential binding and macro&#8208;scale pattern formation at Ld domains, which leads to altered oscillation mode selection in phase&#8208;separated membrane compartments (GUVs). Moreover, incorporating bacterial division proteins within phase&#8208;separated GUVs leads to blebbing&#8208;like membrane deformations followed by the reorganization of Lo domains aligning at the neck region of the bleb, which agrees well with the domain rearrangement in bacterial membranes immediately preceding the radial constriction process. Overall, the presented in vitro model system showcases a basic framework to better comprehend the cellular division mechanism in consideration of complex cellular lipid environments.

&lt;p&gt;Cell membranes in bacteria are laterally polarized to produce specific environments for membrane proteins, e.g., proteins involved in cell division which accumulate at mid-cell or the cell poles. An interesting result of such membrane-lipid interplay is the reorganization of lipid domains together with membrane-bound proteins at the onset of cell division, suggesting functional significance of membrane compartments in the cell cycle. Here, by adopting the key bacterial division proteins MinC, MinD, MinE, FtsA and FtsZ as an archetypal spatial patterning system, we present a simple vesicle-based in vitro model to explore the mutual dependence of protein pattern formation and membrane heterogeneity. Like many other peripheral membrane proteins, Min proteins exhibit preferential binding and macro-scale pattern formation at L&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; domains, which leads to altered oscillation mode selection in phase-separated membrane compartments (GUVs). Moreover, incorporating bacterial division proteins within phase-separated GUVs leads to blebbing-like membrane deformations followed by the reorganization of L&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; domains aligning at the neck region of the bleb, which agrees well with the domain rearrangement in bacterial membranes immediately preceding the radial constriction process. Overall, the presented in vitro model system showcases a basic framework to better comprehend the cellular division mechanism in consideration of complex cellular lipid environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving the Blue Color Purity of Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes with the Assistance of F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H Interaction towards High&#8208;Performance Blue Phosphorescent OLEDs with EQE over 33&#8201;%</title>

Incorporating trifluoromethyl (&#8722;CF3) groups enhances color purity and luminous efficiency in tetradentate Pt(II) complexes through F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interaction, resulting in blue OLEDs with EQEmax over 33&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.14).







Abstract
Among the various challenges in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), simultaneously achieving high efficiency, a long lifespan, and a narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum (FWHM) in blue OLEDs remains a significant hurdle. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to improve the color purity of tetradentate Pt(II) complexes with the assistance of &#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interaction by incorporating trifluoromethyl (&#8722;CF3) groups into the well&#8208;known blue tetradentate Pt(II) phosphorescent complex. The results show that the different substitution positions of &#8722;CF3 have significantly varying effects on the FWHM values of the complexes; specifically, introducing &#8722;CF3 on the benzene ring of carbazole effectively reduces the FWHM, while introducing it on the benzene ring linked to the carbene unit has a minimal impact. When utilized in a mixed host system of SiCzCz/SiTrzCz2, the OLEDs with these new complexes as emitters demonstrated maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 27.1&#8201;%, 33.8&#8201;%, and 27.6&#8201;% for PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;1, PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;2, and PtON&#8208;2CF3, respectively, with excellent color purity (CIEy&#8776;0.14 for the PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;2 based device). Notably, the device based on PtON&#8208;CF3&#8208;2 matched the stability of the benchmark PtON&#8208;TBBI complex.This work offers an important guideline for the design of high efficient Pt(II) phosphorescent complexes with good blue color purity.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence Inversion Driven by Dichroic Competition of Achiral Dyes in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Establishing a dynamically photoresponsive dichroic competition between two achiral dyes within a chiral cholesteric liquid crystal has led to an excitation&#8208;dependent material. Excitation at 365&#8197;nm generates a negative CPL signal (glum=&#8722;0.16) at 650&#8197;nm, while excitation at 430&#8197;nm results in inversion of the CPL signal and an increase in the glum value to +0.26, with the helical superstructure and handedness of the materials remaining unchanged.







Abstract
The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) materials holds significant potential for achieving three&#8208;dimensional (3D) anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multi&#8208;level information encryption. However, constructing phototunable CLCs systems with easy fabrication and fast response remains a great challenge. Herein, we exploit an excitation&#8208;dependent CLCs (ExD&#8208;CLCs) material by establishing dynamically photoresponsive dichroic competition between two achiral dyes: a negative dichroic dye (SP&#8208;COOH) and a positive dichroic dye (Nile Red, NR) within a CLCs medium. The ExD&#8208;CLCs exhibits a negative circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signal (glum=&#8722;0.16) at 625&#8197;nm when excited at 365&#8197;nm. Remarkably, under excitation at 430&#8197;nm, the CPL signal is inverted, and the glum value increases to +0.26. Notably, the helical superstructure and handedness of the ExD&#8208;CLCs remain unchanged during this reversal process. The CPL signal reversal is driven by the dichroic competition between the SP&#8208;COOH dimer, which displays strong negative dichroism in its open&#8208;ring isomer form and silent negative dichroism in its closed&#8208;ring isomer form, and the NR dye, which exhibits static positive dichroism. Leveraging these excitation&#8208;dependent CPL properties, the quadruplex numerical anti&#8208;counterfeiting using ExD&#8208;CLCs is achieved.

         <title>Stabilisation of a Strontium Hydride with a Monodentate Carbazolyl Ligand and its Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular strontium hydride was stabilised by a bulky monodentate ligand and arene co&#8208;ligands. Characteristic vibrations of the Sr2H2 core were identified and the reactivity patterns were studied with regard to addition, redox and base reactivity.







Abstract
The molecular strontium hydride 2 [(dtbpCbz)SrH(L)]2 (L=benzene, toluene) was isolated and stabilized by employing a sterically demanding carbazole ligand (dtbpCbz=1,8&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;ditertbutylphenyl)&#8208;3,6&#8208;ditertbutylcarbazolyl). Compound 2 was synthesized via phenylsilane metathesis with the corresponding amide (dtbpCbz)SrN(SiMe3)2 and characterized by 1H NMR, XRD and vibrational spectroscopy methods. We further investigated the stoichiometric reactivity of 2 towards carbon monoxide, azobenzene and trimethylsilylacetylene, showing three distinct reactivity pathways: addition, reduction and deprotonation. The reaction of 2 with carbon monoxide yields the ethenediolate complex 4 via addition, while with azobenzene reduction of the N&#8722;N double bond and release of hydrogen were observed, affording a heteroleptic strontium complex with a radical azobenzenyl ligand (5). The terminal alkyne is deprotonated by the hydride moiety to give the acetylide complex 6.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Formate Ester Transfer Hydrogenation Enables an Electrochemical/Thermal Organometallic Cascade for Methanol Synthesis from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development and mechanistic understanding of room&#8208;temperature transfer hydrogenation unlocks a multicatalyst cascade reaction strategy for the CO2 reduction to MeOH combining electrochemical and organometallic catalysis in the same reactor.







Abstract
The reduction of CO2 to synthetic fuels is a valuable strategy for energy storage. However, the formation of energy&#8208;dense liquid fuels such as methanol remains rare, particularly under low&#8208;temperature and low&#8208;pressure conditions that can be coupled to renewable electricity sources via electrochemistry. Here, a multicatalyst system pairing an electrocatalyst with a thermal organometallic catalyst is introduced, which enables the reduction of CO2 to methanol at ambient temperature and pressure. The cascade methanol synthesis proceeds via CO2 reduction to formate by electrocatalyst [Cp*Ir(bpy)Cl]+ (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), Fischer esterification of formate to isopropyl formate catalyzed by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTf), and thermal transfer hydrogenation of isopropyl formate to methanol facilitated by the organometallic catalyst (H&#8208;PNP)Ir(H)3 (H&#8208;PNP=HN(C2H4PiPr2)2). The isopropanol solvent plays several crucial roles: activating formate ion as isopropyl formate, donating hydrogen for the reduction of formate ester to methanol via transfer hydrogenation, and lowering the barrier for transfer hydrogenation through hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition to reporting a method for room&#8208;temperature reduction of challenging ester substrates, this work provides a prototype for pairing electrochemical and thermal organometallic reactions that will guide the design and development of multicatalyst cascades.

         <title>Unveiling Surface Reconstruction as the Primary Trigger for Capacity Loss in Ultra&#8208;High Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanical and structural degradation of ultra&#8208;high Ni cathodes with different structures was systematically studied. contrary to the traditional view, structural and electrochemical characterizations of the cycled cathodes demonstrate that intragranular cracks, intergranular cracks, and nanopores are not the primary contributing factors of capacity loss. Instead, surface reconstruction (i.e., chemical decay) triggers rapid capacity decay.







Abstract
Mechanical failures, such as cracks and nanopores, along with the associated surface reconstruction, have long been regarded as the primary causes of capacity decay in ultra&#8208;high Ni layered oxides. However, the impact of these failures on performance degradation has not yet been effectively elucidate and distinguished. Herein, we develop ultra&#8208;high Ni cathodes with tailored morphological structures by incorporating B and Mo to optimize lithiation kinetics, which can suppress lattice strain, particle cracking, and surface reconstruction during charging/discharging. And the role of chemo&#8208;mechanical failures in capacity loss is systematically investigated. Surprisingly, contrary to the traditional view, structural and electrochemical characterizations of the cycled cathodes demonstrate that intragranular cracks, intergranular cracks, and nanopores are not the primary contributing factors of capacity loss. Instead, surface reconstruction triggers rapid capacity decay. Notably, compared to nanopores, intragranular cracks expose a significantly larger quantity of active substances, thereby promoting interfacial side reactions and accelerating surface structural reconstruction during cycling.

         <title>Reactive Intermediate Confinement in Beta Zeolites for the Efficient Aerobic Epoxidation of &#945;&#8208;Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient conversion of long&#8208;chain linear &#945;&#8208;olefins (LAOs) into industrially useful epoxides is of pivotal importance. Mukaiyama epoxidation based on the use of molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant and aldehyde as the cosubstrate offers a promising route for LAOs epoxidation. However, challenges associated with epoxide forming selectivity and aldehyde coupling efficiency have long impeded the adoption of Mukaiyama epoxidation in large&#8208;scale applications. Herein, we show that confinement of key intermediates involved in the parallel epoxidation pathways within a Beta zeolite unlocks a selectivity of greater than 95% towards the epoxides at the expense of minimal consumption of only 1.5 equivalents of the aldehyde, achieving an efficiency better than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, the incorporation of Sn sites into the Beta zeolite framework further facilitates the adsorption activation process of the aldehyde cosubstrate, thereby increasing the concentration of acylperoxy radicals and accelerating the kinetic process of the epoxidation step. Consequently, this work not only provides an efficient and green epoxidation route over zeolite catalysts with easily available O2 as the oxidant, but also systematically reveals the fundamental understanding of the zeolite confinement effects on steering the reaction pathway, which benefits the further development of valorization of LAOs.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis and Applications of Stereogenic &#946;'&#8208;Methyl Enones and &#946;,&#946;'&#8208;Dimethyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#8220;Magic Methyl&#8221; effect has received tremendous interest in medicinal chemistry due to the significant pharmacological and physical modification of properties that have&#160;been observed upon introducing a methyl group, especially, a stereogenic methyl group into potential chiral drug candidates. The prevalence of stereogenic &#946;&#8208;methyl ketone structural motifs in bioactive compounds and natural products has long motivated the development of enantioselective strategies toward their synthesis. Herein, we have rationally designed a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric monohydrogenation of readily&#8208;available &#946;'&#8208;methylene conjugated enones with high efficiency and remarkable site&#8208;selectivity and enantioselectivity control for the practical construction of enantioenriched &#946;'&#8208;methyl unsaturated enones that are difficult to access by other methods. Control experiments revealed that the conjugated C=C bond in &#946;'&#8208;methylene conjugated enones plays a significant role in enhancing the reactivity of monohydrogenation. This methodology is applicable for the preparation of chiral &#946;,&#946;'&#8208;dimethyl ketones through consecutive double asymmetric hydrogenation of &#946;,&#946;'&#8208;dimethylene ketones. Detailed mechanistic investigation and DFT studies further provided strong support for a unique processive catalysis pathway for double asymmetric hydrogenation. The synthetic utilities have been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of several key intermediates for bioactive molecules, asymmetric total synthesis of natural products (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;ar&#8208;Turmerone and (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;dihydro&#8208;ar&#8208;Turmerone, and two C2&#8208;symmetric chiral spirocyclic diol frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Activation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes: Distonic Radical Cation Reactivity in [3+2] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Altering the reactivity model of a molecule can potentially eliminate limitations existing in its current paradigm. When it comes to the activation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes (DACs), Lewis acids have been the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Although a variety of polarized 2&#960;&#160;components have been successfully coupled with DACs for [3+2] cycloaddition, unpolarized alkenes prove to be a roadblock due to an inherent polarity mismatch with the Lewis acid&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediate.&#160; Hereby, harnessing the distonic radical cation mode of cleavage by photoredox catalysis overcomes this mismatched reactivity of the zwitterionic intermediate, providing a unique route to highly substituted cyclopentanes and cyclopentenes. Expansion of this strategy to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes enables access to bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHs) through a facile [3&#963;+2&#963;] cycloaddition. Detailed mechanistic insights are also provided using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Starfish&#8208;Inspired Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;ion Conductive Membrane with Balanced Rigidity and Flexibility for Ultrastable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (SSLMB) is often constrained by the low ionic conductivity, narrow electrochemical window, and insufficient mechanical strength&#160;of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes. Inspired by the soft&#8208;outside, rigid&#8208;inside structure of starfish, we designed multifunctional "starfish&#8208;type" composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) using electrospinning technology. These CPEs feature a three&#8208;dimensional rigid skeleton network composed of polyacrylonitrile/metal&#8208;organic frameworks/ionic liquids (PAN/MOFs/ILs), creating continuous and efficient&#160;&#160;Li+ transport channels: MOFs impart rigidity, PEO acts as a cushioning outer layer to enhance interfacial compatibility, and ILs reduce interfacial resistance. The resulting CPEs exhibited excellent ionic conductivity (4.37&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1), a wide electrochemical window (5.34 V), uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, and a high transference number (0.69). Leveraging these synergistic advantages, the Li/CPEs/Li symmetric cell demonstrated outstanding dendrite suppression for over 1300 hours, and the LiFePO4/CPEs/Li cell retained 90.1% capacity after 2100 cycles at 1.0 C, which is the best performance reported for SSLMB with MOF/PEO. The formation of multi&#8208;component solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and its role in stabilizing lithium metal cycling were systematically elucidated through theoretical simulations and spectroscopic analysis. This nature&#8208;inspired design provides a promising strategy for the development of stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes with extended lifespans.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hydrolytically Stable Metal&#8722;Organic Framework for Simultaneous Desulfurization and Dehydration of Wet Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) have great prospects as adsorbents for industrial gas purification, but often suffer from issues of water stability and competitive water adsorption. Herein, we present a hydrolytically stable MOF that could selectively capture and recover trace SO2 from flue gas, and exhibits remarkable recyclability in the breakthrough experiments under wet flue&#8208;gas conditions, due to its excellent resistance to the corrosion of SO2 and the water&#8208;derived capillary forces. More strikingly, its SO2 capture efficiency is barely influenced by the increasing humidity, even if the pore filling with water is reached. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the delicate pore structure with diverse pore dimensions and chemistry leads to different adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics as well as segregated adsorption domains of SO2 and H2O. Significantly, this non&#8208;competitive adsorption mechanism enables simultaneous desulfurization and dehydration by a single adsorbent, opening an avenue toward cost&#8208;effective and simplified processing flowcharts for flue gas purification.</dc:description>

Herein, we present a hydrolytically stable MOF that could selectively capture and recover trace SO2 from flue gas, and exhibits remarkable recyclability in the breakthrough experiments under wet flue-gas conditions, due to its excellent resistance to the corrosion of SO2 and the water-derived capillary forces. More strikingly, its SO2 capture efficiency is barely influenced by the increasing humidity, even if the pore filling with water is reached. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the delicate pore structure with diverse pore dimensions and chemistry leads to different adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics as well as segregated adsorption domains of SO2 and H2O. Significantly, this non-competitive adsorption mechanism enables simultaneous desulfurization and dehydration by a single adsorbent, opening an avenue toward cost-effective and simplified processing flowcharts for flue gas purification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Photochemical Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical transformation represents an attractive pathway for the conversion of earth&#8208;abundant resources, such as H2O, CO2, O2, and N2, into valuable chemicals by utilizing sunlight as an energy source. Recently, two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as the focal points in the field of photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion due to their advantages in light harvesting, electrical conductivity, mass transport, tunable electronic and porous structures, as well as abundant active sites. In this review, we highlight various physical and chemical features of 2D c&#8208;MOFs that can contribute to enhanced photo&#8208;induced exciton generation, charge transport, proton migration and redox catalysis. Then, the existing strategies to integrate suitable light absorbers and/or co&#8208;catalysts onto 2D c&#8208;MOFs for photochemical transformations (with a particular focus on H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and O2 reduction) have been discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of using 2D c&#8208;MOFs in other photochemical applications (e.g., N2 fixation, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation) are assessed.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Semiconductive AgBiS2 NC Inks toward High&#8208;Efficiency, Low&#8208;cost and Environmental&#8208;friendly Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silver bismuth sulfide nanocrystals (AgBiS2 NCs) embody a pioneering heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free photovoltaic material renowned for its ultrahigh absorption coefficient, offering promising opportunities for advancing the field of ultra&#8208;thin and biocompatible solar cells. Currently, the fabrication of AgBiS2 NC photovoltaic devices relies on hot&#8208;injection synthesis and subsequent tedious ligand exchange, leading to high production cost, complex processes and environmental pollution. Here, we developed a direct&#8208;synthesis (DS) method without ligand&#8208;exchange for AgBiS2 NC semiconductive inks, significantly simplifying the material preparation and device fabrication processes. The synthesis cost of AgBiS2 inks (17.0 $ g&#8722;1) is over an order of magnitude lower than the traditional method (203.5&#8208;275.2 $ g&#8722;1). Through optimizing synthesis and device structure, a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.32% was achieved, aligning with the highest reported efficiency (9.17%) based on ligand&#8208;exchanged methods. In addition, our DS&#8208;AgBiS2 inks show excellent storage stability for over ten months. More importantly, the life cycle assessment (LCA) indicates drastically reduced energy consumption as well as environmental and human health impact for our strategy. The low&#8208;cost and scalable synthesis approach for AgBiS2 NC semiconductive inks present a &#8220;greener&#8221;pathway for the commercial applications of NC optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Emergence of Lipid Vesicles in a Coacervate&#8208;Based Compartmentalized System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spontaneous emergence of lipid vesicles in the absence of evolved biological machinery represents a major challenge for bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. We show that coacervate microdroplets could create a compartmentalized environment that enriches lipid molecules and facilitates their spontaneous assembly into lipid vesicles. These vesicles can escape from the coacervate microdroplets in a continuous process under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions, resembling a constant production process akin to a "primitive enzyme" factory assembly line. These findings significantly extend our understanding of the intricate interaction between lipid molecules and coacervate microdroplets, shedding light on the emergence of cellular systems and offering a new perspective on the conditions necessary for the development of life on Earth.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated Li+ Solvation via Competitive Coordination Mechanism of Organic Cations for High Voltage and Fast Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li+ solvation exerted a decisive effect on electrolyte physicochemical properties. Suitable tuning for Li+ solvation enabled batteries to achieve unexpected performance. Here, we introduced inert organic cations to compete with Li+ for combining electrolyte molecules to modulate Li+ coordination in the electrolyte. The relevance between the number of cationic sites in organic cations and the competitive solvation ability was explored. The organic cations with multiple cationic sites attracted solvent molecules and anions away from Li+ to form new solvated shell, improving the Li+ transport kinetics and desolvation process in electrolyte while enhancing electrolyte oxidation tolerance. Moreover, electrostatic shielding provided by organic cations and anion&#8208;derived robust SEI promoted uniform and rapid Li+ deposition on Li electrodes. With the positive effect of organic cations, Li||LiCoO2 (LCO) batteries showed high specific capacity (136.46 mAh g&#8208;1) at high charge/discharge rate (10 C). Furthermore, Li||LCO batteries exhibited good capacity retention (70% after 500 cycles) at 4.6 V charge cut&#8208;off voltage. This work provides fresh insights for the optimization of electrolytes and battery performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen/Electron Amphiphilic Bi&#8208;functional Water Molecular Inactivator&#8208;Assisted Interface Stabilization in Highly Reversible Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;network in aqueous electrolytes can lead to uncontrollable hydrogen transfer, and combining the interfacial parasitic electron consumption cause the side reaction in aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Herein, hydrogen/electron amphiphilic bi&#8208;functional 1,5&#8208;Pentanediol (PD) molecule was introduced to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. Stronger proton affinity of &#8208;OH in PD can break bulk&#8208;H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;network to inhibit the activity of water, and electron affinity can enhance electron acceptation capability, which ensures that PD is preferentially bound to electrode material over H2O. Besides, the participation of PD in the Zn2+ solvation structure reduces water content at the solid&#8208;liquid interface and promotes uniform deposition process by optimizing Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation energy. Accordingly, dense and vertical zinc texture based on intrinsic steric hindrance effect of PD and formed SEI protective layer to induce stable Zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, an organic&#8208;inorganic shielding water layer was formed at the cathode side to suppress vanadium dissolution in vanadium Oxide. Resultly, Zn//Zn symmetric cell could cycle for more than 5600 hours at 1 mAh cm&#8208;2@1 mA cm&#8208;2 (more than 250 hours at 50 &#8451;). &#160;Besides, the VO2 and I2 cathode all achieved stable cycling performance and former pouch cell could reach average capacity of 0.13 Ah.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Reaction Network&#8208;driven Polymerization&#8208;induced Transient Coacervation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A living cell has a highly complex microenvironment whereas numerous enzyme&#8208;driven processes are active at once. These procedures are incredibly accurate and efficient, although comparable control has not yet been established in vitro. Here, we design an enzymatic reaction network (ERN) that combines antagonistic and orthogonal enzymatic networks to produce adjustable dynamics of ATP&#8208;fueled transient coacervation. Using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;mediated Biocatalytic Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (BioATRP), we synthesized poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate), which subsequently formed coacervates with ATP. We rationally explored enzymatic control over coacervation and dissolution, using orthogonal and antagonistic enzyme pairs viz., alkaline phosphatase, Creatine phosphokinase, hexokinase, esterase, and urease. ATP&#8208;fuelled coacervates also demonstrate the enzymatic catalysis to prove its potential to be exploited as a cellular microreactor. Additionally, we developed ERN&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced transient coacervation (ERN&#8208;PIC), with complete control over the system, polymerization, coacervation, and dissolution. Notably, the coacervation process itself determines functional properties, as seen in selective cargo uptake. The strategy offers cutting&#8208;edge biomimetic applications, and insights into cellular compartmentalization by bridging the gap between synthetic and biological systems. The development of temporally programmed coacervation is promising for the spatial arrangement of multienzyme cascades, and offers novel ideas on the architecture of artificial cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Reductive Amination and Tandem Amination&#8211;Alkylation of Esters Enabled by a Cationic Iridium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is a convenient and efficient method for one&#8208;pot, catalytic reductive amination, as well as the first multi&#8208;component tandem reductive amination &#8208; functionalization of bench&#8208;stable and readily available common carboxylic esters. This method is based on the cationic [Ir(COD)2]BArF&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective hydrosilylation of esters, followed by one&#8208;pot acid&#8208;mediated amination and nucleophilic addition. The reaction was conducted under mild conditions at a very low catalyst loading (0.1 mol% of Ir), which could be further reduced to 0.001 mol%, as demonstrated by a reaction at a 15 g scale. The method is highly versatile, allowing the use of esters with or without &#945;&#8208;protons for the N&#8208;mono&#8208;alkylation of primary and secondary amines to produce diverse secondary and tertiary amines, as well as &#945;&#8208;branched/functionalized amines. The method is highly chemoselective and tolerates a variety of functional groups such as bromo, trifluoromethyl, ester, and cyano groups. The value of the method was demonstrated by the one&#8208;step catalytic synthesis of two bio&#8208;relevant N&#8208;mono&#8208;methyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters and the antiparkinsonian agent piribedil, as well as by the use of&#160;two shorter chain triglycerides as alkylating feedstock.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds Weaken Interaction Between Solvents and Small Organic Molecules Towards Superior Lithium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strong interaction between organic electrode materials (OEMs) and electrolyte components induces a high solubility tendency of OEMs, thus hindering the practical application of lithium&#8208;organic batteries. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy for intramolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) to redistribute the charge of OEMs to weaken the interaction with electrolyte components, thereby suppressing their dissolution. For the designed 2,2',2''&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trihydroxybenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl) tris (1H&#8208;naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]imidazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione) (TPNQ) molecule, the intramolecular HBs (O&#8208;H&#8230;N and N&#8208;H&#8230;O) reduce the charge density of active sites and alter the charge distribution on the molecular skeleton. As a result, TPNQ shows significantly reduced solubility in both ether&#8208; and ester&#8208;based solvents. In&#8208;situ measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the O&#8208;H&#8230;N dominated HB interaction strengthening during the discharging process, which can continuously suppress dissolution. Therefore, the TPNQ cathode displays high cycling stability (no capacity fading over 100 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8208;1; 88.4% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1), fast Li+&#8208;storage kinetics (211 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2 A g&#8208;1), and surprising low&#8208;temperature performances (stability cycles 500 times at &#8208;60 &#176;C). Our results offer evidence that the intramolecular HBs strategy is promising in developing robust organic electrode materials for rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose an efficient strategy for intramolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) to redistribute the charge of OEMs to weaken the interaction with electrolyte components, thereby suppressing their dissolution. For the designed 2,2',2''-(2,4,6-trihydroxybenzene-1,3,5-triyl) tris (1H-naphtho[2,3-d]imidazole-4,9-dione) (TPNQ) molecule, the intramolecular HBs (O-H&#8230;N and N-H&#8230;O) reduce the charge density of active sites and alter the charge distribution on the molecular skeleton. As a result, TPNQ shows significantly reduced solubility in both ether- and ester-based solvents. In-situ measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the O-H&#8230;N dominated HB interaction strengthening during the discharging process, which can continuously suppress dissolution. Therefore, the TPNQ cathode displays high cycling stability (no capacity fading over 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1; 88.4% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1), fast Li+-storage kinetics (211 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1), and surprising low-temperature performances (stability cycles 500 times at -60 &#176;C). Our results offer evidence that the intramolecular HBs strategy is promising in developing robust organic electrode materials for rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Oxidation Reactions of E&#8208; and Z&#8208;Allylic Primary Alcohols by an Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unspecific Peroxygenases (UPOs) catalyze the selective oxygenation of organic substrates using only hydrogen peroxide as the external oxidant. The PaDa&#8208;I variant of the UPO from Agrocybe aegerita catalyses the oxidation of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and carboxylic acid/aldehyde products respectively. Both reactions can be performed on preparative scale with isolated yields up to 80%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99% ee). The divergent reactions can also be used to transform E/Z mixtures of allylic alcohols, enabling both product series to be isolated from a single reaction. The utility of the epoxidation method is exemplified in the total synthesis of both enantiomers of the insect pheromone disparlure, including a highly enantioselective gram&#8208;scale transformation. These reactions provide further evidence for the potential of UPOs as catalysts for the scalable preparation of important oxygenated intermediates</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Bridging Cyclic Bilatriene Analogue Affords Stable &#960;&#8208;Radicaloid Dyes with Near&#8208;Infrared II Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable neutral metal radicaloid complexes have been synthesized from a modified tetrapyrrolic pigment, bilatriene, with iridium(I) and rhodium(I) cyclooctadiene (COD) synthons. The bilatriene skeleton contains &#945;&#8208;linked conjugated pyrrole units, whereas an N&#8208;confused analogue used in this work possesses &#946;&#8208;linked pyrrole moieties at the terminal, demonstrating a unique metal binding capability. Unprecedentedly, the metal&#8208;COD cations are accommodated at the outer nitrogen sites, which induced the formation of open&#8208;shell metal&#8208;radicaloid species. The resulting compounds are highly stable under ambient conditions and demonstrated facile redox conversion to afford the corresponding cation and anion species. Furthermore, the radicaloid complexes showed a distinct second near&#8208;infrared absorption (NIR&#8208;II) capability extending up to 1500 nm along with high photostability. These features emphasized that the complexes can be potential NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;responsible photothermal and photoacoustic imaging contrast agents based on the metal&#8208;radicaloid dye platform.</dc:description>

         <title>A BOIMPY Dye Enables Multi&#8208;Photoinduced Electron Transfer Catalysis: Reaching Super&#8208;Reducing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An established concept to create radical intermediates is photoexcitation of a catalyst to a higher energy intermediate, subsequently leading to a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) with a reaction partner. The known concept of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (con&#8208;PET) leads to catalytically active species even higher in energy by the uptake of two photons. Generally speaking, increased photon uptake leads to a more potent reductant. Here, we report the concept of multi&#8208;photoinduced electron transfer catalysis (&gt;2 photons), termed multi&#8208;PET, which is enabled by photoinduced one&#8208;electron reductions of an organic dye. Further irradiation of the doubly reduced species leads to a photoexcited dianionic super&#8208;reductant, which is more potent than Li metal &#8211; one of the strongest chemical reductants known. This multi&#8208;photon process which is enabled by 390 nm LEDs allows the cleavage of strong carbon&#8208;fluorine bonds and reduction of other halides even in very electron&#8208;rich substrates.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An established concept to create radical intermediates is photoexcitation of a catalyst to a higher energy intermediate, subsequently leading to a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) with a reaction partner. The known concept of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (con-PET) leads to catalytically active species even higher in energy by the uptake of two photons. Generally speaking, increased photon uptake leads to a more potent reductant. Here, we report the concept of multi-photoinduced electron transfer catalysis (&amp;gt;2 photons), termed multi-PET, which is enabled by photoinduced one-electron reductions of an organic dye. Further irradiation of the doubly reduced species leads to a photoexcited dianionic super-reductant, which is more potent than Li metal &#8211; one of the strongest chemical reductants known. This multi-photon process which is enabled by 390 nm LEDs allows the cleavage of strong carbon-fluorine bonds and reduction of other halides even in very electron-rich substrates. The resulting radicals are quenched by hydrogen atoms or engaged in carbon-carbon and carbon-phosphorus bond formations, highlighting the utility of multi-PET for organic chemistry. In addition, multi-PET enabled Birch-type reductions. Spectroscopic, chemical and computational investigations are presented to gain mechanistic insights.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coaxial Helices in Chiral Supramolecular Aggregates from Highly Hindered Chiral Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral allenes self&#8208;assembly following a cooperative mechanism into a supramolecular chiral aggregate consisting of two coaxial helices: the internal helix described by the allene stack and the external helix which consist in a quadruple&#8208;helix described by the four allene substituents. More precisely, this supramolecular aggregate possesses six axially chiral elements within its structure &#8212;the allene, the allene stack (internal helix) and the stacks of the four allene substituents (external 4&#8208;helix)&#8212;. Interestingly, slight variations in the magnitude of the tilting degree while keeping its P&#8208; or M&#8208; orientation (internal helix) can vary the orientation of the 4&#8208;axial motifs at the external helix. Thus, while (P)&#8208;1 produces a supramolecular helix with a Q ca. 15&#176; (Pint) and a M1/P2/M1&#8217;/P2&#8217; orientation of the four axial motifs at the periphery, (P)&#8208;2 produces a supramolecular helix with a Q ca. 23&#176; (Pint) and a P1/P2/P1&#8217;/P2&#8217; orientation of the four axial motifs at the external helix. As a result, the ECD spectra and the AFM images of the (P)&#8208;1 and (P)&#8208;2 supramolecular aggregates dominated by the 1 and 1&#8217; substituents of the chiral allene indicate opposite handedness although the chirality of the building block and the orientation of the allene stack are the same</dc:description>

         <title>Stimulating the potential of Zn anode to operate in low pH and harsh environments for highly sustainable Zn batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to near&#8208;neutral electrolytes (pH = 3&#8208;6), Zn||Mn batteries in acidic environments can achieve voltages up to ~2 V. However, high proton concentrations raise concerns about Zn anode stability. Current strategies for inhibiting hydrogen evolution corrosion (HEC) on the anode in Zn&#8208;based batteries mainly focus on the near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. To supplement this gap, we developed a conversion&#8208;type interphase strategy using phosphate, sulfate precipitation, and phytic acid modification layers for Zn anodes to demonstrate the potential of Zn anode to operate in acidic electrolytes. This approach enables stable Zn stripping/plating at &#160;pH = 2.2 for over &#160;3,600 h and 400 h at 1 mA cm&#8722;2/0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 20 mA cm&#8722;2/10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Benefiting from stable Zn electrodes, the electrolytic Zn||Mn batteries can operate at 1.90 V. To show more harsh scenarios, the seawater&#8208;based 0.25 Ah&#8208;scale Zn||Mn pouch cells can be assembled with a practical energy density of 57.4 Wh kg&#8722;1 cell. Significantly, we analyze and emphasize that seawater holds promise as an alternative to deionized water for electrolyte solvents due to its energy and economic effectiveness. This strategy has motivated to expand the working pH range of metal anodes and provides the rational design for grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Achieving 4.8 V LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes to stabilize LiCoO2 (LCO) cycling remains a challenge in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Constructing a high&#8208;quality cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) is essential to mitigate adverse reactions at high voltages. However, conventional inorganic CEIs dominated by LiF have shown limited performance for high&#8208;voltage LCO. Here, we propose an ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) with a high donor number additive, enabling Li//LCO cells to achieve a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.7 V/4.8 V and a high&#8208;capacity retention of 86.9%/74.2% after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. During this process, a groundbreaking phenomenon was discovered: the construction of a stable organic CEI rich in C&#8208;F bonds by the high donor number additive under high voltage. These strong polar C&#8208;F bonds exhibit excellent electrochemical inertness and film&#8208;forming properties, resulting in optimal passivation of the cathode. This organic C&#8208;F bond&#8208;dominated CEI significantly suppresses phase transitions, cobalt dissolution, and gas evolution in LCO at high voltage. Additionally, the 4.8 V&#8208;class Li//LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 and 4.95 V&#8208;class Li//LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cells also demonstrate outstanding cycling stability. Even at 60 &#176;C, the ILE&#8208;constructed organic CEI maintains superior performance. Our findings highlight the potential of organic CEI to enhance high&#8208;voltage cathode stability, paving the way for more efficient lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting C2+ Alcohols Selectivity and Activity in High&#8208;Current CO Electroreduction using Synergistic Cu/Zn Co&#8208;Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols, specifically ethanol and n&#8208;propanol through CO electroreduction (CORR) in H2O, presents a sustainable pathway for intermittent renewable energy storage and a low&#8208;carbon economy. However, achieving high selectivity for alcohol production at industrial current densities is kinetically hampered by side reactions such as ethylene generation and hydrogen evolution reaction, which result from competing adsorption of *CO and *H. In this study, we developed a Cu/Zn alloy catalyst to simultaneously enhance the activity and selectivity for alcohol production by increasing CO capture capacity and enriching active hydrogen on Cu sites. Our findings demonstrate that the Cu/5Zn alloy with a molar ratio of Cu to Zn of 95:5 exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of 50% for the selective electrosynthesis of C2+ alcohols during ampere&#8208;level CO electrolysis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the Cu/Zn alloy promotes polarized Cu sites, enhancing CO adsorption while facilitating the spillover of hydrogen atoms from Zn to Cu sites, contributing to selective alcohol formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Negative Thermal Expansion Behavior Enabling Good Electrochemical&#8208;Energy&#8208;Storage Performance at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;ion batteries (such as lithium&#8208;ion batteries) are very popular energy&#8208;storage devices nowadays. However, low temperatures cause their poor electrochemical kinetics and performance, significantly limiting their wide applications in cold environments. Here, we propose that electrochemical energy&#8208;storage materials with negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) behavior can enable good low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, which becomes a new strategy to tackle the low&#8208;temperature issues of metal&#8208;ion batteries. LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) with an a&#8208;direction thermal expansion coefficient of &#8722;1.1 &#215; 10&#8722;7 K&#8722;1 is used as a model material. As the temperature decreases, the transverse vibration of O atoms not only increases the transverse distances among O atoms connected to Li/Ti atoms, but also widens the Li+&#8208;transport channels and enlarges Li+&#8208;insertion sites along the [12 &#8208;1] direction, which are mainly controlled by the lattice parameter a. Consequently, carbon&#8208;coated LTP (C&#8208;LTP) retains good electrochemical performance at &#8722;10 &#176;C, including fast Li+ diffusivity (84% of that at 25 &#176;C), large capacity (96% of the theoretical capacity), and superior rate capability (83% capacity retention at 5C vs. 0.5C). Moreover, the more open crystal structure of LTP at the lower temperature allows smaller maximum unit&#8208;cell&#8208;volume expansion, resulting in better cycling stability of C&#8208;LTP at &#8722;10 &#176;C (96.8% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 2C).</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Nuclearity Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Oxidative Cleavage of C&#8208;C Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;nuclearity polyoxometalate (POM) clusters are attractive building blocks (BBs) for the synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their high connectivity and inherently multiple metal centers as functional sites. This work demonstrates a strategy of step&#8208;wise growth on ring&#8208;shaped [P8W48O184]40&#8208; precursor, which produced two new high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxotungstates, a half&#8208;closed [H16P8W58O218]32&#8208; {W58} and a fully&#8208;closed [H16P8W64O236]32&#8208; {W64}. By in&#8208;situ synthesis, unique MOFs of copper triazole&#8208;benzoic acid (HL) complexes incorporating the negatively&#8208;charged {W58} and {W64} as nodes, {Cu11(HL)8LW58} HNPOMOF&#8208;1 and {Cu9(HL)9W64} HNPOMOF&#8208;2, were constructed by delicately tuning the reaction conditions, mainly solution pH, which controls the formation of {W58} and {W64}, and at the same time the protonation of triazole&#8208;benzoic acid ligand thus its coordination mode to copper ion that creates the highest nuclearity POM&#8208;derived MOFs reported to date. HNPOMOF&#8208;1 features 3D framework possessing cage&#8208;like cavities filled with exposed carboxyl groups, while the inherent 2D layer&#8208;like HNPOMOF&#8208;2 allows for facile exfoliation into ultrathin nanosheets, and the resulted HNPOMOF&#8208;2NS exhibits superior activity towards photocatalytic oxidative cleavage of C&#8208;C bond for a series of lignin models. This work not only provides a strategy to build high&#8208;nuclearity POM cluster&#8208;based frameworks, but also demonstrates their great potential as functional materials for green catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Polypseudorotaxane Formation with Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Co&#8208;crystallization Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the number of chiral ring molecules in chiral polyrotaxane increases, the number of possible stereoisomers exponentially increases. Consequently, the selective synthesis of a specific stereoisomer becomes much more challenging. To address this problem, we co&#8208;crystallized poly(ethylene glycol) and a diastereomeric ring molecule, pillar[5]arene, in the solid state. The co&#8208;crystallization formed polypseudorotaxanes with a high diastereomeric excess (ca. 88% de), meaning that polypseudorotaxanes containing (S, pS) stereoisomer pillar[5]arene rings were synthesized selectively. By contrast, in a solution and evaporation systems, the selectivity remained low (ca. 10% de). The results suggested that the packing effect by the co&#8208;crystallization contributed to the denser assembly of ring molecules on the polymeric chain, resulting in the diastereoselective formation. High diastereoselectivity was also observed even in higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(ethylene glycol)s. These selectivities arose from the cooperative effects of the ring molecules on the polymeric chain, which were supported by calculating the stabilization energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction Pathway Regulation for Gaseous and Liquid Products of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Adsorbate Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide anion adsorption on transition metals can improve the performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), while the specific reaction mechanisms governing selective CO2RR pathways remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the distinct pathways for gaseous (CO) and liquid products (formate and ethanol) on the well&#8208;defined Ag&#8208;Cu nanostructures with controlled chlorination, respectively. We show that CO2 conversion to CO on Ag/AgCl can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of AgCl layer, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) near 100% over a broad potential range in a 0.5 M KHCO3 using flow cell. In contrast, the optimized Cl&#8208;Ag/Cu system enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total FE nearing 100%, delivering high current density under similar conditions. In situ infrared experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate facilitates the thermodynamics of both the CO pathway on Cl&#8208;Ag(111) and the formate pathway on Cl&#8208;Ag/Cu(111) by reducing Gibbs free energy barriers of each potential&#8208;limit step. This work uncovers the role of chlorination in the tuning of C&#8208;bound or O&#8208;bound intermediates during CO2RR on Ag&#8208;Cu catalysts, determining the reaction pathway under lateral adsorbate effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying N Coordination Types of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Spin&#8208;Modulated Luminol Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The type of coordinated N atoms in the metal&#8208;N coordination structure is of paramount importance to the catalytic property of carbon&#8208;based metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for analyzing the coordination environments of SACs. Despite its efficacy, the limited availability of synchrotron light sources and the complexity of data analysis have constrained its broader application in identifying metal&#8208;N coordination types within SACs. In this work, two kind of CoN4 SACs were prepared by varying the N source. Then their electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behavior in the luminol/dissolved oxygen system during cathodic scanning were investigated. In comparison to CoN4(pyridinic N), for which the spin density displays dz2 orbital characteristics, CoN4(pyrrolic N) exhibits dxz orbital features, which was more conducive to the subsequent cleavage of the O&#8208;O bond in O2&#8226;&#8208; to &#8226;OH, resulting in the generation of more active intermediates *OH and the promotion of cathodic ECL emission. This work demonstrates that the ECL technique provides a novel method for the rapid identification of Co&#8208;N coordination types and the spin nature of the metal center in CoN4 SACs.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;Compatible Supercapacitor&#8208;Diode Empowering Computation Efficiency for Human&#8208;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological system utilizes unidirectional ion flow to produce and transmit signals. To realize bioinspired artificial intelligence and thus seamless human&#8208;machine interaction, ion rectification devices should be developed. Here, a reconfigurable CMOS&#8208;compatible supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode) is developed by resettling the pseudo&#8208;capacitive and electrochemical&#8208;double&#8208;layer&#8208;capacitive components of a lithium&#8208;ion pseudocapacitor into the positive and negative voltage regions respectively through engineering the redox peaks. This CAPode exhibits good ion rectification and charge&#8208;storage bifunction with high rectification ratio (RR) (RRI ~ 20, RRII ~ 0.83), large areal capacitance (17 mF cm&#8208;2) and long cycling stability (5000 cycles). More importantly, two main computing paradigms in the biological system are efficiently realized based on this CAPode by empowering the supercapacitor function into the diode: (I) multivalued ionic logic gates are constructed based on the tunable ion rectification characteristics induced by the bifunction of this CAPode for mimicking the dendritic computing; (II) all&#8208;CAPode based reservoir computing is implemented based on the reconfigurable volatile and nonvolatile charge&#8208;storage characteristics of this CAPode for mimicking the neuromorphic computing. This work paves a new way towards seamless and high&#8208;efficiency human&#8208;machine interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Solid&#8208;State Emissive Carbon Quantum Dots for Multicolor, Bright and Efficient Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Color&#8208;tunable electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on quantum dots (QDs) are rapidly emerging as a key technology for next&#8208;generation full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting. However, achieving broad color tunability in LEDs that utilize a single QD emissive material continues to pose significant challenges. Here, we present the first example of bright, multicolor electroluminescent LEDs with tunable emission peaks spanning from 535 to 640 nm, utilizing a new type of single red solid&#8208;state emissive carbon quantum dots (R&#8208;SSCQDs). Unlike conventional CQDs, which often exhibit weak or negligible emission in solid&#8208;state form, R&#8208;SSCQDs demonstrate bright red emission in solid state and green emission in diluted state. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the unique non&#8208;planar spatial structure and significant steric hindrance of R&#8208;SSCQDs effectively suppress &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, resulting in efficient solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission. By adjusting the weight ratios of R&#8208;SSCQDs doped in host materials, we showcase bright, efficient and multicolor CQD&#8208;based LEDs that emit green, yellow, orange, and red light, achieving a record&#8208;high luminance of 15,834 cd m&#8208;2 and current efficiency of 10.3 cd A&#8208;1.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Complexes Derived from Non&#8208;classical Diboriranes: Side&#8208;on vs. End&#8208;on Carbonylative Ring Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report first &#960;&#8208;complexes derived from non&#8208;classical diboriranes (three&#8208;membered aromatic B2C rings) and their carbonylative ring expansion to four&#8208; and five&#8208;membered cyclic ligands. The H&#8208;bridged diborirane (R=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl; R&#8217;=H) initially reacts with Fe2(CO)9 to an allylic &#960;&#8208;complex, which further reacts under side&#8208;on addition of CO to the B&#8722;B moiety to an &#951;5&#8208;coordinated five&#8208;membered B2C2O ring. For R&#8217;=SnMe3, CO is added end&#8208;on to the B&#8722;B bond.







Abstract
Unlike cyclopropanes, the analogous B2C species (diboriranes) tend to adopt non&#8208;classical H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromatic structures with bridging moieties R between the boron atoms. The coordination of the thus generated cyclic 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system to transition metals is completely unexplored. We here report that complexation of non&#8208;classical diboriranes cyclo&#8208;&#956;&#8208;RB2Dur2CPh (R=H, SnMe3; Dur=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl) to Fe(CO)3 fragments allows for the carbonylative ring expansion of the B2C ring to either four&#8208; or five&#8208;membered rings depending on the nature of the BRB 3&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron bond (3c2e): The H&#8208;bridged diborirane (R=H) initially reacts with Fe2(CO)9 to the allylic &#960;&#8208;complex with an agostic BH/Fe interaction. Subsequent formal hydroboration of CO from excess Fe2(CO)9 results in the side&#8208;on ring expansion under formation of a five&#8208;membered B2C2O ring, coordinated to the Fe(CO)3 moiety. In contrast, in case of the stannyl&#8208;bridged diborirane (R=SnMe3) under the same conditions, CO is added end&#8208;on to the B&#8722;B bond with the carbon terminus formally inserting into the B2Sn 3c2e&#8208;bond. The two carbonylative ring expansion products can also be described as nido and closo clusters, respectively, according to the Wade&#8208;Mingos rules.

         <title>Tunable Isometric Donor&#8208;Acceptor Wurster&#8208;Type Covalent Organic Framework Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline polymeric materials featuring wide&#8208;ranging structural control and modularity. The synthesis of a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor Wurster building blocks enabled the formation of isostructural, photoactive COFs with distinct optical features in thin films. These COFs were further applied for photoelectrochemical water splitting.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer remarkable versatility, combining ordered structures, high porosity, and tailorable functionalities in nanoscale reaction spaces. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of isostructural, photoactive Wurster&#8208;type COFs achieved by manipulating the chemical and electronic nature of the Wurster aromatic amine building blocks. A series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) Wurster building block molecules was synthesized by incorporating heteroaromatic acceptors with varying strengths between triphenylamine donor groups. These tailored building blocks were integrated into a 2D COF scaffold, resulting in highly crystalline structures and similar morphologies across all COFs. Remarkably, this structural uniformity was also achieved in the synthesis of homogeneous and oriented thin films. Steady&#8208;state photoluminescence revealed a tunable red&#8208;shift in film emission exceeding 100&#8197;nm, demonstrating effective manipulation of their optical properties. Furthermore, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting studies exhibited a doubled current density (8.1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;VRHE) for the COF with the strongest acceptor unit. These findings highlight the potential of Wurster D&#8208;A&#8208;D COFs in photoelectrochemical water splitting devices and pave the way for further exploration of chemical functionality&#8208;reactivity&#8208;property relationships in this promising class of photoactive materials.

         <title>From Ions to Crystals: A Comprehensive View of the Non&#8208;Classical Nucleation of Calcium Sulfate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium sulfate is a mineral of considerable relevance for various industrial and geochemical processes. In the present work, the formation of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum) crystals from aqueous solutions has been elucidated in detail through application of a complementary suite of advanced characterization techniques. The results show how crystalline order emerges from intrinsically disordered precursors and highlights the complexity of mineral nucleation.







Abstract
The early stages of mineralization continue to be in the focus of intensive research due to their inherent importance for natural and engineered environments. While numerous observations have been reported for single steps in the pathways of various crystallizing phases in previous studies, the complexity of the underlying processes and their elusive character have left central questions unanswered in most cases. In the present work, we provide a detailed view on the nucleation of calcium sulfate mineralization&#8212;an abundant mineral with broad use in construction industry&#8212;in aqueous systems at ambient conditions. As experimental basis, a co&#8208;titration procedure with potentiometric, turbidimetric and conductometric detection was developed, allowing solution speciation and the formation of crystallization precursors to be monitored quantitatively as the level of nominal (super)saturation gradually increases. The nature and spatiotemporal evolution of these precursors was further elucidated by time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments, complemented by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM) as a direct imaging technique. The results reveal how ions associate into nanometric primary species, which subsequently aggregate and develop anisotropic order by intrinsic structural reorganization. Our observations challenge the common understanding of fundamental notions such as the nucleation barrier or the meaning of supersaturation, with broad implications for mineralization phenomena in general and the formation of calcium sulfate in geochemical settings and industrial applications in particular.

         <title>Unlocking of Hidden Mesopores for Enzyme Encapsulation by Dynamic Linkers in Stable Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing dynamic boroxine linkers into mesoporous PCN&#8208;333 creates defects that expand pore sizes, enabling the encapsulation of enzymes larger than the inherent pore size of MOFs. This strategy allows the immobilization of glycoenzymes in MOFs for synthesizing complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating high activity and enhanced enzyme stability.







Abstract
Mesoporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising supports for the immobilization of enzymes, yet their applications are often limited by small pore apertures that constrain the size of encapsulated enzymes to below 5&#8197;nm. In this study, we introduced labile linkers (4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;boroxintriyl)&#8208;tribenzoate, TBTB) with dynamic boroxine bonds into mesoporous PCN&#8208;333, resulting in PCN&#8208;333&#8208;TBTB with enhanced enzyme loading and protection capabilities. The selective breaking of B&#8722;O bonds creates defects in PCN&#8208;333, which effectively expands both window and cavity sizes, thereby unlocking hidden mesopores for enzyme encapsulation. Consequently, this strategy not only increases the adsorption kinetics of small enzymes (&lt;5&#8197;nm) such as cytochrome c (Cyt C) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), but also enables the immobilization of various large&#8208;sized enzymes (&gt;5&#8197;nm), such as glycoenzymes. The glycoenzymes@PCN&#8208;333&#8208;TBTB platform was successfully applied to synthesize thirteen complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating high activity and enhanced enzyme stability. The dynamic linker&#8208;mediated enzyme encapsulation strategy enables the immobilization of enzymes exceeding the inherent pore size of MOFs, thus broadening the scope of enzymatic catalytic reactions achievable with MOF materials.

         <title>Pyrrolizwilline, a Unique Bacterial Alkaloid Assembled by a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase and non&#8208;Enzymatic Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of pyrrolizwilline produced by XhpA&#8208;G was elucidated in Xenorhabdus hominickii using a promoter exchange approach together with heterologous expression of xhpA&#8208;G in E. coli. We also report the structural characterization of XhpG, the key enzyme in the conversion of the intermediate pyrrolizixenamide to pyrrolizwilline.







Abstract
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a structurally diverse group of heterocyclic specialized metabolites characterized by a core structure comprising a hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolizine. PAs are synthesized through two main pathways. In plants, assembly occurs via a homospermidine synthase, and in bacteria, through combined action of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenase. While the toxic properties of plant&#8208;derived PAs and their prevalence in animal and human foods have been extensively studied, the biological roles and biosynthesis of more complex bacterial PAs are not well understood. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a bacterial biosynthetic gene cluster from Xenorhabdus hominickii, xhpA&#8208;G, which is responsible for producing the PA pseudo&#8208;dimer pyrrolizwilline. Analysis of X. hominickii promoter exchange mutants together with heterologous expression of xhpA&#8208;G in E. coli, revealed a set of pathway intermediates, two of which were chemically synthesized, as well as multiple derivatives. This information was leveraged to propose a detailed biosynthetic pathway to pyrrolizwilline. Furthermore, we have characterized the hydrolase XhpG, the key enzyme in the conversion of the pathway intermediate pyrrolizixenamide to pyrrolizwilline, using X&#8208;ray crystallography and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS).

         <title>A Nitroreductase&#8208;Activatable Metabolic Reporter for Covalent Labeling of Pathological Hypoxic Cells in Tumorigenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under pathophysiological hypoxic environments, the caged non&#8208;metabolizable precursor pNB&#8208;ManNAz exhibited responsiveness to cellular NTR, culminating in structural self&#8208;immolation and the resultant ManNAz could be incorporated onto the cell surface glycoproteins, thereby facilitating fluorescence labeling via bioorthogonal chemistry. This NTR&#8208;responsive metabolic reporter demonstrated broad applicability for specific hypoxia labeling in diverse cell lines, particularly in the monitoring of orthotopic tumorigenesis and targeted tumor phototherapy in zebrafish models.







Abstract
Aberrant hypoxic stress will initiate a cascade of pathological consequence observed prominently in tumorigenesis. Understanding of hypoxia's role in tumorigenesis is highly essential for developing effective therapeutics, which necessitates reliable tools to specifically distinguish hypoxic tumor cells (or tissues) and correlate their dynamics with the status of disease in complex living settings for precise theranostics. So far, disparate hypoxia&#8208;responsive probe molecules and prodrugs were designed via chemical or enzymatic reactions, yet their capability in real&#8208;time reporting pathogenesis development is often compromised due to unrestricted diffusion and less selectivity towards the environmental responsiveness. Herein we present an oxygen&#8208;insensitive nitroreductase (NTR)&#8208;activatable glycan metabolic reporter (pNB&#8208;ManNAz) capable of covalently labeling hypoxic tumor cells and tissues. Under pathophysiological hypoxic environments, the caged non&#8208;metabolizable precursor pNB&#8208;ManNAz exhibited unique responsiveness to cellular NTR, culminating in structural self&#8208;immolation and the resultant ManNAz could incorporate onto cell surface glycoproteins, thereby facilitating fluorescence labeling via bioorthogonal chemistry. This NTR&#8208;responsive metabolic reporter demonstrated broad applicability for multicellular hypoxia labeling, particularly in the dynamic monitoring of orthotopic tumorigenesis and targeted tumor phototherapy in vivo. We anticipate that this approach holds promise for investigating hypoxia&#8208;related pathological progression, offering valuable insights for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by a Fullerene&#8208;Based Hole Transport Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fullerene&#8208;based hole transport material (FHTM) has been designed and synthesized, exhibiting high hole mobility through intramolecular electron transfer. Incorporating FHTM at the NiOx/perovskite interface optimizes the energy level alignment and improves the quality of the perovskite layer. This integration results in an inverted perovskite solar cell with a champion efficiency of 25.58&#8201;% (certified:25.04&#8201;%) and enhanced stability.







Abstract
Designing an efficient modification molecule to mitigate non&#8208;radiative recombination at the NiOx/perovskite interface and improve perovskite quality represents a challenging yet crucial endeavor for achieving high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we synthesized a novel fullerene&#8208;based hole transport molecule, designated as FHTM, by integrating C60 with 12 carbazole&#8208;based moieties, and applied it as a modification molecule at the NiOx/perovskite interface. The in situ self&#8208;doping effect, triggered by electron transfer between carbazole&#8208;based moiety and C60 within the FHTM molecule, along with the extended &#960; conjugated moiety of carbazole groups, significantly enhances FHTM's hole mobility. Coupled with optimized energy level alignment and enhanced interface interactions, the FHTM significantly enhances hole extraction and transport in corresponding devices. Additionally, the introduced FHTM efficiently promotes homogeneous nucleation of perovskite, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films. These combined improvements led to the FHTM&#8208;based PSCs yielding a champion efficiency of 25.58&#8201;% (Certified: 25.04&#8201;%), notably surpassing that of the control device (20.91&#8201;%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated device maintained 93&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This study highlights the potential of functionalized fullerenes as hole transport materials, opening up new avenues for their application in the field of PSCs.

         <title>Oscillating Structural Transformations in the Electrochemical Synthesis of Graphene Oxide from Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of electrochemical graphite oxidation in aqueous sulfuric acid reveal periodic structural changes of a graphite intercalation compound (GIC) into &#8220;pristine graphite oxide&#8221;. The potential oscillations of the graphite electrode correlate with the appearance and disappearance of a solid phase identified as stage&#8208;1 GIC. The observed phenomenon can be considered as a new type of oscillating reaction.







Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of graphene oxide (GO) is known to occur with potential oscillations, but the structural changes underlying these oscillations have remained unclear. In&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrates that the electrochemical synthesis of GO in aqueous H2SO4 can be described as an oscillating reaction. The transformation from graphite to GO proceeds through periodic structural oscillations that correlate with potential cycles. Stage&#8208;1 graphite intercalation compound (GIC) is found only at the peak of the potential cycle, but not at the bottom of the cycle. Stage&#8208;1 GIC is formed in the first half&#8208;cycle from stage&#8208;2 GIC and then transforms into &#8220;pristine graphite oxide&#8221; (PGO) on the lower side of the potential cycle, after which the cycle restarts with the formation of a new portion of stage&#8208;1 GIC. Water&#8208;washing results in the transformation of PGO into water&#8208;swollen GO with d(001) ~11&#8197;&#197;. These periodic structural changes can be considered a new type of oscillating reaction. The presented results provide broad insights into the oscillating structural changes occurring during the anodic graphite oxidation in aqueous H2SO4 and allow to update of the mechanism of GO electrochemical formation.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Discovery of a Potent Inhibitor of the Ferric Citrate Binding Protein FecB in Vibrio Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron acquisition is a crucial factor for bacterial growth, and its transport process could be a promising target for antibacterial drugs. A potent molecular inhibitor of the ferric citrate binding protein FecB has been discovered. The findings provide new insight into the modulation of ferric ion acquisition pathways and their application to pathogen growth suppression.







Abstract
Infections caused by Gram&#8208;negative bacteria present a significant risk to human health worldwide. Novel strategies are needed to deal with the challenge caused by drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. Here, we report a new approach to combat infections by targeting iron&#8208;binding proteins to suppress bacterial growth. We investigated the function of the conserved periplasmic binding protein FecB from Vibrio alginolyticus. FecB was known to play a crucial role in the bacterial growth and to relate with biofilm formation. We then solved the crystal structures and elucidated the binding mechanism of FecB with ferric ion chelated by citrate. The results indicated that FecB binds weakly to one citrate molecule and strongly to the Fe3+&#8208;(citrate)2 complex. Based on these results, a structure&#8208;based virtual screening approach was conducted against FecB to identify small molecules that block ferric citrate uptake. Further evaluations in vivo and in vitro demonstrated that salvianolic acid C significantly suppressed bacterial growth, indicating that targeting bacterial nutrient absorption is a promising strategy for identifying potential antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Extending Shelf&#8208;Life of Two&#8208;Step Method Precursor Solutions through Targeted Regulation for Highly Efficient and Reproducible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The commercialization of PVSCs is hindered by poor reproducibility due to the chemical instability of the solution&#8208;processed materials. We first observe that the aging phenomenon is more pronounced in the precursor solution of the two&#8208;step sequential method compared to that in the one&#8208;step method due to the difference in the used solvents. Here, an effective targeted strategy for precursor stabilization by introducing benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithiol (BDT) and decamethylferrocene (FcMe10) additives into the organic amine salt solution and the PbI2 precursor solution, thus extending the shelf&#8208;life of the two&#8208;step precursor solutions.







Abstract
Precursor solution aging process can cause significant influence on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Notably, we first observe that the aging phenomenon is more severe in the precursor of two&#8208;step sequential method compared to that in one&#8208;step method due to that the protic solvent isopropanol facilitates amine&#8208;cation side reaction and iodide ions oxidation. Herein, we report a novel approach for selectively stabilizing both organic amine salt and lead iodide (PbI2) precursor solutions in two&#8208;step method. The introduction of benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithiol into organic amine salt solution can mitigate amine&#8208;cation side reactions due to the formation of an acidic and reducing environment. Simultaneously, decamethylferrocene (FcMe10/FcMe+10) pair can act as a redox shuttle in PbI2 solution to concurrently oxidize Pb0 and reduce I2 in cyclic manner. Consequently, the PVSCs device fabricated from ameliorative precursor solutions demonstrates superior power conversion efficiency of 25.31&#8201;%, retaining 95&#8201;% of its efficiency after 21&#8197;days of solution aging. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 85&#8201;% of primitive efficiency for 1500&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination. This work establishes a fundamental guidance and scientific direction for the stabilization of two&#8208;step perovskite precursor solutions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction: Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Axially Chiral Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction has been realized via vinyl cation pathway, enabling the atom&#8208;economical synthesis of axially chiral phenyl and indolyl carbazoles. This protocol continues the first example of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction. Notably, the constructed axially chiral carbazoles are applicable to asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
The dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (DDA) reaction is a powerful method for the construction of aromatic compounds. However, the enantioselective DDA reaction has been rarely developed, probably due to the competitive thermal reaction. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction through vinyl cation pathway. The reaction leads to the atom&#8208;economical synthesis of axially chiral phenyl and indolyl carbazoles in generally excellent yields with good to excellent atroposelectivities. This methodology represents the first example of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction. Notably, new chiral ligand and organocatalyst derived from the constructed axially chiral carbazole are demonstrated to be useful in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Structural Rearrangement Towards a White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Adamantane&#8208;Type Cluster Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of an ethylene bridge into a quaternary adamantane&#8208;type cluster core {Si(CH2)n(C2H4)mSn3S3} (n/m=3/0 or 2/1) causes distinct distortions, which the molecules escape by an unprecedented dimerization of the cluster cores. This structural change affects the (extreme) nonlinear optical properties of such white&#8208;light emitting materials, as shown by a combined experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical study.







Abstract
Group 14/16 adamantane&#8208;type hybrid clusters of the type [(RT)4E6] (T=group 14 element, E=group 16 element, R=organic group) have been reported to emit white&#8208;light when irradiated in an amorphous state with a continuous&#8208;wave (CW) infrared laser diode. This effect is enhanced if the cluster core is varied from a binary to a more complex composition. To further explore this phenomenon, we synthesized clusters with a multinary R/R&#8217;&#8208;T/T&#8217;&#8208;E/E&#8217; composition, including isolobal replacement of E with CH2, in [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}3] (1, Np=naphthyl). When expanding one of the CH2 moieties to a C2H4 group, thus generating a R/R&#8217;&#8208;T/T&#8217;&#8208;E/E&#8217;/E&#8217;&#8217; cluster composition, we unexpectedly observed a dimerization of the initially formed, yet non&#8208;isolable adamantane&#8208;like cluster [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}2{C2H4Sn(S)Ph}] (2) to [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}2{C2H4Sn(S)Ph}]2 (3), exhibiting a heretofore unprecedented cluster architecture. Both monomeric 1 and dimeric 3, show white&#8208;light emission as thin films. The nonlinear optical response of the compounds was also modelled with DFT methods.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Dynamic Carburization of Mo Oxide with Unprecedented High CO Formation Rate in Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ carburization of the Mo&#8208;based catalyst at 500&#8201;&#176;C is achieved in RWGS reaction. The surface O/Mo atomic ratio plays significant role in carburization, i.e., lower surface O/Mo atomic ratio is beneficial to carburization. In situ carburization induced by reaction product of CO strongly promotes the RWGS activity showing CO formation rate of 7544.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
In situ construction of active structure under reaction conditions is highly desired but still remains challenging in many important catalytic processes. Herein, we observe structural evolution of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) into highly active molybdenum carbide (MoCx) during reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Surface oxygen atoms in various Mo&#8208;based catalysts are removed in H2&#8208;containing atmospheres and then carbon atoms can accumulate on surface to form MoCx phase with the RWGS reaction going on, both of which are enhanced by the presence of intercalated H species or Pt&#8208;dopants in MoOx. The structural evolution from MoOx to MoCx is accompanied by enhanced CO2 conversion, which is positively correlated with the surface C/Mo ratio but negatively with the surface O/Mo ratio. As a result, an unprecedented CO formation rate of 7544.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 600&#8201;&#176;C has been achieved over in situ carbonized H&#8208;intercalated MoO3 catalyst, which is even higher than those from noble metal catalysts. During 100&#8197;h stability test only a minimal deactivation rate of 2.3&#8201;% is observed.

         <title>Controlled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Methyl Glycolide with Bifunctional Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a bifunctional thiourea&#8208;amine&#8208;based organocatalyst has been employed in the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of optically active D&#8208; and L&#8208;methyl glycolide (MG) at room temperature. This innovative, metal&#8208;free catalytic approach leads to highly alternating poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acids) (PLGAs), both in linear and star&#8208;shaped forms. The synthesized PLGAs exhibit high regioselectivity, consistent alternating structure, recyclability, and atactic microstructure, making them suitable for drug delivery applications.







Abstract
A bifunctional thiourea&#8208;amine&#8208;based organocatalyst (Takemoto's catalyst), employing a metal&#8208;free approach, is presented for the regioselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of optically active (D and L) methyl glycolide (MG). In this study, a chiral version of Takemoto's catalyst efficiently promotes the ROP of MG at room temperature, yielding poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acids) (PLGAs) with predicted molecular weights and narrow polydispersity indices (PDI&#8804;1.2). These PLGAs exhibit highly alternating structures without transesterification, as confirmed by 1H NMR, SEC, and MALDI&#8208;TOF analyses. Additionally, various macromolecular architectures, including linear and star&#8208;shaped PLGAs, were successfully synthesized using the corresponding multi&#8208;functional alcohol initiators while maintaining the same alternating structures and regioselectivity with PLGA obtained from benzyl alcohol as initiator. Computational studies were conducted to elucidate the mechanism of alternating PLGA formation, revealing two key transition states (TSs): TS&#8208;1, which implicates the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the initiator or propagating chain on the carbonyl carbon of MG, and TS&#8208;2, which involves the subsequent ring&#8208;opening of the cyclic ester. The results indicate that ring&#8208;opening occurs at both the glycolyl and lactyl sites, with a preference for the glycolyl site, as supported by experimental results. The resulting atactic PLGAs are amorphous, rendering them suitable for drug delivery applications.

         <title>Anticancer Tetranuclear Cu(I) Complex Catalyzes a Click Reaction to Synthesize a Chemotherapeutic Agent in situ to Achieve Targeted Dual&#8208;Agent Combination Therapy for Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tetranuclear Cu(I) complex (Cu4) was developed based on apoferritin, which not only inhibited tumor growth through cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;induced immunity, but also possessed significant CuAAC reaction to synthesize a chemotherapeutic resveratrol analogue in situ for achieving targeted dual&#8208;drug combination therapy for cancer.







Abstract
To develop next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based drugs and dual&#8208;drug combination therapy for cancer, we proposed to develop a copper (Cu) complex that exerts anticancer function by integrating chemotherapy, immunotherapy and catalyzes a click reaction for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent, thereby achieving targeted dual&#8208;agent combination therapy. We designed and synthesized a tetranuclear Cu(I) complex (Cu4) with remarkable cytotoxicity and notable catalytic ability for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent via Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition (CuAAC). We also constructed an apoferritin (AFt)&#8208;Cu4 nanoparticles (NPs) delivery system. Aft&#8208;Cu4 NPs not only showed an enhanced performance of tumor growth inhibition, but also improved the targeting ability and reduced the systemic toxicity of Cu4 in vivo. Importantly, the anticancer effect was enhanced by combining the Aft&#8208;Cu4 NPs with the resveratrol analogue obtained from the CuAAC reaction in situ. Finally, we revealed the anticancer mechanism of the Cu4/Aft&#8208;Cu4 NPs, which involves both cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;induced systemic immune response.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Disialyllacto&#8208;N&#8208;Tetraose (DSLNT) and Related Human Milk Oligosaccharides Reveals Broad Siglec Recognition of the Atypical Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc Motif</title>

         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the efficiency and substrate promiscuity of human ST6GalNAc enzymes along with a panel of enzyme modules, a library of human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) containing an atypical Neu5Aca2&#8208;6GlcNAc linkage including disialyllacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose (DSLNT) was synthesized for the first time. Glycan microarray assays revealed broad yet distinct recognition by Siglecs of the atypical Neu5Aca2&#8208;6GlcNAc motif.







Abstract
Sialic acids (Sias) are ubiquitously expressed on all types of glycans, typically as terminating residues. They usually link to galactose, N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine, or other Sia residues, forming ligands of many glycan&#8208;binding proteins. An atypical linkage to the C6 of N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) has been identified in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs, e.g., DSLNT) and tumor&#8208;associated glycoconjugates. Herein, describe the systematic synthesis of these HMOs in an enzymatic modular manner. The synthetic strategy relies on a novel activity of ST6GalNAc6 for efficient construction of the Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc linkage, and another 12 specific enzyme modules for sequential HMO assembly. The structures enabled comprehensive exploration of their structure&#8208;function relationships using glycan microarrays, revealing broad yet distinct recognition by Siglecs of the atypical Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc motif. The work provides tools and new insight for the functional study and potential applications of Siglecs and HMOs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Switching of Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes on Cu(111) Evidenced by Spin&#8208;Flip Spectroscopy</title>

Spin&#8208;state switching of a spin&#8208;crossover complex on Cu(111) induced by injection of tunneling electrons. The spin&#8208;state is readout from the low&#8208;voltage differential&#8208;conductance spectrum: the high&#8208;spin state exhibits magnetic excitation steps evolving with the application of a magnetic field while no spectroscopic feature is observed in the low&#8208;spin state.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover compounds can be switched between two stable states with different magnetic moments, conformations, electronic, and optical properties, which opens appealing perspectives for technological applications including miniaturization down to the scale of single molecules. Although control of the spin states is crucial their direct identification is challenging in single&#8208;molecule experiments. Here we investigate the spin&#8208;crossover complex [Fe(HB(1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)3)2] on a Cu(111) surface with scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Spin crossover of single molecules in dense islands is achieved via electron injection. Spin&#8208;flip excitations are resolved in scanning tunneling spectra in a magnetic field enabling the direct identification of the molecular spin state, and revealing the existence of magnetic anisotropy in the HS molecules.

         <title>Eliminating Hydrogen Fluoride through Piperidine&#8208;Doped Separators for Stable Li Metal Batteries with Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated molecular sieve@piperidine&#8208;decorated polyethylene separator is proposed for eliminating the H2O&#8208;derived HF directly by an acid&#8208;base mechanism rather than the elimination of H2O. This successfully enables LMBs with a LiF&#8208;rich SEI and stable cathode structure during cycling in an electrolyte with high H2O content.







Abstract
Hydrofluoric acid (HF)&#8208;induced electrode and interfacial structure degeneration poses a significant challenge for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). To address this issue, we propose a separator strategy that involves decorating a regular polyethylene (PE) separator with molecular sieves (TW) impregnated with piperidine (PI). The porous structure of the TW serves as a reaction chamber for PI and HF. As a result, the HF content in the controlled electrolyte with 500&#8197;ppm H2O (ELE&#8208;500) is notably reduced when using TW@PI&#8208;PE separators, thereby shielding nickel&#8208;rich cathodes from HF etching. Simultaneously, due to the hydrolysis of Li salts, and the inertness of PI towards H2O, a uniform lithium fluoride (LiF)&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase can form on the Li metal anode, further mitigating dendrite formation. The lifespan of the symmetric Li cell using the TW@PI&#8208;PE separator is doubled in ELE&#8208;500, exhibiting stable 500&#8208;hour cycles at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, with the effective limitation of transition metal (TM) dissolution, the 4.6&#8208;V LMBs employing a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode maintain an 81&#8201;% capacity retention over 100&#8197;cycles, even in ELE&#8208;1000. The innovative TW@PI system presented here offers a fresh perspective for future research aimed at eliminating HF in LMBs.

         <title>Drug Discovery and Screening Tool Development for Tauopathies by Focusing on Pathogenic Tau Repeat 3 Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To identify the core region driving tauopathy, tau repeats within the microtubule&#8208;binding domain were synthesized and assessed for pathogenic traits. Repeat 3 initiated amyloid formation, cytotoxicity, and cognitive decline, with oligomeric aggregates showing pronounced neurotoxicity. This pathological form was utilized in a screening platform, leading to the discovery of tolcapone as a potent anti&#8208;tau agent. (SPPS=solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis)







Abstract
Comprehending early amyloidogenesis is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. In tauopathies like Alzheimer's disease (AD), the abnormal accumulation of tau protein is initiated by pathological tau seeds. Mounting evidence implies that the microtubule binding domain, consisting of three to four repeats, plays a pivotal role in this process, yet the exact region driving the formation of pathogenic species needs to be further scrutinized. Here, we chemically synthesized individual tau repeats to identify those exhibiting pathogenic prion&#8208;like characteristics. Notably, repeat 3 (R3) displayed a remarkable propensity to polymerize, form toxic filaments, and induce cognitive impairment, even in the absence of an aggregation&#8208;promoting inducer, highlighting its physiological relevance. Additionally, oligomeric R3 was identified as a particularly pathological form, prompting the establishment of a screening platform. Through screening, tolcapone was found to possess therapeutic efficacy against pathological tau aggregates in PS19 transgenic mice. This screening platform provides a valuable avenue for identifying compounds that selectively interact with peptides implicated in the progression of tauopathies.

         <title>Lithium Metal Recovery from Sea Water by a Flexible and Scalable Membrane with Lithium&#8208;Ion Exclusive Channels</title>

Extracting and obtaining lithium metal anodes from sea water for assembly of Li metal batteries by using single&#8208;channel Li ion&#8208;sieve membrane. The membrane effectively blocks water and interfering ions, allowing only Li ions to be transported.







Abstract
Sea water is abundant in lithium reserves, and extracting lithium metal from it holds the potential to not only mitigate the shortage of lithium in light of the fast&#8208;growing electric vehicle industry, but also serve as an anode electrode to provide electricity. The task, however, is challenging due to the harsh reactions and low lithium concentration in sea water. Here, we present a single&#8208;channel strategy based on a flexible and scalable lithium ion&#8208;sieve membrane for efficient lithium extraction. Our composite membrane exhibits high separation factor &#946;Li/Na of more than 2.87&#215;107 with an ionic conductivity of 6.2&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Lithium metal was electrolytically extracted from sea water through a hybrid&#8208;electrolyte system, which yielded a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.04&#8201;% and a low energy consumption of 17.4&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgLi&#8722;1 at an optimized extracting current of 200&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The extracted lithium metal can be directly integrated into a lithium&#8208;sulfur battery, delivering an energy output of 395&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. To demonstrate its industrial viability, we also fabricate a pouch cell with Li metal anode extracted by an amplified extraction prototype. This study has the potential to dispel concerns of lithium depletion and facilitate the sustainable development of lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems.

Breaking upper limit of CO2&#8208;uptake at low&#8208;pressure using porous materials is challenging due to the lack of multiple adsorption mechanisms. This study presents a novel concept of reversible multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to alkaline earth metal ion&#8208;pairs in ferrierite&#8208;type zeolite with the formation of unprecedented CO2&#8208;complexes even at 400&#8197;ppm and 298&#8197;K. The findings in the present study offer a new direction for efficient CO2 adsorbents.







Abstract
The efficient capture of low&#8208;pressure CO2 remains a significant challenge due to the lack of established multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to active sites in microporous materials. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of reversible multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to alkaline earth metal (AEM) ion pairs, utilizing a host site in ferrierite&#8208;type zeolite (FER). This unique site constrains two AEM ions in proximity, thereby enhancing and isotopically spreading their electrostatic potentials within the zeolite cavity. This electrostatic potential&#8208;engineered micropore can trap up to four CO2 molecules, forming M2+&#8722;(CO2)n&#8722;M2+ (n=0&#8211;4, M=Ca, Sr, Ba) complexes, where each CO2 molecule is stabilized by interactions between terminal oxygen (Ot) in CO2 and the AEM ions. Notably, the Ba2+ pair site exhibits higher thermodynamic stability for multiple adsorptions due to the optimal binding mode of Ba2+&#8722;Ot&#8722;Ba2+. Through high&#8208;accuracy energy calculations, we have established the relationship among structure, CO2 uptake, and operating temperature/pressure, demonstrating that the Ba2+ pair site can capture four CO2 molecules even at concentrations as low as 400&#8197;ppm and at 298&#8197;K. Three of the four molecules of CO2 trapped were removable at room temperature and under vacuum. The findings in the present study provide a new direction for developing efficient CO2 adsorbents.

&lt;p&gt;Breaking upper limit of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-uptake at low-pressure using porous materials is challenging due to the lack of multiple adsorption mechanisms. This study presents a novel concept of reversible multi-complexation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to alkaline earth metal ion-pairs in ferrierite-type zeolite with the formation of unprecedented CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-complexes even at 400&#8197;ppm and 298&#8197;K. The findings in the present study offer a new direction for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorbents.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficient capture of low-pressure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remains a significant challenge due to the lack of established multi-complexation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to active sites in microporous materials. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of reversible multi-complexation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to alkaline earth metal (AEM) ion pairs, utilizing a host site in ferrierite-type zeolite (FER). This unique site constrains two AEM ions in proximity, thereby enhancing and isotopically spreading their electrostatic potentials within the zeolite cavity.

         <title>Simultaneous Inhibition of Vanadium Dissolution and Zinc Dendrites by Mineral&#8208;Derived Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Metal Batteries</title>

Kaolin is demonstrated as an effective material to prepare Zn&#8208;based solid electrolyte (KL&#8208;Zn), which simultaneously eliminates the interfacial side reactions of zinc anode and inhibits the vanadium dissolution of NH4V4O10 cathode, endowing high reversible capacity and superior cyclic stability for Zn//NH4V4O10 batteries.







Abstract
Designing solid electrolyte is deemed as an effective approach to suppress the side reaction of zinc anode and active material dissolution of cathodes in liquid electrolytes for zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, kaolin is comprehensively investigated as raw material to prepare solid electrolyte (KL&#8722;Zn) for ZMBs. As demonstrated, KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte is an excellent electronic insulator and zinc ionic conductor, which presents wide voltage window of 2.73&#8197;V, high ionic conductivity of 5.08&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, and high Zn2+ transference number of 0.79. For the Zn//Zn cells, superior cyclic stability lasting for 2200&#8197;h can be achieved at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. For the Zn//NH4V4O10 batteries, stable capacity of 245.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 can be maintained at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles along with high retention ratio of 81&#8201;%, manifesting KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte contributes to stabilize the crystal structure of NH4V4O10 cathode. These satisfying performances can be attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing, zinc (de)solvation&#8208;free mechanism and fast diffusion kinetics of KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte, availably guaranteeing uniform zinc deposition for zinc anode and reversible zinc (de)intercalation for NH4V4O10 cathode. Additionally, this work also verifies the application possibility of KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte for Zn//MnO2 batteries and Zn//I2 batteries, suggesting the universality of mineral&#8208;based solid electrolyte.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Autotrophic Growth and Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Chemical Conversion in Shewanella Oneidensis MR&#8208;1&#8201;through Light&#8208;Driven Electron Transfer</title>

Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 achieved months&#8208;long autotrophic growth and acetate production through CO2 fixation coupled to sulfur oxidation, driven by biogenic CdS nanoparticles under light.







Abstract
Members of the genus Shewanella are known for their versatile electron accepting routes, which allow them to couple decomposition of organic matter to reduction of various terminal electron acceptors for heterotrophic growth in diverse environments. Here, we report autotrophic growth of Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 with photoelectrons provided by illuminated biogenic CdS nanoparticles. This hybrid system enables photosynthetic oscillatory acetate production from CO2 for over five months, far exceeding other inorganic&#8208;biological hybrid system that can only sustain for hours or days. Biochemical, electrochemical and transcriptomic analyses reveal that the efficient electron uptake of S. oneidensis MR&#8208;1 from illuminated CdS nanoparticles supplies sufficient energy to stimulate the previously overlooked reductive glycine pathway for CO2 fixation. The continuous solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion is achieved by photon induced electric recycling in sulfur species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this mineral&#8208;assisted photosynthesis, as a widely existing and unique model of light energy conversion, could support the sustained photoautotrophic growth of non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms in nutrient&#8208;lean environments and mediate the reversal of coupled carbon and sulfur cycling, consequently resulting in previously unknown environmental effects. In addition, the hybrid system provides a sustainable and flexible platform to develop a variety of solar products for carbon neutrality.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Induced &#8216;Click Reaction&#8217; Involving Coordination and Covalent Assembly of Hybrid Borates for the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthetic method is developed to synthesize a large family of pyrazole molecule&#8208;protected borates containing cyclic eight&#8208;membered B4O4&#8208;ring as corns, in a rapid and precise manner under mild conditions. The obtained borates proved to be good electrocatalytic catalysts for CO2 reduction reaction towards HCOOH and C2H4.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of hybrid borates by the organic ligand modification method are urgent and undeveloped areas of research. It is difficult to directly integrate organoboronic acids within inorganic borate chemistry by adopting the traditional preparation approaches. This work reports a facile synthetic method to synthesize a large family of pyrazole molecule&#8208;protected borates in a rapid and precise manner under mild conditions. A unique cyclic eight&#8208;membered B4O4&#8208;ring has been identified as the cluster core for all these hybrid borates with two different conformations (boat and crown). This strategy can be applied to a system of pyrazolyl molecules to generate such hybrid borates in two independent routes from organoboronic or inorganic boric acids. Furtherly, the mechanism of &#8216;click reaction&#8217; between boric acid and pyrazole induced by copper ions has been proposed based on the synthetic conditions and the structure of intermediate. Due to the bimetallic Cu sites and the functional surfaces, these materials can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction and efficiently enhance the selectivity of HCOOH and C2H4. Our strategy can be regarded as a typical template technique for organic molecule&#8208;protected borates.

         <title>Operando Stable Palladium Hydride Nanoclusters Anchored on Tungsten Carbides Mediate Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>

The reverse hydrogen spillover was mediated over operando stable Pd hydrides on tungsten carbides systems, which endows efficient and durable hydrogen evolution in proton exchange membrane electrolysis with ultralow Pd loading of 0.022&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis holds great promise for green hydrogen production, but suffering from high loading of platinum&#8208;group metals (PGM) for large&#8208;scale deployment. Anchoring PGM&#8208;based materials on supports can not only improve the atomic utilization of active sites but also enhance the intrinsic activity. However, in practical PEM electrolysis, it is still challenging to mediate hydrogen adsorption/desorption pathways with high coverage of hydrogen intermediates over catalyst surface. Here, operando generated stable palladium (Pd) hydride nanoclusters anchored on tungsten carbide (WCx) supports were constructed for hydrogen evolution in PEM electrolysis. Under PEM operando conditions, hydrogen intercalation induces formation of Pd hydrides (PdHx) featuring weakened hydrogen binding energy (HBE), thus triggering reverse hydrogen spillover from WCx (strong HBE) supports to PdHx sites, which have been evidenced by operando characterizations, electrochemical results and theoretical studies. This PdHx&#8208;WCx material can be directly utilized as cathode electrocatalysts in PEM electrolysis with ultralow Pd loading of 0.022&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, delivering the current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the cell voltage of ~1.66&#8197;V and continuously running for 200&#8197;hours without obvious degradation. This innovative strategy via tuning the operando characteristics to mediate reverse hydrogen spillover provide new insights for designing high&#8208;performance supported PGM&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Exchange of CO2 with CO as Reactant Switches Selectivity in Photoreduction on Co&#8722;ZrO2 from C1&#8211;3 Paraffin to Small Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pathways from CO2 to paraffin while from CO to C2H4 and C3H6 using Co&#8722;ZrO2 photocatalyst were switched. CO2 at the O vacancy on ZrO2 transformed into COH and hopped onto Co0 to be paraffin while CO and H competed on Co0 leading to preferable coupling of CH2 to olefins.







Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2,3 hydrocarbons completes a C&#8208;neutral cycle. The reaction pathways of photocatalytic generation of C2,3 paraffin and C2H4 from CO2 are mostly unclear. Herein, a Co0&#8722;ZrO2 photocatalyst converted CO2 into C1&#8211;3 paraffin, while selectively converting CO into C2H4 and C3H6 (6.0&#177;0.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, 70&#8197;mol&#8201;%) only under UV/Visible light. The photocatalytic cycle was conducted under 13CO and H2, with subsequent evacuation and flushing with CO. This iterative process led to an increase in the population of C2H4 and C3H6 up to 61&#8211;87&#8197;mol&#8201;%, attributed to the accumulation of CH2 species at the interface between Co0 nanoparticles and the ZrO2 surface. CO2 adsorbed onto the O vacancies of the ZrO2 surface, with resulting COH species undergoing hydrogenation on the Co0 surface to yield C1&#8211;3 paraffin using either H2 or H2O (g, l) as the reductant. In contrast, CO adsorbed on the Co0 surface, converted to HCOH species, and then split into CH and OH species at the Co and O vacancy sites on ZrO2, respectively. This comprehensive study elucidates intricate photocatalytic pathways governing the transformation of CO2 into paraffin and CO to olefins.

         <title>Growth Kinetics of Graphene on Cu(111) Foils from Methane, Ethyne, Ethylene, and Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We obtained the activation enthalpies of graphene island growth on Cu(111) foils using H2 and: CH4, and C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6, respectively. The rate determining step (RDS) for CH4 is its gas phase decomposition to H and CH3. The RDS for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 is dehydrogenation on the Cu(111) surface yielding adsorbed C2H1, C2H3, and C2H5, respectively.







Abstract
Chemical vapor deposition of carbon precursors on Cu&#8208;based substrates at temperatures exceeding 1000&#8201;&#176;C is currently a typical route for the scalable synthesis of large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) films. Using molecules with higher activities than CH4 may afford lower growth temperatures that might yield fold&#8208; and wrinkle&#8208;free graphene. The kinetics of growth of graphene using hydrocarbons other than CH4 are of interest to the scientific and industrial communities. We measured the growth rates of graphene islands on Cu(111) foils by using C2H2, C2H4, C2H6 and CH4, respectively (each mixed with H2). From such kinetics data we obtain the activation enthalpy (&#916;H&#8800;) of graphene growth as shown in parentheses (C2H2 (0.93&#177;0.09&#8197;eV); C2H4 (2.05&#177;0.19&#8197;eV); C2H6 (2.50&#177;0.11&#8197;eV); CH4 (4.59&#177;0.26&#8197;eV)); C2Hy (y=2, 4, 6) show similar growth behavior but CH4 is different. Computational fluid dynamics and density functional theory simulations suggest that C2Hy differs from CH4 due to different values of adsorption energy and the lifetime of relevant carbon precursors on the Cu(111) surface. Combining experimental and simulation results, we find that the rate determining step (RDS) is the dissociation of the first C&#8722;H bond of CH4 molecules in the gas phase, while the RDS using C2Hy is the first dehydrogenation of adsorbed C2Hy that happens with assistance of H atoms adsorbed on the Cu(111) surface. By using C2H2 as the carbon precursor, high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal adlayer&#8208;free SLG films are achieved on Cu(111) foils at 900&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Visualizing Triplet Energy Transfer in Organic Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescent Host&#8208;Guest Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel NIR phosphors are constructed using a n&#8208;&#960;&#8208;n molecular design strategy. Their phosphorescence can be readily modulated by altering the conjugated core structures. When incorporated into a 4&#8208;bromobenzophenone host, these materials exhibit efficient NIR phosphorescence ranging from 655&#8211;710&#8197;nm. Analysis of the exciton transition process reveals that the enhanced phosphorescence of the guest originates from the triplet energy transfer of abundant triplet excitons generated independently by the host material.

Limited by the energy gap law, purely organic materials with efficient near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence are rare and difficult to achieve. Additionally, the exciton transition process among different emitting species in host&#8211;guest phosphorescent materials remains elusive, presenting a significant academic challenge. Herein, using a modular nonbonding orbital&#8208;&#960; bridge&#8208;nonbonding orbital (n&#8208;&#960;&#8208;n) molecular design strategy, we develop a series of heavy atom&#8208;free phosphors. Systematic modification of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores enables the construction of a library with tunable near&#8208;infrared phosphorescence from 655 to 710&#8197;nm. These phosphors exhibit excellent performance under ambient conditions when dispersed into a 4&#8208;bromobenzophenone host matrix, achieving an extended lifetime of 11.25&#8197;ms and a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 4.2&#8201;%. Notably, by eliminating the interference from host phosphorescence, the exciton transition process in hybrid materials can be visualized under various excitation conditions. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that the improved phosphorescent performance of the guest originates from the triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer of abundant triplet excitons generated independently by the host, rather than from enhanced intersystem crossing efficiency between the guest singlet state and the host triplet state. The findings provide in&#8208;depth insights into constructing novel near&#8208;infrared phosphors and exploring emission mechanisms of host&#8211;guest materials.

&lt;p&gt;Novel NIR phosphors are constructed using a n-&#960;-n molecular design strategy. Their phosphorescence can be readily modulated by altering the conjugated core structures. When incorporated into a 4-bromobenzophenone host, these materials exhibit efficient NIR phosphorescence ranging from 655&#8211;710&#8197;nm. Analysis of the exciton transition process reveals that the enhanced phosphorescence of the guest originates from the triplet energy transfer of abundant triplet excitons generated independently by the host material.

We report atomically dispersed manganese (Mn) embedded on nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped graphene for ORR in alkaline electrolyte, realizing a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.883&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with negligible activity degradation after 40,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. Introducing sulfur (S) changes the spin state of single Mn atom from high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin, optimizing the oxygen intermediates adsorption.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) are promising non&#8208;precious catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Unfortunately, the ORR SACs usually suffer from unsatisfactory activity and in particular poor stability. Herein, we report atomically dispersed manganese (Mn) embedded on nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped graphene as an efficient and robust electrocatalyst for ORR in alkaline electrolyte, realizing a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.883&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with negligible activity degradation after 40,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. Introducing sulfur (S) to form Mn&#8722;S coordination changes the spin state of single Mn atom from high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin, verified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and magnetic susceptibility measurements as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which effectively optimizes the oxygen intermediates adsorption over the single Mn atomic sites and thus greatly improves the ORR activity.

The [SbCl5]2&#8722; luminescent center structure is formed by self&#8208;assembly of SbCl3, methylamine hydrochloride, and 18&#8208;crown ether&#8208;6. This asymmetric structure can control the emission of singlet&#8208;triplet hybrid excitons by wavelength at room temperature. Under ultraviolet irradiation at 310&#8197;nm, it shows strong emission at 470&#8197;nm, white light emission under 340&#8197;nm irradiation, and strong emission at 570&#8197;nm under 370&#8197;nm irradiation.







Abstract
Self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission, typified by antimony (Sb), with broadband characteristics, represents the next generation of materials for solid&#8208;state lighting and radiation detection. However, little is known about the multiexciton behavior of the Sb emission center. Here, we proposed a general approach for designing antimony&#8208;centered multi&#8208;exciton emitting materials through self&#8208;assembly. Benefitting from controllable multiexciton behavior, dual&#8208;band white light emission spanning the entire visible spectrum was achieved. Relying on the reduction of an effective atomic number brought by self&#8208;assembly, excellent scintillation response to &#946;&#8208;rays was attained. This study offers unprecedented insight into hybrid single/triple STE emission and unveils new avenues for single&#8208;emitter white&#8208;light emission, as well as radiographic testing using low&#8208;risk &#946;&#8208;rays as sources.

         <title>Steering the Selectivity of CORR from Acetate to Ethanol via Tailoring the Thermodynamic Activity of Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal approach was developed to tune the selectivity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in CORR from acetate to ethanol by tailoring the thermodynamic activity of water. The faradaic efficiencies of ethanol and alcohol can reach 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;% at 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The ability to control the selectivity of CORR opens up new possibilities for synthesizing a wider range of valuable chemical products from CO2.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) into oxygenated C2+ products at high rates and selectivity offers a promising approach for the two&#8208;step conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, a major drawback of the CO electrochemical reduction in alkaline electrolyte is the preference for the acetate pathway over the more valuable ethanol pathway. Recent research has shed light on the significant impact of thermodynamic water activity on the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction pathways, but less is understood for the electrochemical reduction of CO. In this study, we investigated how the water activity at the electrified interface can be enhanced to adjust the selectivity between acetate and ethanol. We employed an ionomer modifier to lower the local concentration of alkali ions (via Donnan exclusion), successfully enhancing ethanol production while suppressing acetate formation. We observed a remarkable improvement in the Faradaic efficiency of ethanol and alcohol (i.&#8201;e. ethanol, propanol etc), which reached 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;%, respectively, at a current density of 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The partial current densities of ethanol and alcohol reached 698 and 942&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, we achieved a 3.7&#8208;fold increase in the ethanol/acetate ratio, providing clear evidence of our successful modulation of product selectivity.

         <title>Stable Dendrite&#8208;Free Room Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Enabled by a Novel Sodium Thiotellurate Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel sodium thiotellurate (Na2TeS3) interfaces are constructed both on the cathode and anode for Na&#8722;S batteries to simultaneously address the Na dendritic growth and polysulfide shuttling. Benefiting from this rational design, an anode&#8208;free cell fabricated with the Na2S/Na2Te@C cathode delivers an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 634&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C under practically necessary conditions, which could pave a new path to design high&#8208;performance cathodes for anode&#8208;free RT Na&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The practical application of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries is severely hindered by inhomogeneous sodium deposition and notorious sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) shuttling. Herein, novel sodium thiotellurate (Na2TeS3) interfaces are constructed both on the cathode and anode for Na&#8722;S batteries to simultaneously address the Na dendritic growth and polysulfides shuttling. On the cathode side, a heterostructural sodium sulfide/sodium telluride embedded in a carbon matrix (Na2S/Na2Te@C) is rationally designed through a facile carbothermal reaction, where the Na2TeS3 interface will be in situ chemically obtained. Such an interface provides abundant electron/ion diffusion channels and ensures rich catalytic surfaces toward Na&#8722;S redox, which could significantly improve the utilization of active material and alleviate polysulfides shuttling in the cathode.

&lt;p&gt;Novel sodium thiotellurate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TeS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) interfaces are constructed both on the cathode and anode for Na&#8722;S batteries to simultaneously address the Na dendritic growth and polysulfide shuttling. Benefiting from this rational design, an anode-free cell fabricated with the Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te@C cathode delivers an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 634&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;C under practically necessary conditions, which could pave a new path to design high-performance cathodes for anode-free RT Na&#8722;S batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical application of room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries is severely hindered by inhomogeneous sodium deposition and notorious sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) shuttling. Herein, novel sodium thiotellurate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TeS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) interfaces are constructed both on the cathode and anode for Na&#8722;S batteries to simultaneously address the Na dendritic growth and polysulfides shuttling. On the cathode side, a heterostructural sodium sulfide/sodium telluride embedded in a carbon matrix (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te@C) is rationally designed through a facile carbothermal reaction, where the Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TeS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface will be in situ chemically obtained. Such an interface provides abundant electron/ion diffusion channels and ensures rich catalytic surfaces toward Na&#8722;S redox, which could significantly improve the utilization of active material and alleviate polysulfides shuttling in the cathode. On the anode side, the inevitable formation of soluble polytellurosulfides species will migrate on Na anode surface, finally constructing a compact and smooth solid-electrolyte Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TeS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interphase (SEI) layer. Such electrochemical formed Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TeS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface can significantly enhance ionic transport and stabilize Na deposition, thus realizing dendrite-free Na-metal plating/stripping. Benefitting from these advantages, an anode-free cell fabricated with the Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te@C cathode exhibits an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 634&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;C, which could pave a new path to design high-performance cathodes for anode-free RT Na&#8722;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anilines Formation via Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Reaction of Ynones with Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented and efficient approach for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted anilines was reported. With a simple Mo&#8208;catalyst, a wide range of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines, some of which were otherwise challenging to access, were efficiently prepared in generally good yields from readily accessible ynones and allylic amines. This process was robust, modular and ready for the syntheses of various valuable multi&#8208;substituted anilines.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;substituted anilines are widely found in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science. The quest for robust and efficient methods to construct a diverse array of these compounds using readily accessible starting materials under simple reaction conditions is of utmost importance. Here, we report an unprecedented and efficient approach for the synthesis of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines. With a simple molybdenum(VI) catalyst, a wide range of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines were efficiently prepared in generally good to excellent yields from readily accessible ynones and allylic amines. The synthetic potential of this methodology was further underscored by its applications in several synthetic transformations, gram&#8208;scale reactions, and derivatization of bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that this aniline formation might involve a cascade of aza&#8208;Michael addition, [1,6]&#8208;proton shift, cyclization, dehydration, 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization, and aromatization. This novel strategy provided a robust, simple, and modular approach for the syntheses of various valuable di&#8208; or trisubstituted anilines, some of which were otherwise challenging to access.

         <title>Supramolecular Control of Helicene Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emitters in Molecular Solids and Bright Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic molecular chiroptical properties (electronic circular dichroism and circular polarized luminescence) of helicences are perfectly transferred from solution to the crystal state and to water&#8208;soluble nanoparticles by encapsulating the chiral emitter in supramolecular small&#8208;molecule, ionic isolation lattices (SMILES). Furthermore, CPL brightness is enhanced by combination with a rhodamine antenna system.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from chiral molecules is attracting much attention due to its potential use in optical materials. However, formulation of CPL emitters as molecular solids typically deteriorates photophysical properties in the aggregated state leading to quenching and unpredictable changes in CPL behavior impeding materials development. To circumvent these shortcomings, a supramolecular approach can be used to isolate cationic dyes in a lattice of cyanostar&#8208;anion complexes that suppress aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and which we hypothesize can preserve the synthetically&#8208;crafted chiroptical properties. Herein, we verify that supramolecular assembly of small&#8208;molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES) allows translation of molecular ECD and CPL properties to solids. A series of cationic helicenes that display increasing chiroptical response is investigated. Crystal structures of three different packing motifs all show spatial isolation of dyes by the anion complexes. We observe the photophysical and chiroptical properties of all helicenes are seamlessly translated to water soluble nanoparticles by the SMILES method. Also, a DMQA helicene is used as FRET acceptor in SMILES nanoparticles of intensely absorbing rhodamine antennae to generate an 18&#8208;fold boost in CPL brightness. These features offer promise for reliably accessing bright materials with programmable CPL properties.

         <title>Nanoporous Heterojunction Photocatalysts with Engineered Interfacial Sites for Efficient Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoporous and chemically bonded S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is synthesized by hybridization of two semiconducting MOFs, which exhibits excellent performance of photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction with an NH3 production rate of 2.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield value of 16.2&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.28&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (PNRR) offers a promising strategy for sustainable production of ammonia (NH3). However, the reported photocatalysts suffer from low efficiency with great room to improve regarding the charge carrier utilization and active site engineering. Herein, a porous and chemically bonded heterojunction photocatalyst is developed for efficient PNRR to NH3 production via hybridization of two semiconducting metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs), MIL&#8208;125&#8722;NH2 (MIL=Material Institute Lavoisier) and Co&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytripehenylene). Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the formation of Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Co chemical bonds at the interface, which not only serve as atomic pathway for S&#8208;scheme charge transfer, but also provide electron&#8208;deficient Co centers for improving N2 chemisorption/activation capability and restricting competitive hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the nanoporous structure allows the transportation of reactants to the interfacial active sites at heterojunction, enabling the efficient utilization of charge carriers. Consequently, the rationally designed MOF&#8208;based heterojunction exhibits remarkable PNRR performance with an NH3 production rate of 2.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield (AQY) value of 16.2&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 0.28&#8201;%, superior to most reported PNRR photocatalysts. Our work provides new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Vacancy Effect on the Luminescent and Water Responsive Properties of Vacancy&#8208;Ordered Double Perovskite Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inversely relationships between vacancy volume in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite derivatives with their luminescent quantum yield and water stability have been established for the first time based on a series of [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8242;&#8208;type vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite derivatives.







Abstract
Vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskites and derivatives represent an important subclass of hybrid metal halides with promise in applications including light emitting devices and photovoltaics. Understanding the vacancy&#8208;property relationship is crucial for designing related task&#8208;specific materials, yet research in this field remains sporadic. For the first time, we use the Connolly surface to quantitatively calculate the volume of vacancy (V&#9633;, &#9633;=vacancy) in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite derivatives (VDPDs). A relationship between void fraction and the structure, photoluminescent properties and humidity stability was established based on zero&#8208;dimensional (0&#8208;D) [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8242;&#8208;type VDPDs.

     alt="Vacancy Effect on the Luminescent and Water Responsive Properties of Vacancy-Ordered Double Perovskite Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inversely relationships between vacancy volume in vacancy-ordered double perovskite derivatives with their luminescent quantum yield and water stability have been established for the first time based on a series of [N(alkyl)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&#9633;Cl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#9633;&#8242;-type vacancy-ordered perovskite derivatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vacancy-ordered perovskites and derivatives represent an important subclass of hybrid metal halides with promise in applications including light emitting devices and photovoltaics. Understanding the vacancy-property relationship is crucial for designing related task-specific materials, yet research in this field remains sporadic. For the first time, we use the Connolly surface to quantitatively calculate the volume of vacancy (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&#9633;, &#9633;=vacancy) in vacancy-ordered double perovskite derivatives (VDPDs). A relationship between void fraction and the structure, photoluminescent properties and humidity stability was established based on zero-dimensional (0-D) [N(alkyl)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&#9633;Cl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#9633;&#8242;-type VDPDs.

Our results demonstrate an inverse relationship between the photoluminescent quantum yield and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&#9633; in 0-D VDPDs. Additionally, structural transformation from &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Synchronously Improved Multiple Afterglow and Phosphorescence Efficiencies in 0D Hybrid Zinc Halides With Ultrahigh Anti&#8208;Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 0D hybrid Zn halide family with high water&#8208;resistance and simultaneous integration of cyan STE emission and ultralong green afterglow was firstly synthesized by skillfully manipulating metal halides and organic phosphors as independent optical centers. Through regulating heavy atom effect to control the intersystem crossing rate and spin&#8208;orbit coupling, the dormant emitting units were significantly activated resulting in unprecedented high emission efficiency for both STE and afterglow emissions in 0D hybrid metal halides, which was applied for color&#8208;time&#8208;dual&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption&#8208;decryption.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides have been emerged as room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, but synchronous optimization of multiple phosphorescence performance in one structural platform remains less resolved, and stable RTP activity in aqueous medium is also unrealized due to serious instability toward water and oxygen. Herein, we demonstrated a photophysical tuning strategy in a new 0D hybrid zinc halide family of (BTPP)2ZnX4 (BTPP=benzyltriphenylphosphonium, X=Cl and Br). Infrequently, the delicate combination of organic and inorganic species enables this family to display multiple ultralong green afterglow and efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) associated cyan phosphorescence. Compared with inert luminescence of [BTPP]+ cation, incorporation of anionic [ZnX4]2&#8722; effectively enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect, which significantly boosts the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 30.66&#8201;% and 54.62&#8201;% for afterglow and phosphorescence, respectively. Synchronously, the corresponding luminescence lifetime extend to 143.94&#8197;ms and 0.308&#8197;&#956;s surpassing the indiscernible phosphorescence of [BTPP]X salt. More importantly, this halide family presents robust RTP emission with nearly unattenuated PLQY in water and harsh condition (acid and basic aqueous solution) over half a year. The highly efficient integrated afterglow and STE phosphorescence as well as ultrahigh aqueous state RTP realize multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications in wide chemical environments.

A newly synthesized complex, KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2, with the dihydrogen bond structural features, exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, four orders of magnitude greater than that of KCB9H10 and the highest ionic conductivity reported to date for hydridoborate&#8208;based K+ conductors. This work offers a promising strategy for synthesizing solid K&#8208;ion conductors with enhanced conductivity.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries have caught increasing interest owing to their abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high energy/power density. However, their development is generally constrained by the lack of suitable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Herein, we report a new complex KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2, synthesized by grinding and heating the mixture of potassium decahydrido&#8208;monocarba&#8208;closo&#8208;decaborate (KCB9H10) and imidazole (C3H4N2) under mild conditions, to achieve the K&#8208;ion superionic solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The crystal structure was revealed as an orthorhombic lattice with the space group of Pna21 by FOX software. The diffusion properties for K+ in the crystal structure were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI&#8208;NEB) method. KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2 exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, four orders of magnitude higher than that of KCB9H10. This ionic conductivity is also the highest value of hydridoborate&#8208;based K+ conductors reported. Moreover, KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2 demonstrated a K+ transference number of 0.96, an electrochemical stability window of 1.2 to 3.2&#8197;V vs. K/K+, and good stability against the K metal coated by a layer of potassium imidazolate (KIm). These great performances make KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2 a promising K&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state electrolyte.

         <title>One&#8208;Stone&#8208;For&#8208;Three&#8208;Birds Strategy Using a Fullerene Modifier for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>

A novel fullerene derivative (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) is synthesized and employed to modify the interface between perovskite and C60. C60&#8208;TMA can passivate the surface defects to suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination, form a cascade energy level to facilitate electron extraction, and induce secondary growth of perovskite, contributing to a champion PCE of 24.89&#8201;% for inverted PSCs with significantly improved thermal stability.







Abstract
The electron extraction from perovskite/C60 interface plays a crucial role in influencing the photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a one&#8208;stone&#8208;for&#8208;three&#8208;birds strategy via employing a novel fullerene derivative bearing triple methyl acrylate groups (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) as a multifunctional interfacial layer to optimize electron extraction at the perovskite/C60 interface. It is found that the C60&#8208;TMA not only passivates surface defects of perovskite via coordination interactions between C=O groups and Pb2+ cations but also bridge electron transfer between perovskite and C60.

&lt;p&gt;A novel fullerene derivative (denoted as C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-TMA) is synthesized and employed to modify the interface between perovskite and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;. C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-TMA can passivate the surface defects to suppress non-radiative recombination, form a cascade energy level to facilitate electron extraction, and induce secondary growth of perovskite, contributing to a champion PCE of 24.89&#8201;% for inverted PSCs with significantly improved thermal stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electron extraction from perovskite/C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; interface plays a crucial role in influencing the photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a one-stone-for-three-birds strategy via employing a novel fullerene derivative bearing triple methyl acrylate groups (denoted as C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-TMA) as a multifunctional interfacial layer to optimize electron extraction at the perovskite/C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; interface. It is found that the C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-TMA not only passivates surface defects of perovskite via coordination interactions between C=O groups and Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations but also bridge electron transfer between perovskite and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, it effectively induces the secondary grain growth of the perovskite film through strong bonding effect, and this phenomenon has never been observed in prior art reports on fullerene related studies. The combination of the above three upgrades enables improved perovskite film quality with increased grain size and enhanced crystallinity. With these advantages, C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-TMA treated PSC devices exhibit a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.89&#8201;% than the control devices (23.66&#8201;%).

         <title>Chaperone&#8208;Derived Copper(I)&#8208;Binding Peptide Nanofibers Disrupt Copper Homeostasis in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a chaperone&#8208;derived Cu+&#8208;binding peptide featuring the conserved MTCGGC Cu+ binding motif, which self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers within cancer cells. These nanofibers have multiple MTCGGC Cu+&#8208;binding motifs on their surfaces, allowing for efficient capture of intracellular Cu+ ions. This process disrupts the Cu+ homeostasis network of cancer cells. Our study offers a novel therapeutic intervention targeting metal ion homeostasis in cancer.







Abstract
Copper (Cu) is a transition metal that plays crucial roles in cellular metabolism. Cu+ homeostasis is upregulated in many cancers and contributes to tumorigenesis. However, therapeutic strategies to target Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells are rarely explored because small molecule Cu+ chelators have poor binding affinity in comparison to the intracellular Cu+ chaperones, enzymes, or ligands. To address this challenge, we introduce a Cu+ chaperone&#8208;inspired supramolecular approach to disrupt Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells that induces programmed cell death. The Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR peptide self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers inside cancer cells with high binding affinity and selectivity for Cu+ due to the presence of the unique MTCGGC motif, which is conserved in intracellular Cu+ chaperones. Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR exhibits cytotoxicity towards triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231), impairs the activity of Cu+ dependent co&#8208;chaperone super oxide dismutase1 (SOD1), and induces oxidative stress. In contrast, Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR has minimal impact on normal HEK 293T cells. Control peptides show that the self&#8208;assembly and Cu+ binding must work in synergy to successfully disrupt Cu+ homeostasis. We show that assembly&#8208;enhanced affinity for metal ions opens new therapeutic strategies to address disease&#8208;relevant metal ion homeostasis.

         <title>Bioactive Ion&#8208;Confined Ultracapacitive Memristors with Neuromorphic Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>

Pronounced physisorption of bioactive cations with a hydrophobic alkyl chain by porous carbons with a negative zeta potential results in confined cations, which triggers anion enrichment and depletion under electric polarization and enables rapid differential ionic memresistance behavior for cations with strong and weak interactions with porous carbons.







Abstract
The field of bioinspired iontronics, bridging electronic devices and ionic systems, has multiple biological applications. Carbon&#8208;based ultracapacitive devices hold promise for controlling bioactive ions via electric double layers due to their high&#8208;surface&#8208;area and biocompatible porous carbon electrodes. However, the interplay between complex bioactive ions and porous carbons remains unclear due to the variety of structures of bioactive ions present in biological systems. Herein, we investigate the adsorption behavior of a series of bioactive ammonium&#8208;based cations with varying alkyl chain lengths in nanoporous carbons. We find that strong physisorption results from the synergistic hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction between porous carbons (with a negative zeta potential) and bioactive cations. Bioactive cations with varying alkyl chain lengths can be irreversibly physically adsorbed and confined within nanoporous carbons resulting in anion enrichment and depletion during electric polarization. This situation, in turn, results in a characteristic memristive behavior in all&#8208;carbon capacitive ionic memristor devices. Our findings highlight the relationship between the resistance state of the memristor and ion adsorption mechanisms in all&#8208;carbon capacitive devices, which hold potential for future transmitter delivery, biointerfacing, and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolved Protein Imaging Using Bifunctional Light&#8208;Up Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusions of protein&#8208;binding aptamers to the fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamer RhoBAST enabled visualization of GFP&#8208;tagged or endogenous proteins in both fixed and live mammalian cells. The fast exchange of the fluorogen yields intermittent fluorescence required for super&#8208;resolved imaging by RhoBAST&#8208;PAINT, a single&#8208;molecule localization technique.







Abstract
Efficient labeling methods for protein visualization with minimal tag size and appropriate photophysical properties are required for single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), providing insights into the organization and interactions of biomolecules in cells at the molecular level. Among the fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamers (FLAPs) originally developed for RNA imaging, RhoBAST stands out due to its remarkable brightness, photostability, fluorogenicity, and rapid exchange kinetics, enabling super&#8208;resolved imaging with high localization precision. Here, we expand the applicability of RhoBAST to protein imaging by fusing it to protein&#8208;binding aptamers. The versatility of such bifunctional aptamers is demonstrated by employing a variety of protein&#8208;binding aptamers and different FLAPs. Moreover, fusing RhoBAST with the GFP&#8208;binding aptamer AP3 facilitates high&#8208; and super&#8208;resolution imaging of GFP&#8208;tagged proteins, which is particularly valuable in view of the widespread availability of plasmids and stable cell lines expressing proteins fused to GFP. The bifunctional aptamers compare favorably with standard antibody&#8208;based immunofluorescence protocols, as they are 7&#8208;fold smaller than antibody conjugates and exhibit higher bleaching&#8208;resistance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in super&#8208;resolution microscopy in secondary mammalian cell lines and primary neurons by RhoBAST&#8208;PAINT, an SMLM protein imaging technique that leverages the transient binding of the fluorogenic rhodamine dye SpyRho to RhoBAST.

         <title>Phenyl Radical Activates Molecular Hydrogen Through Protium and Deuterium Tunneling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activating the strong H2 bond is typically reserved for transition metals, and only a few main group systems can tackle this challenge. Here, we explore a phenyl radical mediated pathway utilizing the photolysis of iodobenzene. The phenyl radical leverages the high C&#8722;H bond energy of the forming benzene to drive H2 activation. Low&#8208;temperature experiments and dual level instanton computations reveal hydrogen tunneling as a critical factor.







Abstract
Activating dihydrogen, H2, is a challenging endeavor typically achieved using transition metal centers. Pure main&#8208;group compounds capable of this are rare and have emerged in recent decades. These systems rely on synergistic donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with H2&#8217;s antibonding &#963;* and bonding &#963; orbital. An alternative (hydrocarbon) radical&#8208;mediated activation is problematic because the H&#8722;H bond is stronger (104.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) than most C&#8722;H bonds. Here, we explore using the phenyl radical to tackle this, forming benzene with a C&#8722;H bond energy (112.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) that provides a thermodynamic driving force. We mainly observe a benzene&#8208;HI complex upon photolysis of iodobenzene in an H2&#8208;doped neon matrix at 4.4&#8197;K despite a barrier of 7.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, while phenyl radical forms in case of the heavier D2 isotopologue. When D2 molecules are allowed to diffuse, mono&#8208;deuterated benzene accumulates within hours. Computations using path integral&#8208;based instanton theory highlight that primarily the transferred hydrogen atom is moving during the reaction which greatly increases the tunneling probability. In excellent agreement with the experimental results, we predict significant tunneling rate constants for both isotopologues, H2 and D2, featuring a strong kinetic isotope effect of up to four orders of magnitude at the lowest temperatures.

&lt;p&gt;Activating the strong H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bond is typically reserved for transition metals, and only a few main group systems can tackle this challenge. Here, we explore a phenyl radical mediated pathway utilizing the photolysis of iodobenzene. The phenyl radical leverages the high C&#8722;H bond energy of the forming benzene to drive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. Low-temperature experiments and dual level instanton computations reveal hydrogen tunneling as a critical factor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating dihydrogen, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is a challenging endeavor typically achieved using transition metal centers. Pure main-group compounds capable of this are rare and have emerged in recent decades. These systems rely on synergistic donor-acceptor interactions with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8217;s antibonding &#963;* and bonding &#963; orbital. An alternative (hydrocarbon) radical-mediated activation is problematic because the H&#8722;H bond is stronger (104.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) than most C&#8722;H bonds. Here, we explore using the phenyl radical to tackle this, forming benzene with a C&#8722;H bond energy (112.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) that provides a thermodynamic driving force. We mainly observe a benzene-HI complex upon photolysis of iodobenzene in an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-doped neon matrix at 4.4&#8197;K despite a barrier of 7.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while phenyl radical forms in case of the heavier D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; isotopologue. When D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules are allowed to diffuse, mono-deuterated benzene accumulates within hours. Computations using path integral-based instanton theory highlight that primarily the transferred hydrogen atom is moving during the reaction which greatly increases the tunneling probability. In excellent agreement with the experimental results, we predict significant tunneling rate constants for both isotopologues, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, featuring a strong kinetic isotope effect of up to four orders of magnitude at the lowest temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering a Cu&#8208;Pd Paddle&#8208;Wheel Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of atomically precise Cu&#8722;Pd dimers within the nodes of a Cu&#8208;MOF was confirmed through detailed XAS experiments. DFT calculations suggest that the Pd atom in the Cu&#8722;Pd dimer modulates the binding energy of the key *COOH intermediate on the neighboring Cu site, leading to enhanced selectivity for electrocatalytic CO production during CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Optimizing the binding energy between the intermediate and the active site is a key factor for tuning catalytic product selectivity and activity in the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Copper active sites are known to reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygenates, but suffer from poor product selectivity due to the moderate binding energies of several of the reaction intermediates. Here, we report an ion exchange strategy to construct Cu&#8722;Pd paddle wheel dimers within Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu3&#8208;xPdx(BTC)2] (BTC=benzentricarboxylate), without altering the overall MOF structural properties. Compared to the pristine Cu MOF ([Cu3(BTC)2], HKUST&#8208;1), the Cu&#8722;Pd MOF shifts CO2 electroreduction products from diverse chemical species to selective CO generation. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis of the catalyst oxidation state and local geometry, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that the incorporation of Pd within the Cu&#8722;Pd paddle wheel node structure of the MOF promotes adsorption of the key intermediate COOH* at the Cu site. This permits CO&#8208;selective catalytic mechanisms and thus advances our understanding of the interplay between structure and activity toward electrochemical CO2 reduction using molecular catalysts.

         <title>Cyclic Acetals as Expanding Monomers to Reduce Shrinkage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals distance of a thiol and ene is depicted. After the thiol&#8208;ene reaction a thioether bond is formed resulting in a shorter interatomic distance. This shrinkage leads to stress in the polymer which can be reduced by radical&#8208;mediated redox&#8208;rearrangements catalyzed by thiols. A compact cyclic acetal extent to a longer linear ester. This volumetric expansion is counteracting the shrinkage resulting from the thiol&#8208;ene reaction.







Abstract
Polarity&#8208;reversal catalysts (PRCs) for hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer reactions have been known in radical chemistry for more than 60&#8197;years but are rarely described and utilized in the field of photopolymerization up to now. Herein, we present the use of thiols in a unique dual function as thiol&#8208;ene click reagents and as polarity&#8208;reversal catalyst (PRC) for the radical&#8208;mediated redox rearrangements of benzylidene acetals. During the rearrangement reaction, cyclic benzylidene acetals are transformed into benzoate esters leading to a significant volumetric expansion to reduce thermoset shrinkage. We were able to show that this expansion on a molecular level reduces shrinkage and polymerization stress but does not significantly affect the (thermo&#8722;)mechanical properties of the cross&#8208;linked networks. One of the key advantages of this process lies in its simplicity. No additives like sensitizers or combinations of different initiators (radical and cationic) are needed. Furthermore, the same light source can be used for both the polymerization reaction and expansion through rearrangement. Additionally, the applied photoinitiator enables spatial and temporal control of the polymerization; thus, the developed system can be an excellent platform for additive manufacturing processes.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infinite&#8208;Chain Polymers with Ge=Ge Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers with Ge=Ge double bonds in the &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugational path are obtained via heavier acyclic diene metathesis of bis(digermene)s. High solubility and interchain dispersion interactions allow for near&#8208;infinite chains and deposition as thin films with ordered lamellar bundles. With the absorption in the visible range corresponding to small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps, this new class of conjugated materials is promising for various applications.







Abstract
Despite considerable interest in heteroatom&#8208;containing conjugated polymers, there are only few examples with heavier p&#8208;block elements in the conjugation path. The recently reported heavier acyclic diene metathesis (HADMET) allowed for the synthesis of a polymer containing Ge=Ge double bonds&#8212;albeit insoluble and with limited degree of polymerization. By incorporation of long alkyl chains, we now obtained soluble representatives, which exhibit degrees of polymerization near infinity according to diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). UV/Vis and NMR data confirm the presence of &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugation across the silylene&#8208;phenylene linkers between the Ge=Ge double bonds. Favorable intermolecular dispersion interactions lead to ladder&#8208;like cylindrical assemblies as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and DLS. AFM and TEM images of deposited thin films reveal lamellar ordering of extended polymer bundles.

         <title>Controllable Graphene/MoS2 Heterointerfaces by Perpendicular Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The van der Waals interfaces of graphene/MoS2 heterostructures are tuned through controlled functionalization of the bottom graphene layer. Adjusting the size of the functional groups enables nm&#8208;scale modification of interlayer distances. Both the size and electronic properties of the functional groups are key to regulating charge transport, with size being particularly decisive.







Abstract
Surface chemistry and interface interactions profoundly influence the properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures. Therefore, developing methods to precisely control surfaces and interfaces is crucial for harnessing the properties and functions of 2D materials and heterostructures. Here, we developed a facile approach to tuning the interface distance and properties of graphene/MoS2 heterostructures (G/MoS2) by varying the functional groups attached to the surface of graphene bottom layer. We systematically investigated how different functionalized graphene bottom layers affect the interlayer distance, coupling between the interlayers, and optical properties of resulting G/MoS2 heterostructures. Our findings indicate that both the size and electron&#8208;withdrawing/donating properties of functional groups are pivotal in regulating charge transport properties, with size playing a particularly decisive role. Our approach demonstrates an efficient and flexible pathway to regulate the interlayer spacing and charge transport, highlighting the potential of engineering interface chemistry in optimizing properties of van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Solid&#8208;State Fluorescent Photoswitches for High&#8208;Level Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and cis&#8208;trans isomerization, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven solid&#8208;state fluorescent photoswitch has been developed. It was obtained by incorporating a bulky naphthalimide group into a salicylaldimine. The photoswitch shows triple fluorescence switching, showing potential application in high&#8208;level information encryption.







Abstract
Developing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven fluorescent photoswitches in the solid state remains an enormous challenge in smart materials. Such photoswitches are obtained from salicylaldimines through excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and subsequent cis&#8208;trans isomerization strategies. By incorporating a bulky naphthalimide fluorophore into a Schiff base, three photoswitches achieve dual&#8208;mode changes (both in color and fluorescence) in the solid state. In particular, the optimal one generates triple fluorescence changing from green, to yellow and finally to orange upon visible&#8208;light irradiation. This switching process is fully reversible and can be repeated at least 10&#8197;times without obvious attenuation, suggesting its good photo&#8208;fatigue resistance. Mechanism studies reveal that the naphthalimide group not only enables the tuning of multicolor with an additional emission, but also induces a folded structure, reducing molecular stacking and facilitating ESIPT and cis&#8208;trans isomerization. As such, photopatterning, ternary encoding and transient information recording and erasing are successfully developed. The present study provides a reliable strategy for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven fluorescent photoswitches, showing implications for advanced information encryption materials.

         <title>Construction of Highly Porous and Robust Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for High&#8208;Capacity Clean Energy Gas Storage</title>

We herein proposed and demonstrated a strategy of constructing the double&#8208;walled framework to target a highly porous and robust HOF material (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a), exhibiting one of the highest gravimetric and volumetric surface areas for extraordinary high&#8208;pressure methane and hydrogen storage capacities.







Abstract
Development of highly porous and robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for high&#8208;pressure methane and hydrogen storage remains a grand challenge due to the fragile nature of hydrogen bonds. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing the double&#8208;walled framework to target highly porous and robust HOF (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a) for extraordinary CH4 and H2 storage. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a features a minimized twofold interpenetration with double&#8208;walled structure, in which multiple supramolecular interactions are existed between the interpenetrated walls. This structural configuration can notably enhance the framework robustness while maintaining its high porosity, affording one of the highest gravimetric and volumetric surface areas of 3102&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1976&#8197;m2&#8201;cm&#8722;3 among the reported HOFs so far. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a thus exhibits an extremely high volumetric H2 uptake of 43.6&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 77&#8197;K/100&#8197;bar and working capacity of 41.3&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 under combined swing conditions (77&#8197;K/100&#8197;bar&#8594;160&#8197;K/5&#8197;bar), and also impressive methane storage performance with a 5&#8211;100&#8197;bar working capacity of 187 (or 159) cm3 (STP) cm&#8722;3 at 270&#8197;K (or 296&#8197;K), outperforming most of the reported porous organic materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies on CH4&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a reveal that abundant supramolecular binding sites combined with ultrahigh porosities account for its high CH4 storage capacities. Combined with high stability, super&#8208;hydrophobicity, and easy recovery, ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a is placed among the most promising materials for H2 and CH4 storage applications.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Driven Dynamic Behavior of Nanoconfined Water in Hydrophilic MXene Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the detailed proton&#8208;driven dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water between hydrophilic MXene sheets using molecular dynamics simulation based on the active learning potential trained by deep neural network algorithms. These findings have illuminated several novel phenomena including the MXene oxidation rate regulated by protons, the formation of a hexagonal ice phase exhibiting unconventional bonding patterns at room temperature, and a significant reduction in water diffusivity.







Abstract
Liquid water under nanoscale confinement has attracted intensive attention due to its pivotal role in understanding various phenomena across many scientific fields. MXenes serve an ideal paradigm for investigating the dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water in a hydrophilic environment. Combining deep neural networks and an active learning scheme, here we elucidate the proton&#8208;driven dynamics of water molecules confined between V2CTx sheets using molecular dynamics simulation. Firstly, we have found that the Eigen and Zundel cations can inhibit water&#8208;induced oxidation by adjusting the orientation of water molecules, thus proposing a general antioxidant strategy. Besides, we also identified a hexagonal ice phase with abnormal bonding rules at room temperature, rather than only at ultralow temperatures as other studies reported, and further captured the proton&#8208;induced water phase transition. This highlighted the importance of protons in the maintaining stable crystal phase and phase transition of water. Furthermore, we discussed the conversions of different water structures and water diffusivity with changing proton concentrations in detail. The results provide useful guidance in practical applications of MXenes including developing antioxidant strategies, identifying novel 2D water phases and optimizing energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Multifunctional Interface Layer Constructed by Trace Zwitterions for Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trace zwitterionic additive endows the Zn||Zn cells with a cycling life of more than 10000&#8197;hours. And the Zn||I2 full cell exhibits 95&#8201;% capacity retention after 30000&#8197;cycles. Remarkably, the Zn||I2 pouch cells (95&#8197;mAh) deliver a high&#8208;capacity retention of 99&#8201;% after 750&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
The inhomogeneous plating/stripping of Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and parasitic reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, severely restricts its cycling life&#8208;span. Here, trace zwitterions (trifluoroacetate pyridine, TFAPD) are introduced into the aqueous electrolyte to construct a multifunctional interface that enhances the reversibility of Zn anode. The TFA&#8722; anions with strong specific adsorption adhere onto the Zn surface to reconstruct the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), preventing the hydrogen evolution and corrosion side reactions caused by free H2O. The Py+ cations accumulate on the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) of Zn anode with the force of electric field during Zn2+ plating, forming a shielding layer to uniformize the deposition of Zn2+. Besides, the adsorbed TFA&#8722; and Py+ promote the desolvation process of Zn2+ resulting in fast reaction kinetics. Thus, the Zn||Zn cells present an outstanding cycling performance of more than 10000&#8197;hours. And even at 85&#8201;% utilization rate of Zn, it can stably cycle for over 200&#8197;hours at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Zn||I2 full cell exhibits a capacity retention of over 95&#8201;% even after 30000&#8197;cycles. Remarkably, the Zn||I2 pouch cells (95&#8197;mAh) deliver a high&#8208;capacity retention of 99&#8201;% after 750&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Initiated Difunctionalization of [1.1.1]Propellane via Photoinduced Polarity Match Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, XB adducts are formed between BzI&#8208;tethered amines and amines via the halogen bonding. After photofragmentation, the &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals are generated and subsequently undergo radical addition to [1.1.1]propellane, yielding BCP radicals that participate in polarity&#8208;matched additions, culminating in the difunctionalization of bicyclopentane. The versatility of this approach is underscored by a series of valuable transformations.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP), recognized as a bioisostere for para&#8208;disubstituted benzene, has gained widespread interest in drug development due to its ability to enhance the physicochemical properties of pharmaceuticals. In this work, we introduce a photoinduced, halogen bonding&#8208;initiated, metal&#8208;free strategy for synthesizing various BCP derivatives. This method involves the generation of nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals via halogen&#8208;bonding adducts. These undergo selective radical addition to [1.1.1]propellane, yielding electrophilic BCP radicals that subsequently participate in polarity&#8208;matched additions, culminating in the difunctionalization of bicyclopentane. The versatility and practicality of this metal&#8208;free approach are underscored by its broad substrate scope, which includes late&#8208;stage functionalization and a series of valuable transformations, all conducted under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>The Asymmetrical Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se Bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 Boosting Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalytic Performance for Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>

The N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Fe&#8208;based selenium oxide catalyst Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC was fabricated for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). The Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC@NC could obviously enhance catalytic performance of ORR and OER because it can modify coordination environment surrounding Fe atoms and accordingly realize an optimization of the adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates. Furthermore, the Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC&#8208;based ZABs exhibit superior peak power density and specific capacity in comparison to Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;based ZABs.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have the advantages of high energy density and rich zinc raw materials. It is a low&#8208;cost, green and sustainable energy storage device. At present, one of the key technologies that hinder the large&#8208;scale application of ZABs is the design and fabrication oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) bifunctional catalysts with excellent performance, especially the non&#8208;platinum&#8208;based catalysts. Here N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Fe&#8208;based selenium oxide catalyst Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC with high performance has been fabricated by a one&#8208;step pyrolysis and then the electrochemical oxidization. The experimental results confirmed that the existence of Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 crystal phase of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC, and the Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds could obviously enhance ORR and OER catalytic performance of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC. Density functional theoretical calculations (DFT) confirmed that the Fe2O(SeO3)2 in Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC had a higher d&#8208;band center of Fe atom and a lower p&#8208;orbital coupling degree with its own lattice O atom than Fe2O3, which leads to Fe site of Fe2O(SeO3)2 being more likely to adsorb external oxygen intermediates. The Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 results in the modification of coordination environment of Fe atoms and optimizes the adsorption energy of Fe site for oxygen intermediates. Compared with Fe2O3/Fe3C@NC, the Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC showed the obvious enhancements of ORR/OER catalytic activities with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#8197;V for ORR in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte and a low overpotential of 345&#8197;mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The peak power density and specific capacity of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC&#8208;based ZABs are higher than those of Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;ZABs. The above results demonstrate that the asymmetrical Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 plays a key role in improving the bifunctional catalytic activities of ORR/OER for ZABs.

         <title>Constructing Quasi&#8208;Single Ion Conductors by a &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Polymer to Stabilize Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin polymer is used to construct a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for coating the Zn anodes, and thereby inhibited the corrosion of Zn anode, prevented the side reaction, elevated the Zn ion transference number, suppressed the formation of space charge regions and stabilized the plating/striping of Zn ions.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for the next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the Zn anode remains facing challenges. Here, we report a cyclodextrin polymer (P&#8208;CD) to construct quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for coating and protecting Zn anodes. The P&#8208;CD coating layer inhibited the corrosion of Zn anode and prevented the side reaction of metal anodes. More important is that the cyclodextrin units enabled the trapping of anions through host&#8211;guest interactions and hydrogen bonds, forming a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor that elevated the Zn ion transference number (from 0.31 to 0.68), suppressed the formation of space charge regions and hence stabilized the plating/striping of Zn ions. As a result, the Zn//Zn symmetric cells coated with P&#8208;CD achieved a 70.6&#8197;times improvement in cycle life at high current densities of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the Zn//K1.1V3O8 (KVO) full&#8208;cells with high mass loading of cathode materials and low N/P ratio of 1.46 reached the capacity retention of 94.5&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1; while the cell without coating failed only after 230&#8197;cycles. These results provide novel perspective into the control of solid&#8208;electrolyte interfaces for stabilizing Zn anode and offer a practical strategy to improve AZIBs.

         <title>Revealing the Dynamic Evolution of Electrolyte Configuration on the Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface by Visualizing (De) Solvation Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the charging process of lithium cobalt oxide cathode, Li+ undergoes solvation, and Li+&#8208;complexes aggregate in the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, forming a concentrated interface. As the voltage increases, the intensified interfacial electric field exerts greater electro&#8208;repulsion on Li+, forming a diluted interface.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is crucial for improving cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) to enhance the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially at high charging cut&#8208;off voltages. However, typical electrolyte modification strategies always focus on the solvation structure in the bulk region, but consistently neglect the dynamic evolution of electrolyte solvation configuration at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which directly influences the CEI construction. Herein, we reveal an anti&#8208;synergy effect between Li+&#8208;solvation and interfacial electric field by visualizing the dynamic evolution of electrolyte solvation configuration at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which determines the concentration of interfacial solvated&#8208;Li+. The Li+ solvation in the charging process facilitates the construction of a concentrated (Li+&#8208;solvent/anion&#8208;rich) interface and anion&#8208;derived CEI, while the repulsive force derived from interfacial electric field induces the formation of a diluted (solvent&#8208;rich) interface and solvent&#8208;derived CEI. Modifying the electrochemical protocols and electrolyte formulation, we regulate the &#8220;inflection voltage&#8221; arising from the anti&#8208;synergy effect and prolong the lifetime of the concentrated interface, which further improves the functionality of CEI architecture.

&lt;p&gt;During the charging process of lithium cobalt oxide cathode, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; undergoes solvation, and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-complexes aggregate in the cathode-electrolyte interface, forming a concentrated interface. As the voltage increases, the intensified interfacial electric field exerts greater electro-repulsion on Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, forming a diluted interface.

         <title>Nickel Catalyzed Carbonylative Cross Coupling for Direct Access to Isotopically Labeled Alkyl Aryl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of an effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross coupling of redox&#8208;activated alkyl carboxylic acids and aryl boronic acids is presented. A wide variety of alkyl aryl ketones is obtained in good yields, and the chemistry is easily applicable to stable and radiocarbon isotope labeling. The mechanism of the transformation has been investigated applying experimental and DFT methods.







Abstract
Here we present an effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling for direct access to alkyl aryl ketones from readily accessible redox&#8208;activated tetrachlorophthalimide esters and aryl boronic acids. The methodology, which is run employing only 2.5&#8197;equivalents of CO and simple Ni(II) salts as the metal source, exhibits a broad substrate scope under mild conditions. Furthermore, this carbonylation chemistry provides an easy switch between isotopologues for stable (13CO) and radioactive (14CO) isotope labeling, allowing its adaptation to the late&#8208;stage isotope labeling of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Based on DFT calculations as well as experimental evidence, a catalytic cycle is proposed involving a carbon&#8208;centered radical formed via nickel(I)&#8208;induced outer&#8208;sphere decarboxylative fragmentation of the redox&#8208;active ester.

         <title>Expansion of Structure Property in Cascade Nazarov Cyclization and Cycloexpansion Reaction to Diverse Angular Tricycles and Total Synthesis of Nominal Madreporanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade Nazarov cyclization/dicycloexpansions reaction for the efficient synthesis angularly fused M/5/N tricyclic skeletons (M=5, 6; N=4&#8211;9, 13) has been explored. In this novel transformation, the priority of ring expansion could be predicted by the rational design of the ring size and substituents. Employing the reaction as a key step, we finished total synthesis of nominal madreporanone for the first time.

A cascade Nazarov cyclization/dicycloexpansions reaction was developed for the precise synthesis of the angularly fused M/5/N (M=5, 6; N=4&#8211;9, 13) tricyclic skeletons. The prioritized expansion of the first ring played a critical role in the transformations, due to the release of ring strain, and the nature of the substituents present on the substrate is another influencing factor. This pioneering cascade reaction features broad substrates scope (33&#8197;examples), short reaction time, exceptional yields (up to 95&#8201;%), and remarkable regioselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). Exploiting the synthetic application of this cascade reaction, we successfully executed a succinct total synthesis of nominal madreporanone for the first time.

         <title>Homochiral Covalent Organic Frameworks with Superhelical Nanostructures Enable Efficient Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homochiral superhelical COF nanofibers were synthesized by manipulating the lengths of alkyl chains in enantiopure BINOL&#8208;based organic linkers. The resulting 3D chiral COFs formed right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed superhelix fibers with macroscopic chirality. These nanofibers exhibit significantly enhanced enantiodiscrimination in carbohydrate binding and a remarkable chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect.







Abstract
Despite significant advancements in fabricating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse morphologies, creating COFs with superhelical nanostructures remains challenging. We report here the controlled synthesis of homochiral superhelical COF nanofibers by manipulating pendent alkyl chain lengths in organic linkers. This approach yields homochiral 3D COFs 13&#8208;OR with a 10&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamondoid structure (R=H, Me, Et, nPr, nBu) from enantiopure 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;based tetraaldehydes and tetraamine. COF&#8208;13&#8208;OEt exhibits macroscopic chirality as right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed superhelical fibers, whereas others adopt spherical or non&#8208;helical morphologies. Time&#8208;tracking shows a self&#8208;assembly process from non&#8208;helical strands to single&#8208;stranded helical fibers and intertwined superhelices. Ethoxyl substituents, being of optimal size, balance solvophobic effects and intermolecular interactions, driving the formation of superhelical nanostructures, with handedness determined by BINOL chirality. The superhelical nature of these materials is evident in their chiral recognition and spin&#8208;filter properties, showing significantly improved enantiodiscrimination in carbohydrate binding (up to six times higher enantioselectivity) and a remarkable chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect with a 48&#8211;51&#8201;% spin polarization ratio, a feature absent in non&#8208;helical analogs.

         <title>Operando Spectroelectrochemistry Unravels the Mechanism of CO2 Electrocatalytic Reduction by an Fe Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive experimental investigation of the mechanistic aspects of the selective electroreduction of CO2 to CO by an iron porphyrin using IR and UV/Visible absorption spectroelectrochemistry provides operando insights at molecular scale. In addition to the main catalytic cycle involving FeI species as resting state, a secondary pathway involving the protonation of the porphyrin ligand into a phlorin ligand at the Fe0 level was identified.







Abstract
Iron porphyrins are molecular catalysts recognized for their ability to electrochemically and photochemically reduce carbon dioxide (CO2). The main reduction product is carbon monoxide (CO). CO holds significant industrial importance as it serves as a precursor for various valuable chemical products containing either a single carbon atom (C1), like methanol or methane, or multiple carbon atoms (Cn), such as ethanol or ethylene. Despite the long&#8208;established efficiency of these catalysts, optimizing their catalytic activity and stability and comprehending the intricate reaction mechanisms remain a significant challenge. This article presents a comprehensive investigation of the mechanistic aspects of the selective electroreduction of CO2 to CO using an iron porphyrin substituted with four trimethylammonium groups in the para position [(pTMA)FeIII&#8722;Cl]4+. By employing infrared and UV/Visible spectroelectrochemistry, changes in the electronic structure and coordination environment of the iron center can be observed in real&#8208;time as the electrochemical potential is adjusted, offering new insights into the reaction mechanisms. Catalytic species were identified, and evidence of a secondary reaction pathway was uncovered, potentially prompting a re&#8208;evaluation of the nature of the catalytically active species.

         <title>Cyclic Sulfoximines as Methyl and Perdeuteromethyl Transfer Agents and Their Applications in Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under photoredox catalysis, novel heterocyclic sulfoximines serve as methyl and perdeuteromethyl radical sources. The reagents are bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use. Various radical acceptors can be applied leading to products in good yields. Up&#8208;scaling has been achieved by using a photoflow reactor. Physicochemical studies suggest a photoredox process.







Abstract
Benzo[1,3,2]dithiazole&#8208;1,1,3&#8208;trioxides are bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use reagents. In photoredox catalysis, they generate methyl and perdeuteromethyl radicals which can add to a variety of radical acceptors, including olefins, acrylamides, quinoxalinones, isocyanides, enol silanes, and N&#8208;Ts acrylamide. As byproduct, a salt is formed which can be regenerated to the original methylating agent. Flow chemistry provides an option for reaction scale&#8208;up further underscoring the synthetic usefulness of these methylation reagents. Mechanistic investigations suggest a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) pathway induced by photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Mild and Scalable Conditions for the Solvothermal Synthesis of Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fifteen imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks were synthesized in hours in the same mixture of n&#8208;butanol, water and acetic acid while stirring. The method is convenient, green, tolerates a wide variety of monomers, and can produce over ten grams of covalent organic framework in one batch.







Abstract
A convenient method was developed that allows for the synthesis of highly crystalline and porous imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in hours. The use of an apolar solvent in combination with a precise amount of water and acetic acid was crucial to obtain materials of optimal quality. Fifteen different COFs could be produced under the same reaction conditions, using a green solvent mixture of n&#8208;butanol, acetic acid and water at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 16&#8197;hours with stirring. The crystallinity of the COFs produced in this manner is similar or better than that obtained by traditional solvothermal synthesis. The method could be easily scaled to synthesize over ten grams of COF in one batch. Optical microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy gave insight in the role of the solvent on the aggregation of COF nanosheets and the resulting crystallinity, porosity and robustness of the material.

         <title>In Situ Generation of 1&#8208;Acetylpyrene as a Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyst for the Thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The unexpected discovery of the photosensitization properties of 1&#8208;acetylpyrene for the thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction enabled the limitations of this hetero&#8208;cycloaddition reaction to be tackled in terms of substrate scope and efficiency. The synthesis of a wide range of thietanes from intrinsically unstable thiocarbonyls was made possible by the use of pyrenacyl sulfides as a source of both the thiocarbonyl substrate and the photocatalyst.







Abstract
The thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction represents a straightforward approach to build thietane cores. Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report herein a visible&#8208;light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls though a Norrish type&#8197;II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction with various non&#8208;volatile electron&#8208;rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocarbonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1&#8208;acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet&#8208;triplet Dexter energy transfer based mechanism is proposed.

         <title>Boron Cluster Anions Dissolve En Masse in Lipids Causing Membrane Expansion and Thinning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superchaotropic dodecaborate cluster anions adsorb efficiently on lipid mono&#8208; and bilayers, affecting the physical properties of the membrane more strongly than conventional chaotropic anions. Cluster immersion in the bilayer leads to a reorganization of the lipid chains, affording hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic membranes with expanded surface area per lipid as well as thinner membranes with increased fluidity.







Abstract
Boron clusters are applied in medicinal chemistry because of their high stability in biological environments and intrinsic ability to capture neutrons. However, their intermolecular interactions with lipid membranes, which are critical for their cellular delivery and biocompatibility, have not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, we combine different experimental methods &#8211; Langmuir monolayer isotherms at the air&#8211;water interface, calorimetry (DSC, ITC), and scattering techniques (DLS, SAXS) &#8211; with MD simulations to evaluate the impact of closo&#8208;dodecaborate clusters on model membranes of different lipid composition. The cluster anions interact strongly with zwitterionic membranes (POPC and DPPC) via the chaotropic effect and cause pronounced expansions of lipid monolayers. The resulting lipid membranes contain up to 33&#8197;mol&#8201;% and up to 52 weight&#8201;% of boron cluster anions even at low aqueous cluster concentrations (1&#8197;mM). They show high (&#956;M) affinity to the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic interface, affecting the structuring of the lipid chains, and therefore triggering a sequence of characteristic effects: (i) an expansion of the surface area per lipid, (ii) an increase in membrane fluidity, and (iii) a reduction of bilayer thickness. These results aid the design of boron cluster derivatives as auxiliaries in drug design as well as transmembrane carriers and help rationalize potential toxicity effects.

         <title>Aza&#8208;Diarylethenes Undergoing Both Photochemically and Thermally Reversible Electrocyclic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aza&#8208;diarylethenes with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure undergo bidirectional thermal isomerization in addition to bidirectional photochemical isomerization due to a small energy difference between the open&#8208; and the closed&#8208;ring isomers. Kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed the detailed mechanisms of the photochemical and thermal reactions. Using these unique properties, both light&#8208;writing/light&#8208;erasing and heat&#8208;writing/light&#8208;erasing systems were demonstrated.







Abstract
Exploring novel molecular photoswitches plays a crucial role in the field of photo&#8208;functional materials chemistry. In this study, we synthesized aza&#8208;diarylethenes with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure and investigated their photochromic properties. Unlike previously reported aza&#8208;diarylethenes, which exhibit fast thermally reversible photochromism, the compounds synthesized here exhibited pseudo&#8208;photochemically reversible photochromism. Due to their thermal stability, we successfully isolated the colored isomer. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed for the first time that the colored isomer adopts a closed&#8208;ring structure with a bond between carbon and nitrogen atoms. Remarkably, these aza&#8208;diarylethenes exhibited not only photochemical ring&#8208;closing and ring&#8208;opening reactions but also thermal ring&#8208;closing and ring&#8208;opening reactions, driven by a thermal equilibrium between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers. This behavior, unprecedented for common diarylethenes, was elucidated through kinetic analysis, revealing an energy&#8208;level diagram for the thermal equilibrium between these isomers. Furthermore, 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy revealed that both photochemically and thermally generated closed&#8208;ring isomers adopt the same molecular structure, which was well explained based on the reaction mechanism of photochemical and thermal ring&#8208;closing reactions. These findings not only advance the field of aza&#8208;diarylethenes but also inspire future research in the development of new photoswitches.

&lt;p&gt;Aza-diarylethenes with benzothiophene-S,S-dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure undergo bidirectional thermal isomerization in addition to bidirectional photochemical isomerization due to a small energy difference between the open- and the closed-ring isomers. Kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed the detailed mechanisms of the photochemical and thermal reactions. Using these unique properties, both light-writing/light-erasing and heat-writing/light-erasing systems were demonstrated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring novel molecular photoswitches plays a crucial role in the field of photo-functional materials chemistry. In this study, we synthesized aza-diarylethenes with benzothiophene-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure and investigated their photochromic properties. Unlike previously reported aza-diarylethenes, which exhibit fast thermally reversible photochromism, the compounds synthesized here exhibited pseudo-photochemically reversible photochromism. Due to their thermal stability, we successfully isolated the colored isomer. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed for the first time that the colored isomer adopts a closed-ring structure with a bond between carbon and nitrogen atoms. Remarkably, these aza-diarylethenes exhibited not only photochemical ring-closing and ring-opening reactions but also thermal ring-closing and ring-opening reactions, driven by a thermal equilibrium between the open- and closed-ring isomers. This behavior, unprecedented for common diarylethenes, was elucidated through kinetic analysis, revealing an energy-level diagram for the thermal equilibrium between these isomers. Furthermore, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy revealed that both photochemically and thermally generated closed-ring isomers adopt the same molecular structure, which was well explained based on the reaction mechanism of photochemical and thermal ring-closing reactions. These findings not only advance the field of aza-diarylethenes but also inspire future research in the development of new photoswitches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Photochromic properties of aza&#8208;diarylethenes with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure were investigated by Shota Hamatani, Daichi Kitagawa, and Seiya Kobatake in their Research Article (e202414121). Unlike typical diarylethene molecules, the aza&#8208;diarylethenes showed both photochemically and thermally reversible electrocyclic reactions. The reaction mechanisms were investigated by DFT calculations, offering insights for future research on photoswitches.

Thiosilvatins are a class of biologically active dithiodiketopiperazine natural products. In their Research Article (e202412397), Daniel Strand and co&#8208;workers describe a first, collective, synthesis of thiosilvatins, introducing methods and tactics to overcome stereochemical issues in dithiodiketopiperazine synthesis. The artwork depicts thiosilvatins emerging from and escaping an abyss of inaccessibility and structural ambiguity.

Dynamic boroxine linkers were incorporated into the mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) PCN&#8208;333, which creates defects and expands pore sizes, enabling the encapsulation of enzymes larger than the intrinsic MOF pores. As reported by Xing Zhang, Shuai Yuan et&#8197;al in their Research Article (e202409951), this strategy facilitates the immobilization of glycoenzymes for synthesizing complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating both high activity and enhanced enzyme stability.

         <title>A Smart Design of Non&#8208;Noble Catalysts for Sustainable Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper highlights a smart sustainable Ni@TiOx catalyst, Ni encapsulated in TiOx, for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as reported by Gong and co&#8208;workers. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in PDH, achieving 94&#8201;% propylene selectivity and high stability. This design offers a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional noble metal&#8208;based catalysts, with potential for broader industrial applications.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an important process for propylene synthesis, relies on expensive noble metals or highly toxic oxides as catalysts. In a recent publication, Gong and co&#8208;workers report a breakthrough discovery for PDH by introducing a sustainable catalyst composed of titanium oxide overlayers encapsulating nickel nanoparticles, termed Ni@TiOx. This innovative catalyst showcases exceptional performance in PDH, exhibiting high propylene selectivity and stability under industrially relevant conditions. The study elucidates the role of defective TiOx overlayers and the electronic promotional effect of subsurface Ni in enhancing catalytic activity, translating a traditional model catalyst system into a sustainable industrial catalyst for low&#8208;carbon energy and the chemical industry.

         <title>Carbonylation Reactions at Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals with an Adjacent Heteroatom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes the most recent advances in carbonylative transformations involving heteroatom adjacent carbon radicals, specifically including the heteroatoms oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), boron (B), fluorine (F), and chlorine (Cl). The reaction mechanisms are also described in detail.







Abstract
Heteroatoms are essential to living organisms and present in almost all molecules with medicinal usage. The catalytic functionalization at the carbon&#8208;centered radical with an adjacent heteroatom provides an effective way to value added moiety while retaining the unique physicochemical and pharmacological properties of heteroatoms, which can promote the development of pharmaceutical and fine chemical production. Carbonylative transformation was discovered nearly a century ago which is an efficient method for the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing molecules with potent applications in both industry and academia. Despite numerous advances in new reaction development, carbonylative transformation involving adjacent heteroatom carbon radical remain a subject that deserves to be discussed. In this minireview, we systematically summarized and discussed the recent advances in carbonylative transformations involving carbon&#8208;centered radicals with an adjacent heteroatom, including oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), boron (B), fluorine (F), and chlorine (Cl). The related reaction mechanism was also discussed.

         <dc:description>
Sunlight has long been the primary energy source for our planet. This minireview highlights its importance and investigates the potential revolutionary impact of photocatalysis on Earth. It examines fundamental processes, including the formation of prebiotic molecules and the oxygen evolution reaction via water oxidation. Additionally, the review assesses various carbon and nitrogen&#8208;based complexes photocatalysts and their roles in driving chemical reactions. It further provides insights into possible evolutionary pathways for Earth, emphasizing the pivotal influence of carbon and nitrogen&#8208;based photocatalysts in the development of Earth.







Abstract
Sunlight has long served as primary energy source on our planet, shaping the behavior of living organisms. Extensive research has been dedicated to unraveling the evolutionary pathways involved. When the formation of Earth atmosphere, it primarily consisted of small gas molecules, which are considered crucial for the emergence of life. Recent demonstrations have shown that these molecules can also be transformed into semiconductors, with the potential to harness solar energy and catalyze chemical reactions as photocatalysts. Building upon this research, this minireview focuses on the potential revolutionary impact of photocatalysis on Earth. Initially, it examines key reactions, such as the formation of prebiotic molecules and the oxygen evolution reaction via water oxidation. Additionally, various C&#8722;N complexes in photocatalysts are explored, showcasing their roles in catalyzing chemical reactions. The conclusion and outlook provide a potential pathway for the evolution of Earth, shedding light on the significance of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts in development of Earth.

Phototheranostics of infectious diseases by utilizing NIR&#8208;II AIEgens has been developed at a tremendous pace. This Minireview summarizes recent efforts in this area in terms of molecular design strategy and bioapplications, and discusses current challenges and promising prospects.







Abstract
Pathogenic infectious diseases have persistently posed significant threats to public health. Phototheranostics, which combines the functions of diagnostic imaging and therapy, presents an extremely promising solution to block the spread of pathogens as well as the outbreak of epidemics owing to its merits of a wide&#8208;spectrum of activity, high controllability, non&#8208;invasiveness, and difficult to acquire resistance. Among multifarious phototheranostic agents, second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) are notable by virtue of their deep penetration depth, excellent biocompatibility, balanced radiative and nonradiative decay and aggregation&#8208;enhanced theranostic performance, making them an ideal option for combating pathogens. This minireview provides a systematical summary of the latest advancements in NIR&#8208;II AIEgens with emphasis on the molecular design and nanoplatform formulation to fulfill high&#8208;efficiency in treating bacterial and viral pathogens, classified by disease models. Then, the current challenges, potential opportunities, and future research directions are presented to facilitate the further progress of this emerging field.

         <title>Recent Advances of Organic Cocrystals in Emerging Cutting&#8208;Edge Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the recent advances of organic cocrystals in emerging cutting&#8208;edge properties and applications during the nearest five years including PTC, RTP, TADF, CPL, OSSLs, NIR sensing, photocatalysis, batteries, and stimuli responses, along with the structure&#8211;property relationship, limitations, prospects and some inspirations for future investigations.







Abstract
Organic cocrystals, representing one type of new functional materials, have gathered significant interest in various engineering areas. Owing to their diverse stacking modes, rich intermolecular interactions and abundant functional components, the physicochemical properties of organic cocrystals can be tailored to meet different requirements and exhibit novel characteristics. The past few years have witnessed the rapid development of organic cocrystals in both fundamental characteristics and various applications. Beyond the typical properties like ambipolarity, emission tuning ability, ferroelectricity, etc. that are previously well demonstrated, many novel, impressive and cutting&#8208;edge properties and applications of cocrystals are also emerged and advanced recently. Especially during the nearest five years, photothermal conversion, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, thermally activated delay fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence, organic solid&#8208;state lasers, near&#8208;infrared sensing, photocatalysis, batteries, and stimuli responses have been reported. In this review, these new properties are carefully summarized. Besides, some neoteric architecture and methodologies, such as host&#8211;guest structures and machine learning&#8208;based screening, are introduced. Finally, the potential future developments and expectations for organic cocrystals are discussed for further investigations on multiple functions and applications.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Boroxine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boroxine&#8208;based COFs including 3D COF&#8208;102 with high porosity, are now accessible by simple, efficient, and rapid mechanochemical synthesis, in a process amenable to in situ monitoring and multi&#8208;gram scale&#8208;up.







Abstract
We report a rapid, room&#8208;temperature mechanochemical synthesis of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;dimensional boroxine covalent organic frameworks (COFs), enabled by using trimethylboroxine as a dehydrating additive to overcome the hydrolytic sensitivity of boroxine&#8208;based COFs. The resulting COFs display high porosity and crystallinity, with COF&#8208;102 being the first example of a mechanochemically prepared 3D COF, exhibiting a surface area of ca. 2,500&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Mechanochemistry enabled a&gt;20&#8208;fold reduction in solvent use and ~100&#8208;fold reduction in reaction time compared with solvothermal methods, providing target COFs quantitatively with no additional work&#8208;up besides vacuum drying. Real&#8208;time Raman spectroscopy permitted the first quantitative kinetic analysis of COF mechanosynthesis, while transferring the reaction design to Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) enabled synthesis of multi&#8208;gram amounts of the target COFs (tested up to 10&#8197;g).

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Discovery of Low&#8208;Pt High Entropy Intermetallic Compounds for Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning strategy utilizing crystal graph convolutional neural networks is proposed for the rational design of low&#8208;Pt high entropy intermetallic compounds (PtM3 type, where M=transition metal) for the oxygen reduction reaction. The developed Pt(FeCoNiCu)3/C catalyst, featuring small nanoparticle size, exhibits exceptional mass and specific activity, along with significantly enhanced electrochemical stability.







Abstract
Advancing the design of cathode catalysts to significantly maximize platinum utilization and augment the longevity has emerged as a formidable challenge in the field of fuel cells. Herein, we rationally design a high entropy intermetallic compound (HEIC, Pt(FeCoNiCu)3) for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by an efficient machine learning stategy, where crystal graph convolutional neural networks are employed to expedite the multicomponent design. Based on a dataset generated from first&#8208;principles calculations, the model can achieve a high prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors of 0.003 for surface strain and 0.011&#8197;eV atom&#8722;1 for formation energy. In addition, we identify two chemical features (atomic size difference and mixing enthalpy) as new descriptors to explore advanced ORR catalysts. The carbon supported Pt(FeCoNiCu)3 catalyst with small particle size is successfully synthesized by a freeze&#8208;drying&#8208;annealing technology, and exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (4.09&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and specific activity (7.92&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, The catalyst also shows significantly enhanced electrochemical stability which can be ascribed to the sluggish diffussion effect in the HEIC structure. Beyond offering a promising low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for fuel cell cathode, this work offers a new paradigm to rationally design advanced catalysts for energy storage and conversion devices.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotides for Exploration of Cellular Protein ADP&#8208;Ribosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a synthesis of cell&#8208;permeable NADs bearing fluorescent (TAMRA) or affinity (desthiobiotin) tag and their utility for ADP&#8208;ribosylation studies in living cells. Cell&#8208;permeability was achieved by modification with cholesterol or polyarginine. The probes were accepted by all tested PARP enzymes. The optimized desthiobiotin&#8208;labelled NAD+ was used for affinity enrichment and identification of proteins ADP&#8208;ribosylated upon oxidative stress.







Abstract
Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) greatly enhance the functional diversity of proteins, surpassing the number of gene&#8208;encoded variations. One intriguing PTM is ADP&#8208;ribosylation, which utilizes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a substrate and is essential in cell signaling pathways regulating cellular responses. Here, we report the first cell&#8208;permeable NAD+ analogs and demonstrate their utility for investigating cellular ADP&#8208;ribosylation. Using a desthiobiotin&#8208;labelled analog for affinity enrichment of proteins that are ADP&#8208;ribosylated in living cells under oxidative stress, we identified protein targets associated with host&#8208;virus interactions, DNA damage and repair, protein biosynthesis, and ribosome biogenesis. Most of these targets have been noted in various literature sources, highlighting the potential of our probes for cellular ADP&#8208;ribosylome studies.

Here, we report the first cell-permeable NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; analogs and demonstrate their utility for investigating cellular ADP-ribosylation. Using a desthiobiotin-labelled analog for affinity enrichment of proteins that are ADP-ribosylated in living cells under oxidative stress, we identified protein targets associated with host-virus interactions, DNA damage and repair, protein biosynthesis, and ribosome biogenesis. Most of these targets have been noted in various literature sources, highlighting the potential of our probes for cellular ADP-ribosylome studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Hydroboration of C&#8722;C Single Bonds without Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general system for the hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds without transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Our strategy surpasses the transition&#8208;metal systems regarding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities, substrate scopes, or yields. Mechanistic studies, DFT, and IBO calculations revealed a hydroborane&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage and a hydride shift reaction pathway. The key role of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen atom of the amide was disclosed.







Abstract
Selective hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds presents a fundamental challenge in the chemical industry. Previously, only catalytic systems utilizing precious metals Ir and Rh, in conjunction with N&#8208; and P&#8208; ligands, could achieve this, ensuring bond cleavage and selectivity. In sharp contrast, we discovered an unprecedented and general transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free system for the hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds. This methodology is transition&#8208;metal and ligand&#8208;free and surpasses the transition&#8208;metal systems regarding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities, substrate versatility, or yields. In addition, our system tolerates various functional groups such as Ar&#8722;X (X=halides), heterocyclic rings, ketones, esters, amides, nitro, nitriles, and C=C double bonds, which are typically susceptible to hydroboration in the presence of transition metals. As a result, a diverse range of &#947;&#8208;boronated amines with varied structures and functions has been readily obtained. Experimental mechanistic studies, density functional theory (DFT), and intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) calculations unveiled a hydroborane&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage and hydride&#8208;shift reaction pathway. The carbonyl group of the amide suppresses dehydrogenation between the free N&#8722;H and hydroborane. The lone pair on the nitrogen of the amide facilitates the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds in cyclopropanes.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Batteries Operating Stably under &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;based chemistries enables ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide redox couple with high concentration of 0.8&#8197;M to access a broad range of physicochemical and electrochemical properties at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C that represents the lowest operating temperature for ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide catholyte reported so far.







Abstract
Alkaline ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide&#8208;based flow batteries are well suited for energy storage because of their features of high electrochemical activity, good kinetics and low material cost. However, they suffer from low energy density and poor temperature adaptability. The ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide catholyte exhibits low solubility (~0.4&#8197;M at 25&#8201;&#176;C) in NaOH&#8208; or KOH&#8208;based supporting electrolyte and can easily form precipitates below room temperature. Here we report a lithium&#8208;based supporting electrolyte that significantly enhances the solubility of ferrocyanide. The use of LiOH intensifies the ion&#8208;dipole interaction between water molecules and solutes and cripples polarization among ferrocyanide ions. Thus, we have achieved a ferrocyanide&#8208;based catholyte of 1.7&#8197;M at 25&#8201;&#176;C and of 0.8&#8197;M at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. A zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery based on the lithium&#8208;based supporting electrolyte demonstrates a steady charge energy of ~72&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1catholyte at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and maintains stable for ~4200&#8197;cycles (~4200&#8197;hours). Furthermore, it remains stable for ~800&#8197;cycles (~800&#8197;hours) at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>A Clean One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Structurally Ordered Linear, Monocyclic, and Bicyclic Oligosiloxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetraacetoxysilanes reacted with silanols or silanediols under base&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions to selectively generate acetoxy&#8208;containing di&#8208; and trisiloxanes. Cyclotetrasiloxanes and bicyclic pentasiloxanes with precisely constructed structures were obtained from successive one&#8208;pot reactions of a tetraacetoxysilane with various silanediols. The acetoxy&#8208;containing oligosiloxanes can serve as efficient surface&#8208;treatment agents and as new building blocks for heat&#8208;resistant materials.







Abstract
A highly selective cross&#8208;coupling reaction between Si&#8722;OAc (AcO=acetoxy) and Si&#8722;OH compounds that generates unsymmetrical and symmetrical oligosiloxanes concurrent with the release of acetic acid has been developed. The high selectivity arises from the reactivity difference that depends on the varying number of acetoxy groups present, thus facilitating a clean one&#8208;pot synthesis of oligosiloxanes. For instance, the reactions of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, or tetraacetoxysilanes with silanols furnish acetoxy&#8208;containing di&#8208; and trisiloxanes in high yield. Two equivalents of tetraacetoxysilane can react with various silanediols to form 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexaacetoxytrisiloxanes, which subsequently react with a second molecule of a silanediol to selectively afford 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetraacetoxycyclotetrasiloxanes. The cyclotetrasiloxanes further react with a third molecule of silanediol to provide unprecedented bicyclic pentasiloxanes with acetoxy groups at the bridgehead silicon atoms. Applications of the acetoxy&#8208;containing products as efficient surface&#8208;treatment agents and new building blocks for highly heat&#8208;resistant materials are demonstrated.

         <title>The Trifluorooxygenate Anion [OF3]&#8722;: Spectroscopic Evidence for a Binary, Hypervalent Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic evidence is presented for the binary, hypervalent [OF3]&#8722;, formed in the reaction of OF2 with laser ablated MF (M=Li&#8722;Cs) under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show that the bonding in [OF3]&#8722; is similar to that in [F3]&#8722;.







Abstract
Experimental evidence for hypervalent compounds of second&#8208;row elements is still scarce in literature. Here, we present the first report of the long&#8208;sought binary, hypervalent trifluorooxygenate anion [OF3]&#8722;. It was isolated in solid Ne matrices under cryogenic conditions after reacting oxygen difluoride with free fluoride ions from laser ablation of alkali metal fluorides MF (M=Li&#8722;Cs). VSEPR theory and calculations at the CCSD(T) level predict a C2v&#8208;symmetric T&#8208;shape structure with one short and two long O&#8722;F bond lengths in [OF3]&#8722;. This is confirmed experimentally by FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotopic labeling. Analysis of the natural local molecular orbitals shows the presence of one 2c&#8211;2e and one 3c&#8211;4e bond each. Natural resonance theory indicates the importance of the stability of [OF2]&#8901;&#8722; for the stability of [OF3]&#8722;. Although free [OF2]&#8901;&#8722; was not detected, the species MOF2 (M=Na&#8722;Cs) could be observed in the same experiments, which are best described as contact ion pairs of M+[OF2]&#8901;&#8722;.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Ketoamides by Sulfonium Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of chiral sulfinimines to keteniminium ions generated through electrophilic amide activation enables a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement to yield enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides in a single step. The transformation proceeds with high enantio&#8208; and chemoselectivity as well as functional group tolerance, and&#8212;in contrast to imide&#8208;based chiral auxiliary approaches&#8212;directly delivers stereochemically stable amide products.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls remains a contemporary challenge in synthesis due to their tendency to undergo racemization via keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Herein, we report a method to access enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides by a chiral sulfinimine&#8208;mediated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement. The transformation displays good chirality transfer, as well as excellent chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. Diastereoselective reduction of the ketone moiety, also achievable in one&#8208;pot fashion, affords enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxyamides.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Activation at Chromium(I): An 11&#8208;Electron Complex Cleaving Dialkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A T&#8208;shaped 11&#8208;electron chromium(I) complex was stabilized by a (PNP) ligand and fully characterized. An sp&#8208;sp carbon&#8208;carbon bond scission in dialkynes was found to occur at the vacant in&#8208;plane coordination site through the formation of a dinuclear dimer.







Abstract
An 11&#8208;electron T&#8208;shaped chromium(I) complex was obtained by reduction of a PNP&#8208;supported chromium(II) iodide complex. Its d5 high&#8208;spin electronic structure was characterized employing paramagnetic NMR, EPR, UV/Vis and magnetic measurements (SQUID). The complex readily reacts with conjugated dialkynes to cleave the internal C&#8722;C bond, forming the respective acetylide complexes. Varying the alkyne substituents enabled the isolation and characterization of dinuclear dialkynedichromium intermediates which thermally convert to the products.

         <title>Are Hydroxyl Radicals Spontaneously Generated in Unactivated Water Droplets?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous reactions of water in either highly charged nanodrops formed by electrospray ionization, or less highly charged microdroplets formed by a vibrating mesh screen nebulizer were investigated. No evidence for ionized water dimer, nor oxidation products of the radical scavengers caffeine or melatonin was observed over a wide range of droplet size, net charge, and lifetime, indicating that water is stable at the surface of unactivated water droplets.







Abstract
Spontaneous ionization/breakup of water at the surface of aqueous droplets has been reported with evidence ranging from formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, indicated by ions at m/z 36 attributed to OH&#8901;&#8208;H3O+ or (H2O&#8208;OH2)+&#8901; as well as oxidation products of radical scavengers in mass spectra of water droplets formed by pneumatic nebulization. Here, aqueous droplets are formed both by nanoelectrospray, which produces highly charged nanodrops with initial diameters ~100&#8197;nm, and a vibrating mesh nebulizer, which produces 2&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;m droplets that are initially less highly charged. The lifetimes of these droplets range from 10s of &#956;s to 560&#8197;ms and the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios span ~100&#8208;fold range. No ions at m/z 36 are detected with pure water, nor are significant oxidation products for the two radical scavengers that were previously reported to be formed in high abundance. These and other results indicate that prior conclusions about spontaneous hydroxyl radical formation in unactivated water droplets are not supported by the evidence and that water appears to be stable at droplet surfaces over a wide range of droplet size, charge and lifetime.

         <title>An Automated Electrochemical Flow Platform to Accelerate Library Synthesis and Reaction Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated electrochemical flow platform for operator&#8208;free data generation is presented, leveraging slug&#8208;based reaction mixtures for low material consumption. This platform was employed in the context of library synthesis of 44 medicinal chemistry&#8208;relevant compounds. The platform was also used to optimize one previously unsuccessful target via DoE, leading to a 6&#8208;fold yield increment.







Abstract
Automated batch and flow setups are well&#8208;established for high throughput experimentation in both thermal chemistry and photochemistry. However, the development of automated electrochemical platforms is hindered by cell miniaturization challenges in batch and difficulties in designing effective single&#8208;pass flow systems. In order to address these issues, we have designed and implemented a new, slug&#8208;based automated electrochemical flow platform. This platform was successfully demonstrated for electrochemical C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings of E3 ligase binders with diverse amines (44 examples), which were subsequently transferred to a continuous&#8208;flow mode for confirmation and isolation, showing its applicability for medicinal chemistry purposes. To further validate the versatility of the platform, Design of Experiments (DoE) optimization was performed for an unsuccessful library target. This optimization process, fully automated by the platform, resulted in a remarkable 6&#8208;fold increase in reaction yield.

         <title>Collective Asymmetric Synthesis of Thiosilvatins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of the epidithiodiketopiperazine (&#8722;)&#8208;dithiosilvatin is reported along with a collective approach to ten related thiosilvatins. The described methods offer a practical blueprint for exploring the dithiotiketopiperazine pharmacophore with absolute and relative stereocontrol.







Abstract
Thiosilvatins are a family of biologically active sulfenylated diketopiperazine natural products. The first members were reported over 40&#8197;years ago, but total synthesis of a thiosilvatin has remained elusive. Here, we describe the first, collective, synthesis of the parent epidithiodiketopiperazine (&#8722;)&#8208;dithiosilvatin and ten related thiosilvatins. Several of the targets are structurally revised. A catalytic asymmetric sulfenylation of triketopiperazines efficiently controls absolute configuration at the thioaminal units. Further synthetic highlights include a diastereoconvergent installation of the requisite cis&#8208;orientation of the sulfur atoms and a tandem epidisulfide formation/O&#8208;prenylation under mild Mitsunobu conditions. The described methods for late&#8208;stage diversification of sensitive bis(methylthio)diketopiperazines offer a blueprint for systematically exploring this interesting 3D&#8208;pharmacophore in stereochemically pure form.

Further synthetic highlights include a diastereoconvergent installation of the requisite &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-orientation of the sulfur atoms and a tandem epidisulfide formation/&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-prenylation under mild Mitsunobu conditions. The described methods for late-stage diversification of sensitive bis(methylthio)diketopiperazines offer a blueprint for systematically exploring this interesting 3D-pharmacophore in stereochemically pure form.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alloying Strategy Regulating Size and Electronic Structure of Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 to Achieve High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by binary descriptors, 16 transition metal selenides are screened, and an alloying strategy is subsequently employed to controllably synthesize Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2/NG. This approach significantly reduces the surface energy while precisely tuning the band alignment and lattice matching between polysulfides and Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2/NG, thereby enhancing interfacial reaction kinetics and enabling the successful construction of high&#8208;performance lithium&#8722;&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
The utilization of catalysts in lithium&#8722;&#8208;sulfur batteries has proven to be an efficacious avenue for enhancing the kinetics of polysulfide conversion. Specially, the size and electronic structure of catalysts play a pivotal role in harnessing the active sites and intrinsic catalysis activity. Outstanding MoSe2 and NbSe2 are were selected from 16 universal transition metal selenides based on the proposed binary descriptor. Then, an alloying strategy is was devised to prepare Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 flakelets for further improvement of the intrinsic catalysis. The integration of density functional theory calculations and electrochemical analysis demonstrates that alloying Mo with Nb can regulate the surface energy and indexes of band match and lattice mismatch, thereby enabling Mo0.25Nb0.75Se2 to possess a small size, suitable adsorption energy and low reaction energy barrier. This optimization enhances the catalysis of sulfur reduction/evolution reaction and the reversible deposition/stripping of lithium. Consequently, an assembled Ah&#8208;level pouch cell is realized with dramatic cycle stability. With the electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 2.36&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8201;S&#8722;1, the cell can deliver a high energy density of up to 505.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgtotal&#8722;1. This work pioneers a universal strategy for sculpting the geometric configurations and electronic structures of catalysts, to achieve enhanced catalytic activity and precise interpretation of structure&#8211;activity relationships.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Solution&#8208;Processable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Based on a Narrowband Near&#8208;Ultraviolet Emitter and a Hot Exciton Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;ultraviolet emitter (ICz&#8208;BO) has been designed with two simple multiple resonance skeletons. ICz&#8208;BO shows a narrowband near&#8208;ultraviolet emission at 404&#8197;nm with a small FWHM of 28&#8197;nm in toluene, while a solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on the ICz&#8208;BO emitter showed an EQEmax of 12.01&#8201;% and a low CIEy of 0.031.







Abstract
Achieving high efficiency narrowband near&#8208;ultraviolet (NUV) emitters in organic light emitting diode (OLED) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybridized local and charge transfer (HLCT) molecule, named ICz&#8208;BO, is prepared and characterized, in which both multiresonant (MR) skeletons are integrated via conjugation connection. A slightly distorted structure and weak intramolecular charge transfer (CT) interaction between two MR subunits lead to a high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (h&#8208;RISC) channel of T6&#8594;S1, also evidenced by both experimental and calculated results. Impressively, the ICz&#8208;BO emitter exhibits outstanding narrowband NUV emission at 404&#8197;nm with a full&#8208;width at half maximum of 28&#8197;nm in toluene solution. The solution processable OLED shows an excellent device performance with the recorded maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.01&#8201;%, concomitant with an extremely low y&#8208;axis Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIEy) value of 0.031. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency reported for the HLCT&#8208;based NUV&#8208;OLEDs to date. This research proves that the MR skeleton plays a positive effect on the narrowband hot exciton emitter, which provides an alternative paradigm for developing high&#8208;efficiency NUV emitters.

         <title>The Spin&#8208;Selective Channels in Fully&#8208;Exposed PtFe Clusters Enable Fast Cathodic Kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin&#8208;dependent transition between triplet O2 and singlet Li2O2 is studied on a fully&#8208;exposed PtFe cluster catalyst. The fast spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer enabled by the directional e&#8208;spins at Fe&#8722;Fe sites, markedly accelerates the kinetics of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction. This work provides new insights into enhancing the cathodic kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 battery through spintronic electrocatalysis and constructing spin catalysts at atomic level.







Abstract
In Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs), the electron transfer between triplet O2 and singlet Li2O2 possesses a spin&#8208;dependent character but is still neglected, while the spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer without losing phase information should guarantee fast kinetics and reduced energy barriers. Here, we provide a paradigm of spin&#8208;selective catalysis for LOB that the ferromagnetic quantum spin exchange interactions between Pt and Fe atoms in fully&#8208;exposed PtFe clusters filter directional e&#8208;spins for spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer at Fe&#8722;Fe sites. The kinetics of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction is markedly accelerated as predicted by theoretical calculations, showing dramatically decreased relaxation time of the rate determining step for more than one order of magnitude, compared with the Fe clusters without spin&#8208;selective behavior. In consequence, the assembled LOB provides ultrahigh energy conversion efficiency of 89.6&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 under a discharge&#8208;charge overpotential of only 0.32&#8197;V. This work provides new insights into the spin&#8208;dependent mechanisms of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction, and the strategy of constructing spin catalysts at atomic level.

The kinetics of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; redox reaction is markedly accelerated as predicted by theoretical calculations, showing dramatically decreased relaxation time of the rate determining step for more than one order of magnitude, compared with the Fe clusters without spin-selective behavior. In consequence, the assembled LOB provides ultrahigh energy conversion efficiency of 89.6&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under a discharge-charge overpotential of only 0.32&#8197;V. This work provides new insights into the spin-dependent mechanisms of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; redox reaction, and the strategy of constructing spin catalysts at atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressing Exciton&#8211;Vibration Coupling via Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions for Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Loss Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimizing energy loss is crucial for overcoming the efficiency bottleneck of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, tuning intramolecular noncovalent interactions is utilized to enhance molecular rigidity, suppress structural relaxation, and weakens exciton&#8211;vibration coupling strength. Therefore, the OSC devices based on Y&#8208;SeSe, featuring dual strong intramolecular Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O noncovalent interactions, achieve outstanding photovoltaic performance and extremely small &#916;Enr.







Abstract
Minimizing energy loss is crucial for breaking through the efficiency bottleneck of organic solar cells (OSCs). The main mechanism of energy loss can be attributed to non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss (&#916;Enr) that occurs due to exciton&#8211;vibration coupling. To tackle this challenge, tuning intramolecular noncovalent interactions is strategically utilized to tailor novel fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Upon comprehensive analysis of both theoretical and experimental results, this approach can effectively enhance molecular rigidity, suppress structural relaxation, reduce exciton reorganization energy, and weakens exciton&#8211;vibration coupling strength. Consequently, the binary OSC device based on Y&#8208;SeSe, which features dual strong intramolecular Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O noncovalent interactions, achieves an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.49&#8201;%, accompanied by an extremely small &#916;Enr of 0.184&#8197;eV, much lower than those of Y&#8208;SS and Y&#8208;SSe based devices with weaker intramolecular noncovalent interactions. These achievements not only set an efficiency record for selenium&#8208;containing OSCs, but also mark the lowest reported &#916;Enr value among high&#8208;performance binary devices. Furthermore, the ternary blend device showcases a remarkable PCE of 20.51&#8201;%, one of the highest PCEs for single&#8208;junction OSCs. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of intramolecular noncovalent interactions in suppressing exciton&#8211;vibration coupling, thereby achieving low&#8208;energy&#8208;loss and high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

         <title>Alcohol Self&#8208;Aggregation: the Preferred Configurations of the Ethanol Trimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four isomers of the ethanol trimer were identified by their rotational spectra aided by extensive quantum chemical calculations. All aggregates show cyclic structures linking the &#8722;OH groups through O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds, and additional C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions. Gauche ethanol conformations are prevalent but there is no homochirality synchronization. Our results underscore the critical changes involved in alcohol aggregation as size increases.







Abstract
An atomic&#8208;level knowledge of the aggregation of archetypal molecular systems is essential to accurately model supramolecular structures and the transition from gas to liquid phase. The structures and forces involved in ethanol aggregation have been investigated using microwave spectroscopy and extensive quantum chemical calculations. Four isomers of the ethanol trimer have been observed and identified based on comparisons between experimental and predicted spectroscopic parameters, and considering collisional relaxation in the supersonic expansion. All observed isomers exhibit O&#8722;H

         <title>Identification of Key Post&#8208;modification Enzymes Involved in the Biosynthesis of Lanostane&#8208;type Triterpenoids in the Medicinal Mushroom Antrodia camphorata.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through different gene mining strategies, three key enzymes (AcCYP4, AcSDR6, AcSMT1) involved in the downstream biosynthesis of major lanostane&#8208;type triterpenoids were discovered and identified from Antrodia camphorata. The catalytic mechanisms of AcSDR6 were elucidated by crystal structure analysis. These post&#8208;modification enzymes could be used to synthesize at least 11 major Antrodia lanostanoids.







Abstract
Lanostane&#8208;type triterpenoids are important bioactive secondary metabolites of mushrooms, though their biosynthetic study has been challenging due to scattered genes. Herein, the strategies of combining metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses, functional motif blast, and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) annotation were used to discover three key post&#8208;modification enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lanostanoids in the medicinal mushroom Antrodia camphorata. The cytochrome P450 enzyme AcCYP4 could generate a &#916;7,9(11) diene structure and introduce a 15&#945;&#8208;hydroxy group to the triterpene skeleton. The short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase AcSDR6 could regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208; selectively catalyze the dehydrogenation of 3&#946;&#8208;OH to produce 3&#8208;keto triterpenoids, and the catalytic mechanisms were interpreted by crystal structure analysis. AcSMT1 could introduce the methyl group at C&#8208;24 to produce a unique 31&#8208;carbon triterpene skeleton. This work elucidated the major biosynthetic pathway of Antrodia lanostanoids in vitro, and the discovered enzymes could be used to synthesize a series of bioactive triterpenoids.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of ~1&#8197;nm Multilevel Capacitor&#8208;like Particles with Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multilevel capacitor&#8208;like character of a novel Au44Cd20 nanoparticle (NP) is identified by NPA charge calculations, charge carrier transport, voltammetry and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. Intra&#8208;NP anti&#8208;galvanic reduction leads to the unanticipated innermost Cd occupation in the cannula&#8208;like Au&#8722;Cd nanoclusters with Au&#8722;Cd segregation.







Abstract
Can the chemically synthesized nanoparticles act as nanodevices or nanomachines? Herein, we demonstrated this feasibility. A novel nanocluster (ultrasmall nanoparticle) [Au44Cd20(m&#8208;MBT)40][N(C8H17)4]2 (Au44Cd20 in short, m&#8208;MBTH: m&#8208;methylbenzenethiol) obtained via developing a synthesis method has a cannula&#8208;like structure of the outer shell and an internal sleeve, revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Natural population analysis (NPA) charge calculations, charge carrier transport of Au44Cd20 (during which an intra&#8208;nanocluster anti&#8208;galvanic reaction was observed) after unneutral charging using NaBH4 as well as voltammetry proved the capacitor&#8208;like character of Au44Cd20. The subsidiary capacitor&#8208;like character of the outer shell of Au44Cd20 was further probed via NPA charge calculations and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. Thus, this study predicts a new era of engineering metal nanoparticles for realizing atomically precise ultrasmall nanodevices and nanomachines.

         <title>Engineered Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;Responsive Artificial H+/Cl&#8722; Ion Channels for Targeted Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive artificial H+/Cl&#8722; ion channels are developed. ROS trigger the rapid release of the channel forming units, which self&#8208;assemble into stable H&#8208;bonded transmembrane cascades, facilitating efficient H+/Cl&#8722; co&#8208;transport. ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl exhibits significant cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cells and demonstrates exceptional selectivity over normal cells.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ion channels regulate the ion flow across the membranes in response to alterations in the cellular redox state, playing a crucial role in cellular adaptation to oxidative stress. Despite their significance, replicating ROS&#8208;responsive functionality in artificial ion channels remains elusive. In this study, we introduce a novel class of artificial H+/Cl&#8722; ion channels activatable by elevated ROS levels in cancer cells. ROS&#8208;induced decaging of the phenylboronate group triggers the rapid release of the channel&#8208;forming units, leading to self&#8208;assembly of the H&#8208;bonded cascades facilitating the synergistic transport of H+ and Cl&#8722; ions, with H+/Cl&#8722; ion transport selectivity of 7.7. Upon activation, ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl exhibits significant apoptotic activity against human breast cancer cells, achieving an IC50 of 2.8&#8197;&#956;M, comparable to that of paclitaxel. Exploiting the intrinsic oxidative microenvironment of cancer cells, along with the enhanced oxidative stress arising from H+/Cl&#8722; co&#8208;transport, ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl demonstrates exceptional selectivity in targeting cancer cells with a selectivity index of 10.2 over normal breast cells, outperforming that of paclitaxel by 19.4 folds.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;small Metallic Nickel Nanoparticles on Dealuminated Zeolite for Active and Durable Catalytic Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step aging method for preparing ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles on dealuminated Beta zeolite has been developed. These nanoparticles show high performance in catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexane into hydrogen and benzene.







Abstract
Each step in the catalyst synthesis process plays an important role in tuning the catalyst structures. For zeolite&#8208;supported nickel catalysts, we found the conventional calcination&#8208;reduction method typically leads to the formation of large nickel particles, but a pre&#8208;aging in hydrogen or nitrogen at a low temperature prior to final reduction can result in ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles in a metallic state. This pre&#8208;aging treatment facilitates the interaction between Ni2+ cations and silanol nests on zeolite before the decomposition of the metal salt, leading to the formation of nanoparticles with an average diameter of ~1.2&#8197;nm. In contrast, the pre&#8208;calcination in oxygen caused the Ni2+ aggregation before the decomposition of the metal salt precursor, yielding nickel nanoparticles larger than 5&#8197;nm. Given the structure sensitivity of nickel in cyclohexane dehydrogenation for hydrogen production, the ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles exhibited significantly enhanced activity and durability compared to previous nickel catalysts.

         <title>Abnormal Freezing Effect on Electron Conduction of Ball&#8208;milled Lanthanum Trihydride for Superionic Conductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At low temperatures, lattice deformation has a noticeable influence on the interaction of octahedral hydrogen and tetrahedral hydrogen in the ball&#8208;milled LaHx, which plays a crucial role in hindering electron conduction, thus improving the ionic transfer number significantly.







Abstract
A recent finding shows that lattice deformation could transform the mixed electronic/hydride (H&#8722;) conducting lanthanum trihydride (LaH3) to a superionic H&#8722; conductor. Such a feature would enable the development of a brand&#8208;new all&#8208;solid&#8208;state hydride ion battery. It is essential to elucidate the mechanism of such a phenomenon. Here, we disclose an abnormal freezing effect on the electronic conductivity (&#963;e) of the ball&#8208;milled LaH3; that is, &#963;e can be lowered by over 2 orders of magnitude upon a low&#8208;temperature treatment. Low&#8208;temperature Raman reveals that at low temperatures, lattice deformation has a noticeable influence on the interaction of hydrogen at octahedral (Ho) and tetrahedral (Ht) sites, which may play a crucial role in hindering electron conduction. This freezing effect can significantly improve the ionic transfer number of rare earth&#8208;based H&#8722; conductors and provide a new direction to the development of solid electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Engineering Electrolyte Network Structure for Improved Kinetics and Dendrite Suppression in Zn&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating co&#8208;solvents (PM) and additives (ZnI2), the electrolyte network structure was optimized, enhancing the interfacial stability between the cathode and anode while promoting the reversibility of sulfur cathodic transitions. Experimental results demonstrated that PM reshaped the ligand structure, improving Zn2+ transport kinetics. Additionally, PM interacted synergistically with ZnI2 to reduce cell polarization, catalyze sulfur cathode reactions, and mitigate I3&#8722;&#8208;induced zinc anode corrosion, significantly enhancing the electrochemical performance of the aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur battery.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur batteries (Zn&#8722;S) are promising alternatives to conventional lithium&#8208;ion technology due to their high energy density, low cost, and enhanced safety. However, challenges such as slow redox kinetics of sulfur cathode conversion and inadequate anode stability persist. This study demonstrates that by tuning the electrolyte structure with the introduction of propylene glycol methyl ether (PM) as a co&#8208;solvent and ZnI2 as an electrolyte additive, and significant improvements at both electrodes could be achieved. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the larger polar &#8722;OH and C&#8722;O&#8722;C electron&#8208;donating groups in the PM molecule can donate electrons for the redox reaction of I&#8722;/I3&#8722;. Its role as a redox mediator improves the reversibility of the sulfur cathodic transformation. Additionally, the dipole moment induced by the hydroxyl groups in PM enhances electron transfer from the zinc anode to the electrolyte and promote the decomposition of anions (OTF&#8722;), improving the interfacial stability of the zinc anode. The synergistic effect of PM and the I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox mediator pair enables the zinc&#8208;sulfur battery to deliver an impressive capacity of 1456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 471.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>A Supramolecular Approach to Engineering Living Cells with Enzymes for Adaptive and Recyclable Cascade Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coating live cells with supramolecular polymers through electrostatic interactions created SupraBAC, a bacteria more resilient to environmental stresses. Host&#8208;guest interactions then enabled the ready immobilization of enzymes on SupraBAC for efficient and recyclable multi&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions. This approach both enhances the stability and recyclability of biocatalysts, while also offering a sustainable approach for complex chemical synthesis.







Abstract
Biocatalytic transformation in nature is inherently dynamic, spontaneous, and adaptive, enabling complex chemical synthesis and metabolism.

&lt;p&gt;Coating live cells with supramolecular polymers through electrostatic interactions created SupraBAC, a bacteria more resilient to environmental stresses. Host-guest interactions then enabled the ready immobilization of enzymes on SupraBAC for efficient and recyclable multi-enzymatic cascade reactions. This approach both enhances the stability and recyclability of biocatalysts, while also offering a sustainable approach for complex chemical synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biocatalytic transformation in nature is inherently dynamic, spontaneous, and adaptive, enabling complex chemical synthesis and metabolism. These processes often involve supramolecular recognition among cells, enzymes, and biomacromolecules, far surpassing the capabilities of isolated cells and enzymes used in industrial synthesis. Inspired by nature, here we design a supramolecular approach to equip living cells with these capacities, enabling recyclable, efficient cascade reactions. Our two-step &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; methodology begins by coating &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; cells with guest-containing polymers (SupraBAC) via supramolecular charge interactions, followed by the introduction of &#946;-cyclodextrin-functionalized host enzymes through host-guest chemistry, creating a robust cell-enzyme complex. This supramolecular coating not only protects cells from various stresses, such as UV radiation, heat, and organic solvents, but also facilitates the overexpression of intracellular enzymes and the attachment of extracellular enzymes within and on SupraBAC. This combination results in efficient multienzyme cascade synthesis, enabling two- and three-step reactions in one pot. Importantly, the multienzyme system can be recycled up to five times without significant loss of activity. Our findings introduce a versatile, adaptive supramolecular coating for whole-cell catalysts, offering a sustainable and efficient solution for complex synthesis in both chemistry and industrial biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Cage&#8208;Confined Cations Molecular Dynamics toward High&#8208;Tc Perovskite Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the cage&#8208;confinement effect is established to exploit new high&#8208;Tc ferroelectrics, of which the Tc is dramatically promoted to 402&#8197;K (&gt;BaTiO3, 393&#8197;K). Further, Deep understanding of cage&#8208;confinement effect and high&#8208;Tc ferroelectricity is well elaborated by combining in situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations on potential energies. This paves a new pathway and makes a breakthrough in the field of molecular ferroelectrics.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;confinement effect that imposes great constriction on the dynamic behaviors of guest molecules is an established platform for tailoring physical properties. Herein, the strategy of enhancing cage&#8208;confinement effect to control molecular motion has been probed for the first time to exploit new high&#8208;Tc ferroelectrics of 2D hybrid perovskites. By fine&#8208;tailoring of the confined cations inside the perovskite cavities, we have successfully obtained new homologous ferroelectrics of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3Cl10 (1; BA=n&#8208;butylamine, MA=methylamine) and (BA)2(EA)2Pb3Cl10 (2; EA=ethylamine). Intriguingly, this dynamics modulation of cage&#8208;confined cations leads to a remarkable promotion of Curie temperature (Tc), boosting from 340&#8197;K (for 1) to 402&#8197;K (for 2). In situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and theoretical simulations on energy barrier confirm that the larger EA cation in 2 is subject to stronger confinement effect, of which potential energy barrier of molecular motion is ~3.5&#8197;times that of MA cation. This dynamic behavior greatly suppresses the dynamic motions of EA cation, while MA cation can easily accelerate motion and reach a fast motion limit, thus accounting for an enhancement of Tc (&#916;T~62&#8197;K) in 2. The finding sheds light on the understanding of cage&#8208;confined electric orders and the precise design of high&#8208;performance ferroelectrics.

         <title>Restraining Planar Gliding in Single&#8208;Crystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 Cathodes by Combining Bulk and Surface Modification Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bulk and surface modification strategy is devised for developing single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 cathode particles with robust chemo&#8208;mechanical properties. Specifically, stabilizing MgO6 octahedra and BO4 tetrahedra are introduced into the bulk lattice, while a Mg3(BO3)2 protective layer is concurrently formed on the surface.







Abstract
The delamination cracking from planar gliding along the (003) facets and anisotropic lattice strain perpendicular to the (003) facets inevitable lead to degradation of Ni&#8208;rich single&#8208;crystal cathode materials, adversely affecting their cyclability. Herein, we rationally design a single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (SC90) cathode with robust chemo&#8208;mechanical properties, in which coherently grown MgO6 octahedra and BO4 tetrahedra are incorporated into the lattice, and a stabilizing Mg3(BO3)2 layer is concurrently formed on the particle surface. Multiscale in/ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that introducing the MgO6 and BO4 units leads to a &#8220;pinning effect&#8221; within the layered structure. This in turn strongly mitigates mechanical degradation by reducing planar gliding and delamination cracking over extended cycling. Moreover, the Mg3(BO3)2 coating maintains fast lithium diffusion by suppressing parasitic reactions at the cathode|electrolyte interface. The tailored SC90 cathode exhibits a capacity retention of ~88&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 5&#8197;C rate, significantly outperforming the pristine counterpart (~60&#8201;%). Additionally, a pouch&#8208;type full cell with a graphite anode sustains a specific discharge capacity of 177&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles, with 90&#8201;% capacity retention. This work highlights the &#8220;pining effect&#8221; in preventing unfavorable slab sliding and structural deterioration, offering new insights for designing advanced ultrahigh Ni single&#8208;crystal cathodes.

         <title>Enabling controllable time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence in carbonized polymer dots based on chromophore excited triplet energy level modulation by ionic bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration for the time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color characteristic in a high contrast self&#8208;protected AA&#8208;based carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) based on the chromophore excited triplet energy level modulation by ionic bonding. And, the precise regulation for TDPC lifetime can be achieved based on heavy atom effort and crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE) effect.







Abstract
Time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials are highly attractive for realizing multitiered dynamic information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. It's extremely challenging to modulate puzzle of multiple luminescence species and understand the intrinsic mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate a novel and synthesize&#8208;friendly strategy to develop a high contrast TDPC carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with adjustable lifetime and quantum yields. The ionic bonding is introduced in self&#8208;protected CPDs to effectively tune the excited triplet energy level of chromophores, and promote the stable existence of L&#8208;aspartic (AA) with green phosphorescence at 545&#8197;nm, and alkali metal aspartates (AA&#8211;M) with red phosphorescence at 665&#8197;nm. The precise regulation for TDPC lifetime can be achieved based on heavy atom effort and crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE) effect. And, the efficient radiative energy transfer could be proven as an intrinsic mechanism for better understanding the TDPC materials. These results further expand on the fundamental principle to design high&#8208;quality TDPC materials with more flexible regulation for luminescence properties, providing a major step forward in broadening the scope of smart phosphorescence applications.

         <title>Hederagenin is a Highly Selective Antagonist of the Neuropeptide FF Receptor 1 that Reveals Mechanisms for Subtype Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identifying subtype&#8208;selective ligands for G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) with highly conserved binding pockets is challenging. In this study, we characterize hederagenin&#8197;(1), a neuropeptide FF receptor&#8197;1 (NPFFR1) antagonist, which exhibits high selectivity over the neuropeptide FF receptor 2 (NPFFR2) despite its overlapping binding site with the endogenous agonist neuropeptide FF (NPFF). Analysis of the binding mode of hederagenin&#8197;(1) elucidates structural determinants for subtype selectivity in the NPFFR family.







Abstract
RF&#8208;amide peptide receptors including the neuropeptide FF receptor&#8197;1 (NPFFR1) are G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) that modulate diverse physiological functions. High conservation of endogenous ligands and receptors makes the identification of selective ligands challenging. Previously identified antagonists mimic the C&#8208;terminus of peptide ligands and lack selectivity towards the closely related neuropeptide FF receptor&#8197;2 (NPFFR2) or the neuropeptide Y1 receptor (Y1R). In a high&#8208;throughput screening, we identified the pentacyclic triterpenoid hederagenin (1) as a novel selective antagonist for the NPFFR1. Hederagenin (1) is a natural product isolated from Hedera helix (ivy). We characterized its mode of activity using in vitro and in silico methods, revealing an overlapping binding site of the small molecule with the orthosteric peptide agonists. Despite the high similarity of the orthosteric binding pockets of NPFFR1 and NPFFR2, hederagenin (1) shows strong subtype selectivity, particularly caused by slight differences in the shape of the binding pockets and the rigidity of the small molecule. Several residues inhibiting the activity of hederagenin (1) at the NPFFR2 were identified. As NPFFR1 antagonists are discussed as potential candidates for the treatment of chronic pain, these insights into the structural determinants governing subtype specificity will facilitate the development of next&#8208;generation analgesics with improved safety and efficacy.

&lt;p&gt;Identifying subtype-selective ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with highly conserved binding pockets is challenging. In this study, we characterize hederagenin&#8197;(&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), a neuropeptide FF receptor&#8197;1 (NPFFR1) antagonist, which exhibits high selectivity over the neuropeptide FF receptor 2 (NPFFR2) despite its overlapping binding site with the endogenous agonist neuropeptide FF (NPFF). Analysis of the binding mode of hederagenin&#8197;(&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) elucidates structural determinants for subtype selectivity in the NPFFR family.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RF-amide peptide receptors including the neuropeptide FF receptor&#8197;1 (NPFFR1) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that modulate diverse physiological functions. High conservation of endogenous ligands and receptors makes the identification of selective ligands challenging. Previously identified antagonists mimic the C-terminus of peptide ligands and lack selectivity towards the closely related neuropeptide FF receptor&#8197;2 (NPFFR2) or the neuropeptide Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R). In a high-throughput screening, we identified the pentacyclic triterpenoid hederagenin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) as a novel selective antagonist for the NPFFR1. Hederagenin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is a natural product isolated from &lt;i&gt;Hedera helix&lt;/i&gt; (ivy). We characterized its mode of activity using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; methods, revealing an overlapping binding site of the small molecule with the orthosteric peptide agonists. Despite the high similarity of the orthosteric binding pockets of NPFFR1 and NPFFR2, hederagenin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) shows strong subtype selectivity, particularly caused by slight differences in the shape of the binding pockets and the rigidity of the small molecule. Several residues inhibiting the activity of hederagenin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) at the NPFFR2 were identified.

         <title>Cationic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (CROPISA) of 2&#8208;Oxazolines: From Block Copolymers to One&#8208;Step Gradient Copolymer Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel method for creating poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) nanoparticles via cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (CROPISA) in n&#8208;dodecane. By chain&#8208;extending poly(2&#8208;(3&#8208;ethylheptyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) with poly(2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline), unique nanoparticles with diverse morphologies were synthesized. Additionally, a single&#8208;step gradient CROPISA process was developed, enabling a streamlined synthesis of new formulations.







Abstract
In recent years, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) has emerged as a powerful method for the straightforward synthesis of polymer nanoparticles at high concentration. In this study, we describe for the first time the synthesis of poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) nanoparticles by dispersion cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (CROPISA) in n&#8208;dodecane. Specifically, a n&#8208;dodecane&#8208;soluble aliphatic poly(2&#8208;(3&#8208;ethylheptyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEHOx) block was chain&#8208;extended with poly(2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PPhOx). While the PhOx monomer is soluble in n&#8208;dodecane, its polymerization leads to n&#8208;dodecane&#8208;insoluble PPhOx, which leads to in&#8197;situ self&#8208;assembly of the formed PEHOx&#8208;b&#8208;PPhOx copolymers. The polymerization kinetics and micellization upon second block formation were studied, and diverse nanoparticle dispersions were prepared, featuring varying block lengths and polymer concentrations, leading to dispersions with distinctive morphologies and physical properties. Finally, we developed a single&#8208;step protocol for the synthesis of polymer nanoparticles directly from monomers via gradient copolymerization CROPISA, which exploits the significantly greater reactivity of EHOx compared to that of PhOx during the statistical copolymerization of both monomers. Notably, this approach provides access to formulations with monomer compositions otherwise unattainable through the block copolymerization method. Given the synthetic versatility and application potential of poly(2&#8208;oxazolines), the developed CROPISA method can pave the way for advanced nanomaterials with favorable properties as demonstrated by using the obtained nanoparticles for stabilization of Pickering emulsions.

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Oxidative Atom and Group Transfer Reactions at a Well&#8208;Defined Uranium(II) Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of two&#8208;electron oxidative atom and group transfers were accomplished at a well&#8208;defined uranium(II) center. This strategy provides a convenient entry to access a variety of uranium(IV)&#8722;element multiple bonds. Moreover, these results highlight the unique ability of the tris(amido)arene ligand framework in stabilizing reactive intermediates and unusual structural motifs for metal complexes.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;electron redox chemistry of uranium(II) compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report a series of two&#8208;electron oxidative atom and group transfer reactions at a well&#8208;defined uranium(II) center. The reactions of uranium(II) complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)U] (M=K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand) and K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)(THF)) with pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide or nitrosobenzene, elemental sulfur/selenium or triphenylphosphine sulfide/selenide, and ditellurium salt led to the isolation of uranium(IV) terminal oxo and chalcogenido complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)UX] (X=O, S, Se, Te). In addition, the reactions of [M][(AdTPBN3)U] with aryl azides ArN3 or diazoalkanes R2CN2 quantitatively yielded uranium(IV) terminal imido [M][(AdTPBN3)UNAr] or hydrazonido(2&#8722;) complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)UN2CR2], respectively. Notably, the low&#8208;temperature reaction between [M][(AdTPBN3)U] and mesityl azide allowed the isolation of the first uranium(IV) aryldiazenylimido complex as an intermediate. These uranium(IV)&#8722;element multiply bound compounds were fully characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 1H NMR spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, solution and solid&#8208;state magnetometry, and elemental analysis. The controlled two&#8208;electron oxidative reactions at a uranium(II) center not only expand the redox reactivity of uranium(II) but also offer a convenient new route to access uranium&#8722;element multiply bound compounds.

         <title>CO&#8208;Tolerant Heterogeneous Ruthenium Catalysts for Efficient Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous ruthenium catalysts without phosphorus were designed and synthesized for formic acid dehydrogenation in the absence of additives. Theoretical calculations, catalytical experiments and characterization proved that the coordination of nitrogen to ruthenium inhibited the formation the CO and weakened the adsorption of CO over ruthenium. Thus, the catalysts exhibited good catalytic performance for formic acid dehydrogenation and excellent tolerance to CO.







Abstract
The development of improved and less costly catalysts for dehydrogenation of formic acid (HCOOH) is of general interest for renewable energy technologies involving hydrogen storage and release. Theoretical calculations reveal that ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon should be appropriate catalysts for such transformations. It is predicted that nitrogen doping significantly decreases the formation of CO, but at the same time increases CO tolerance of the catalysts. To prove these hypotheses heterogeneous ruthenium catalysts supported on porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Rux/CN) with hierarchical structure were synthesized using carbon nitride (C3N4) as template and phenanthroline (Phen) as ligand. Experimental tests in HCOOH dehydrogenation revealed that the optimal catalyst Ru7/CN exhibited good thermal stability at 140 &#176;C and a high turnover frequency (TOF &gt;1300&#8197;h&#8722;1), which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the commercial Ru5/C catalyst.

         <title>Modular Access to C2&#8217;&#8208;Aryl/Alkenyl Nucleosides with Electrochemical Stereoselective Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C2&#8217;&#8208;modifications of nucleosides represent a key structural feature in many nucleoside&#8208;based therapeutics, though the development of efficient synthetic methodologies remains a significant challenge. This report introduces a modular and highly efficient approach for the C2&#8217;&#8208;arylation/alkenylation of nucleosides via electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling, which delivers excellent &#945;&#8208;stereoselectivity and broad functional group compatibility. Using this method, we synthesized a series of C2&#8217;&#8208;aryl&#8208;modified oligonucleotides that exhibited notable effects on DNA duplex melting temperatures (Tm), enhanced resistance to 3&#8217;&#8208;exonuclease degradation, and retained efficient cellular uptake.







Abstract
Chemically modified oligonucleotides have garnered significant attention in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and synthetic biology due to their enhanced stability in vivo compared to naturally occurring oligonucleotides. However, current methods for synthesizing modified nucleosides, particularly at the C2&#8217;&#8208;position, are limited in terms of efficiency, modularity, and selectivity. Herein, we report a new approach for the synthesis of highly functionalized C2&#8217;&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl/alkenyl nucleosides via an electrochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8217;&#8208;bromo nucleosides with a variety of (hetero)aryl and alkenyl iodides.

&lt;p&gt;C2&#8217;-modifications of nucleosides represent a key structural feature in many nucleoside-based therapeutics, though the development of efficient synthetic methodologies remains a significant challenge. This report introduces a modular and highly efficient approach for the C2&#8217;-arylation/alkenylation of nucleosides via electrochemical Ni-catalyzed cross-electrophile-coupling, which delivers excellent &#945;-stereoselectivity and broad functional group compatibility. Using this method, we synthesized a series of C2&#8217;-aryl-modified oligonucleotides that exhibited notable effects on DNA duplex melting temperatures (Tm), enhanced resistance to 3&#8217;-exonuclease degradation, and retained efficient cellular uptake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemically modified oligonucleotides have garnered significant attention in medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, and synthetic biology due to their enhanced stability &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; compared to naturally occurring oligonucleotides. However, current methods for synthesizing modified nucleosides, particularly at the C2&#8217;-position, are limited in terms of efficiency, modularity, and selectivity. Herein, we report a new approach for the synthesis of highly functionalized C2&#8217;-&#945;-aryl/alkenyl nucleosides via an electrochemical nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling of 2&#8217;-bromo nucleosides with a variety of (hetero)aryl and alkenyl iodides. This method affords a diverse array of C2&#8217;- &#945;-aryl/alkenyl nucleosides with excellent stereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. We further synthesized oligonucleotides incorporating C2&#8217;-aryl-modified thymidine moieties and demonstrated that their annealed double-stranded DNAs exhibit decreased melting temperatures (Tm). Additionally, oligonucleotides with C2&#8217;-aryl modifications at the 3&#8217; end showed enhanced resistance to 3&#8217;-exonuclease degradation and C2&#8217;-aryl modifications did not impede the cellular uptake process, highlighting the potential of these modified oligonucleotides for therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated [4+2] Annulation of Silylimines with Olefins to 1&#8208;Aminotetralins Enabled by Diradical Hydrogen Atom Transfer of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;mediated diradical hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) of primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;alkyl arylsilylimines and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;formyl arylsilylimines and their subsequent [4+2] annulations with olefins were accomplished via energy transfer. The silyl substituent on the nitrogen atom was crucial for the success of the reaction by modulating the reactivities of the diradical intermediates derived from the excited imines in DHAT and cascade cyclization process.







Abstract
A facile photochemical, one&#8208;pot synthesis of highly functionalized 1&#8208;aminotetralins derivatives (&gt;70 examples) from readily accessible o&#8208;alkyl and o&#8208;formyl aryl silylimines with olefins is described. A diradical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) of primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;alkyl arylsilylimines and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;formyl arylsilylimines enabled a [4+2] annulation with olefins in excellent diastereoselectivity. This was accomplished upon irradiation at &#955; = 420&#8197;nm in the presence of thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the sensitizer via energy transfer. Moreover, sulfur&#8208;substituted o&#8208;alkyl silylimines can undergo such photochemical process in the absence of an external photosensitizer. This effective protocol is compatible with a variety of functional groups and can be applied to the modification of bioactive molecules. Based on mechanistic evidences and computational studies, it is suggested that the silyl substituent enables an efficient energy transfer leading to the formation of a key C,N&#8208;diradical and subsequent [4+2]&#8208;cyclization was supported by a better molecular orbital matching between the HSOMO of the 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediate and the LUMO of the olefins. Thus, upon irradiation, the excited silylimine unlocks a carbon&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen DHAT and subsequent [4+2] cyclization that allows the divergent functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Methylthio Substituent in SAM Constructing Regulatory Bridge with Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduced the MeS&#8208; substituent into SAM HTL materials, which enables stronger interactions with the buried perovskite interface, and offers better HOMO energy level alignment compared to the methoxy group. MeS&#8722;CbzPh based inverted perovskite photovoltaics achieved a champion efficiency of 26.01&#8201;%, along with exceptional stability. Notably, the MeS&#8208; group demonstrated remarkable versatility. These findings present a novel strategy for designing new SAM materials to enhance the performance of inverted PSCs.







Abstract
Inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have experienced remarkable advancements in recent years, which is largely attributed to the development of novel hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) materials. Methoxy (MeO&#8722;) groups are typically introduced into SAM materials to enhance their wettability and effectively passivate the perovskite buried interface. However, MeO&#8208;based SAM materials exhibit a mismatch in highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels with perovskite layer due to the strong electron&#8208;donating capability of methoxy group. In this work, we introduced a methylthio (MeS&#8722;) substituent that is superior to methoxy as a highly versatile self&#8208;assembled molecular design strategy. As a soft base, sulfur atom forms a stronger Pb&#8722;S bond than oxygen. Additionally, within the CbzPh series of SAM materials, MeS&#8722;CbzPh demonstrates a more optimal HOMO level and enhanced hole transport properties. Consequently, the MeS&#8722;CbzPh HTL based device achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.01&#8201;% and demonstrated high stability, retaining 93.3&#8201;% efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Moreover, in comparison with the commonly used 4PACz&#8208;based SAM molecular series, MeS&#8208;4PACz also exhibited the best performance among its peers. Our work provides valuable insights for the molecular design of SAM materials, offering a highly versatile functional substituent group.

         <title>Supramolecular Rotor Assembly for the Design of a Hybrid Ferroelectric&#8208;Antiferromagnetic Multiferroic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first crown ether&#8208;based hybrid ferroelectric&#8208;antiferromagnetic multiferroic material with excellent X&#8208;ray radiation detection response was prepared by the self&#8208;assembly of a supramolecular rotor and a magnetic module. This study demonstrates the great advantages this approach in the design of multiferroic materials and provides a new avenue for developing ferroic functional materials.







Abstract
Ferroelectric (FE)&#8208;antiferromagnetic (AFM) multiferroic materials have sparked growing interest due to their huge possibilities in energy&#8208;saving, photoelectric devices, nonvolatile storage, and switches. However, realizing FE&#8208;AFM properties in a hybrid molecular material is difficult because ferroelectric and magnetic orders are commonly mutually exclusive. Here, we report an FE&#8208;AFM multiferroic semiconductor [NH4(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]2[Mn(SCN)4] (NCMS) by supramolecular assembly approach via molecular rotor synthon [NH4(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] and inorganic magnetic module [Mn(SCN)4]. Interestingly, NCMS shows good ferroelectricity with a spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 5.94&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2 higher than most crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based ferroelectrics. Especially, the realization of antiferromagnetism is for the first time in the crown ether hybrid perovskite ferroic systems. Additionally, semiconductor NCMS displays an X&#8208;ray radiation detection response with a large photo/dark current on&#8208;off ratio (197). Our study not only gives a deep insight into understanding multiferroic properties but also provides a novel and efficient approach to realizing high&#8208;performance hybrid multiferroic materials.

         <title>Controlling the Mechanism of Nucleation and Growth Enables Synthesis of UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Desired Macroscopic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism of UiO&#8208;66 solvothermal synthesis in presence of H2O and HCl modulators has been studied. Nucleation stage is limited with hydrolysis of Zr&#8722;Cl bonds and rate&#8208;limiting stage of crystal growth is formation of zirconium&#8208;oxo nodes. H2O accelerates and HCl inhibits both nucleation and crystal growth, however, to a different extent. The degree of deprotonation of terephthalic acid does not directly affect either nucleation or crystal growth rates.







Abstract
By combining in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, Zr K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that the properties of the final MOF are influenced by H2O and HCl via affecting the nucleation and crystal growth at the molecular level. The nucleation implies hydrolysis of monomeric zirconium chloride complexes into zirconium&#8208;oxo species, and this process is promoted by H2O and inhibited by HCl, allowing to control crystal size by adjusting H2O/Zr and HCl/Zr ratios. The rate&#8208;determining step of crystal growth is represented by the condensation of monomeric and oligomeric zirconium&#8208;oxo species into clusters, or nodes, with the structure identical to that in secondary building units (SBU) of UiO&#8208;66 framework. The rapid crystallization in the absence of HCl leads to formation of defective secondary building units with missing zirconium atoms, providing a pathway to control the number of defects in UiO&#8208;66 crystals. Remarkably, we have shown that assembling of the metal nodes and linkers into the UiO&#8208;66 structure is not the rate&#8208;limiting step, and the degree of deprotonation of the linker has no direct effect on the crystallization kinetics or crystal size of product.

     alt="Controlling the Mechanism of Nucleation and Growth Enables Synthesis of UiO-66 Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Desired Macroscopic Properties"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanism of UiO-66 solvothermal synthesis in presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and HCl modulators has been studied. Nucleation stage is limited with hydrolysis of Zr&#8722;Cl bonds and rate-limiting stage of crystal growth is formation of zirconium-oxo nodes. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O accelerates and HCl inhibits both nucleation and crystal growth, however, to a different extent. The degree of deprotonation of terephthalic acid does not directly affect either nucleation or crystal growth rates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining in situ X-ray diffraction, Zr K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we show that the properties of the final MOF are influenced by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and HCl via affecting the nucleation and crystal growth at the molecular level. The nucleation implies hydrolysis of monomeric zirconium chloride complexes into zirconium-oxo species, and this process is promoted by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and inhibited by HCl, allowing to control crystal size by adjusting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Zr and HCl/Zr ratios. The rate-determining step of crystal growth is represented by the condensation of monomeric and oligomeric zirconium-oxo species into clusters, or nodes, with the structure identical to that in secondary building units (SBU) of UiO-66 framework. The rapid crystallization in the absence of HCl leads to formation of defective secondary building units with missing zirconium atoms, providing a pathway to control the number of defects in UiO-66 crystals. Remarkably, we have shown that assembling of the metal nodes and linkers into the UiO-66 structure is not the rate-limiting step, and the degree of deprotonation of the linker has no direct effect on the crystallization kinetics or crystal size of product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ce3+/Ce4+ Ion Redox Shuttle Stabilized Cu&#948;+ for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a simple solvothermal strategy to obtain Ce/CuOx catalyst for the CO2 conversion to multi&#8208;carbon products, which exhibits high C2 selectivity (at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE, 40&#8201;% for C2H4, 6&#8201;% for CH3COOH and 14&#8201;% for CH3CH2OH) and durability over 25&#8197;h. The excellent performance of Ce/CuOx may be attributed to the following factors: 1)&#8197;The dispersed Ce stabilizes Cu&#948;+ species under the reduction condition. 2)&#8197;The presence of Cu&#948;+ reduces the free energy of forming *COCO intermediate and decreases the energy barrier of the C&#8722;C coupling reaction, resulting in the high activity and selectivity of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4.







Abstract
The CO2 electroreduction reaction has advantages in clean and pollution&#8208;free carbon conversion, but it still faces challenges in carbon utilization efficiency and improving the selectivity of C2 products. Although the dynamic Cu&#948;+ state is known to favor the C&#8722;C coupling process, the suitable Cu&#948;+ species for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 are difficult to maintain under the conditions of strong reduction and large current. Herein, we propose a Ce doping strategy to stabilize the Cu&#948;+ state (Ce/CuOx) during the CO2RR process, which enables a high Faradaic efficiency of 60&#8201;% for multi&#8208;carbon products (40&#8201;% for C2H4, 14&#8201;% for CH3CH2OH, and 6&#8201;% for CH3COOH), and 25&#8197;h stability at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. In&#8197;situ infrared spectroscopy, in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu&#948;+ is stabilized by the redox ion pairs of Ce, which reduces the energy barrier of *CO coupling, and improves the Faraday efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction of C2H4. This work provides a new idea to make full use of lanthanide variable value metals for advanced catalysis and clean energy conversion.

         <title>An Advanced 3D Crosslinked Conductive Binder for Silicon Anodes: Leveraging Glycerol Chemistry for Superior Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel n&#8208;type conductive crosslinked binder (POD&#8208;c&#8208;GL) has been successfully developed, combining enhanced electronic and ionic conductivities with dynamic crosslinking chemistry. This innovative binder significantly improves silicon anodes&#8217; rate capability and cycling stability by efficiently dissipating stress and maintaining a robust electrode structure. The study comprehensively analyzes the binder's conductivity changes pre&#8208; and post&#8208;doping, addressing critical gaps in n&#8208;type conductive polymer research and paving the way for advanced lithium&#8208;ion battery applications







Abstract
Silicon (Si) anodes hold great promise for high&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), yet their practical application is hindered by severe volume expansion and mechanical degradation. To tackle these challenges, we present an innovative 3D crosslinked conductive polyoxadiazole (POD) binder engineered with glycerol (GL) to form a robust network of covalent and hydrogen bonds. This unique chemical architecture not only enhances adhesion and mechanical resilience to effectively dissipate the stresses induced by Si's volumetric changes but also constructs a robust conductive framework to facilitate electron transfer. The dynamic interplay between strong covalent and flexible hydrogen bonds in the POD&#8208;c&#8208;GL binder enables superior structural integrity and stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) during cycling. The Si@POD&#8208;c&#8208;GL anode exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance, including a high initial Coulombic efficiency, impressive rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability. This work highlights the potential of harnessing in situ crosslinking chemistry to develop advanced binders, paving the way for the next generation of high&#8208;performance Si anodes in LIBs.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Strategy to Enhance Long&#8208;Range Order of Poly(Heptazine Imide) Nanorods for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(heptazine imide) nanorods with improved long&#8208;range order was prepared by a bottom&#8208;up strategy. The improvement of long&#8208;range order greatly enhances the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges as well as the adsorption for *CO intermediate, resulting in excellent activity for photocatalytic CO2 methanation.







Abstract
Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), one of the crystalline or long&#8208;range ordered allotropes of polymeric carbon nitride, is a promising polymeric photocatalyst; however, preparation of highly crystalline PHI remains a challenge. Herein, through a bottom&#8208;up strategy involving repair of structural defects and increase of specific surface area of melon precursor, we prepared PHI nanorods with dramatically improved long&#8208;range order. The resulting PHI exhibited a shift of product selectivity in CO2 photoreduction from CO to CH4 with a high methanation activity in contrast to the pristine PHI with relatively low long&#8208;range order. The improvement of long&#8208;range order for PHI remarkably enhanced the separation efficiency and transfer kinetics of photogenerated charges as well as the adsorption for *CO intermediate. This study revealed the relationship between the precursor structure and PHI crystal growth in ionothermal synthesis, and also showcased the great potential of highly crystalline PHI in artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Electron Oxidation Triggered by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excited Enzymes for Asymmetric Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights an emerging strategy in photobiocatalysis: repurposing naturally occurring enzymes by visible&#8208;light excitation to trigger single&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation&#8208;driven biotransformations. Combined with protein engineering, the highly oxidizing excited enzymatic flavin cofactor or enzyme&#8208;bound iminium ion enables various non&#8208;natural photobiocatalytic C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;S bond&#8208;formation reactions in a stereocontrolled and redox&#8208;neutral manner.







Abstract
By integrating enzymatic catalysis with photocatalysis, photoenzymatic catalysis emerges as a powerful strategy to enhance enzyme catalytic capabilities and provide superior stereocontrol in reactions involving reactive intermediates. Repurposing naturally occurring enzymes using visible light is among the most active directions of photoenzymatic catalysis. This Minireview focuses on a cutting&#8208;edge strategy in this direction, namely single&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation&#8208;triggered non&#8208;natural biotransformations catalyzed by photoexcited enzymes. These straightforward transformations feature a unique radical mechanism initiated by single&#8208;electron oxidation, achieving redox&#8208;neutral non&#8208;natural C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, and C&#8722;S bond formation, and expanding the chemical toolbox of enzymes. By highlighting recent advances in this field and emphasizing their catalytic mechanisms and synthetic potential, innovative approaches for photobiomanufacturing are anticipated.

         <title>Heterogeneous Catalysis of Molecular&#8208;Like Au8M(PPh3)8n+ Clusters Cultivated in Mesoporous SBA&#8208;15</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a push&#8208;and&#8208;pull synthesis strategy for designing the heterogeneous catalyst denoted as TiOx/cluster@SBA, where the three functional units of clusters, SBA&#8208;15 and TiOx are combined into one heterogeneous catalyst, and thereby we learn how the atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring of a heterogeneous catalyst can switch on elusive heterogeneous mechanisms with cluster catalysis.







Abstract
It is a dream of researchers to be able to tailor the catalytic performances by adjusting heterogeneous catalysts at the atomic level. Atomically precise metal clusters provide us with the possibility to achieve this challenge. Here, we design a push&#8208;and&#8208;pull synthesis strategy coupled with TiOx coating to prepare the heterogeneous catalysts denoted as TiOx/Au8M@SBA via cultivating atomically precise Au8M(PPh3)8n+ (M=Pd, Pt or Au; n=2 for Pd/Pt and 3 for Au) clusters in mesoporous molecular sieve. The catalysts are made up of the three functional units, which include Au8M(PPh3)8n+ clusters that can act as the active sites, the pore environment of the SBA&#8208;15 that can announce a catalysis show for the clusters with precise number of atoms maintained during the chemical reactions, and the TiOx coating that can further inhibit the migration of the clusters under reaction conditions. The selective hydrogenation of acetylene performed in the fixed&#8208;bed reactor taken, for example, we learn how the atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring of a heterogeneous catalyst can switch on elusive heterogeneous mechanisms with cluster catalysis. This work sheds light on the fundamental insight into catalysis origin of heterogeneous catalysts and achieves a distinguished level of detail for cluster catalysis.

         <title>Unconventional Heterobidentate Coordination of 4&#8208;Hydroxypyridine Leading to Remarkably Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Zn(C5H4NO)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual heterobidentate coordination generates a novel compound Zn(C5H4NO)2, which shows a uniform alignment of microscopic polarization that generates the record&#8208;high bulk SHG among all UV&#8208;transparent Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic compounds.







Abstract
Herein, we report an unconventional heterobidentate coordination mode of conventional 4&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligand in a novel compound Zn(C5H4NO)2. The strong heterobidentate coordination interactions between Zn2+ and 4&#8208;hydroxypyridine ligands promote a uniform alignment of the polarization of each [ZnO2N2] tetrahedral building unit, resulting in remarkably strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) with an intensity that is the largest among all UV&#8208;transparent Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic compounds reaching 13.6&#215;KDP. Moreover, Zn(C5H4NO)2 processes a suitable optical band gap of 4.40&#8197;eV, high thermal stability up to 300&#8201;&#176;C, excellent air stability, and strong water resistance, demonstrating great application potential. Additionally, Zn(C5H4NO)2 exhibits photoluminescence with a significantly enhanced lifetime of 558&#8197;ms, accompanied by a rare blue afterglow visible to the naked eye, lasting up to 5&#8197;s.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Tri&#8208;Axis Naphthalenes via Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction and Dehydrative Aromatization of Isobenzofurans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomers with multiple stereogenic axes have attracted much attention due to their increasing significance in the fields of natural products, chiral materials, and drug discoveries. However, the catalytic stereoselective construction of axially chiral ring scaffolds with more than two axes on a single benzene ring remains a challenging task. Herein, we present an efficient method for synthesizing triaxially chiral polysubstituted naphthalene scaffolds via sequential Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of isobenzofurans and TfOH&#8208;promoted dehydrative aromatization reaction. Using 1,3&#8208;biarylisobenzofurans and &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles as modular reaction partners, a series of naphthalenes with 1,3,4&#8208;triaxes were synthesized with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, by attaching two pyrene chromophores to this novel triaxially chiral ring scaffold, a circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active dye exhibiting a remarkable luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum = &#8210;0.019) and high fluorescence quantum efficiency (&#216;FL = 0.29) was obtained, highlighting the potential applications of atropisomers with multiple stereogenic axes in the design of chiroptical organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer&#8208;MOF Network Enabling Ultrathin Coating for Post&#8208;Combustion Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Permeance&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off and high temperature resilience are key challenges in development of membranes for post&#8208;combustion carbon capture. While mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) consisting of polymers and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) offer the potential to address the challenges, they are limited by the low loading of MOFs in the thin film layer. Herein, we propose an inverse synthesis strategy to form polymer&#8208;MOF networks by copolymerizing monomers with functionalized UiO&#8208;66 nanoparticles. This process yields a finely dispersed, easily processable solution, enabling defect&#8208;free, thin polymer&#8208;MOF coatings with up to 40 wt% MOF loading within the polyethylene oxide&#8208;based polymers on polyacrylonitrile supports. The membrane with 40 wt% MOF demonstrated a 212% increment in CO2 permeance at 25 &#176;C and maintained a selectivity of 20 at 60 &#176;C, which is attributed to the stable diffusivity selectivity of MOFs at high temperature. Furthermore, the membrane was evaluated with mixed gas and 83% relative humidity (RH) at 60&#176;C, achieving a CO2 permeance up to 2793 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 21.6. This work offers insights into the design of practical mixed matrix membranes, which not only paves the way towards energy efficient carbon capture from flue gas, but also provides more possibilities for other applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of Interfacial Hydration Structure Induced by Ion Condensation and Correlation Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial hydration structures are crucial in wide&#8208;ranging applications, including battery, colloid, lubrication. Multivalent ions like Mg2+ and La3+ show irreplaceable roles in these applications, which are hypothesized due to their unique interfacial hydration structures. However, this hypothesis lacks experimental supports. Here, we provide the first observation for their interfacial hydration structures with molecular resolution using atomic force microscopy. We observed the evolution of layered hydration structures at La(NO3)3 solution&#8208;mica interfaces. As concentration increases from 25 mM to 2 M, the layer number varies from 2 to 1 and back to 2, and the interlayer thickness rises from 0.25&#177;0.05 to 0.34&#177;0.03 nm, with hydration force increasing from 0.27&#177;0.07 to 1.04&#177;0.24 nN. Theory and molecular simulation reveal that the cations form inner&#8208;sphere complexes. Multivalence induces concentration&#8208;dependent ion condensation and correlation effects, resulting in compositional and structural evolution within interfacial hydration structures. Additional experiments at seven different solid&#8208;liquid interfaces together with literature comparison confirm the universality of this mechanism for both multivalent and monovalent ions. New factors affecting interfacial hydration structures are revealed, including concentration and solvent dielectric constant. This insight provides guidance for designing interfacial hydration structures to optimize solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;interphase for battery life extension, modulate colloid stability and develop efficient lubricants.</dc:description>

         <title>Coulombic Condensation of Liquefied Gas Electrolytes for Li Metal Batteries at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of employing highly concentrated electrolytes has been widely incorporated into electrolyte design, due to their enhanced Li&#8208;metal passivation and oxidative stability compared to their diluted counterparts. However, issues such as high viscosity and sub&#8208;optimal wettability, compromise their suitability for commercialization. In this study, we present a highly concentrated dimethyl ether&#8208;based electrolyte that appears as a liquid phase at ambient conditions via Li+ &#8208; solvents ion&#8208;dipole interactions (Coulombic condensation). Unlike conventional high salt concentration ether&#8208;based electrolytes, it demonstrates enhanced transport properties and fluidity. The anion&#8208;rich solvation structure also contributes to the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich salt&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase, facilitating stable Li metal cycling for over 1000 cycles at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2, 1 mAh cm&#8208;2 condition. When combined with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) electrode, the electrolyte effectively reduces the polysulfide shuttling effect and ensures stable performance across a range of charging currents, up to 6 mA cm&#8208;2. This research underscores a promising strategy for developing an anion&#8208;rich, high concentration ether electrolyte with decreased viscosity, which supports a Li metal anode with exceptional temperature durability and rapid charging capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Stability of Metastable Monomers to Bias the Supramolecular Polymerization of Naphthalendiimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of the naphthalendiimides (NDIs) 1&#8208;3 endowed with peripheral 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxybenzamide units and a variable number of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole rings. Both the benzamide units and the triazole rings are able to form six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded pseudocycles that behave as metastable monomeric units. Whilst freshly prepared solutions of 1&#8208;3 afford H&#8208;type aggregates, the presence or lack of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole rings strongly conditions the kinetics and stability of the resulting aggregated species. These structural features result in highly stable metastable monomeric species M* for the symmetric 2 that can be trapped for long periods of time when the sample is subject to a heating/cooling cycle. Contrary to NDI 2, the M* species formed by 1 and 3 evolve to the final supramolecular polymers in shorter times. A detailed experimental and theoretical study display the different non&#8208;covalent supramolecular forces operating in the stabilization of such M* species. In all cases, but especially in those NDIs endowed with the triazoles rings (NDIs 2 and 3), a number of conformers for the metastable monomeric units can be modelled. The high stability of such monomeric species justifies the delay in the formation of the H&#8208;type aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of IrB1.15 Nanocrystals for Efficient Chlorine and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions in Saline Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of storable hydrogen fuel through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, marine, geothermal, and wind energy presents a promising pathway toward achieving energy sustainability. Nevertheless, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolysis requires support from ancillary processes which often incur financial and energy costs. Developing electrolysers capable of directly operating with water that contains impurities can circumvent these processes. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient and durable electrolysis of saline water to produce chlorine gas (Cl2) and hydrogen using structurally ordered IrB1.15, synthesized through ultrafast joule heating. IrB1.15 exhibits remarkable performance, achieving overpotentials of 75 mV for the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and 12 mV for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, IrB1.15 displays a durability of over 90 h towards both CER and HER. Density functional theory reveals that IrB1.15 has adsorption energies significantly closer to 0 eV for Cl and H, compared to IrO2 and Pt/C. Furthermore, in&#8208;situ Raman investigations reveal that Ir in IrB1.15 serves as the active center for CER, while the introduction of B atoms to Ir lattices mitigates the formation of absorbed hydrogen species on the Ir surface, thereby enhancing the performance of IrB1.15 in HER.</dc:description>

         <title>The amplification of alpha&#8208;synuclein amyloid fibrils is suppressed under fully quiescent conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seed amplification assays (SAAs) are a promising avenue for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, when amplifying fibrils from patient&#8208;derived samples in multiwell plates, it is currently highly challenging to accurately quantify the aggregates. It is therefore desirable to transfer such assays into a digital format in microemulsion droplets to enable direct quantification of aggregate numbers. To achieve transfer from conventional plate&#8208;based to the microfluidic digital format, effective seed amplification needs to be achieved inside the microdroplets. Therefore, we establish a new set of assay conditions that enable highly efficient seed amplification in plates without any shaking. However, the same set of conditions displayed a very different behavior upon transfer to a microfluidic platform where no amplification was observed. We demonstrate that this is caused by the suppression of all secondary processes that could amplify the seeds in the complete absence of mechanical perturbations inside the microdroplets. We further show that the amplification inside droplets can be achieved by subjecting the microemulsions to high&#8208;frequency vibrations using a piezo device. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the physical requirements of alpha&#8208;synuclein seed amplification and demonstrate a pathway towards the development of effective digital SAAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of Supramolecular Coordination Assemblies Visually Monitored by Time&#8208;Dependent Multicolor Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metastable nanofiber structures triggered by the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and coordination between zinc ions and the organic ligands evolved into nanosheet assemblies over time in water, accompanied by fluorescence changes that enabled visual monitoring. This strategy could be extended to multiple ions and offers applications in temporal dynamic fluorescence encryption.







Abstract
Supramolecular coordination assemblies play an important role in both material science and biological systems. Despite significant efforts in their development, most existing examples are thermodynamically controlled, which lack the adaptability and autonomy essential for the creation of advanced materials. In this work, we have developed non&#8208;equilibrium coordination assembly systems that can evolve over time through a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic controls. The introduction of zinc ions resulted in the formation of metastable fiber assemblies in a kinetically trapped state, which autonomously converted to thermodynamically stable nanosheets over time. This evolution process can be regulated by external stimuli and visually monitored by the time&#8208;dependent multicolor fluorescence. The construction strategy was versatile across other various ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Al3+, offering inspiring insights for the design of complex systems that operated both in and out of their thermodynamic equilibrium.

         <title>Skeletal Rearrangement of Azo Compounds Enables Low&#8208;Potential, High&#8208;capacity Organic Anodes for Rechargeable Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skeletal rearrangement strategy is used to optimize the planarity and aromaticity of conventional azo compounds. Benefitted from the fused&#8208;ring structure and inherent basicity, the novel azo compounds exhibit low potential, intrinsic insolubility, and high capacity, serving as promising anode materials for rechargeable alkaline batteries.







Abstract
The widespread adoption of rechargeable alkaline batteries is plagued by the performance&#8208;limiting metal anodes, which are prone to (electro)chemical corrosion and raise environmental or economic concerns. Organic redox&#8208;active materials offer a potential solution, but they typically struggle with dissolution&#8208;induced degradation and insufficiently negative reduction potentials. Herein, we introduce benzo[c]cinnoline and its derivatives (collectively referred to as BCCs), a class of aromatic azo compounds with fused&#8208;ring structure, as promising organic anode materials. BCCs exhibit pronounced aromaticity and Br&#248;nsted basicity, conferring low reduction potentials and intrinsic insolubility in alkaline solutions. Paired with the industrially established nickel hydroxide cathode, these batteries deliver excellent capacity (297&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1anode), high output voltage of 1.3&#8197;V, and extended cycle life (&#8776;16000 cycles). Notably, they also operate efficiently at extremely low temperatures down to &#8722;85&#8201;&#176;C with an 8&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. We further explore the feasibility for all&#8208;organic alkaline batteries by paring BCCs with the dihydro form of 4,4&#8217;&#8208;azopyridine, utilizing azo compounds for both anode and cathodes. This chemistry harnesses the unique properties of small organic molecules to enable all&#8208;organic batteries with high capacity of 236&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8211;1, fast charging at 1200&#8197;C, and easy recyclability.

         <title>Enhanced Stability and Properties of Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Copolymers through Engineered Coupled Equilibria
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing an ester by an ether function in the side chain of a chiral benzene1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer (magenta and red disks, resp.) greatly favours its copolymerization with achiral BTA monomers (green disk), due to the minimization of competing species. The resulting supramolecular copolymers exhibit greater stability which translates into better catalytic and rheological properties.







Abstract
Improving the stability of multi&#8208;component and functional assemblies such as supramolecular copolymers without impeding their dynamicity is key for their implementation as innovative materials. Up to now, this has been achieved by a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach, requiring the time&#8208;consuming characterization of a series of supramolecular coassemblies. We report herein that this is possible to significantly enhance the stability of supramolecular copolymers by a minimal change in the chemical nature of one of the interacting monomers. This is achieved by replacing an ester function by an ether function in the structure of a chiral benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer, used as &#8220;sergeant&#8221;, coassembled with achiral monomers, the &#8220;soldiers&#8221;. Pseudo&#8208;phase diagrams, constructed by probing the nature of the coassemblies with multifarious analytical techniques, confirm that the greater stability of the resulting copolymers is mainly due to the minimization of competing species. This leads to better rheological and catalytic properties of the corresponding supramolecular copolymers. Favouring coassembly over undesired assembly pathways must be considered as a blueprint for the development of better&#8208;performing supramolecular multi&#8208;component systems.

         <title>Cascade Reaction Enables Heterointerfaces&#8208;Enriched Nanoarrays for Ampere&#8208;Level Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts with superior catalytic activity and stability is essential for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Heterostructure nanoarrays are promising candidates, though achieving both high activity and stability simultaneously, especially under high current densities, remains challenging. To this end, we have developed a cascade reaction process that constructs a series of heterostructure nanoarrays with rich heterointerfaces. This process involves treating nickel foam (NF) with molten KSCN and transition metal salts. Initially, NF reacts with KSCN to form Ni9S8 nanoarrays and S2&#8208; ions, which are subsequently captured by transition metal ions to form sulfides that are directly integrated onto the nanoarrays, resulting in abundant heterointerfaces. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that these rich heterointerfaces significantly enhance the interfacial interaction between Ni9S8 and RuS2 within the nanoarrays (termed RH&#8208;Ni9S8/RuS2), markedly improving both the intrinsic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Impressively, the RH&#8208;Ni9S8/RuS2 demonstrates exceptional HER performance, achieving a low overpotential of just 180 mV at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for up to 500 h under such high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions. This innovative approach paves the way for the interfacial design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance catalysts for ampere&#8208;level hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Alcohols Electrooxidation Coupled with Hydrogen Production via Asymmetric Pulse Potential Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic organic oxidation coupled with hydrogen production emerges as a profitable solution to simultaneously reduce overall energy consumption of H2 production and synthetic high&#8208;value chemicals. Noble metal catalysts are highly efficient electrocatalysts in oxidation reactions, but they deactivate easily weakening the benefit in actual production. Herein, we report a universal asymmetric pulse potential strategy to achieve long&#8208;term stable operation&#160;of noble metals for various alcohol oxidation reactions and noble metal catalysts. For example, by pulsed potentials between 0.8 V and 0&#8201;V vs. RHE, palladium (Pd)&#8208;catalyzed glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation can continuously proceed for more than 2800 h with glyceric acid (GLA) selectivity of &gt;70%. Whereas, Pd electrocatalyst becomes nearly deactivated within 6 h of reaction under conventional potentiostatic strategy. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the generated electrophilic OH* from H2O/OH&#8722; oxidation on Pd (denoted as Pd&#8208;OH*) acts as main active species for GLY oxidation. However, Pd&#8208;OH* is prone to be oxidized to PdOx resulting in performance decay. When a short reduction potential (e.g., 0 V vs. RHE for 5 s) is powered, PdOx can be reversibly reduced to restore the current. Moreover, we tested the feasibility of this strategy in a flow electrolyzer, verifying the practical application potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Facilitating Rapid OH&#8208;/H2O Transport in Anion Exchange Membranes via Ultra&#8208;Stable Heteroatom&#8208;free Micropores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient OH&#8208; conduction in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is pivotal for the advancement and industrialization of sustainable electrochemical technologies in alkaline environments, including water electrolysis, fuel cells, and CO2 electroreduction. We here designed AEMs with a novel class of rigid heteroatom&#8208;free micropores (HFMs), engineered at the molecular level to facilitate rapid ionic transport in an ultra&#8208;stable manner. By manipulating monomers, our design strategically controls the torsional angles and energy barriers within the polymeric backbones, creating sub&#8208;nanometer ionic channels that precisely regulate porosity. These hydrophilic micropores significantly enhance the mobility of OH&#8208;/H2O, achieving over a 150% increase in self&#8208;diffusion coefficient compared to commercial AEMs and elevating OH&#8208; conductivity to a leading 215 mS cm&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C. Moreover, the robust carbon&#8208;carbon bond construction in HFMs offers the stability that is four orders of magnitude higher under severe alkaline conditions compared to existing wisdoms, with a demonstrated operational lifespan of over 4000 hours. The integration of HFM&#8208;AEMs into water electrolyzers not only supports the use of platinum group metal&#8208;free catalysts but also exhibits exceptional energy efficiency and extended durability, highlighting their substantial potential for wide&#8208;ranging applications in emerging electrochemical technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrative Molecular Dynamics Simulations Untangle Cross&#8208;Linking Data to Unveil Mitochondrial Protein Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) enables the mapping of protein&#8208;protein interactions on the cellular level. When applied to all compartments of mitochondria, the sheer number of cross&#8208;links and connections can be overwhelming, rendering simple cluster analyses convoluted and uninformative. To address this limitation, we integrate the XL&#8208;MS data, 3D electron microscopy data, and localization annotations with a supra coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulation to sort all data, making clusters more accessible and interpretable. In the context of mitochondria, this method, through a total of 6.9 milliseconds of simulations, successfully identifies known, suggests unknown protein clusters, and reveals the distribution of inner mitochondrial membrane proteins allowing a more precise localization within compartments.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) enables the mapping of protein-protein interactions on the cellular level. When applied to all compartments of mitochondria, the sheer number of cross-links and connections can be overwhelming, rendering simple cluster analyses convoluted and uninformative. To address this limitation, we integrate the XL-MS data, 3D electron microscopy data, and localization annotations with a supra coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation to sort all data, making clusters more accessible and interpretable. In the context of mitochondria, this method, through a total of 6.9 milliseconds of simulations, successfully identifies known, suggests unknown protein clusters, and reveals the distribution of inner mitochondrial membrane proteins allowing a more precise localization within compartments. Our integrative approach suggests, that two so-far ambigiously placed proteins FAM162A and TMEM126A are localized in the cristae, which is validated through super resolution microscopy. Together, this demonstrates the strong potential of the presented approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cell&#8208;Specific Control of Mammalian Gene Expression Using DNA Repair Inducible Ribozyme Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to control gene expression is vital for elucidating gene functions and developing next&#8208;generation therapeutics. Current techniques are challenged by the lack of cell&#8208;specific control designs or immunogenicity risk from foreign proteins. We develop a DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch that enables cell&#8208;specific control of gene expression in cells and in vivo. This strategy designs plasmids with a DNA lesion (8&#8208;oxoG and O6&#8208;MeG) site&#8208;specifically installed within the ribozyme encoding region, generating active hammerhead ribozyme for mRNA degradation due to transcriptional mutagenesis, whereas DNA repair yields a single&#8208;base mismatch in the ribozyme to abrogate its activity. This strategy is demonstrated to allow specific control of gene expression in cancer cells with overexpressed DNA repair enzymes such as MutY DNA glycosylase and O6&#8208;methylguanine&#8208;DNA&#8208;methyltransferases. It also shows the capability of conditionally regulating the expression of different proteins for signal reporting and gene editing, enabling DNA repair monitoring and targeted gene therapy in cancer cells. This strategy is demonstrated using the inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system for in vivo editing of oncogenic Polo&#8208;like kinase 1 in a mouse model, resulting in significant tumor growth suppression. The DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch may provide a compact system for cell&#8208;specific gene expression control toward precise gene therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterochiral Self&#8208;Discrimination Driven Dimerization of Polynuclear Gold(I)&#8208;Sulfido Complexes with Enhanced Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decanuclear chiral gold(I) sulfido clusters (SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10) have been assembled by taking advantage of the judiciously selected SDP ligands (SDP = 7,7&#8217;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;spirobiindane). Interestingly, an achiral heterodimer icosanuclear meso&#8208;cluster (mesoSDP&#8208;Au20) has been obtained by simply mixing SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10 in a 1:1 ratio. These gold(I) complexes have been found to display intense near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence with an emission maximum at around 750 nm in the solid state. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of mesoSDP&#8208;Au20 in drop&#8208;cast solid&#8208;state thin film has been found to show a significant enhancement from 8% in the SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10&#160;to 25%. In addition, the dimerization process with heterochiral self&#8208;discrimination has been found to be sensitive to the solvent polarity and configuration of the diphosphine ligand. This work has provided a platform for the investigation and mechanistic understanding of heterochiral self&#8208;sorting and assembly processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascading Water Activation and Interfacial Lattice Oxygen over Nanocluster CuOx&#8208;modified MnO2 for&#160;Electrocatalytic Propylene Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct electrooxidation of propylene using water&#8208;oxidation intermediates represents a promising route for propylene glycol production. Unfortunately, this economic and environmentally friendly process suffers from low yield and poor Faradaic efficiency resulting from the mismatched oxidative capacity of reactive oxygen species and pronounced side reactions. Herein, we developed an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based nanocluster CuOx&#8208;modified MnO2 catalyst for the efficient electrooxidation of propylene into propylene glycol, achieving a remarkable production rate of 63.0 g/m2/h and 95% Faradaic efficiency at 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated water activation on CuOx&#8208;MnO2 in synergy with the activated interfacial lattice oxygen drove the propylene oxidation to a novel *OOH pathway rather than the traditional *OH route. Additionally, the interfacial interactions intensified the propylene adsorption and polarization for its activation. This work offers new insights into the mechanism of electrocatalytic propylene oxidation and presents great opportunities for the synthesis of commercial chemicals based on earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts and renewable electricity&#8208;driven route.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Active Molybdenum Carbide Catalyst with Dynamic Carbon Flux for Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum carbide has been reported as an efficient and stable catalyst for reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction. The convention understanding of the mechanism suggests domination of the surface phenomena, with only surface or subsurface layers partaking in the catalytic cycle. In this study, we presented a highly active MoC catalyst from carburization process, which showed a mass&#8208;specific reaction rate over 260 [[EQUATION]] with dynamic carbon flux in the bulk phase of the catalyst. Through Isotopic Temperature&#8208;Programmed Reaction (ITPR) analysis and Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy (ETEM), we discerned dynamic carbon flow circulating between the &#945;&#8208;MoC bulk phase and the gas phase reactants under the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction atmosphere. This circulation, essential to maintaining the structural stability of the metastable &#945;&#8208;MoC and its ultra&#8208;high reactivity, is accompanied by thorough carbon component exchange among the bulk, the surface and the gas&#8208;phase reactants during the reaction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordinative Self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;Electron Magnetic Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Electron magnetic compounds on surfaces have emerged as a powerful platform to interrogate spin interactions at the atomic scale, with great potential in spintronics and quantum technologies. A key challenge is organizing these compounds over large length scales, while elucidating their resulting magnetic properties. Herein, we offer a relevant contribution toward this objective, which consists of using on&#8208;surface synthesis coupled with coordination chemistry to promote the self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;electron magnetic porphyrin species. A porphyrin precursor equipped with carbonitrile moieties in a trans arrangement was prepared by solution synthesis and deposited on a Au(111)/mica. Depending on the specific growth protocol, surface&#8208;promoted reactions led to the transformation of the precursor into non&#8208;magnetic Au&#8208;CN coordinated porphyrin monomers, covalent porphyrin dimers, and one&#8208;dimensional porphyrin polymers (based on porphyrin monomers or covalent porphyrin dimers), as revealed by scanning probe microscopy studies combined with theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the scanning tunneling microscopy tip could convert such closed&#8208;shell porphyrin units into open&#8208;shell species by the removal of some peripheral hydrogen atoms. The magnetic features (i.e., singlet or triplet ground state) of the porphyrin units comprising the polymers were investigated for polymers of different lengths. No magnetic exchange coupling between adjacent units was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Magnetic Moments in Manganese&#8208;Doped (CdSe)13 Nanoclusters: Role of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the enhancement in magnetic and photoluminescence properties of Mn2+&#8208;doped (CdSe)13 nanoclusters, significantly influenced by the introduction of paramagnetic centers through doping, facilitated by optimized precursor chemistry and precisely controlled surface ligand interactions. Using a cost&#8208;effective and scalable synthesis approach with elemental Se and NaBH4 (Se&#8208;NaBH4) in n&#8208;octylamine, we tailored bonding configurations (Cd&#8208;O, Cd&#8208;N, and Cd&#8208;Se) on the surface of nanoclusters, as confirmed by EXAFS analysis. These bonding configurations allowed for tunable Mn2+&#8208;doping with tetrahedral coordination, further stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonded acetate ligands, as evidenced by 13C NMR and IR spectroscopy. Mulliken charge analysis indicates that the charge redistribution on Se2&#8208; suggests electron transfer between surface ligands and the nanocluster, contributing to spin fluctuations. These tailored configurations markedly increased the nanoclusters' magnetic susceptibility and photoluminescence efficiency. The resulting nanoclusters demonstrated a clear concentration&#8208;dependent response in emission lifetimes and intensities upon exposure to magnetic field effects (MFE) and spin&#8208;spin coupling, alongside a large magnetic moment exceeding 40 &#956;B at 180K. These findings highlight the potential of these nanoclusters for magneto&#8208;optical devices and spintronic applications, showcasing their tunable magnetic properties and exciton dynamics.</dc:description>

The resulting nanoclusters demonstrated a clear concentration-dependent response in emission lifetimes and intensities upon exposure to magnetic field effects (MFE) and spin-spin coupling, alongside a large magnetic moment exceeding 40 &#956;B at 180K. These findings highlight the potential of these nanoclusters for magneto-optical devices and spintronic applications, showcasing their tunable magnetic properties and exciton dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
