      <title>Singlet&#8208;contrast magnetic resonance imaging: unlocking hyperpolarization with metabolism</title>
      <dc:description>Hyperpolarization&#8208;enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can be used to study biomolecular processes in the body, but typically requires nuclei such as  13  C,  15  N, or  129  Xe due to their long spin&#8209;polarization lifetimes and the absence of a proton&#8209;background signal from water and fat in the images. Here we present a novel type of  1  H imaging, in which hyperpolarized spin order is locked in a nonmagnetic long&#8208;lived correlated (singlet) state, and is only liberated for imaging by a specific biochemical reaction. In this work we produce hyperpolarized fumarate via chemical reaction of a precursor molecule with  para  &#8208;enriched hydrogen gas, and the proton singlet order in fumarate is released as antiphase NMR signals by enzymatic conversion to malate in D  2  O. Using this model system we show two pulse sequences to rephase the NMR signals for imaging and suppress the background signals from water. The hyperpolarization&#8208;enhanced  1  H&#8209;imaging modality presented here can allow for hyperpolarized imaging without the need for low&#8209;abundance, low&#8209;sensitivity heteronuclei.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemically Fueled Volume Phase Transition of Polyacid Microgels</title>
      <dc:description>Microgels are soft colloids that show responsive behavior and are easy to functionalize for applications.

      <title>Unveiling the Hydration Structure of Ferrihydrite for Hole Storage in Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Ferrihydrite (Fh) has been demonstrated acting as a hole&#8208;storage layer (HSL) in photoelectrocatalysis system. However, the intrinsic structure responsible for the hole storage function for Fh remains unclear. Herein, by elaborately dehydrating the Fh via a careful calcination, the essential relation between the HSL function and the structure evolution of Fh material is unraveled. It is found that the irreversible and gradual loss of crystal water molecules in Fh leads to the weakening of the HSL function, accompanied with the arrangement of inner structure units. A structure evolution of the dehydration process is proposed and the primary active structure of Fh for HSL is identified as the [FeO  6  ] polyhedral units bonding with two or three molecules of crystal water. With the successive loss of chemical crystal water, the coordination symmetry of [FeO  6  ] hydration units undergoes mutation and a more ordered structure is formed, causing the difficulty for accepting photogenerated holes as a consequence. This work unravels the relation between the hydration structure of Fh material and its hole storage capacity.</dc:description>

      <title>Nanoscale amperometry reveals only a fraction of vesicular serotonin content is released during exocytosis from beta cells</title>
      <dc:description>Recent work has shown that chemical release during the fundamental cellular process of exocytosis in model cell lines is not all or none. We tested this theory for vesicular release from single pancreatic beta cells. The vesicles in these cells release insulin, but also serotonin, which is detectible with amperometric methods. Traditionally, it is assumed that exocytosis in beta cells is all&#8208;or&#8208;none. Here we use a multidisciplinary approach involving nanoscale amperometric chemical methods to explore the chemical nature of insulin exocytosis. We amperometrically quantified the number of serotonin molecules stored inside of individual nanoscale vesicles (39317 &#177; 1611) in the cell cytoplasm before exocytosis and the number of serotonin molecules released from single cells (13310 &#177; 1127) for each stimulated exocytosis event. Thus, beta cells release only one&#8208;third of their granule content, clearly supporting partial release in this system. We discuss these observations in the context of type&#8208;2 diabetes.</dc:description>

However, synthetic protocols and experimental strategies to directly probe chemical bonding in modified surfaces are scarce. Introduced here is a mild, surface&#8208;specific protocol for the surface functionalization of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus nanosheets using a family of photolytically generated nitrenes (RN) from the corresponding azides.

      <title>Cooperative Stapling of Native Peptides at Lysine and Tyrosine or Arginine with Formaldehyde</title>
      <dc:description>Stapling of peptides via intramolecular crosslinking of two neighboring amino acid side chains offers an important tool to modulate the structure and properties of peptides. In comparison to the stapling of artificially engineered peptide substrates, methods for stapling native peptides are more desirable for easier accessibility and genetic encodability. However, the existing strategy for selectivity control in the stapling of native peptides is relatively limited: the site of anchoring is often dominated by Cys, and the means for achieving the position selectivity among the same type of residues at different locations is lacking. We have developed a simple and powerful strategy for stapling native peptides at lysine residues with formaldehyde via the cooperation of nearby tyrosine or arginine residues. The stapling reactions can proceed with high efficiency and residue selectivity under mild conditions, and generate linchpins with distinct physiochemical properties. The new method for peptide stapling enables unique control of position&#8208;selectivity for substrates bearing multiple reaction sites via reactivity that can be readily built in the peptide sequence.</dc:description>

      <title>A Broad&#8208;Spectrum, Catalytic Amidation of Sulfonyl Fluorides and Fluorosulfates</title>
      <dc:description>A broad&#8208;spectrum, catalytic method has been developed for the synthesis of sulfonamides and sulfamates. With the activation by the combination of a catalytic amount of 1&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and silicon additives, amidations of sulfonyl fluorides and fluorosulfates proceeded smoothly and excellent yields were generally obtained (87%&#8208;99%). Noticeably, this protocol is particularly efficient for sterically hindered substrates. Catalyst loading is generally low and only 0.02 mol% of catalyst is required for the multidecagram&#8208;scale synthesis of an amantadine derivative. In addition, the potential of this method in medicinal chemistry has been demonstrated by the synthesis of the marketed drug Fedratinib via a key intermediate sulfonyl fluoride  13  . Since a large number of amines are commercially available, this route provides a facile entry to access Fedratinib analogues for biological screening.</dc:description>

      <title>Biocatalytic strategy for the highly stereoselective synthesis of CHF2&#8208;containing trisubstituted cyclopropanes</title>
      <dc:description>The difluoromethyl (CHF  2  ) group has attracted significant attention in drug discovery and development efforts, owing to its ability to serve as fluorinated bioisostere of methyl, hydroxyl, and thiol groups. Herein, we report an efficient biocatalytic method for the highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of CHF  2  &#8208;containing trisubstituted cyclopropanes. Using engineered myoglobin catalysts, a broad range of &#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl alkenes are cyclopropanated in the presence of ethyl diazoacetate to give CHF  2  &#8208;containing cyclopropanes in high yield (up to &gt;99%, up to 3,000 TON) and with excellent stereoselectivity (up to &gt;99% de and ee). By means of an enantiodivergent myoglobin variant, the opposite enantiomer of the cyclopropane product was also obtained. This methodology represents a powerful strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of high&#8208;value fluorinated building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as exemplified through the formal total synthesis of a CHF  2  isostere of a TRPV1 inhibitor.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We report a new family of hexa&#8208;  peri  &#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;based helical nanographenes incorporating &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes bearing an octagonal carbocycle.

This novel chiral motif, namely,  oct&#8208;[5]helicene  results in the largest torsion angle recorded so far for a carbo[5]helicene (&#952; = 79.5&#186;), as it has been suggested by DFT&#8208;calculations and confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Consequently, the barriers of isomerization become exceptionally high for a [5]helicene unsubstituted in the fjord region since neither racemization nor decomposition were observed at 200 &#186;C for  1  or  3  &#160;during 5 h. Therefore, racemic resolutions allowed subsequent chiroptical studies showing the ECD and CPL responses of this novel family of chiral nanographenes.</dc:description>

      <title>Enriching Structural Diversity of Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Gold Nanoclusters with Chlorides</title>
      <dc:description>This work describes the synthesis and isolation of alkynyl/chloride&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters. Silica gel column chromatography works effectively in isolating gold nanoclusters from the as&#8208;synthesized cluster mixture to give three clusters Na[Au 25  L 18  ] ( Au 25  ), [HNEt 3  ] 3  [Au 67  L 32  Cl 4  ] ( Au 67  ), [HNEt 3  ] 4  [Au 106  L 40  Cl 12  ] ( Au 106  ), where L = 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenylacetylide. Au 67  and Au 106  are new clusters and their total structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction. Au 67  contains a distorted Au 18  Marks decahedron shelled by an irregular Au 32  and further protected with two V&#8208;shaped Au 2  L 3  , 13 linear AuL 2  staples and four chlorides.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work describes the synthesis and isolation of alkynyl/chloride&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters. Silica gel column chromatography works effectively in isolating gold nanoclusters from the as&#8208;synthesized cluster mixture to give three clusters Na[Au 25  L 18  ] ( Au 25  ), [HNEt 3  ] 3  [Au 67  L 32  Cl 4  ] ( Au 67  ), [HNEt 3  ] 4  [Au 106  L 40  Cl 12  ] ( Au 106  ), where L = 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenylacetylide. Au 67  and Au 106  are new clusters and their total structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction. Au 67  contains a distorted Au 18  Marks decahedron shelled by an irregular Au 32  and further protected with two V&#8208;shaped Au 2  L 3  , 13 linear AuL 2  staples and four chlorides. Au 67  is the first structurally determined 34e superatomic gold nanocluster. Au 106  is composed of 106 Au atoms co&#8208;protected by alkynyls and chlorides. It has a Au 79  kernel, which is the same as that in Au 102  ( p  &#8208;MBA) 44  .

      <title>Multimodal Imaging of Autofluorescent Sites Reveals Varied Chemical Speciation in SSZ&#8208;13 Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>A multimodal imaging study of chabazite is used to show the distribution of and discriminate between different emissive deposits arising as a result of the detemplation process. 3D confocal imaging, fluorescence lifetime imaging, spectral imaging, and Raman mapping are used to show three different types of emissive behaviours each characterised by different spatial distributions, trends in lifetime, spectral signals, and Raman signatures. A notable difference is seen in the morphology of agglomerated surface deposits and larger subsurface deposits, which experience lifetime augmentation due to spatial confinement. The distribution of organic residue throughout the crystal volume is comparable to XRF mapping that shows Si enrichment on the outer edges and higher Al content through the centre, demonstrating that a fluorescence&#8208;based technique can also be used to indirectly comment on the compositional chemistry of the inorganic framework.</dc:description>

      <title>Photochemical Electrocyclization of Poly(phenylacetylene)s: Unwinding Helices to Elucidate their 3D&#8208;Structure in Solution</title>
      <dc:description>Photochemical electrocyclization of poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is presented as a new tool for the structural elucidation of a polyene backbone, where important structural information such as w1 can be obtained. This new methodology allows not only the classification of PPAs in cis&#8208;cisoidal (&#969;1&lt; 90&#176;) or cis&#8208;transoidal structures (&#969;1&gt; 90&#176;), but also to obtain the approximate value of &#969;1, a crucial helical parameter. The process involves the irradiating a dilute PPA solution with visible light and monitoring the photochemical electrocyclization of the PPA helix by measuring the ECD spectra at different times. Thus, PPAs with a cis&#8208;cisoidal structure show a reduction of the ECD signal of at least 50% before 30 min of irradiation, while cis&#8208;transoidal helices need much longer time because the transoidal bond must be isomerized to cisoidal before the photochemical electrocyclization of the helix takes place. Moreover, the different cis&#8208;cisoidal and cis&#8208;transoidal helices require different times to decrease their ECD signal by 50% (t1/2), depending on the degree of compression or stretching of the helix, a fact that allows establishing a relationship between the secondary structure adopted by the PPA (&#969;1) and the time required to lose the ECD vinylic signal by light irradiation. This process also permits the detection and identification of different helical scaffolds that can coexist in some solutions of the polymers.</dc:description>

      <title>Two Dimensional Porous Molybdenum Phosphide/Nitride Heterojunction Nanosheets for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The morphology and heterojunction engineering of Mo&#8208;based catalysts are intensively pursued for effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but it remains a challenge to achieve the two targets simultaneously. Herein, we show a new strategy toward the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets based on the pyrolysis of 2D [PMo12O40]3&#8203;&#8208;  &#8208;melamine (PMo12&#8208;MA) nanosheet precursor from a polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;mediated assembly route. The heterostructure nanosheets is about 20 nm thick and has plentiful pores (&lt; 5 nm). These structure features offer several advantages to promote the HER activity, including the favourable water dissociation kinetics around heterojunction as confirmed by theoretical calculations, large accessible surface of 2D nanosheets and enhanced mass&#8208;transport ability by pores. Consequently, the 2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets exhibits excellent HER activity with low overpotentials of 89, 91 and 89 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2  in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes, respectively. In particular, its HER performance is superior to the commercial Pt/C at a current density &gt; 55 mA cm&#8208;2  in neutral medium and &gt;190 mA cm&#8208;2  in alkaline medium.

      <title>Cocrystal Engineering: toward Solution&#8208;Processed Near&#8208;Infrared 2D Organic Cocrystals for Broadband Photodetection</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) cocrystals open a new way to get 2D functional materials via  crystal engineering instead of molecular engineering. Here, large&#8208;area 2D cocrystals with length reaching several millimeters with strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption have been successfully designed and prepared. Driven by the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (donor) and C 60  (acceptor) self&#8208;assemble into a NIR cocrystals with absorption wavelength up to 1080 nm. By tailoring the growth solvents and processes, the cocrystal morphologies can be tuned from 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets to large&#8208;area 2D cocrystal films with length reaching several millimeters. Impressively, due to the highly ordered donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement, the CT absorption in the 2D cocrystals is significantly enhanced and becomes comparable to singlet absorption. The uniform 2D cocrystals, with enhanced CT absorption in the NIR region, displays a high responsivity of 2424 mA/W to NIR light and a fast response time of 0.6 s. The excellent device performance can be attributed to the generation of long&#8208;lived free charge carriers as revealed by transient absorption spectroscopy and the optimization of device configuration. This work shows an example of controlled growth of 2D cocrystals for broadband photodetectors, which reveals the brilliant future of cocrystal films for high&#8208;performance electronics and paves their way towards large&#8208;scale, integrated, flexible, practical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Long&#8208;range Exciton Migration in Coassemblies: Achieving High Photostability without Disrupting the Electron Donating of Fluorene Oligomers</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, photostable coassemblies from a nonphotostable fluorene oligomer (the energy donor) and a photostable oligomer (the energy acceptor) are fabricated. Long&#8208;range exciton migration over a net distance of about 370 energy donor molecules to energy acceptor is demonstrated in such coassemblies. The fast and long energy migration allows for the harvesting of the excitation energy of energy donors by embedding a small number of energy acceptors for photostability enhancement. Importantly, embedding a small number of energy acceptors in coassemblies causes a negligible negative influence on the electron donating of energy donors that are desired in practical applications. The advantages of coassemblies fabricated in this concept, i.e., high photostability without disrupting the electron donating of energy donors, are well illustrated in fluorescence detection of trace explosives where prolonged working life and improved detection capacity are achieved.</dc:description>

      <title>Scan and Unlock: A programmable DNA molecular automaton for cell&#8208;selective activation of ligand&#8208;based signaling</title>
      <dc:description>Selective modulation of ligand&#8208;receptor interaction is essential in targeted therapy. Current approaches have a limited capacity to engineer a protein&#8208;ligand with cell&#8208;selectivity to overcome its pleiotropic function and potential off&#8208;target toxicities. In this study, we aimed at designing an intelligent &#8220;Scan and Unlock&#8221; DNA automaton (SUDA) system to equip a native protein&#8208;ligand with cell&#8208;identity recognition and receptor&#8208;mediated signaling in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. Using embedded DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction networks (CRNs) on the cell surface, SUDA scans and evaluates molecular profiles of cell&#8208;surface proteins via the Boolean logic circuits. Therefore, it achieves cell&#8208;specific signal modulation by quickly unlocking protein&#8208;ligand in proximity to the target cell&#8208;surface to activate its cognate receptor. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we non&#8208;genetically engineered hepatic growth factor (HGF) with distinct logic SUDAs to elicit target cell&#8208;specific HGF signaling and wound healing behaviors in multiple heterogeneous cell types. Furthermore, the versatility of the SUDA strategy was shown by engineering tumor necrotic factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;) to induce programmed cell death of target cell subpopulations through cell&#8208;specific modulation of TNFR1 signaling. The SUDA strategy is a powerful and versatile approach for engineering a designated ligand that is capable of precise cell&#8208;identification for cell&#8208;specific signaling and cellular behaviors toward low&#8208;side&#8208;effect therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Donor/Acceptor Pair Created by Electrostatic Interaction: Design, Synthesis, and Investigation on Exciplex Formed within the Pair</title>
      <dc:description>Exciplex formed between donor and acceptor has been widely explored, but isolating it from each other and tuning of interaction between the donor and acceptor have remained challenges. Here we report pairs of carbazole&#8208;based anionic donor and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;based cationic acceptor, which are bound together by electrostatic interaction, and the exciplex formed in the pair. In diluted film, the  donor/acceptor (D/A) pair  affords isolated exciplex with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). By changing the anchoring position of imidazolium cation in the cationic acceptor, the interaction between the donor and acceptor can be changed. Compared to conventional exciplex formed in neat film, the isolated exciplex exhibits a substantially higher luminescent efficiency. The D/A pairs show intriguing mechanochromic luminescence and mechanical grinding&#8208;induced/reinforced TADF in solid&#8208;state and promising performances as emitters in light&#8208;emitting devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Pillared Ultramicroporous Carbon Nanoplates for Selective Separation of CH4/N2</title>
      <dc:description>There is growing evidence that pillaring up a densely packed ultramicroporous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure is an effective strategy to reduce their internal diffusion. Reliable pillaring paradigms, however, is rather challenging. Here we report a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component sequential assembly method  for the preparation of a new self&#8208;pillared 2D polymer and ultramicroporous carbon with integrated surface protrusions. The molecular level pillaring process is surprisingly fast, i.e., in 10 min. The thickness of nanoplate edge and the density (roughness), angle as well as height of protrusions can be precisely tuned. Exemplified in coal bed methane purification/separation, this unique pillared 2D carbons exhibit a CH 4  /N 2  selectivity up to 24 at a low CH 4  partial pressure and two orders of magnitude faster CH 4  diffusion kinetics than the commercial carbon molecular sieves. This solution synthesis methodology is generalizable for creation and fine tuning of pillared 2D heterostructures.</dc:description>

      <title>Alloying Nickel with Molybdenum Significantly Accelerates Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysis (hydrogen oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions) in alkaline solution is desirable but challenging. Among all available electrocatalysts, Ni&#8208;based materials are the only non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based candidates for alkaline hydrogen oxidation, but are generally suffered from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that properly alloying Ni with Mo could significantly promote its electrocatalytic performance. Ni  4  Mo alloy nanoparticles are prepared from the reduction of molybdate&#8208;intercalated Ni(OH)  2  nanosheets. The final product exhibits apparent hydrogen oxidation activity exceeding that of the Pt benchmark and record&#8208;high mass&#8208;specific kinetic current of 79 A g  &#8208;1  at the overpotential of 50 mV. Superior hydrogen evolution performance is also measured in alkaline solution. These experimental data are rationalized by our theoretical simulations, which show that alloying Ni with Mo significantly weakens its hydrogen adsorption, improves the hydroxyl adsorption and decreases the reaction barrier for water formation.</dc:description>

Here, we demonstrate that properly alloying Ni with Mo could significantly promote its electrocatalytic performance. Ni  4  Mo alloy nanoparticles are prepared from the reduction of molybdate&#8208;intercalated Ni(OH)  2  nanosheets. The final product exhibits apparent hydrogen oxidation activity exceeding that of the Pt benchmark and record&#8208;high mass&#8208;specific kinetic current of 79 A g  &#8208;1  at the overpotential of 50 mV. Superior hydrogen evolution performance is also measured in alkaline solution. These experimental data are rationalized by our theoretical simulations, which show that alloying Ni with Mo significantly weakens its hydrogen adsorption, improves the hydroxyl adsorption and decreases the reaction barrier for water formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>We here describe, model, and predict the growth kinetics of amine&#8208;capped PbS colloidal nanoparticles in the absence of supersaturation. The particles grow by coalescence rather than by Ostwald ripening. A comparison of different models indicates that the effective activation energy of coalescence (67.65 kJ&#183;mol  &#8208;1  ) is associated with two terms: a term proportional to the contact area between the ligand shells of two colliding particles, and a constant term. Our Brownian dynamics simulations show (i) how the remarkably low activation energy (or large rate constants) are most likely due to the large difference in size between the particles and their mean free path of diffusion, and (ii) how the low polydispersity is the likely result of the suppression of collision rates between rare populations due to crowding. The model successfully predicts the growth kinetics of nanoparticles, therefore enabling the precise control of the average particle size without the need of supersaturation.</dc:description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Verification of Adsorbed Hydroxyl Intermediate in the Bifunctional Mechanism of Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Elucidating hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) mechanisms in alkaline conditions is vital for understanding and improving the efficiency of anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). However, uncertainty remains around the alkaline HOR mechanism due to a lack of direct  in situ  evidence of the reaction intermediates. Herein,  in situ  electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to study HOR processes on both PtNi alloy and pure Pt surfaces. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that adsorbed hydroxyl species (OH  ad  ) were directly involved in HOR processes in alkaline conditions on the PtNi alloy surface. However, OH  ad  species were not observed on the surface of pure Pt during the HOR. We show that Ni doping promoted hydroxyl adsorption on the Pt&#8208;alloy catalytic surface, improving the HOR activity. DFT calculations also suggest that the free energy was decreased by hydroxyl adsorption. Thus, we provide direct evidence of the presence of the OH  ad  intermediate species on an oxophilic metal surface during the HOR and deduce its important role in improving the HOR activity and rate. Consequently, tuning OH adsorption by designing bifunctional catalysts is an efficient method for promoting HOR activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Prebiotic Peptide Synthesis and Spontaneous Amyloid Formation Inside a Proto&#8208;Cellular Compartment</title>
      <dc:description>Cellular life requires a high degree of molecular complexity and self&#8208;organization, some of which must have originated in a prebiotic context. Here, we demonstrate how both of these features can emerge in a plausibly prebiotic system. We found that chemical gradients in simple mixtures of activated amino acids and fatty acids can lead to the formation of amyloid&#8208;like peptide fibrils that are localized inside of a proto&#8208;cellular compartment. In this process, the fatty acid or lipid vesicles act both as a filter, allowing the selective passage of activated amino acids, and as a barrier, blocking the diffusion of the amyloidogenic peptides that form spontaneously inside the vesicles. This synergy between two distinct building blocks of life induces a significant increase in molecular complexity and spatial order thereby providing a route for the early molecular evolution that could give rise to a living cell.</dc:description>

      <title>Prebiotic Phosphorylation and Concomitant Oligomerization of Deoxynucleosides to form DNA</title>
      <dc:description>Recent demonstrations of RNA&#8208;DNA chimeras enabling RNA and DNA replication, coupled with prebiotic co&#8208;synthesis of deoxyribo&#8208; and ribo&#8208;nucleotides, have resurrected the hypothesis of co&#8208;emergence of RNA and DNA. As further support, we show that diamidophosphate (DAP) with 2&#8208;aminoimidazole (amido)phosphorylates and oligomerizes deoxynucleosides to form DNA &#8211; under conditions similar to those of ribonucleosides. The pyrimidine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;amidophosphates are formed in good (&#8776; 60%) yields. Intriguingly, the presence of pyrimidine nucleos(t)ides increased the yields of purine&#8208;deoxynucleotides (&#8776; 20%). Concomitantly, oligomerization (&#8776; 18&#8208;31%) is observed with predominantly 3',5'&#8208;phosphodiester DNA linkages, and some (&lt;5%) pyrophosphates. Combined with previous observations of DAP mediated chemistries and the constructive role of RDNA chimeras, the results reported here help set the stage for systematic investigation of a systems chemistry approach of RNA&#8208;DNA coevolution.</dc:description>

      <title>Identifying the Critical Anion&#8722;Cation Coordination to Regulate Electric Double Layer for Efficient Lithium Metal Anode Interface</title>
      <dc:description>The persistent efforts to reveal the formation and evolution mechanisms of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are of fundamental significance for the rational regulation. In this work, through combined theoretical and experimental model investigations, we elucidate that the electric double layer (EDL) chemistry at the electrode/electrolyte interface instead of the thermodynamic stability of electrolyte components predominately controls the competitive reduction reactions during SEI construction on Li metal anode. Specifically, the negatively&#8208;charged surface of Li metal will prompt substantial cation enrichment and anion deficiency within the EDL. Necessarily, only the species participating in the solvation shell of cations could be electrostatically accumulated in proximity of Li metal surface and thereafter be preferentially reduced during sustained dynamic cycling. Incorporating multi&#8208;valent cation additives to more effectively drag the favorable anionic SEI enablers into EDL is validated as a promising strategy to upgrade the Li protection performance. The conclusions drawn herein afford deeper understandings to bridge the EDL principle, cation solvation, and SEI formation, shedding fresh light on the targeted regulation of reactive alkali metal interfaces.</dc:description>

      <title>Assembly of the mitochondrial Complex I assembly complex suggests a regulatory role for deflavination</title>
      <dc:description>Fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are mitochondrial redox processes that generate ATP. The biogenesis of the respiratory Complex I, a 1 MDa multiprotein complex that is responsible for initiating OXPHOS, is mediated by assembly factors including the mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex. However, the organisation and the role of the MCIA complex are still unclear. Here we show that ECSIT functions as the bridging node of the MCIA core complex. Furthermore, cryo&#8208;electron microscopy together with biochemical and biophysical experiments reveal that the C&#8208;terminal domain of ECSIT directly binds to the vestigial dehydrogenase domain of the FAO enzyme ACAD9 and induces its deflavination, switching ACAD9 from its role in FAO to an MCIA factor. These findings provide the structural basis for the MCIA complex architecture and suggest a unique molecular mechanism for coordinating the regulation of the FAO and OXPHOS pathways to ensure an efficient energy production.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology offers a versatile toolbox for precise spatial and temporal manipulation of matter on the nanoscale. However, rendering DNA&#8208;based systems responsive to light has remained challenging. Here, we describe the remote&#160;manipulation of native (non&#8208;photoresponsive) chiral plasmonic molecules (CPMs) using light. Our strategy is based on the use of a photoresponsive medium comprising a merocyanine&#8208;based photoacid. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium decreases its pH, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links, leading to a spatial reconfiguration of the CPMs. The process can be reversed simply by turning the light off and it can be repeated for multiple cycles. The degree of the overall chirality change in an ensemble of CPMs depends on the CPM fraction undergoing reconfiguration, which, remarkably, depends on and can be tuned by the intensity of incident light. Such a dynamic remotely controlled system could aid in further advancing DNA&#8208;based devices and nanomaterials.</dc:description>

Upon exposure to visible light, the medium decreases its pH, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links, leading to a spatial reconfiguration of the CPMs. The process can be reversed simply by turning the light off and it can be repeated for multiple cycles. The degree of the overall chirality change in an ensemble of CPMs depends on the CPM fraction undergoing reconfiguration, which, remarkably, depends on and can be tuned by the intensity of incident light. Such a dynamic remotely controlled system could aid in further advancing DNA&#8208;based devices and nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Rational Fabrication of Crystalline Smart Materials for Rapid Detection and Efficient Removal of Ozone</title>
      <dc:description>Traditional ozone sensing and removal materials still suffer from high energy consumption and low efficiency. Thus, seeking new ozone&#8208;responsive materials with high efficiency and broad working conditions is of great significance. In this contribution, we first developed covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for smart sensing and efficient removal of ozone. Notably, imine&#8208;based COFs possess dramatically fast optical responses (&lt;1 s) to ozone as low as 0.1 ppm under broad working conditions (e.g., in the presence or absence of moisture, room temperature). Moreover, we found that imine&#8208;based COFs can also be applied as excellent ozone removers that can efficiently reduce the ozone concentration below the recommended safety limit (&lt;0.1 ppm) for humans. The mechanism for the outstanding performance of imine&#8208;based COFs was in&#8208;depth unveiled by various characterization techniques and analyses. This study not only provides a new type of advanced materials for ozone sensing and removal but also broadens the application scope of COFs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>NH4+  ions as charge carriers show great potential in aqueous rechargeable batteries. Herein, we study for the first time the NH4+  storage chemistry in electrodeposited manganese oxide (MnOx). MnOx  experiences morphology and phase transformation during charge/discharge in diluted ammonium acetate (NH 4Ac) electrolyte. The NH4Ac concentration plays an important role in NH4+  storage inside MnOx.

Experimental results suggest a solid&#8208;solution behavior associated with NH4+  migration in layered MnOx. Spectroscopy studies and theoretical calculations indicate that the reversible NH4+  insertion/deinsertion is accompanied by H bond formation/breaking between NH4+  and the MnOx  layers.

      <title>Structural Characterization of Two CO Molecules Bound to the Nitrogenase Active Site</title>
      <dc:description>As an approach towards unraveling the nitrogenase mechanism, we have studied the binding of CO to the active site FeMo&#8208;cofactor. CO is not only an inhibitor of nitrogenase, but it is also a substrate, undergoing reduction to hydrocarbons (Fischer&#8208;Tropsch&#8208;type chemistry). The C&#8208;C bond forming capabilities of nitrogenase suggest that multiple CO, or CO&#8208;derived ligands, bind to the active site. Herein, we report a crystal structure with two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo&#8208;cofactor of the molybdenum nitrogenase at 1.33 &#197; resolution. In addition to the previously observed bridging CO ligand between Fe2 and Fe6 of the FeMo&#8208;cofactor, a new ligand binding mode is revealed through a second CO ligand coordinated terminally to Fe6. While the relevance of this state to nitrogenase&#8208;catalyzed reactions remains to be established, it highlights the privileged role for Fe2 and Fe6 in ligand binding, with multiple coordination modes available depending on the ligand and reaction conditions.</dc:description>

Anionic borate&#8208;based bi&#8208;mesoionic carbenes based on 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes show unique C&#8722;N isomerization reactions.

The picture shows these complexes, which, although having a similar first coordination sphere, differ in geometry, spin state and reactivity. All of these differences are caused by the control of the second coordination sphere, in which agostic interactions influence the cobalt center.

In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202012623), Andrea Rentmeister and co&#8208;workers engineered SAM synthetases suitable for converting methionine analogs with photo&#8208;cleavable groups and show their compatibility with methyltransferases to provide DNA with a light&#8208;sensitive &#8220;cage&#8221;. Crystal structure analysis reveals how substitutions in the active site led to accommodation of the photo&#8208;cleavable group.

      <title>Reactivity and Mechanisms of Photoactivated Heterometallic [RuIINiII] and [RuIINiIIRuII] Catalysts for Dihydrogen Generation from Water</title>
      <dc:description>Two heterometallic photocatalysts were designed and probed for water reduction. Both [(bpy)  2  Ru  II  Ni  II  (L  1  )](ClO  4  )  2  (  1  ) and [(bpy)  2  Ru  II  Ni  II  (L  2  )  2  Ru  II  (bpy)  2  ](ClO  4  )  2  (  2  ) can generate the low&#8208;valent precursor involved in hydride formation prior to dihydrogen generation. However, while the bimetallic [Ru  II  Ni  II  ] (  1  ) requires the presence of an external photosensitizer to trigger catalytic activity, the trimetallic [Ru  II  Ni  II  Ru  II  ] (  2  ) displays significant coupling between the catalytic and light&#8208;harvesting units to promote intramolecular multielectron transfer and perform photocatalysis at the Ni center. A concerted experimental and theoretical effort proposes mechanisms to explain why  1  is unable to achieve self&#8208;supported catalysis, while  2  is fully photocatalytic.</dc:description>

      <title>NiSn Atomic Pair on Integrated Electrode for Synergistic Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical CO  2  reduction (CO  2  RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals offers an efficient way to mitigate global warming and energy supply issues. However, the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO  2  RR to boost reaction efficiency and guide understanding of catalytic mechanism remains a huge challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a NiSn atomic pair electrocatalyst (NiSn&#8208;APC) on a hierarchical integrated electrode, which exhibits a synergistic effect in simultaneously promoting the activity and selectivity of CO  2  RR to formate. The NiSn atomic pair consist of adjacent Ni and Sn coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (N  4  &#8208;Ni&#8208;Sn&#8208;N  4  ) respectively, which is confirmed by high&#8208;angle annular dark field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Typically, the as&#8208;prepared NiSn&#8208;APC displays an exceptional activity toward CO  2  RR to formate with a turnover frequency of 4752 h  &#8208;1  , a formate productivity of 36.7 mol h  &#8208;1  g  Sn  &#8208;1  and an utilization degree of active sites (57.9%), which are superior to the previously reported single&#8208;atomic catalysts (SACs). Moreover, both in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;infrared (ATR&#8208;IR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculation verify the electron redistribution of Sn imposed by adjacent Ni, which reduces the energy barrier of *OCHO intermediate and makes this potential&#8208;determining step thermodynamically spontaneous. The NiSn synergistic catalysis for CO  2  RR in this work provides a successful paradigm for rational design and preparation of atomic pair electrocatalysts with largely enhanced performance.</dc:description>

This high&#8208;silica (Si/Al = 16) zeolite was synthesized using a pyrazolium&#8208;based dication with a tetramethylene linker as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) in hydroxide media. The PST&#8208;31 structure is built from new building layers containing 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;rings, which are connected by single 4&#8208;rings in the interlayer region to form a two&#8208;dimensional pore system. Its channels consist of [4.5  6  .6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] cavities and are thus delimited by 9&#8208;, 10&#8208;, and 11&#8208;rings. The OSDA cations in as&#8208;synthesized PST&#8208;31 were determined to reside without disorder in the large [4  2  .5  14  .6  4  .7  2  .9  4  ] cavities composed of smaller [4.5  6  .6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] ones, leading to a symmetry coincidence between the OSDA and the surrounding zeolite cavity.

      <title>Novel Series of Mononuclear Aluminum Complexes for High&#8208;Performance Solution&#8208;Processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices</title>
      <dc:description>Light metal complexes, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and aluminum (Al) complexes, are attractive candidates for the fabrication of thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials. Nevertheless, mononuclear Al complexes with delayed fluorescence have not been developed so far. In this study, we successfully developed a novel series of highly luminescent Al complexes with two phenylacridine&#8208;modified asymmetric acetylacetonate&#8208;type ligands. These complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 79% in the solid state with a short delayed fluorescence lifetime of approximately 4 &#956;s. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) using these Al complexes exhibit excellent performance with an external quantum efficiency of 17.5% at 100 cd/m2. This is the best performance in light metal&#8208;based TADF OLEDs reported so far. The results are expected to guide the advancement of the next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lighting technology.</dc:description>

      <title>Piptides: New, Easily Accessible Chemotypes For Interactions&#160;With Biomolecules</title>
      <dc:description>Small molecule probe development is pivotal in biomolecular science. Research described here was undertaken to develop a non&#8208;peptidic chemotype, piptides, that is amenable to convenient, iterative solid&#8208;phase syntheses, and useful in biomolecular probe discovery. Piptides can be made from readily accessible pip acid building blocks and have good proteolytic and pH stabilities. An illustrative application of piptides against a protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) target was explored. The Exploring Key Orientations, EKO, strategy was used to evaluate piptide candidates for this. A library of only 14 piptides contained five members that disrupted epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor, EGFR, at low micromolar concentrations. These piptides also caused apoptotic cell death, and antagonized EGF&#8208;induced phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues in EGFR.</dc:description>

      <title>Topological Distortion Driven Amorphous Spherical MOFs for High Quality Single&#8208;Mode Microlasers</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as appealing platforms to construct microlasers owing to their compelling characters combining excellent stability of inorganic materials and processable characters of organic materials. However, MOFs microstructures developed thus far are generally composed of multiple edge boundaries due to their crystalline nature, which consequently raises significant scattering losses that are detrimental to lasing performance. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome the above drawback by designing spherically&#8208;shaped MOFs microcavities. Such spherical MOFs microstructures are constructed by amorphizing MOFs with topological distortion network through introducing flexible building blocks into the growth environment. With an ultra&#8208;smooth surface and excellent circular boundaries, the acquired spherical microcavities possess a Q factor as high as ~10  4  and can provide sufficient feedback for high quality single&#8208;mode lasing oscillations. We hope that these results will pave an avenue for the construction of new types of flexible MOFs&#8208;based photonic components.</dc:description>

Here, we describe a unique strategy for self&#8208;resistance toward a macrolide antibiotic, A26771B (  1  ), identified by elucidating its biosynthetic pathway in the fungus  Penicillium egyptiacum  . A highly reducing polyketide synthase and a  trans  &#8208;acting thioesterase generate the macrolide backbone, and a P450 and an acyltransferase respectively catalyze hydroxylation and succinylation to form the prodrug berkeleylactone E (  2  ). Then, extracellular oxidative activation by a secreted flavin&#8208;dependent oxidase forms  1  , while intracellular reductive inactivation by a short&#8208;chain reductase reforms  2  , forming a redox cycle. Our work illustrates a unique redox&#8208;mediated resistance mechanism for fungal antibiotics and contributes to the understanding of antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance.</dc:description>

Abstract
Proposed are Prussian blue analogue hosts with ordered and continuous channels, and electrocatalytic functionality with open Co and Fe species, which facilitate maximum I2 utilization efficiency and direct I2 to I&#8722; conversion kinetics of the I2 reduction reaction, and free up 1/3 I&#8722; from I3&#8722;. Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6] exhibits a low energy barrier (0.47&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and low Tafel slope (76.74&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). Accordingly, the Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6]/I2//Zn battery delivers a capacity of 236.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a rate performance with 151.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 achieved even at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The battery delivers both high energy density and high&#8208;power density of 305.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 109.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, higher than I2//Zn batteries reported to date. Furthermore, solid&#8208;state flexible batteries were constructed. A 100&#8197;mAh high capacity solid&#8208;state I2//Zn battery is demonstrated with excellent cycling performance of 81.2&#8201;% capacity retained after 400 cycles.
