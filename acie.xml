         <title>Bismuth&#8211;Selenopeptides Combine Potent Bioactivity with Exceptional Kinetic Inertness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major obstacle for bismuth peptides and proteins, in which Bi(III) is coordinated by three cysteine residues, is their kinetic lability when challenged with strong metal chelators. By simply replacing cysteines with selenocysteines, we significantly increased kinetic stability, extending the lifetime to several days. We further applied this strategy to a small protein containing six (seleno)cysteines, enabling coordination of two bismuth atoms.








Abstract
Bismuth peptides and proteins are emerging as versatile tools for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. Bismuth(III) binds three cysteine residues in peptides and proteins with remarkable selectivity. While the thermodynamic stability of these bismuth complexes is outstanding, their kinetic lability imposes limitations. Introducing bismuth selenopeptides, we demonstrate that selenocysteine binds bismuth with substantially higher kinetic stability than cysteine. This effect was quantified by directly comparing a peptide containing three cysteine residues with an identical peptide containing three selenocysteines. Bismuth selenopeptides are not only inert to strong chelators such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) but also to the natural metal&#8208;binding protein transferrin present in human plasma. We further demonstrate biological utility by developing bismuth selenopeptides that selectively bind and inhibit unrelated target proteins. To extend this concept to a more complex system, we investigated the human epidermal growth factor (EGF), a small protein comprising three disulfide bonds. We established that precisely two bismuth atoms bind to the six cysteine or selenocysteine residues in EGF and seleno&#8208;EGF, respectively. In the presence of EDTA, bismuth seleno&#8208;EGF remains fully intact, unlike its cysteine&#8208;based analog, consistent with observations from smaller peptides. Structural models confirm full preservation of the native EGF fold.

         <title>Ligand Effects in Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular [4+2]&#8208; and [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition Reactions of Unactivated 1,3&#8208;Diene&#8208;8&#8208;ynes and 1,3&#8208;Diene&#8208;8&#8208;enes</title>

         <dc:description>
Catalysts based on earth abundant cobalt {as cationic [LCoI]+} and readily available ligands are practical alternatives to prohibitively expensive Rh&#8208;catalysts for intramolecular [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;8&#8208;ynes and 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;8&#8208;enes. Tunable phosphino&#8208;oxazoline ligands enable an alternate intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition mode in 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes. A mechanism that involves a cobaltacycle formed via intramolecular oxidative dimerization of the precursors is proposed.








Abstract
Intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions have been extensively used for the syntheses of biologically active compounds including natural products. We have identified Co(I) complexes and optimal reaction conditions to accomplish highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective intramolecular [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions of 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;ynes and 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes. These catalysts, readily prepared from an earth&#8208;abundant metal and tunable ligands, serve as practical replacements for the prohibitively expensive Rh&#8208;complexes previously used for similar reactions. The cationic complexes are readily prepared by the reaction of LCoX2 with Zn in the presence of NaBARF. Both neutral and cationic Co(I)&#8208;complexes of (S)&#8208;BINAP and (S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINAP ligands effect the cyclization of 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;ynes giving the expected [4+2]&#8208;addition products in excellent selectivities. The [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of the less reactive 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes proceed only with the cationic complexes and 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;[(2S,5S)&#8208;2,5&#8208;diphenylphospholan&#8208;1&#8208;yl]ethane (PhBPE) and appropriately substituted phosphinooxazoline (PHOX) are the most optimal ligands for these reactions. Depending on the ligands, 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;enes bearing an aromatic substituent at the terminal position undergo an intramolecular [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, giving cyclobutane products in very good yields and enantioselectivities. The absence of the corresponding [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition in the 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;yne substates may be related to the enhanced strain in the expected bicyclo[3.2.0]heptene products. A unified mechanism involving Co(I)/Co(III)&#8208;redox cycle, consistent with all available evidence, is proposed for these reactions.

         <title>Hybrid of Indolizine and Merocyanine&#8212;A New Class of Organelle&#8208;Specific Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new merocyanines and cyanines possessing an indolizine scaffold were synthesized via tandem Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation followed by nucleophilic aromatic substitution, by leveraging the special reactivity of 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde. Indolizine scaffold as a donor enables the bathochromic shift of emission independent of solvent polarity, whereas indolizine&#8211;cyanine selectively marks mitochondria or RNA&#8208;rich nucleoli. 








Abstract
Unlocking the potential of electron&#8208;rich 2&#8208;hydroxyindolizines led to the discovery of a new class of dyes&#8212;indolizine&#8208;merocyanines (IndMer) and indolizine&#8208;cyanines. Tandem Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation followed by intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution afforded structurally diverse dyes, as both the nucleophilic and electrophilic partners can be broadly modified. A convergent fragment coupling strategy allowed rapid access to these &#960;&#8208;conjugated merocyanines in three steps from pyridines. Uniform distribution of the HOMO and LUMO combined with negligible change of dipole moment upon excitation is responsible for the intense orange or red emission of this new family of reasonably photostable dyes in a broad range of solvents. The new merocyanine dyes have the potential to target a variety of organelles&#8212;both uncharged and positively charged indolizine&#8211;merocyanines localize a subset of cellular lysosomes, positively charged indolizine&#8211;cyanine hybrid accumulates in mitochondria, while coumarin&#8211;merocyanine shows context&#8208;dependent localization to mitochondria and RNA&#8208;rich nucleoli of the living cells.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Rare Fungal Terpenoid&#8208;Isonitrile Amino Acid Hybrid Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a two&#8208;step genome mining strategy, a conserved and widely distributed gene cluster family was discovered from Fusarium sp., which was demonstrated for synthesising a group of new and rare terpenoid&#8208;isonitrile amino acid hybrid natural products (namely, chlamonitriles A&#8211;F) by heterologous expression and enzymatic biochemical characterisation. These compounds present a group of unusual structural features, including a highly oxidised guaiane&#8208;type sesquiterpene skeleton connected to a C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; dehydrogenation isonitrile isoleucine moiety via an ester bond.








Abstract
Terpenoid nonproteinogenic amino acid hybrid natural products usually have complex chemical structures and important biological functions. Herein, we discovered a group of conserved and widely distributed clusters of sesquiterpenoid&#8208;isonitrile isoleucine hybrid compounds from Fusarium through a two&#8208;step genome mining strategy. An investigation of the function of the isc cluster from Fusarium chlamydosporum revealed a variety of unusual enzymatic transformations, which importantly include 1) a single&#8208;module nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) IscF featuring an unusual C&#8208;terminal transferase domain that catalyses the esterification reaction on C2&#9472;OH of a highly oxidised guaiane&#8208;type 5/7&#8208;bicyclic sesquiterpene precursor 4 with T domain&#8208;bound l&#8208;isonitrile isoleucine 11a to yield terpenoid&#8208;isonitrile isoleucine hybrid natural product 9a (chlamonitrile A) and 2) cytochrome P450 (CYP450) IscD, which unexpectedly catalyses the C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; dehydrogenation of the isonitrile isoleucine moiety of 9a, resulting in the final products 13a/13b (chlamonitriles E/F). In addition, phytotoxic evaluation experiments revealed that 9a and its structural analogues are new phytotoxins of Fusarium. Our work provides the first example of the discovery of terpenoid&#8208;isonitrile amino acid hybrid compounds from fungi, expands our knowledge of the new functions of NRPS domains and fungal CYP450s, and uncovers the possible biological functions of these compounds in Fusarium.

An investigation of the function of the &lt;i&gt;isc&lt;/i&gt; cluster from &lt;i&gt;Fusarium chlamydosporum&lt;/i&gt; revealed a variety of unusual enzymatic transformations, which importantly include 1) a single-module nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) IscF featuring an unusual &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-terminal transferase domain that catalyses the esterification reaction on C2&#9472;OH of a highly oxidised guaiane-type 5/7-bicyclic sesquiterpene precursor &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with T domain-bound &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-isonitrile isoleucine &lt;b&gt;11a&lt;/b&gt; to yield terpenoid-isonitrile isoleucine hybrid natural product &lt;b&gt;9a&lt;/b&gt; (chlamonitrile A) and 2) cytochrome P450 (CYP450) IscD, which unexpectedly catalyses the C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; dehydrogenation of the isonitrile isoleucine moiety of &lt;b&gt;9a&lt;/b&gt;, resulting in the final products &lt;b&gt;13a&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;13b&lt;/b&gt; (chlamonitriles E/F). In addition, phytotoxic evaluation experiments revealed that &lt;b&gt;9a&lt;/b&gt; and its structural analogues are new phytotoxins of &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt;. Our work provides the first example of the discovery of terpenoid-isonitrile amino acid hybrid compounds from fungi, expands our knowledge of the new functions of NRPS domains and fungal CYP450s, and uncovers the possible biological functions of these compounds in &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen Affinity in Intermetallic Electrides as a Key Indicator of Catalytic Performance in Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We systematically investigated the structure&#8208;performance relationship of 13 isostructural ATmSi intermetallics for catalytic ammonia synthesis, focusing on their anionic electrons and lattice hydrogen. The A&#9472;A interlayer distance d is an indicator of anion electron density and catalytic performance. Critically, optimal catalytic activity requires a balanced hydrogen stability within the ATmSiH lattice. 








Abstract
Electrides have emerged as promising catalysts or catalyst supports for efficient ammonia synthesis under mild conditions. ATmSi compounds (A&#160;=&#160;rare earth/alkaline earth, Tm&#160;=&#160;transition metal) with a tetragonal CeFeSi&#8208;type structure represent a class of intermetallic electrides, where lattice atoms serve as active sites, offering significant potential for catalytic applications. However, with over 25 ATmSi compounds, their catalytic performance variations and optimization strategies remain poorly understood. In this study, we systematically investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of ATmSi compounds, focusing on their anionic electron properties and hydrogen storage capabilities. Analysis of lattice parameters revealed the A&#8211;A interlayer distance as a descriptor of anionic electron concentration, with the non&#8208;electride CaRuSi exhibiting a notable reduction in this distance due to minimal anionic electrons. The catalytic activities in ARuSi, ACoSi, and AFeSi systems all increase with the expansion of A&#8211;A interlayer spacing. Furthermore, hydrogen storage properties, where anionic electrons are replaced by hydride ions, were evaluated. It is critical for N2 hydrogenation. The hydrogen affinity, gauged by the desorption temperature, proved pivotal in determining catalytic efficiency, with optimal performance requiring balanced hydrogen binding strength. These findings provide critical insights for designing advanced catalysts for ammonia synthesis and potentially other hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Divergent Synthesis via Photochemical Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent Synthesis: A time&#8208;dependent photochemical rearrangement driven by energy transfer catalysis under visible light has been developed. Remarkably, by simply adjusting the reaction time, we can selectively synthesize two distinct types of fluorinated strained rings using the same photocatalyst. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies reveal that this photochemical rearrangement follows a kinetically controlled pathway.








Abstract
Divergent synthesis is a powerful and economical approach in synthetic chemistry and materials science. However, achieving precise control over divergent reactions using only reaction time as a variable is still rare. Herein, we show a time&#8208;dependent photochemical rearrangement driven by energy transfer catalysis under visible light. Remarkably, by simply adjusting the reaction time, we can selectively synthesize two distinct types of fluorinated strained rings using the same photocatalyst. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies reveal that this photochemical rearrangement follows a kinetically controlled pathway, involving a sequence of steps: diradical formation, 1,4&#8208;aryl migration, and 1,3&#8208;diradical formation. Interestingly, when the reaction time is extended, the newly formed difluoromethyl cyclopropanes can reversibly revert to the starting materials. This indicates that the final product is not simply kinetically or thermodynamically favored in the ground state potential energy surface. Instead, the excited state introduces additional complexity to the situation, as the starting materials are then fully converted into 1,1&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes through an excited&#8208;state thermodynamic control pathway&#8212;defined as the product distribution being governed by the relative thermodynamic stabilities of intermediates on the excited&#8208;state potential energy surface (PES), in contrast to conventional ground&#8208;state thermodynamic control, which relies on singlet ground&#8208;state PES stabilities under thermal conditions.

         <title>Cu Evolution over Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Y/Beta Zeolite Under H2 and Ethanol Atmospheres: Unveiling the Role of Diatomic Metal&#8211;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between isolated Cu(II) and Y(III) sites in Cu&#8208;Y/Beta catalysts increase the energy barrier for Cu(II) reduction under H2 atmosphere at high temperature, contributing to distinct induction period during ethanol dehydrogenation compared with monometallic Cu&#8208;Beta catalysts.








Abstract
Understanding the dynamic evolution of Cu species under varying environmental conditions is critical for addressing challenges related to the activity and the stability of copper&#8208;based catalysts in thermo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electrocatalysis. However, metal&#8211;metal interactions between dual single atoms and their effects on Cu evolution after exposure to different environmental molecules remain underexplored. Herein, we synthesized bimetallic Cu&#8208;Y/Beta catalysts with dual single&#8208;atom Cu and Y sites and monometallic Cu&#8208;Beta catalysts with isolated Cu sites in dealuminated Beta zeolites. By varying Cu and Y compositions, diatomic interactions were studied under H2 and ethanol atmospheres. With 6 wt% Y loading, approximately 0.4 wt% of Cu species in Cu&#8208;Y/Beta remained partially oxidized as Cu(I) after reduction in pure H2 at 350 &#176;C, in contrast to the full transition to metallic Cu observed in Cu&#8208;Beta. Combining X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy with kinetic studies revealed that metallic Cu became the predominant species after reduction with H2 as Cu loading increased from 0.4 to 1.7 wt%, quadrupling the initial ethanol dehydrogenation rate and demonstrating the dominant role of Cu(0) sites. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory simulations indicated spatial proximity between dual single&#8208;atom Cu and Y sites and elucidated Cu speciation controlled by diatomic interactions.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based MOF as a Highly Sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Detector for Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We&#8208;fabricated a novel POMOF BW12&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;MOF&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector for imaging. The Cu&#9472;O coordination bonds between [BW12O40]5&#8722; and [Cu(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy)2]2+ are not only conducive to charge transfer between anion and cation, but also effectively reduce ion migration. The fabricated BW12&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;MOF wafer device shows excellent X&#8208;ray detection performances and imaging capability, yielding a high sensitivity of 9832 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2








Abstract
Polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (POMOFs) show potential application prospects in the field of X&#8208;ray detection in recent years. However, it is still unclear how to effectively separate X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced charge carriers through the effective connection between polyoxometalates (POMs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their current infancy research status. Here, we designed and fabricated a novel POMOF BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector for stable and sensitive X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. The Cu&#9472;O coordination bonds between [BW12O40]5&#8722; and [Cu(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy)2]2+ in the structure of BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF are not only conducive to charge transfer between anion and cation, resulting in a high hole carrier mobility (&#956;h) of 4.80 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, but also effectively reduce ion migration and dark current simultaneously, which causes a small dark current drift as low as 1.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;18 A cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Finally, the fabricated BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF wafer device shows excellent X&#8208;ray detection performances, yielding a high sensitivity of 9832 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with the lowest detectable dose rate of 120 nGyair s&#8722;1 at an electric field of 200&#160;V mm&#8722;1 under 80&#160;kV X&#8208;ray irradiation. Furthermore, the constructed POMOF BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF as a potential candidate for X&#8208;ray detection also exhibits good X&#8208;ray imaging capability and long&#8208;term operational stability without any encapsulation exposed to the air for 6 months.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyoxometalate-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (POMOFs) show potential application prospects in the field of X-ray detection in recent years. However, it is still unclear how to effectively separate X-ray-induced charge carriers through the effective connection between polyoxometalates (POMs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their current infancy research status. Here, we designed and fabricated a novel POMOF BW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-MOF-based X-ray detector for stable and sensitive X-ray detection and imaging. The Cu&#9472;O coordination bonds between [BW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;5&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [Cu(2,2&#8242;-bipy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the structure of BW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-MOF are not only conducive to charge transfer between anion and cation, resulting in a high hole carrier mobility (&#956;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) of 4.80 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, but also effectively reduce ion migration and dark current simultaneously, which causes a small dark current drift as low as 1.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;18&lt;/sup&gt; A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Finally, the fabricated BW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-MOF wafer device shows excellent X-ray detection performances, yielding a high sensitivity of 9832 &#181;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Artificial Photosynthesis of Glycolaldehyde and Syngas from Plastic Feedstocks via Boron&#8208;Functionalized Nickel Species on CdS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by enzyme cofactors, a CdS&#8208;supported nickel boride@nickel borate core&#8208;shell nanoarchitectured photocatalyst was developed, featuring closely integrated electron/proton acceptors and catalytic sites. This &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; photocatalyst boosted charge separation and facilitated electron&#8211;proton cascade transfer, enabling selective co&#8208;synthesis of high&#8208;value glycolaldehyde and versatile syngas from plastic feedstocks under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Glycolaldehyde is an important intermediate in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and biodegradable plastics. Artificial photosynthesis of glycolaldehyde from plastic waste provides a sustainable approach for waste recycling and solar energy utilization. However, the inertness of plastic substrates and unselective photoredox make it challenging to generate valuable aldehydes or other market&#8208;demanded products. Here we demonstrate co&#8208;production of glycolaldehyde and syngas from the photoreforming of polyethylene terephthalate via an electron&#8211;proton cascade redox using a boron&#8208;functionalized nickel species modified CdS photocatalyst (NinB@Ni&#8208;BOx/CdS) under ambient conditions. We confirm the surface specie as a nickel boride@nickel borate core&#8208;shell nanoarchitecture with dual functions, serving as a reduction cocatalyst and facilitating electron&#8211;proton cascade transfer. The feature boosts charge separation and reactant molecule activation for an efficient cooperative redox. The optimized photocatalyst exhibits a glycolaldehyde generation of 1068.3 &#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 66.3%, as well as a syngas generation of 3232.2 &#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a tuneable H2/CO ratio. The finding demonstrates the solar&#8208;driven synthesis of value&#8208;added and multifunctional products from plastic waste as a sustainable and economically promising strategy.

         <title>Programmable Ultralong Phosphorescent Ionogels for Intelligent Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly tough room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) ionogels (77.11&#160;MJ m&#8211;3) has been fabricated with long lifetimes (afterglow &gt;50&#160;s, &#964;&#160;&#8776;&#160;5.23&#160;s) and broad color gamut (from deep blue to NIR&#8208;I). The ionogels have been integrated into real&#8208;time strain&#8208;softening/hardening monitoring, smart conductive materials, as well as intelligent grippers, thus demonstrating their potential application in smart materials. 








Abstract
Pure organic flexible RTP materials show broad application prospects in fields such as electronic sensing and high&#8208;resolution displays. IGs offer advantages over conventional soft matter due to their high ionic conductivity, thermal stability, and low volatility. However, flexible IGs often fail to provide sufficient rigidity to protect triplet excitons from environmental quenching, presenting a challenge in the development of RTP&#8208;IGs. Additionally, these materials may encounter unforeseen circumstances during operation that compromise their functional integrity, affecting real&#8208;time monitoring effectiveness. Developing novel IG systems with excellent RTP properties and real&#8208;time monitoring capabilities is thus urgent and meaningful. This work fabricated a novel, mechanically outstanding IG material (toughness&#160;&#8776;&#160;77.11&#160;MJ m&#8211;3) serving as an excellent matrix for flexible RTP materials. A trace doping strategy endowed these materials with ultralong full&#8208;color RTP (afterglow &gt;50&#160;s, lifetime up to 5.23&#160;s), demonstrating potential for real&#8208;time operational state monitoring. These systems were applied in strain&#8208;softening/hardening monitoring materials, smart conductive systems, and an intelligent thermally driven claw.

         <title>Harnessing Phenonium Ions in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenonium ions have frequently been viewed as intermediates of theoretical interest, but whose synthetic utility was limited. This minireview outlines how physical&#8208;organic characterization has led to a better understanding of controlling their formation, which has resulted in modern strategies to form phenonium ions straightforwardly and use them in a synthetically useful manner.








Abstract
Whereas phenonium ions have been known for decades, their use in synthesis has been surprisingly scarce. This might be attributed to the difficulty in taming their formation and reactivity. However, by considering the physical&#8208;organic properties of phenonium species, through careful design of substrates, or the use of defined reagents/promoter systems, several applications have emerged in recent years to overcome those challenges. This minireview encompasses key recent strategies to generate those highly reactive cationic intermediates in line with their physicochemical properties, with special emphasis on mechanistic aspects, regioselectivity, and functional group compatibility.

         <title>Unprecedented Selectivity for Arsenic(III) in a Dimercaptosuccinic Acid&#8208;Based Zr&#8208;MOF: The Role of Dangling Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly defective DMSA&#8208;based zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;DMSA&#8208;MOF) removes arsenic from water with higher selectivity over phosphate than conventional Zr&#8208;MOFs. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, pair distribution function analysis, and solid&#8208;state NMR reveal that, unlike other Zr&#8208;based MOFs where arsenic binds to the clusters, the flexible, rotatable DMSA linkers in Zr&#8208;DMSA&#8208;MOF enable strong, selective arsenic binding sites via chelation.








Abstract
While zirconium&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) show promise for arsenic remediation, their practical implementation faces critical challenges: poor capture of neutral arsenite (H3AsO3 containing As(III)) and limited selectivity for arsenate (HAsO42&#8722; and H2AsO4&#8722; containing As(V)) species in the presence of competing ions. Here, we present a transformative solution using dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) ligands to construct two topologically distinct Zr&#8208;MOFs. The Zr&#8208;DMSA framework with fcu topology demonstrates exceptional capture of both arsenic species, even in the presence of phosphates, which normally compete for adsorption sites. Through comprehensive structural analysis combining PDF analysis, XAS, and solid&#8208;state NMR, we uncover the molecular basis for this superior performance. Comparative studies with analogous thiol&#8208;free Zr&#8208;MOFs reveal that DMSA's thiol groups enable strong covalent sulfur&#8208;arsenic interactions. Moreover, DFT calculations and XAS analysis illuminate an unexpected mechanism: dangling or flexible DMSA ligands enhance As(III) chelation through rotational freedom that enables effective As&#8208;S bond formation. The remarkable selectivity for arsenate over phosphate likely stems from arsenate's reduction potential, enabling its conversion to As(III) during thiol chelation. This work not only addresses a pressing environmental challenge but also establishes how particle size effects and/or structural disorder, rather than perfect crystallinity, may dramatically enhance MOF performance for selective guest capture.

         <title>Simultaneous Measurement of RNA Synthesis and Degradation Rates in Single Cells Unveils the Regulatory Mechanisms of Temporal RNA Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double metabolic RNA labeling&#8208;based single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing method (scDUAL&#8208;seq) was developed to measure RNA synthesis and degradation rates simultaneously in single cells. scDUAL&#8208;seq resolves the cell cycle&#8208;dependent variations of RNA kinetic rates in cortisol response, identifies the underlying regulatory strategies, and elucidates the coordinated regulation of RNA kinetic rates that control distinct strategy transitions.








Abstract
The temporal dynamics of coordinated RNA transcription and degradation are heterogeneous among different cell types or states. However, current transcriptomic approaches are unable to simultaneously measure transcriptome&#8208;wide RNA synthesis and degradation rates in single cells for resolving the RNA regulatory mechanisms during dynamic processes. Herein, we develop scDUAL&#8208;seq, which integrates double nucleoside analogs pulse&#8208;pulse labeling, chemical nucleoside conversion, and single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing to record both RNA transcription and RNA degradation in heterogeneous cell populations. Compared to single nucleoside analog labeling&#8208;based methods, scDUAL&#8208;seq allows simultaneous recording of RNA transcription and degradation, leading to more accurate determination of RNA kinetic rates and RNA regulatory strategies. In a cortisol response model, scDUAL&#8208;seq enables the discovery of key regulons driving strategy transitions and elucidation of the coordinated regulation of RNA synthesis and degradation rates that control distinct strategy transitions. scDUAL&#8208;seq is expected to provide new insights into RNA regulatory mechanisms across diverse biological processes.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Content PdCu Disordered Nanoalloys on Carbon Nitrides for Unity&#8208;Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique PdCu/PCN catalyst is synthesized by in situ anchoring PdCu disordered nanoalloys onto PCN via a one&#8208;step co&#8208;polymerization method. Alloying Cu with Pd modulates the CO2 hydrogenation pathway toward methanol and lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step. With ultralow metal loadings (Pd: 0.18%, Cu: 0.16%), the catalyst delivers exceptional activity, stability, and 100% methanol selectivity at 160&#160;&#160;C.








Abstract
Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol offers a dual benefit of mitigating CO2 emissions and producing liquid fuel. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol catalyst (PdCu/PCN), consisting of ultrafine PdCu disordered nanoalloys anchored on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) nanosheets. Prepared via a facile one&#8208;pot co&#8208;polymerization recipe, this strategy permits the in situ formation and integration of PdCu alloys during PCN synthesis, which ensures strong interfacial confinement and prevents the generation of oxide&#8208;derived encapsulation overlayers, maximizing the exposure of active metal sites. Despite its ultralow metal loading (Pd: 0.18%, Cu: 0.16%), the catalyst achieves a high methanol production rate of 21.24&#160;mmol gmetal&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity at 160&#160;&#176;C, together with outstanding reusability. Alloying Cu with Pd in a disordered nanoalloy structure modulates the CO2 hydrogenation pathway toward methanol while lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. This work highlights the potential of PCN as a flexible metal&#8208;free support for constructing active and durable catalysts for selective CO2 conversion through in situ alloy engineering.

         <title>Microdroplet&#8208;Driven Synthesis of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microdroplet chemistry can achieve rapid synthesis at room temperature of copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;MOFs), which can catalyze microbubble interfacial nitrogen oxidation into nitric acid.








Abstract
We report a room&#8208;temperature synthesis of copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;MOFs) using microdroplet chemistry, offering a fast and energy&#8208;efficient alternative to conventional solvothermal methods that typically require high temperatures, extended reaction times, and suffer from inhomogeneous mixing. The unique microdroplet environment significantly accelerates reaction kinetics, enabling the formation of uniform octahedral crystals within 1&#160;h at ambient conditions. Comprehensive characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface area analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed the high crystallinity, thermal stability, and porous structure of the Cu&#8208;MOFs. Compared to conventionally prepared Cu&#8208;MOFs, those synthesized via microdroplet chemistry exhibit comparable surface areas with improved exposure of active sites. As a demonstration of their catalytic potential, the MOFs were employed in a microbubble&#8208;assisted air&#8211;water interface system for nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions. The system effectively converted atmospheric nitrogen into nitrate, showcasing the practical utility of these materials in green chemical transformations. This study shows that microdroplet and microbubble technologies are powerful and sustainable platforms for MOF synthesis and catalytic applications.

         <title>Organic Polymer Semiconductor Photocatalysts: From Building Block Design to Controllable Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic polymer semiconductors are highly tunable photocatalytic systems. This review explores the structural design of organic polymer semiconductors from two perspectives: building block design and control over self&#8208;assembly and surface modification. Furthermore, the future development of organic polymer semiconductor photocatalysts is discussed. By integrating structural design with photocatalytic reactions, this review provides a foundation for the rational design of photocatalytic organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic polymer semiconductors are emerging as a promising class of photocatalysts because their highly tunable molecular structures and flexible morphological control offer unique advantages for overcoming the efficiency bottlenecks of traditional inorganic materials. However, the development of organic polymer photocatalysts largely relies on empirical, trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches. The understanding of their structure&#8211;activity relationship is insufficient, which significantly hinders the rational design and performance prediction of polymer photocatalysts. This review systematically outlines the structure&#8208;driven design strategies for polymer photocatalysts by focusing on two interconnected levels: molecular building block design and controllable assembly. Starting with the molecular building block design, strategies including monomer unit selection, functional group modification, and heteroatom doping are analyzed in detail for tuning the material's intrinsic electronic and photophysical properties. At the assembly level, we explore how strategies like morphological control, surface modification, and pore engineering can guide the controlled organization of polymers to optimize the final semiconductor architecture. By establishing the relationship between structure and properties at different scales, we aim to build a systematic structure&#8211;activity relationship for polymer photocatalysts, ultimately seeking to shift from empirical screening to rational design.

         <title>Defects Induced in Situ Reconstruction of CdS with Oxygen&#8208;Tolerance Up to 23% in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defective CdS&#8208;D showed superior oxygen tolerance than traditional CdS, maintaining a stable CO generation rate of 2.77&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 23% O2 (matching pure CO2 conditions). Defect&#8208;induced hole accumulation triggered oxidative reconstruction to active Cd2SO4(OH)2, enhancing CO2 adsorption and suppressing O2 adsorption, thus enabling high oxygen resistance.








Abstract
Direct driving the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 from air or flue gas to produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is very challenging due to the suppressing effect of the more favorable thermodynamically oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we presented a novel oxygen&#8208;involved reconstruction pathway on a unique defective CdS&#8208;D in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The material is highly tolerant to O2 and generates 2766.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 of CO under visible light irradiation in the presence of up to 23% content of O2. Intriguingly, instead of inhibiting the performance of CO2 reduction, the presence of oxygen positively promotes it, CO generation rate is up to 5124&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 after multiple experimental cycles. The meticulously structural analysis reveals that the CdS&#8208;D with abundant defects tended to accumulate photogenerated holes, and S2&#8722; is oxidized to SO42&#8722; in the presence of oxygen to produce Cd2SO4(OH)2 as the active center for preferable CO2 adsorption and inhibit the O2 adsorption, which is the root cause for the high tolerance of oxygen in CO2 reduction (CO2RR). This work reveals a unique reconstruction process of sulfides photo corrosion, which provides a new idea for realizing the direct conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 by omitting expensive carbon capture or purification in industrial carbon resource utilization.

         <title>Ultrasmall Chemogenetic Tags with Group&#8208;Transfer Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Small is beautiful,&#8221; wrote the economist E. F. Schumacher. We report two ultrasmall chemogenetic tags of human origin that exhibit transferase&#8208;type reactivity with their ligands, allowing the attachment of any moiety&#8208;of&#8208;interest to the tag. We demonstrate the utility of their small size in cell&#8208;signaling and induced&#8208;proximity applications.








Abstract
Chemogenetic tags facilitate exploration of activities of a protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest (POI) that lacks small&#8208;molecule ligands; however, most tags are too large for several POIs. Here, we report two ultrasmall chemogenetic tags (mgTag and cTag) of 36 and 50 amino acids (aa) that, to the best of our knowledge, are the smallest. These tags exhibit transferase&#8208;type reactivity with their ligands, allowing the attachment of any moiety&#8208;of&#8208;interest to the tag. cTag utilizes an engineered C1 domain&#8208;bearing cysteine that undergoes a group&#8208;transfer reaction with its ligand. Likewise, mgTag utilizes an engineered zinc&#8208;finger domain&#8208;bearing cysteine that undergoes a group&#8208;transfer reaction with its molecular glue ligand in the presence of cereblon (CRBN). While the fusion of HaloTag (297 aa) or SNAPTag (182 aa) to the KRASG12D (188 aa) disrupted its growth&#8208;signaling pathway, fusion of mgTag or cTag did not, pointing to the importance of tag size. Group&#8208;transfer of BRD4 binder to tags appended to Abelson kinase (ABL) induced proximity between ABL and BRD4, resulting in the latter's phosphorylation. Deletion of the transferase&#8208;type reactivity reduced phosphorylation levels, suggesting that proximity&#8208;inducing chimeras with group&#8208;transfer design may be more efficacious. We envision these ultrasmall tags to have wide&#8208;ranging applications, including in basic science, biotechnology, and medicine.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Conjugated Macrocyclic BODIPYs for Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic substitution&#8208;cyclization&#8208;dehydrogenation reactions generate a photosensitizer exhibiting enhanced non&#8208;radiative transitions, resulting in excellent photothermal therapeutic effects. 








Abstract
With this research we developed a cyclization strategy that effectively converts radiative transitions (RTs) to non&#8208;radiative transitions (NRTs) during the decay process of BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizers. Compared to BODIPY monomers, cyclization leads to a significant decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap and a significant increase in the HOMO energy. In particular, the absorption spectrum of 7a exhibits a significant redshift, with the maximum absorption wavelength reaching 794&#160;nm. Photophysical characterization indicates that the macrocyclic BODIPY derivatives 7(a&#8211;d) exhibit a reduced RT process. While, the crystal structure and theoretical calculations suggest that the molecular ring distortion enhances the intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of the macrocyclic BODIPY derivatives 7(a&#8211;d). In addition 7a&#8208;NPs constructed using DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 encapsulation exhibit excellent water solubility, stability, and photothermal conversion efficiency (44.6%). The photothermal therapeutic performance of 7a&#8208;NPs was evaluated through in vitro cell and in vivo mice experiments. The results indicated that 7a&#8208;NPs could be enriched at the tumor site and exhibited strong tumor ablation ability using near&#8208;infrared radiation. Our findings suggest that the regulation of the RT to NRT conversion using an alkali&#8208;induced cyclization reaction is a useful strategy for preparing efficient photo&#8208;thermal conversion materials based on BODIPY.

         <title>London Dispersion&#8208;Induced Contraction of the Cu&#9472;O Bond in Copper(I) Phenolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
London dispersion drives counterintuitive contraction without strengthening of Cu&#9472;O bonds in sterically bulk copper(I) phenoxides, challenging the classical bond&#8208;length/strength correlation. Combined crystallographic and computational analyses reveal that dispersion interactions enforce symmetrical geometries and stabilize shortened, weakened bonds through enhanced &#960;&#8208; yet diminished &#963;&#8208;bonding, establishing a new paradigm in metal&#8211;ligand bonding.








Abstract
Conventional chemical wisdom holds that shorter bonds of a given type generally exhibit greater strength. Here, we reveal a counterintuitive bonding mode in copper(I) phenoxides, where bulky substituents induce Cu&#9472;O bond contraction without concomitant strengthening. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis shows that increasing steric bulk at ortho positions of the phenolate ligand can shorten Cu&#9472;O bonds and promote symmetrical molecular geometries. Combined structural and computational studies demonstrate that London dispersion (LD) between N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and ortho&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl phenolates plays a crucial role in driving this conformational reorganization. Local energy decomposition analysis quantifies substantial dispersion stabilization (by up to 11.2&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Notably, natural orbital analysis indicates that the compressed Cu&#9472;O bonds exhibit diminished &#963;&#8208;character despite enhanced &#960;&#8208;interactions. This LD&#8208;induced bond contraction results in overall shorter yet weaker Cu&#9472;O bonds than those in less sterically bulk analogues, thereby establishing a different bonding paradigm from the conventional bond&#8208;length/strength correlation.

Engineering localized aromaticity in amine&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons effectively suppresses molecular vibration coupling and reduces the intensity of shoulder peaks in emission spectra, thereby giving rise to highly efficient yellow and red narrowband fluorophores for the assembly of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
The development of narrowband fluorescent emitters remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in organic optoelectronics. Herein, we present an aromaticity engineering approach based on a perylene core to construct highly efficient narrowband fluorescent emitters. Replacement of one naphthalene unit with a carbazole moiety enhances the localization of aromaticity, while extension of the &#960;&#8211;conjugation further attenuates the aromaticity of the remaining naphthalene ring. This dual modulation effectively suppresses emission shoulder bands, yielding spectrally pure fluorescence. Consequently, the centrosymmetric c&#8208;NaDTCz and the axially symmetric a&#8208;NaDTCz exhibit sharp emissions at 536 and 600&#160;nm, with narrow full widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 17 and 30&#160;nm, respectively. When applied in OLEDs, the c&#8208;NaDTCz&#8208;based device displays sharp yellow emission peaking at 548&#160;nm with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.1%, while a&#8208;NaDTCz delivers narrowband red electroluminescence at 610&#160;nm, achieving a record&#8208;high EQE of 27.8% for conventional red fluorescent emitters.

         <title>Electrochemical &#9082;&#8208;C&#9472;H Functionalization of Nitramines for Accessing Bifunctional Energetic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical &#945;&#8208;C&#9472;H functionalization of nitramines enables the synthesis of molecules containing bifunctional energetic heterocycles with promising properties. A telescoped, HNO3&#8208;free sequence involving nitration and azolation steps offers a safer, modular, and scalable platform for the synthesis of energetic compounds.








Abstract
The synthesis of energetic materials (EMs) often involves hazardous reagents and harsh conditions, raising safety and environmental concerns. We herein present an electrochemical method for the &#9082;&#8208;C&#9472;H azolation of nitramines, enabling the integration of nitramines and various nitrogen&#8208;rich azoles as dual energetic components within the same molecule. To enhance the practicality of the overall synthesis, we developed a tandem two&#8208;step process that transforms free amines into nitramines using stable and readily available reagents, which was complemented by subsequent electrochemical azolation to complete a streamlined, scalable preparation of bifunctional energetic compounds. Finally, a continuous flow system was employed to further improve the practicality of the electrosynthetic method, which substantially reduced electrolyte usage and increased productivity. Computational and experimental data revealed that the introduction of azoles, particularly those with additional nitro substituents, improves the energy density and thermal stability of nitramines. This work provides a proof of concept that the reported electrochemical azolation reaction may not only offer a safer and more sustainable alternative to traditional approaches for energetic material synthesis, but it will also provide a platform for the discovery of novel compounds with favorable energetic properties.

         <title>Hydrogen Atom Capture Toward Dense Solid Electrolyte Interface for Long&#8208;Cycling Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed a hydrogen&#8208;capture strategy to achieve H2&#8208;interference&#8208;free crystallization of a dense zinc hydroxide sulfate (ZHS) SEI by introducing potassium persulfate to suppress hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This electron&#8208;insulating ZHS layer concurrently inhibits dendrite growth and further HER during cycling, stabilizing Zn anodes for long&#8208;cycle aqueous zinc batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising high&#8208;safety energy storage devices, but their practical implementation has been limited by dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) is expected to address these problems. Herein, we revealed that HER results in loose and porous interfacial structure, making the in situ construction of reliable SEI a challenge. Thus, a universal and effective hydrogen atom scavenging strategy is proposed to in situ construct a dense and uniform inorganic SEI by introducing potassium persulfate (PSS). PSS scavenges the adsorbed hydrogen atoms, thus inhibiting HER. Meanwhile, PSS is reduced into SO42&#8722; and participates in the formation of zinc hydroxide sulfates (ZHS). With no interference of H2 bubbles on ZHS crystallization, an ideal SEI is constructed. This ZHS&#8208;SEI exhibits superior electronic insulation, effectively suppressing further HER and Zn dendrite growth during cycling. As a result, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell with PSS can achieve stable Zn plating/stripping for 1882&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 2.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 650 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5 mAh cm&#8722;2, respectively. The cycling stability of the Zn||NVO full cell is also significantly improved at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work provides a novel perspective for stabilizing the zinc anode interface.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule DNA Tweezers Enable Programmable Control of Enzyme Activity via Arbitrary Molecular Cues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling enzyme activity with molecular precision remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a DNA&#8208;based strategy for the dynamic and programmable regulation of enzyme function in response to arbitrary, user&#8208;defined chemical cues. We report the development of single&#8208;molecule DNA tweezers (SMDTs)&#8212;structures that can be programmed to bind and inhibit enzymes, then release upon sensing specific signals, restoring activity.








Abstract
Engineering allosteric control sites into enzymes typically requires extensive protein modification. Here, we introduce single&#8208;molecule DNA tweezers (SMDTs), which enable programmable, allosteric&#8208;like regulation of enzyme activity in response to user&#8208;defined chemical cues, without altering the enzyme itself. SMDTs consist of two aptamers connected by a tunable, stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA linker. By binding non&#8208;covalently to two distinct sites on an enzyme, the SMDT adopts a &#8220;pinched&#8221; conformation, reminiscent of mechanical tweezers, that inhibits enzymatic activity. Upon exposure to specific molecular triggers, the SMDT undergoes a conformational change that releases the inhibitory aptamer, restoring function. The degree of inhibition and reactivation efficiency can be finely tuned by adjusting the DNA linker's length, sequence, flexibility, and geometry. Operating at nanomolar concentrations, the system exhibits high specificity, capable of discriminating between closely related inputs, including single&#8208;base mismatches in nucleic acids. Importantly, SMDTs can be programmed to respond not only to molecular abundance but also to molecular activity. We show the versatility of this platform by regulating enzymes using diverse triggers, including nucleic acids, transcription factors (TATA&#8208;binding protein [TBP], cellular myelocytomatosis [c&#8208;Myc]), signaling proteins (platelet&#8208;derived growth factor [PDGF]), small molecules (kanamycin), and metal ions (Mn2+). These results establish a generalizable framework for designing responsive protein binders that translate molecular recognition into functional outcomes.

         <title>Polarity Gradient CEI Driven Rapid Desolvation for Extreme Fast&#8208;Charging Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work engineers the CEI via electrolyte design, showing its dual role in K+ desolvation under extreme fast charging (XFC) and in sustaining conductivity and robustness. A polarity gradient CEI, rich in B&#8208;F/B&#8208;O outside and uniform K2CO3/KF inside, accelerates K+ migration and stabilizes structure. As a result, KFeHCF/graphite full cells achieve faster kinetics and stable interfaces, highlighting CEI tailoring as key for XFC batteries.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) offer an opportunity for superior fast&#8208;charging compared to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, owing to their faster K+ transport in electrolyte. However, severe side reactions at the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), sluggish K+ transport, and cathode structural degradation hinder the development of fast&#8208;charging PIBs. Herein, we tailor&#8208;design a polarity gradient CEI via an electrolyte additives modification strategy. Specifically, the outer B&#8211;F/B&#8211;O species assist in withdrawing solvent molecules around K+ during the desolvation process, while abundant K2CO3 and KF throughout the CEI facilitate K+ transport and structural stability. Consequently, the KFeHCF/graphite full cell demonstrates improved charge transfer and diffusion kinetics, with suppressed Fe dissolution, enhancing stability of both the cathode bulk structure and interphase under fast&#8208;charging conditions. The full cell with optimized CEI delivers high reversible capacities of 126.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.02 A g&#8722;1 and 95.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 (a charging time of 7.5 min for 80% of the capacity), and maintains 67 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 as well as good long cycle life. Moreover, it retains 85.1 mAh g&#8722;1 and exhibits good rate performance even at &#8211;10&#8201;&#176;C. Our work reveals the critical role of rationally regulating CEI components and structure for fast&#8208;charging PIBs.

The full cell with optimized CEI delivers high reversible capacities of 126.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.02 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 95.8 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (a charging time of 7.5 min for 80% of the capacity), and maintains 67 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as well as good long cycle life. Moreover, it retains 85.1 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibits good rate performance even at &#8211;10&#8201;&#176;C. Our work reveals the critical role of rationally regulating CEI components and structure for fast-charging PIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Electrocatalysis Cascade Synthesis of Deuterated Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At present, industrial production methods, such as the Haber&#8211;Bosch (H&#8211;B) process using N2 and D2, require harsh reaction conditions and complexity equipment, leading to a high production cost of ND3. This work demonstrates a two&#8208;step relay route to produce ND3 by using air and deuterium oxide (D2O) as raw materials, including plasma&#8208;driven air&#8208;to&#8208;NOx conversion and electrocatalytic NOx&#8211;&#8208;to&#8208;ND3 conversion, which can be directly driven by volatile green energy. 








Abstract
Deuterated ammonia (ND3) exhibits growing market demand in the fields of chemical analysis, pharmaceutical industry and semiconductor manufacturing. Currently, industrial production of ND3 relies on harsh conditions and complex processes, leading to high production cost and security risk. Herein, we propose a sustainable relay strategy to produce ND3 by using air and deuterium oxide (D2O) as raw materials, including plasma&#8208;driven air&#8208;to&#8208;NOx conversion and electrocatalytic NOx&#8211;&#8208;to&#8208;ND3 conversion. The insufficient supply of reactive deuterium (*D) leads to sluggish kinetics of electrocatalytic deuterium reaction. The well&#8208;designed F modified cobalt (F&#8211;Co) catalyst exhibits a remarkable yield of 0.75&#160;mmol h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 80.43% for ND3 at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The combined results of characterizations reveal that fluorine (F) atom can boost D2O dissociation and suppress competing deuterium evolution reaction, thereby providing abundant *D for deuteration reaction. Notably, a pilot&#8208;scale demonstration system, consisting of non&#8208;thermal plasma, flow electrolyzer, air stripping and ammonia absorber, is constructed to produce practicable ND3 solution (2.8 wt%) with &#8764;21.45&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 ND3 production capability by using air and D2O as sources.

         <title>Electronic Modification at Atomic Scale: Design and Preparation of Diatomic Structures by Atomic Layer Deposition for Methanol Steam Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed transition metal modified Pt&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts were designed and synthesized via the ALD method, which are used to investigate the atomic&#8208;level electronic effects of Ni and Fe against Pt in methanol steam reforming (MSR) reaction, which was achieved by combining microscopic and spectroscopic analyses, DFT calculations. Notably, the 10cNi/Pt1/CeO2 catalyst exhibited optimal activity and the lowest activation energies, attributed to moderate electronic modification against Pt.








Abstract
The electronic effects of bimetallic components in catalysis remain poorly understood. Herein, atomically dispersed transition metal (TM) modified platinum (Pt)&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts were designed and synthesized with the atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. Methanol steam reforming (MSR) was selected as a probe reaction to investigate the atomic&#8208;level electronic effects of nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) on Pt species. In situ/ex situ characterizations, isotope labeling, and DFT calculations reveal that different transition metals and ALD cycles tune the Pt electronic structure, significantly affecting catalytic activity. Notably, the 10cNi/Pt1/CeO2 catalyst exhibits optimal electronic modification, achieving the highest MSR and water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) conversions and the lowest activation energies. Additionally, kinetic isotope effect studies confirm that hydrogen formation proceeds via methanol dehydrogenation coupled with WGS. These findings provide new insights into electronic modifications at atomic scales within the bimetallic components, offering valuable guidance for the design and development of advanced catalytic systems.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Based Azo Compound&#8208;Mediated CO Activation and N2 Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare silicon(IV)&#8208;based azo compound featuring a Si&#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472;Si linkage was synthesized via the direct reaction of an organoazide with a silaiminyl&#8211;silylene precursor. This compound undergoes an unusual CO activation process, resulting in N2 release and complete cleavage of the C&#8801;O bond, forming a Si(II)/Si(IV) product bridged by an oxygen atom and an organic isonitrile.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;substituted azo compounds featuring Si&#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472;Si linkages remain elusive in main&#8208;group chemistry. Herein, we report the synthesis of a silicon&#8208;based azo compound generated directly from a mixed&#8208;valent silaiminyl&#8211;silylene precursor and a bulky organic azide. Unlike classical iminosilane formation, this reaction affords a thermally stable Si(IV)&#8211;azo species. Upon treatment with carbon monoxide (CO), this compound undergoes N2 extrusion, complete C&#8801;O bond cleavage, and formation of a formal Si(II)/Si(IV) product in which an oxygen atom bridges both silicon centers. Notably, the transformation incorporates the carbon atom into a DippNC byproduct via ligand rearrangement. A similar transformation occurs upon reaction with Fe(CO)5, wherein N2 release and CO cleavage also occur, but with the resulting Fe(CO)4 fragment coordinating to the silicon center. These results demonstrate a rare example of silicon based azo&#8208;mediated small&#8208;molecule activation and highlight the potential of silicon&#8208;based systems for multi&#8208;electron redox chemistry typically associated with transition metals.

         <title>Photochemical Spin&#8208;State Switching of an All&#8208;Organic Molecular System with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light photochemical spin&#8208;state switching is achieved through a tailored design. The photoswitching core is substituted with the &#960;&#8208;acceptor indanedione resulting in a small optical bandgap in combination with torsional twisting of the substituent. This twisting is essential for the stability of the diradical state as it isolates the spin density in the periphery preventing immediate radical&#8211;radical recombination.








Abstract
Controlling the spin state of a molecule using the spatiotemporal properties of visible light is of interest for spintronic devices in information technology or (bio)medical applications. We, herein, report an all&#8208;organic visible light&#8208;induced photochromic system than can switch from a diamagnetic (singlet) to a paramagnetic (triplet) state. This is realized by precisely tuning orbital symmetry and internal molecular strain in a [5]helicene scaffold substituted with an indanedione &#960;&#8208;acceptor. Irradiation with visible light at cryogenic temperatures gives a kinetically meta&#8208;stable paramagnetic diradical state with a solvent&#8208;dependent ground&#8208;state multiplicity (triplet or singlet), which can be thermally switched back to its initial diamagnetic state.

         <title>Quantifying the Biodegradation of Water&#8208;Soluble Polymer Mixtures with Diffusion NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fate of polymers in liquid formulations in natural environments has not been extensively researched, in part as a result of incompatible analytical techniques. We show that diffusion NMR spectroscopy can be used to quantify the simultaneous biodegradation of multiple water&#8208;soluble polymers with limited sample preparation, measuring the molar mass, and chemical composition of multiple species with no molar mass restriction.








Abstract
Polymers in liquid formulations result in 36 million tons of waste each year. It is estimated that 13% of these polymers directly enter, and accumulate in, natural environments, however, their fate is poorly understood; in part as a consequence of challenges in characterizing how the polymers biodegrade. Multiple analytical techniques have been used to quantify polymer biodegradation but require extensive sample preparation and can only measure one species accurately at a time, inhibiting the measurement of water&#8208;soluble polymer mixtures. Here, we report the application of diffusion nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as an alternative method to enable the facile monitoring of polymer biodegradation. This technique uniquely aids the understanding of biodegradation mechanisms, by measuring chemical as well as molar mass changes, concurrently, for both the polymer and degradation products. Furthermore, the ability to detect and measure the molar mass of multiple separate species enables the measurement of simultaneous biodegradation of polymer mixtures, including polymers with different chemical structures but the same molar mass.

&lt;p&gt;The fate of polymers in liquid formulations in natural environments has not been extensively researched, in part as a result of incompatible analytical techniques. We show that diffusion NMR spectroscopy can be used to quantify the simultaneous biodegradation of multiple water-soluble polymers with limited sample preparation, measuring the molar mass, and chemical composition of multiple species with no molar mass restriction.

         <title>Formation of Interconnected Nanofiber Sheets by Chemical Vapor Polymerization at the Free Surface of Liquid Crystalline Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the formation of a quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional interconnected amine functionalized nanofiber network at a gas&#8211;liquid crystal interface by chemical vapor polymerization. The network forms via an interfacial phase separation pathway, revealing that the range of morphologies accessible via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystal is much greater than previously understood.








Abstract
We report that chemical vapor polymerization (CVP) of aminomethyl[2.2]paracyclophane into nematic liquid crystal (LC) films (thicknesses of 18&#160;&#181;m) yields quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional, sub&#8208;micron thick nanoporous polymer networks consisting of interconnected amine&#8208;functionalized nanofibers/nanowalls (widths of 30&#160;&#177;&#160;1&#160;nm). We establish that the polymer networks form at the free surface of the LC films with thicknesses ranging from 79&#160;&#177;&#160;5 to 280&#160;&#177;&#160;14&#160;nm and nanoscopic pores tunable via the choice of LC and monomer loading. Structural analysis using electron microscopy reveals the networks to possess morphologies ranging from open bicontinuous&#8208;like to cellular foam&#8208;like structures which, along with optical observations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, supports a synthesis pathway involving an interface&#8208;confined phase separation. MD simulations provide further insight into the atomic&#8208;scale processes determining the synthesis pathway, including the role of reactive precursor chemistry (e.g., hydroxymethyl[2.2]paracyclophane versus aminomethyl[2.2]paracyclophane versus [2.2]paracyclophane) in defining the nanostructure of the polymer product. Fluorescence and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm that the nanofiber sheets are decorated with primary amine groups, permitting covalent functionalization of the surfaces of the nanosheets. Finally, we show how the nanosheet synthesis can be integrated with existing membrane technology, illustrating the potential utility of the nanoporous sheets in a range of contexts, including filters, separators, and heat exchanger surfaces.

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence for High&#8208;Resolution Immune Response Monitoring and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fused B&#8208;N coordinated organic NIR phosphors (TPP&#8208;BN/BF) with 819&#160;nm emission and 28.6&#160;ms lifetime are synthesized. PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PEG nanoengineering yields nanoparticles (PNPs) with five&#8208;folds enhanced afterglow. A GrB&#8208;responsive nanoprobe (Q&#8208;BFNP) leveraging peptide&#8211;PRET enables tumor immune monitoring with a 216.4 signal&#8208;background ratio, advancing real&#8208;time, high&#8208;contrast bioimaging, and programmable immunity assessments via molecular&#8208;to&#8208;nanoscale RTP design.








Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials hold great potential for bioimaging due to their ability to eliminate background noise and tissue autofluorescence. Here, we synthesized octa&#8208;ring fused RTP molecules (TPP&#8208;BN and TPP&#8208;BF) with B&#9472;N coordination bonds via a two&#8208;step reaction, enabling NIR phosphorescent emission at 819&#160;nm and a 28.6&#160;ms lifetime. Using PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PEG as host and surfactant to stabilize the RTP molecules, we fabricated PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PEG based nanoparticles (PNPs) with five&#8208;fold brighter afterglow than conventional F127&#8208;based methods (FNPs). We further developed a granzyme B (GrB)&#8208;responsive nanoprobe (Q&#8208;BFNP) that achieves specific and quantitative detection. In vivo studies demonstrated their ability to monitor and distinguish tumor immune response with the signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) as high as 216.4. This study provides a new method for constructing NIR organic RTP probes and advances applications of RTP materials in real&#8208;time, high&#8208;contrast bioimaging and tumor immune monitoring.

         <title>Cleavable Antibody&#8208;Conjugated A&#946; Specific Immune Exosome for Combination Alzheimer's Disease Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#946;&#8208;secretase&#8208;responsive immunotherapeutic agent can synergistically target amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) pathology and innate immunity, achieving a heightened efficacy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment while reducing the side effects associated with conventional antibody therapeutics.








Abstract
Recent progress in antibody&#8208;based immunotherapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) brings a sense of cautious optimism after years of setbacks. However, these approaches remain constrained by suboptimal pharmacodynamics, modest clinical benefits, and pro&#8208;inflammatory adverse effects. Here, we develop a &#946;&#8208;secretase&#8208;responsive immunotherapeutic agent (ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA) that synergistically targets amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) and neuroinflammatory response, achieving heightened efficacy while reducing the side effects associated with conventional antibody therapies. After intranasal administration, ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA actively migrates to AD brains. Upon cleavage by overexpressed &#946;&#8208;secretase, ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA releases aducanumab antibody (aA) and exosomes derived from A&#946; antigen&#8208;specific Tregs (ATExo), which jointly manage A&#946; and inflammatory microglia, thereby synergistically eradicating A&#946; and reducing pro&#8208;inflammatory responses. In AD mouse models, ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA demonstrates efficient brain accumulation, robust A&#946; removal, microglial normalization, neuroinflammation attenuation, and synaptic preservation, ultimately leading to improved cognitive function. These findings highlight ATExo&#8208;cL&#8208;aA as next&#8208;generation immunotherapeutics that transcend the limitations of conventional antibody&#8208;based treatments for AD.

         <title>Molecular Recognition Driven Organelle Cross&#8208;Linking Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction to Potentiate Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designed cyclodextrin and adamantane derivatives that respectively targets the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, achieving precise spatial manipulation at the organelle level through molecular recognition. This approach selectively induced abnormal ER&#8208;mitochondrial connections and ultimately led to strong immunogenic cell death. This supramolecular recognition&#8208;based strategy provides a new perspective for precision medicine.








Abstract
Organelles maintain cellular homeostasis through highly specialized division of labor, dynamic interactions, as well as extensive inter&#8208;organellar information exchange, thereby ensuring the physiological functions of organisms. Although functionalized polymers that target a specific organelle to modulate or disrupt their function have been developed for therapeutic applications, macromolecular systems capable of manipulating two or more types of key organelles remain rare. Here, we designed cyclodextrin and adamantane derivatives that can respectively target endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, to achieve precise spatial manipulation of both organelles at the subcellular organelle level via a specific molecular recognition approach. This approach selectively induced unusual junctions between the ER and mitochondria, disrupting their functional synergy, triggering multiple cellular stress responses, such as Ca2+ homeostasis imbalance, reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, energy metabolism disorder, and ultimately leading to severe immunogenic cell death (ICD). By converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors, this strategy provides a supramolecular perspective for tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Silylative Amide to Nitrile Conversion Mediated by Simple Lanthanide&#8211;Organoamides: Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described here is a LaNTMS mediated silylative conversion of primary amides to nitriles under neat reaction conditions. The reaction is highly efficient and selective under such solventless conditions, where all materials are commercially available, demonstrating the robustness and potential of lanthanide heteroatom catalysis.








Abstract
Efficient, selective, and environmentally benign catalytic nitrile synthesis is attractive for pharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals and materials, and large&#8208;scale industrial applications. In this regard, metal&#8208;catalyzed silylative conversion of primary amides to nitriles is emerging as a promising approach. This contribution reports the utilization of readily available lanthanide&#8208;organic amido precatalysts, Ln[N(SiMe3)2]3, Ln&#160;=&#160;lanthanide, to selectively convert primary alkyl and aryl/heterocyclic amides having diverse functional groups to nitriles, including pharma building blocks, in high yields using the silane reagents PhSiH3 and TMS&#8208;O&#8208;[Si(H)(Me)&#8208;O&#8208;]n&#8208;TMS in a solvent&#8208;free process. Kinetic and mechanistic data reveal the role of lanthanide amidates as the catalytically&#8208;active species, while DFT analysis indicates a catalytic pathway unlike that found in transition metal complex&#8208;catalyzed processes. Thus, the lanthanide amidate resting state actively participates in the catalysis, where rate&#8208;determining bound amidate silylation is activated by the metal center and influenced by the bound amidate electronic and steric characteristics. DFT analysis of the catalytic cycle reveals that the relative energies of three intermediate endergonic steps, hence the rate&#8208;determining step, depends on the silane concentration.

         <title>Fluorescent Peptide Tracers for Simultaneous Oxytocin Receptor Activation and Visualization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Illuminating the Oxytocin Receptor: Here we present the development of fluorescent peptide tracers for the simultaneous visualization and activation of the oxytocin receptor, an important G protein&#8208;coupled receptor involved in health and disease. These tracers are powerful new tools to support various imaging and functional studies across biological systems.








Abstract
The oxytocin receptor (OTR) regulates critical physiological functions and has been implicated in a range of diseases, including psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder. However, a lack of reliable molecular tools hampers the progress in understanding OTR's mechanistic roles in (patho)physiological processes. In this work, we addressed this gap and developed potent, selective, and bright fluorescent peptide tracers that enable precise spatial and functional investigations of OTR actions. Our tracers showed efficient OTR labeling, activation, and internalization in cellular bioassays in both live and fixed overexpression and primary cell systems, including those subjected to immunocytochemical protocols, highlighting their versatility as reliable new imaging tools. Additionally, they facilitated single&#8208;molecule tracking of OTR with live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution microscopy and were able to separate OTR&#8208;positive cells from mixed oxytocin and vasopressin receptor&#8208;containing cell populations via fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting, underscoring their wider scope for live&#8208;cell applications. In summary, we developed versatile fluorescent tracers based on the endogenous ligand oxytocin for both live&#8208;cell and post&#8208;hoc imaging that have additional functional capabilities beyond traditional antibody labeling, offering new avenues to explore OTR's role in health and disease.

         <title>Amyloid Peptide Nanofibrils Promote Efficient Neurotransmitter Oxidation and Serve as Scaffolds for Melanin Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short amyloid peptides can act as efficient catalysts of neurotransmitter degradation, and libraries of short peptides can be used to identify core fragments present in larger proteins that might be linked to neurodegenerative diseases. 








Abstract
We have shown that de novo designed peptides self&#8208;assemble in the presence of copper to create supramolecular assemblies capable of carrying out the oxidation of a range of neurotransmitters in the presence of dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide with high efficiency and in a sequence dependent manner. Moreover, these catalytic peptide assemblies are capable of templating melanin production. Guided by the structure activity relationships identified using the model systems we discovered that peptide assemblies formed by fragments of human carbonic anhydrase VII found in the brain also promote neurotransmitter degradation, supporting its role in neurodegenerative disease. Altogether, our results further support the role of metal&#8208;promoted catalysis in neurodegenerative disease and will facilitate development of new catalyst nanomaterials capable of promoting oxidative transformation.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Programmed Spatial Relay Catalysis on Co&#9472;Ag Dual Heterojunctions for Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion via Migratory *NO2 Shuttling</title>

         <dc:description>
A pulsed laser irradiates Ag&#8208;coated Co foil to create catalytic zones where irradiated areas convert NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; on hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;Co/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc)&#8208;Co and non&#8208;irradiated regions reduce NO2&#8722; to NH3 on Ag/hcp&#8208;Co heterojunctions. *NO2 intermediates shuttle between zones, with charge transfer promoting *NH2 protonation and suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The system achieves 94.8% NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;0.4&#160;V (versus RHE), showing a new spatial relay catalysis strategy for multi&#8208;step electrochemical processes.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) represents a sustainable strategy for wastewater treatment and green NH3 production; however, its efficiency is limited by sluggish reaction kinetics and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we propose a laser&#8208;programmed spatial relay catalysis strategy mediated by migratory *NO2 intermediate on Co&#9472;Ag dual heterojunctions. Site&#8208;selective laser irradiation of Ag&#8208;predeposited Co foil generates spatially segregated interfaces, where hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;Co/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc)&#8208;Co heterojunctions facilitate thermodynamically favorable NO3&#8722; deoxygenation, and Ag/hcp&#8208;Co interfaces promote kinetically enhanced NO2&#8722; protonation. Operando spectroscopic analysis, combined with electrochemical differential mass spectrometry (DEMS), confirms the migratory relay mechanism involving *NO2 transport between catalytic sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that interfacial charge redistribution enables distinct catalytic functions at interface sites. The phase&#8208;transformation&#8208;formed hcp&#8208;Co/fcc&#8208;Co heterojunctions enhance NO3&#8722; adsorption and reduce deoxygenation barriers, whereas Ag/hcp&#8208;Co interfaces suppress HER and promote *NO hydrogenation by lowering the rate&#8208;determining *NO&#8594;*NOH barrier to 0.25&#160;eV via Fermi&#8208;level d&#8208;band engineering. This collaborative spatial design reaches 94.8%&#160;&#177;&#160;3.4% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 in nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electroreduction at &#8722;0.4&#160;V (versus RHE), with 92.5% activity retention over 50 cycles. It highlights the promise of interface&#8208;driven relay catalysis in complex electrochemical systems and enables scalable electrode fabrication.

         <title>Continuous Dual Hydrogenation of Biomass Substrates in a Membrane&#8208;Free Solid Electrolyte Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalytic dual hydrogenation method has been developed using hydrazine and cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, enhancing continuous biomass conversion to succinic acid with substantial hydrogenation Faraday efficiency (200%) and long durability (200&#160;h, 100&#160;mA) in a membrane&#8208;free solid electrolyte reactor. This advancement highlights significant potential for sustainable green chemistry applications.








Abstract
Production of chemicals from biomass through electrocatalytic hydrogenation shows great potential to reduce environmental impact across various applications in sustainable materials, medicine, food, and more. Particularly, dual electrocatalytic hydrogenation, leveraging concurrent reactions at both anode and cathode stand out with maximized electron efficiency (&#8764;200%) and production yield. However, at higher voltages, anodic hydrogen atoms (H*) tend to revert to protons. This tendency results in challenges such as low conversion rates and selectivity, and difficulties in maintaining continuous production. Herein, by employing hydrazine and water as the hydrogen sources for anode and cathode reactions, respectively, we achieved efficient dual hydrogenation of maleic acid to succinic acid. This approach produces two H* atoms per electron transferred, promoting effective carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) bond formation at both cathode and anode. We further developed a modular, membrane&#8208;free solid electrolyte reactor for continuous dual hydrogenation of maleic acid using a commercial cobalt catalyst. By leveraging the hydrazine oxidation and water reduction, the reactor consistently produces succinic acid with a Faraday efficiency of approximately 180% for over 200&#160;h at 100&#160;mA. Our approach shows significant potential for practical applications in green chemistry, particularly in efficient biomass conversion.

However, at higher voltages, anodic hydrogen atoms (H&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) tend to revert to protons. This tendency results in challenges such as low conversion rates and selectivity, and difficulties in maintaining continuous production. Herein, by employing hydrazine and water as the hydrogen sources for anode and cathode reactions, respectively, we achieved efficient dual hydrogenation of maleic acid to succinic acid. This approach produces two H&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; atoms per electron transferred, promoting effective carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) bond formation at both cathode and anode. We further developed a modular, membrane-free solid electrolyte reactor for continuous dual hydrogenation of maleic acid using a commercial cobalt catalyst. By leveraging the hydrazine oxidation and water reduction, the reactor consistently produces succinic acid with a Faraday efficiency of approximately 180% for over 200&#160;h at 100&#160;mA. Our approach shows significant potential for practical applications in green chemistry, particularly in efficient biomass conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>trans&#8208;Silaboration of Terminal Alkynes Enabled by Development of a New Si&#9472;B Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a novel air&#8208;stable Si&#9472;B reagent, TBSQ, by installation of a 8&#8208;quinolinyl directing group on silicon atom. By employment of TBSQ, we successfully solved the puzzle on how to implement the trans&#8208;silaboration of termial alkynes, exclusively delivering diverse trans&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;2&#8208;silyl alkenes. Importantly, this transformation features broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. The silyl group and boryl group on products can be easily distinguished by a variety of stepwise derivatization.








Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;silaboration of alkynes is a powerful strategy for regio&#8208; and stereoselective yielding versatile 1&#8208;boryl&#8208;2&#8208;silyl alkenes, which are ubiquitous synthons leveraging the orthogonal reactivity of boron and silicon for diverse downstream transformations. However, it dominantly features cis&#8208;selectivity. trans&#8208;Selective silaboration remains underdeveloped to date, especially for sterically hindered terminal alkynes. Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed trans&#8208;silaboration of terminal alkynes using a novel Si&#9472;B reagent, TBSQ, bearing an 8&#8208;quinolinyl directing group on silicon. This strategy provides exclusive E&#8208;selectivity across a broad substrate scope, including bulky alkynes. Mechanistic studies suggest a combined cis&#8208;addition/Z&#8594;E isomerization pathway, with the directing group playing a crucial role. The resulting trans&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;2&#8208;silyl alkenes serve as valuable building blocks for selective downstream functionalization toward pharmaceutically relevant molecules.

         <title>Sulfinyl Aziridines as Stereoselective Covalent Destabilizing Degraders of the Oncogenic Transcription Factor MYC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports stereoselective sulfinyl aziridine covalent ligands that directly degrade the oncogenic transcription factor MYC by engaging intrinsically disordered cysteine C203. Lead compound KL2&#8208;236 destabilizes MYC and impairs transcription, while optimized analog KL4&#8208;219A achieves more potent, selective, and durable MYC degradation, highlighting new strategies to drug &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets. 








Abstract
Although MYC is a significant oncogenic transcription factor driver of cancer, directly targeting MYC has remained challenging due to its intrinsic disorder and poorly defined structure, deeming it &#8220;undruggable.&#8221; Whether transient pockets formed within unstructured regions of proteins can be selectively targeted with small molecules remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we developed a stereochemically paired spirocyclic oxindole aziridine covalent library and screened this library for degradation of MYC. We identified a hit covalent ligand, KL2&#8208;236, bearing a unique sulfinyl aziridine warhead, that engaged MYC as a pure MYC/MAX protein complex, and in cancer cells to destabilize MYC, inhibit MYC transcriptional activity and degrade MYC in a proteasome&#8208;dependent manner through targeting intrinsically disordered C203 and D205 residues. Notably, this reactivity was most pronounced for specific stereoisomers of KL2&#8208;236 with a diastereomer, KL4&#8208;019, that was largely inactive. Mutagenesis of both C203 and D205 completely attenuated KL2&#8208;236&#8208;mediated MYC degradation. We also optimized our KL2&#8208;236 hit compound to generate a more potent, selective, and durable MYC degrader, KL4&#8208;219A. Our results reveal a novel ligandable site within MYC and indicate that certain intrinsically disordered regions within transcription factors, such as MYC, can be interrogated by isomerically unique chiral small molecules, leading to destabilization and degradation.

         <title>Failure Mechanism of High&#8208;Temperature Li&#8211;S Batteries in Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insufficient Li2S dissociation and high polysulfide reactivity are determined to be dominant factors for the rapid performance deterioration of HT Li&#8211;S batteries in r&#8208;LHCE. To this end, B&#8208;LMCE featured by suitable anion concentration and weak solvation ability is developed, which concurrently alleviates electrolyte consumption, restricts polysulfide shuttling, and enables kinetically favorable sulfur redox reaction at elevated temperatures with a tailored electrochemical voltage range.








Abstract
Conventional ether&#8208;based electrolytes struggle to sustain steady operation of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries at high temperatures due to inferior thermal durability and aggravated parasitic reactions. Although localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance thermal stability, its deployment in high&#8208;temperature (HT) Li&#8211;S batteries has met with limited success. Herein, the failure mechanism of HT Li&#8211;S batteries in LHCE is revealed via probing sulfur redox reactions and electrolyte solvation chemistry. Slow reaction kinetics and high polysulfide reactivity are determined to be the dominant factors causing the rapid capacity deterioration at high temperatures. To this end, a diethylene glycol dibutyl ether&#8208;based localized medium concentration electrolyte (B&#8208;LMCE) with suitable anion concentration and weakly solvating effect is developed. The new electrolyte concurrently achieves fast cathode kinetics and stable anode/electrolyte interface. With the assistance of a tailored electrochemical voltage range of 1&#8211;3.8&#160;V, Li&#8211;S batteries sustain a durable cycling performance over 250 cycles at 60 &#176;C. They also showcase superior wide&#8208;temperature operation (0&#160;&#176;C&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C) while enabling feasible fabrication of Ah&#8208;level pouch cells. Our study opens a new avenue for designing extreme&#8208;temperature electrolytes toward pragmatic Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Defluorinative Fluoro&#8208;Aza&#8208;Nazarov Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular approach for construction of multi&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;fluoropyrrole is established via a Lewis acid mediated defluorinative fluoro&#8208;aza&#8208;Nazarov cyclization. With this method, a wide range of tetra&#8208;/penta&#8208;substituted fluoropyrroles are synthesized in a highly efficient manner. A Pd&#8208;catalyzed protocol is also developed as an alternative for access to tri&#8208;substituted fluoropyrrole through an allyl&#8208;Pd involved cycloisomerization.








Abstract
A highly efficient approach toward polysubstituted &#946;&#8208;fluoropyrroles is described herein. Starting from &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which is easily available from corresponding difluorinated silyl enol ether, an unprecedented defluorinative fluoro&#8208;aza&#8208;Nazarov cyclization mediated by TiCl4 is successfully developed, which enables expedient construction of fluorine&#8208;containing tetra&#8208;/penta&#8208;substituted pyrroles in moderate to excellent yields. The protocol features the use of inexpensive Lewis acid, insensitivity to steric hindrance and compatibility with substrates of different substitution patterns. Furthermore, a two&#8208;step sequence and also a one&#8208;pot protocol were established for synthesizing tri&#8208;substituted pyrroles bearing a 3&#8208;fluorine substituent, utilizing a Pd&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative fluoro&#8208;aza&#8208;Nazarov cyclization. This methodology provides a modular solution for the rapid assembly of structurally complex &#946;&#8208;fluoropyrrole scaffolds, which are notoriously difficult targets using previous methods. Mechanistic studies indicated a Ti&#8208;mediated allylic C&#9472;F bond activation pathway, triggering the unprecedented defluorinative Nazarov&#8208;type cyclization.

The protocol features the use of inexpensive Lewis acid, insensitivity to steric hindrance and compatibility with substrates of different substitution patterns. Furthermore, a two-step sequence and also a one-pot protocol were established for synthesizing tri-substituted pyrroles bearing a 3-fluorine substituent, utilizing a Pd-catalyzed defluorinative fluoro-aza-Nazarov cyclization. This methodology provides a modular solution for the rapid assembly of structurally complex &#946;-fluoropyrrole scaffolds, which are notoriously difficult targets using previous methods. Mechanistic studies indicated a Ti-mediated allylic C&#9472;F bond activation pathway, triggering the unprecedented defluorinative Nazarov-type cyclization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single Fusion Pore Analysis via Single Cell Amperometry Uncovers Impaired Pore Expansion That Restricts Insulin Exocytosis in Human Type 2 Diabetes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final step in insulin exocytosis from pancreatic beta cells is the formation of the fusion pore. We combined single&#8208;cell amperometry with microsensors and fluorescence microscopy to monitor insulin exocytosis from different perspectives. Our results reveal a link between impaired fusion pore function and diminished insulin secretion, highlighting an unexplored impact of diabetes and a potential therapeutic target.








Abstract
Insulin secretion from vesicles within pancreatic beta cells occurs through the rapid (&#8804;10 ms) process of exocytosis. A crucial final step in this process is the formation of a fusion pore, which connects the insulin vesicle interior to the extracellular space and insulin secretion rate. We employed real&#8208;time single&#8208;cell amperometry (SCA) with microsensors to quantitatively and dynamically monitor serotonin secretion (used as a proxy for insulin) and alterations in the dynamics of fusion pore formation, including opening, duration, and closing times, during single exocytosis events. Additionally, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy was used to track docked vesicles and optically measure insulin release. In beta cells from human organ donors with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the fusion pore opening was prematurely aborted, leading to diminished cargo release. Furthermore, the number of docked vesicles per beta cell differed between healthy donors and individuals with T2D. In conclusion, our combined super&#8208;sensitive optical and electrochemical analyses from a new perspective highlight a link between defective fusion pore dynamics and reduced insulin secretion (a hallmark of T2D) that has not been previously reported. These findings reveal the role of impaired fusion pore dynamics in T2D, independent of its underlying etiology, with potential therapeutic implications.

Developing single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs) with higher ambient ionic conductivity without compromising structural robustness has been challenging. In their Research Article (e202505232), Fang Lian, Zhaoxia Yang and co&#8208;workers report an adaptive 3D coordination electrolyte LiPHB prepared by chemical crosslinking of boron ion&#8208;centered lithium salt (LiT4PAB) as units with poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene). Due to abundant conformational transitions and electrostatic interactions, SICPEs achieved adaptive deformation and excellent interfacial stability upon solid&#8208;state battery cycling.

This review outlines major advances in the design, execution, analysis, and data management phases of high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). The limitations and potential opportunities of applying modern HTE to organic synthesis are highlighted. 








Abstract
High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE), the miniaturization and parallelization of reactions, is a valuable tool for accelerating diverse compound library generation, optimizing reaction conditions, and enabling data collection for machine learning (ML) applications. When applied to organic synthesis and methodology, HTE still poses various challenges due to the diverse workflows and reagents required, motivating advancements in reaction design, execution, analysis, and data management. To address these limitations, cutting&#8208;edge technologies, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI) have been implemented to standardize protocols, enhance reproducibility, and improve efficiency. Additionally, strategies to reduce bias and promote serendipitous discoveries have further strengthened HTE's impact. This review highlights recent advances at every stage of the HTE workflow, including the development of customized workflows, diverse analysis, and improved data management practices for greater accessibility and shareability. Furthermore, we examine the current state of the field, outstanding challenges, and future directions toward transforming HTE into a fully integrated, flexible, and democratized platform that drives innovation in organic synthesis.

         <title>Adaptive 3D Cross&#8208;Linked Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Polymer Electrolytes Enable Powerful Interface for Solid State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

An adaptive 3D&#8208;architechtured single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte LiPHB is designed with dynamic conformational changes under impact, integrating the advantages of natural rigidity and deformability in structural design, facilitating interface compatibility and lithium plating/stripping reversibility.








Abstract
Single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs) are designed by covalently bonding anions to the polymers, which is attractive for mitigating anion aggregation&#8208;derived polarization. However, one major challenge for developing SICPEs with higher ambient ionic conductivity comes at the expense of structural robustness. Here, boron ion&#8208;centered lithium salt (LiT4PAB) with symmetric cross structure and terminal functional C&#9552;C was proposed as a units, and then 3D coordination electrolyte (LiPHB) was constructed via chemical cross&#8208;linking of LiT4PAB with poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP). The boron ion&#8208;centered units catenated by single bonds show the abundant conformation transitions, enabling the deformable architecture of LiPHB with the aid of electrostatic interactions of diphenylsulfonimide. Therefore, LiPHB undergoes adaptive deformation when subjected to impact, achieving good ductility with elastic moduli of 1.4&#160;GPa and a maximum elongation of 447.4%. Moreover, LiPHB demonstrates 3D single lithium&#8208;ion transport channels to guide the homogeneous lithium deposition. As a results, lithium symmetric cells exhibit stable plating/stripping cycle for over 1500&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 30&#160;&#176;C. Li/LiPHB SICPEs/NCM811 solid&#8208;state batteries deliver a capacity retention of 90.3% in 150 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C and 0.2 C. Our study shed light on the design strategies of the dynamic single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes for solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>A Highly Transparent Thermoplastic Synthesized from Ethylene that Melts Above 200&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a highly transparent ethylene&#8208;based thermoplastic (transmittance of 92%, haze of 8% and clarity of 92%) with a very low density (0.86g cm&#8722;3) and an high melting point (up to 228&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Polyolefin&#8208;based thermoplastics are the most widely used polymers and produced in megaton scale. Their applicability depends strongly on the melting point, and a high&#8208;melting ethylene&#8208;based plastic would be highly desirable. Herein, we report the synthesis of isotactic poly(4&#8208;ethylhex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) (P4EH), a highly transparent and ethylene&#8208;based thermoplastic that melts above 220&#160;&#176;C and has an extremely low density. Molecular catalysts were used to synthesize atactic, syndiotactic, and isotactic P4EH with narrow molecular weight distributions. Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts were used to synthesize isotactic and processable P4EH. Processable i&#8208;P4EH was used to produce discs, and a transmittance of 92%, a haze of 8% and a clarity of 92% were measured. In addition, a density of 0.86&#160;g cm&#8722;3 was observed.

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Reduction of Non&#8208;Neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;covalent organic framework nanosheet constructed from an asymmetric tridentate ligand structure was designed for the photoreduction of CO2 to syngas under different contents of CO2 and natural sunlight. The carboxyl group in the asymmetric tridentate ligand structure facilitated dissociation of water to generate *H by hydrogen bond. Moreover, *H assists CO2 (g) adsorption and lowers the energy barrier for *COOH formation.








Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2 where CO2 enrichment and purification is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with an asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst, Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits a widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the covalent organic frame (COF) by the formation of atomically dispersed N&#8211;Co&#8211;O4 sites and enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction of CO2 to syngas.

         <title>Tailored Selectivity for CO and C2+ in CO2 Reduction: Insights into the Dynamic Evolution of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine is introduced as a heteroatom to modulate the structure of copper&#8208;based pre&#8208;catalysts during electrochemical CO2 reduction. The dynamic surface reconstruction and formation of undercoordinated grain boundaries define the real catalytic sites and affect CO and C2+ product selectivity. This offers a strategy for catalyst design and informs principles for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion.








Abstract
Controlling product selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) is critical for efficient CO2 conversion. However, the dynamic structural changes of Cu&#8208;based catalysts during operation complicate mechanistic understanding. Here, we investigate fluorine&#8208;modified copper pre&#8208;catalysts with varying doping levels and reveal how their structural evolution governs eCO2R activity and selectivity. Through operando spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical simulations, we show that fluorine leaches rapidly during electrolysis, transforming Cu2&#8314; precursors into metallic Cu&#8304; with distinct local structures. Cu&#8208;F&#8208;4, with the lowest coordination number, exhibits high eCO2R activity and favors CO formation with a Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 81% at &#8722;0.45&#160;V. In contrast, Cu&#8208;F&#8208;1, enriched in grain boundaries and Cu(100) facets, achieves a high FEC2+ of 80% at &#8722;0.65&#160;V. Differences in local pH, *OH coverage, and *CO binding energies further modulate catalytic pathways. Our findings highlight the importance of dynamic catalyst reconstruction in steering product selectivity and offer design principles for advancing CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion.

Here, we investigate fluorine-modified copper pre-catalysts with varying doping levels and reveal how their structural evolution governs eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R activity and selectivity. Through operando spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical simulations, we show that fluorine leaches rapidly during electrolysis, transforming Cu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; precursors into metallic Cu&#8304; with distinct local structures. Cu-F-4, with the lowest coordination number, exhibits high eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R activity and favors CO formation with a Faradaic efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) of 81% at &#8722;0.45&#160;V. In contrast, Cu-F-1, enriched in grain boundaries and Cu(100) facets, achieves a high FE&lt;sub&gt;C2+&lt;/sub&gt; of 80% at &#8722;0.65&#160;V. Differences in local pH, *OH coverage, and *CO binding energies further modulate catalytic pathways. Our findings highlight the importance of dynamic catalyst reconstruction in steering product selectivity and offer design principles for advancing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-chemicals conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Folding Synthons for Designing Superselective and Ultrapermeable Artificial Water Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

Butterfly&#8208;shaped nanotubes of 3.7&#160;nm in average length and 6.7&#160;&#197; in pore diameter demonstrate an ultrafast water conduction rate of 2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;H2O s&#8722;1 per channel, outperforming the naturally occurred aquaporin 1 by 140% respectively while concurrently achieving high rejections of both salts (i.e., NaCl and KCl) and protons.








Abstract
Water transport across biological membranes is essential for life, facilitated by water channel proteins like aquaporins (AQPs). Drawing inspiration from these natural systems, artificial water channels (AWCs) have emerged as transformative tools for advancing industrial and environmental applications. Herein, we report the design and comprehensive characterization of a groundbreaking class of AWCs, derived from unprecedented butterfly&#8208;shaped aromatic folding synthons, carefully engineered to emulate the functional attributes of natural AQPs. These foldamers, with their intricate helical architectures, exhibit exceptional water transport performance. Remarkably, the highest&#8208;performing AWC achieves an ultrafast water transport rate of 2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;H2O s&#8722;1 per channel&#8212;2.4 times the efficiency of AQP1&#8212;without the need for lipid anchors to preserve its functional orientation within phospholipid bilayers, while effectively excluding salts such as NaCl and KCl, along with protons. This work presents an ideal bio&#8208;inspired, high&#8208;performance artificial alternative to natural systems, demonstrating the remarkable potential of foldamer&#8208;based AWCs as next&#8208;generation solutions for tackling critical challenges in water purification and desalination.

A modular self&#8208;assembling platform ATPlug has been developed that integrates three critical domains: a self&#8208;trimerizing Tri module for enhanced binding avidity, a SpyCatcher domain that enables rapid conjugation, and an albumin&#8208;binding domain that improves circulation half&#8208;life and tissue selectivity. This platform allows rapid customization of multivalent artificial antibodies and modular ADCs with enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profiles, offering a versatile toolkit for drug development.








Abstract
Modular assembly of multivalent therapeutics with precise modulation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties remains a critical challenge in drug development. Here, we present ATPlug, a self&#8208;assembling protein platform that integrates three crucial functional modules: a trimerization domain to enhance avidity, a SpyCatcher module for efficient conjugation, and an albumin&#8208;binding domain to optimize pharmacokinetics and tissue selectivity. This rational design facilitates the modular assembly of multivalent artificial antibodies and antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs), demonstrating remarkable versatility through the successful incorporation of diverse therapeutic modules targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The trivalent constructs exhibited up to 30&#8208;fold enhancement in target binding avidity and extended plasma half&#8208;life via endogenous albumin hitchhiking. Notably, the ATPlug&#8208;customized modular ADCs achieved binding affinities of 1.8&#160;nM for EGFR and exhibited selective cytotoxicity toward EGFR&#8208;overexpressing tumor cells, resulting in potent tumor suppression efficacy. This plug&#8208;and&#8208;play strategy provides a framework for next&#8208;generation therapeutics combining customized multivalency with multidrug synergies.

         <title>Engineering Spin State of Atomic Iron Centers for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that spin state modulation of single Fe sites on TiO2, achieved through crystal phase engineering and F&#8208;doping, boosts photocatalytic nitrogen reduction efficiency by optimizing N2 adsorption/desorption equilibrium, suppressing Fe's magnetic moment, reducing activation energy barriers, and enhancing binding to reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Electronic structures fundamentally influence material properties, with electron spin playing a pivotal role in defining catalytic activity and reaction pathways. However, the precise spin&#8208;mediated mechanisms of adsorption energies and nitrogen&#8211;nitrogen transition states on the catalyst surface, remain unclear due to the complexity of spin&#8208;mediated promotion factors. Herein, we demonstrate that tuning the spin state of single iron (Fe) sites on TiO2 can significantly enhance photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Our theoretical predictions reveal that low spin states of single Fe sites facilitate N2 adsorption and intermediate formation, thereby activating more catalytic sites on TiO2 for efficient nitrogen fixation. By manipulating the crystal phase and incorporating fluorine dopants, we systematically modulate the spin states of Fe sites, achieving optimized N2 adsorption and desorption kinetics and suppressing charge recombination. Experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that these modifications reduce the magnetic moment of Fe sites, lower free energy barriers, and strengthen electronic interactions with key intermediates, particularly during N&#9472;NH formation. Intriguingly, we find that weakening N2 adsorption via reduced Fe magnetization enhances catalytic performance, challenging conventional assumptions that stronger N&#9472;N bond activation necessarily improves NRR efficiency. Our experimental results corroborate these findings, showing a remarkable 72&#8208;fold increase in ammonia production rate compared to pristine TiO2. This work highlights the crucial role of electron spin engineering in designing highly efficient NRR catalysts and provides a new paradigm for rational catalyst design.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Emission of Congruently Melting Iodocuprate Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids based on a 2D or 1D CuI2&#8722; iodocuprate network, which have low congruent melting temperatures allowing the solvent&#8208;free preparation of thin films, exhibit excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent emission: upon excitation at high energy (inorganic network) a strong yellow emission of STE type occurs, whereas upon excitation at low energy (organic component), a red emission originating from iodide vacancies (&#9633;(I&#8722;)) is observed.








Abstract
In the context of the emergence of metal halide perovskites for optoelectronic materials, the lead&#8208;free and earth&#8208;abundant copper(I)&#8208;based halide hybrids are of high interest. Here, we report on two iodocuprate hybrids (HO2C(CH2)n&#8208;1NH3)CuI2 (n&#160;=&#160;3, 4) exhibiting excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent emission. The thermodynamically stable n&#160;=&#160;4 compound (2D&#8208;C4) is based on a rare 2D iodocuprate network, while a more common 1D network of edge&#8208;sharing tetrahedra is found both in the n&#160;=&#160;3 compound (1D&#8208;C3) and in the metastable n&#160;=&#160;4 (1D&#8208;C4) hybrid. Depending on the excitation wavelength, 2D&#8208;C4 and 1D&#8208;C3 hybrids exhibit yellow emission, red emission, or white light emission&#8212;resulting from the emission of both components,&#8212;while 1D&#8208;C4 does not emit in the red region. The description of the electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) indicates two different origins for the emissions of 2D&#8208;C4 and 1D&#8208;C3, in particular from iodide vacancies (red emission), which involve mid&#8208;gap states. The emission of 2D&#8208;C4 can also be modulated from red to yellow depending on applied pressure. 2D&#8208;C4 also has an exceptionally low congruent melting temperature of 110 &#176;C, allowing the solvent&#8208;free preparation of thin films. Finally, phosphor&#8208;converted&#8208;LED based on 2D&#8208;C4 have been prepared, showing that either pink or nearly white emission is produced.

The thermodynamically stable &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;4 compound (2D-C4) is based on a rare 2D iodocuprate network, while a more common 1D network of edge-sharing tetrahedra is found both in the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;3 compound (1D-C3) and in the metastable &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;4 (1D-C4) hybrid. Depending on the excitation wavelength, 2D-C4 and 1D-C3 hybrids exhibit yellow emission, red emission, or white light emission&#8212;resulting from the emission of both components,&#8212;while 1D-C4 does not emit in the red region. The description of the electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) indicates two different origins for the emissions of 2D-C4 and 1D-C3, in particular from iodide vacancies (red emission), which involve mid-gap states. The emission of 2D-C4 can also be modulated from red to yellow depending on applied pressure. 2D-C4 also has an exceptionally low congruent melting temperature of 110 &#176;C, allowing the solvent-free preparation of thin films. Finally, phosphor-converted-LED based on 2D-C4 have been prepared, showing that either pink or nearly white emission is produced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the Full Potential of SERS: Merging Direct and Indirect Approaches for Enhanced Analysis of Multiplex Plasticizer Analogs in Matrices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive structural profiling of plasticizer analogs is achieved by merging both direct and indirect surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy (SERS). By accumulating the intrinsic signals and functional group&#8208;specific information of the three main functional groups, our platform enables accurate multiplexing of plasticizer analogs in complex oil matrices.








Abstract
Rapid and accurate identification of harmful plasticizer analogs in their native matrix is crucial for contaminant monitoring across industries. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) shows promise for detecting structurally similar analogs but faces challenges like subtle receptor signal changes and distortion with weakly adsorbing plasticizer analytes. We address these limitations by integrating direct and indirect SERS to capture intrinsic Raman signals and receptor&#8208;analyte interactions, achieving 100% classification accuracy eight plasticizer analogs and multiplex quantification of three major plasticizers extracted from canola oil with&#160;&lt;&#160;5% predictive errors at a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01&#160;mg L&#8722;1, despite interference from other lipophilic contaminants such as adipates. Experimental SERS data and interaction energy calculations affirm that direct SERS detects alkyl chains, while indirect SERS identifies aromatic rings and carboxyl groups in eight plasticizer analogs with varying alkyl structures. A hybrid direct&#8208;indirect superspectrum was constructed, enabling the differentiation of eight analogs via Partial&#8208;Least&#8208;Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS&#8208;DA) and further analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) reveals equal contribution from all platforms, which highlights their complementary roles. These findings pave the way for broader applications in rapid, on&#8208;site detection of complex contaminants across industries.

         <title>A Versatile DNAzyme&#8208;Amplified Protease&#8208;Sensing Platform for Accurate Diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Reliable Classification of Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile DNAzyme&#8208;amplified protease&#8208;sensing (DP) platform was developed through the ingenious integration of positively charged peptides and DNAzyme (Dz) for the rapid detection of various target proteases. This platform exhibits superior sensitivity compared to traditional nonamplified protease&#8208;sensing (PP) platforms, thereby enabling the accurate diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and reliable classification of colorectal cancer (CRC).








Abstract
Peptide&#8208;based biosensors are widely used for in vitro detection of protease activity but often suffer from the limited sensitivity, poor accuracy, and incompatibility with point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) devices. Herein, we developed a versatile deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme)&#8208;amplified protease&#8208;sensing (DP) platform that integrates the positively charged oligopeptides with a negatively charged DNAzyme biocatalyst for highly&#8208;sensitive protease detection. The system leverages the electrostatic peptide&#8211;DNAzyme interactions to inhibit DNAzyme catalytic activity, which is reactivated upon the protease&#8208;triggered peptide hydrolysis, thus enabling an efficient signal amplification via the successive cleavage of DNAzyme substrate. Compared to conventional peptide&#8208;based sensing platform, our DP system offers an enhanced sensitivity and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and is highly modular for detecting various clinically relevant proteases through a simple replacement of the peptide blocker. By introducing a dual&#8208;enzyme recognition mechanism, we developed a dual&#8208;protease&#8208;triggered DP platform for enabling the accurate detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 proteases in saliva. We also applied the DP platform to differentiate between normal and cancerous colon cells and tissues by detecting colorectal cancer (CRC)&#8208;associated proteases. Overall, this work introduces a universal and scalable biosensing strategy for activity&#8208;based protease detection with potential applications in both infectious disease diagnostics and cancer classification, advancing the field of DNAzyme&#8208;based POCT technologies.

         <title>Retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;Triggered Supramolecular Polymerization of Tetrabenzoporphyrin into Pyramidal Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative supramolecular polymerization of a poorly soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin derivative with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties has been accomplished by applying the thermal precursor approach with the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in the system. Furthermore, the polymerization leads to the formation of unique pyramid&#8208;like multilayer structures with a spiral nature.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization of &#960;&#8208;extended compounds with hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites remains challenging, especially at high concentrations, due to their limited solubility in nonpolar solvents. Herein, we report a novel method incorporating a thermal precursor approach for the supramolecular polymerization of a poorly soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) derivative with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites and chiral cholesterol groups (BPChol). Polymerization in the nonpolar solvent tetralin is induced by the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of the highly soluble precursor (CPChol) to BPChol in the hot solution and subsequent natural cooling, as confirmed by monitoring absorption spectra. The emergence of circular dichroism signals corroborates the formation of aggregates with supramolecular chirality, as the first chiroptical characterization of BP aggregates. Detailed structural analysis using high&#8208;resolution microscopies reveals a unique pyramidal multilayer structure with a spiral nature. Additionally, faster cooling produces monolayer nanosheets, which differ from the multilayer structures formed upon natural cooling. This is due to a different nucleation process in the cooperative polymerization. By using the nanosheets as seeds, seed&#8208;induced polymerization is achieved, resulting in extended sheets. Notably, the indirect precursor method using CPChol enables outstanding polymerization at high concentrations (mM level) to afford micro&#8208;sized pyramids, which cannot be realized by a direct method using BPChol.

         <title>Promiscuity in Molecular Mimics of the Cysteine Dioxygenase: Effects of Selenium in the Substrate and Cobalt as the Central Metal Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic model for the cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) was found to be also capable of selectively dioxygenating selenocysteamine, suggesting that the lack of reactivity found for the CDO in combination with selenocysteine originates in the protein matrix. The corresponding cobalt complex mediates the dioxygenation of selenocysteamine, too, and thus represents the first example of a molecular cobalt complex that is potent to activate O2 for the dioxygenation of a substrate.








Abstract
Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) catalyzes the conversion of cysteine with dioxygen to yield cysteine sulfinic acid, which lies at the branching point of cysteine catabolism. Despite many years of research there are still many questions related to its functioning. Thus, CDO is inactive with selenocysteine (Sec) or when the central iron ion is replaced by cobalt. In this context, we report here biomimetic CDO models with bound selenocysteamine substrate ligands, namely [TpMesFe(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)] and [TpMes*Fe(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)] (with TpMes&#160;=&#160;hydrotris(3&#8208;mesitylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate, TpMes* = hydrobis((3&#8208;mesitylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)(5&#8208;mesitylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate) and in addition a cobalt&#8208;analogue [TpMesCo(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)]. Upon treatment of the Fe/Se homologues with O2 &#8211; as in case of the parent cysteamine&#8208;bound complexes &#8211; the dioxygenation of the chalcogen atoms was observed. This suggests that the lack in reactivity of CDO&#8208;Sec toward O2 does not originate in the electronic situation but in the surrounding protein matrix. Subsequent DFT calculations indeed showed lower initial barriers for selenocysteamine than for cysteamine in support of the experimental work. The complex [TpMesCo(Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)], where Fe is formally replaced by Co, also reacts with dioxygen &#8211; more slowly but selectively &#8211; to give [TpMesCo(O2Se&#8208;CH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;NH2)]. Hence, this is an experimental observation of a dioxygenation with O2 mediated by a cobalt center in a molecular compound, which is so far without precedence.

In this context, we report here biomimetic CDO models with bound selenocysteamine substrate ligands, namely [Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;Fe(Se-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] and [Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes*&lt;/sup&gt;Fe(Se-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] (with Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;=&#160;hydrotris(3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)borate, Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes*&lt;/sup&gt; = hydrobis((3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)(5-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)borate) and in addition a cobalt-analogue [Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;Co(Se-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. Upon treatment of the Fe/Se homologues with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8211; as in case of the parent cysteamine-bound complexes &#8211; the dioxygenation of the chalcogen atoms was observed. This suggests that the lack in reactivity of CDO-Sec toward O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does not originate in the electronic situation but in the surrounding protein matrix. Subsequent DFT calculations indeed showed lower initial barriers for selenocysteamine than for cysteamine in support of the experimental work. The complex [Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;Co(Se-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)], where Fe is formally replaced by Co, also reacts with dioxygen &#8211; more slowly but selectively &#8211; to give [Tp&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;Co(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. Hence, this is an experimental observation of a dioxygenation with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mediated by a cobalt center in a molecular compound, which is so far without precedence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single Ag Atoms Induce Ag&#8208;N/O Bonds on WO3 for Ultrastable Acid Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonding on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis. The catalyst maintains a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of &#8764;94%.








Abstract
Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The resultant catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeding &#8764;90% over a potential range of &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. Importantly, the catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of &#8764;94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), we succeeded in obtaining an NH3 production rate of 12.75 mmol h&#8722;1 at &#8722;4&#160;V and maintained the stability for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis have demonstrated that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, thereby considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities. This work provides insights into acidic nitrate reduction for ammonia electrosynthesis, which develops corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalysts for energy conversion.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Radical C(sp2)&#8722;H Trifluorovinylation of (Hetero)arenes with a Trifluorovinyl Iodine(III) Reagent (TrFVI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis of trifluorovinyl hypervalent iodine reagent [ArI(CF&#160;=&#160;CF2)OTf] (TrFVI) has been successfully developed using bulk chemical HFC&#8208;134a. Light&#8208;induced radical C(sp2)&#8211;H trifluorovinylation of (hetero)arenes with TrFVI reagent is achieved and exhibits good functional group compatibility. Detailed mechanism studies show a plausible radical chain pathway.








Abstract
Trifluorovinyl group is an emerging and valuable motif in drug discovery and material science, especially in polymer&#8208;related researches. However, the practical and efficient synthesis of trifluorovinylated compounds with broad structural diversity still remains a challenging task. Herein, we report the scalable synthesis of a trifluorovinyl hypervalent iodine(III) reagent, ArI(CF &#9552; CF2)OTf (TrFVI), from a bulk chemical, HFC&#8208;134a. The first C(sp2)&#9472;H trifluorovinylation of (hetero)arenes is achieved using TrFVI reagent via photoredox catalysis, which shows good functional group compatibility. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage trifluorovinylation of highly modified substrates, including drug candidates, is achieved to illustrate the powerfulness of our method. A possible radical pathway is proposed according to the mechanism study.

Abstract
In this study, an enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;bis(allenes) to furnish 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208; and vinyl&#8208;substituted five&#8208;membered (hetero)cycles in high yields and with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity is presented. The possibility of further functionalization to access different chiral cyclic and bicyclic skeletons is provided by the two orthogonal functional groups (alkyne and alkene). We also demonstrate the scalability of the reaction through a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and illustrate the synthetic utility of the resulting 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208; and vinyl&#8208;substituted cyclic product via several transformations. The proposed reaction mechanism is supported by both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments.

         <title>NitrOFF: An Engineered Fluorescent Biosensor to Illuminate Nitrate Transport in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a first&#8208;generation, two&#8208;domain biosensor for nitrate named NitrOFF is reported. The power of directed evolution over seven rounds has unlocked this sensing potential. The integration of in vitro spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography provides insights into the allostery driving the turn&#8208;off fluorescence response. Finally, fluorescence imaging with NitrOFF reveals its potential to illuminate nitrate uptake and modulation in mammalian cells.








Abstract
The duality of nitrate is nowhere better exemplified than in human physiology&#8212;a detrimental pollutant but also a protective nutrient&#8212;particularly as connected to nitric oxide. Aside from limited insights into nitrate uptake and storage, foundational nitrate biology has lagged. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors can address this gap with real&#8208;time imaging, but such technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare. Here, we designed and engineered a biosensor fusing the green fluorescent protein EGFP and the nitrate recognition domain NreA from Staphylococcus carnosus. Seven rounds of directed evolution and 15 mutations resulted in NitrOFF. NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between the domains reflected in a turn&#8208;off intensiometric response (Kd &#8776; 9&#160;&#181;M). This was further reinforced by X&#8208;ray crystal structures of apo and nitrate&#8208;bound NitrOFF, which revealed a large&#8208;scale conformational rearrangement changing the relative positioning of the domains by 68.4&#176;. This dramatic difference was triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered linker connecting the two domains, peeling the &#946;7 strand off the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate binding. Finally, we highlighted the utility of NitrOFF to monitor exogenous nitrate uptake and modulation in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line.

&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; &#8776; 9&#160;&#181;M). This was further reinforced by X-ray crystal structures of apo and nitrate-bound NitrOFF, which revealed a large-scale conformational rearrangement changing the relative positioning of the domains by 68.4&#176;. This dramatic difference was triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered linker connecting the two domains, peeling the &#946;7 strand off the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate binding. Finally, we highlighted the utility of NitrOFF to monitor exogenous nitrate uptake and modulation in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Deoxygenation of Esters for the Synthesis of Sterically Hindered Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for accessing sterically hindered ethers via reductive deoxygenation of readily prepared ester starting materials is reported. Employing commercially available and bench&#8208;stable IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF3)2]3)2 (1&#8211;2 mol%) and tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS) as reductant, this single&#8208;vessel approach operates under mild conditions and provides a range of alkyl, aryl, and benzyl ethers&#8212;both acyclic and cyclic&#8212;in good to excellent yields.








Abstract
The synthesis of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208;tertiary and &#946;&#8208;quaternary (neopentylic) ethers has long been constrained by the limitations of traditional SN2 and related SN1 approaches, namely low or inexistent reactivity arising from severe steric hindrance or competitive elimination/rearrangement pathways diverting the reaction outcome. Herein, we describe a general solution to the synthesis of sterically hindered ethers via an iridium&#8208;catalyzed reductive deoxygenation reaction of readily available ester and lactone starting materials. Employing commercially available, bench&#8208;stable IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF3)2]3)2 as a precatalyst at 1 mol% loading with 4 equivalents of tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS) as the terminal reductant at room temperature, this practical synthetic approach to hindered ethers features a simple, mix&#8208;and&#8208;stir, single&#8208;vessel protocol under ambient conditions and produces a diverse range of both acyclic and cyclic ether products in good to excellent yields. Control experiments demonstrated that the IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF3)2]3)2/TMDS catalytic system could not only rapidly hydrosilylate esters to mixed silyl/alkyl hemiacetal intermediates but also catalyze the reduction of acetals directly to ethers, revealing the Lewis acidic and hydridic properties required for this deoxygenative transformation.

         <title>Protein&#8211;Protein Complex Stability Controls Substrate Scope in a &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Reductase Specific for Medium Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme&#8208;ACP complex stability can control substrate preference. Molecular simulations of (top) EcFabG bound to &#946;&#8208;ketobutyryl&#8208;ACP show salt bridges that are not present when (bottom) PpFabG4 binds to the same substrate. EcFabG is active on all chain lengths, but PpFabG4 prefers long chains, which stabilize the enzyme&#8211;ACP complex. By adding stabilizing mutations (red to blue), we can increase its activity on short&#8208;chain substrates by over 100&#8208;fold.








Abstract
Assembly&#8208;line enzymes carry out multistep synthesis of important metabolites by using acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) to shuttle intermediates along defined sequences of active sites. Despite longstanding interest in reprogramming these systems for metabolic engineering and biosynthetic chemistry, the mechanisms underlying their reaction order remain poorly understood and difficult to control. Here we describe a &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP reductase from Pseudomonas putida (PpFabG4) with an unusual selectivity for medium chains and use it to explore the molecular basis of substrate specificity in enzymes that pull intermediates from fatty acid synthesis, a common route to specialized products. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows no obvious barriers to short&#8208;chain binding. Molecular simulations and supporting mutational analyses indicate that substrate preference arises instead from a weak enzyme&#8211;ACP interaction that is stabilized by medium acyl chains but not by short chains. Indeed, mutations that strengthen this interaction for PpFabG4 or weaken it for EcFabG, an Escherichia coli &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP reductase with a broad substrate specificity, can enhance or reduce activity on short&#8208;chain substrates by over 100&#8208;fold. Our findings show how the stability of enzyme&#8208;ACP interactions can control substrate scope in promiscuous enzymes and guide the exchange of intermediates between (and within) assembly&#8208;line systems.

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

Pd and In were chosen to jointly regulate the degree of water involvement during eCO2RR. With aco&#8208;doping ratio of 50:2 (Cu:Pd/In&#160;=&#160;50:2), we achieved a variation from 95% C1 to 70% C2 by changing the ratio of Pd:In. In situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement reveal the positive correlation between the C2 product selectivity and water involvement. Modulating CO2RR via isolated water induction offers a novel catalyst design strategy to boost C2 products.








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8211;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.

         <title>Alkaline Earth Metal&#8208;Based Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite&#8208;Like Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of alkaline&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics has been successfully synthesized for the first time, with (pyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO4)3 serving as a typical representative. Combined with excellent comprehensive ferroelectric properties, ease of preparation and good plasticity, this discovery provides a brand&#8208;new structural paradigm for hybrid perovskite and highlights promise in emerging flexible applications.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) with the ABX3 formula have garnered significant scientific interest owing to their substantial technological promise in photovoltaics, optoelectronics and ferroelectrics. Their structural diversity and molecular&#8208;scale chemical programmability provide an exceptional platform for engineering diverse functional HOIP architectures through targeted compositional design. However, the strategic potential of alkaline earth metals (e.g., Ca, Sr, and Ba) in HOIP assembly remains largely unexplored, with ferroelectric implementations yet to be realized, despite their historical roots in perovskite evolution dating back to the eponymous CaTiO3 mineral discovered in 1839. Here, for the first time, we report a new family of alkaline earth metal&#8208;based HOIP&#8208;like ferroelectrics. Benefiting from three&#8208;dimensional cage&#8208;like structure and multiaxial characteristics, (pyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO4)3 as a representative shows pronounced ferroelectricity with robust polarization switching in both bulk single crystals and compressed polycrystalline powder pellets. Molecular fluorination strategy on pyrrolidinium cation further optimizes the comprehensive ferroelectric properties (R&#8208;3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO4)3, enhancing Curie temperature, increasing polar axes and doubling polarization values. Combined with their easy preparation and good plasticity, this discovery provides a brand&#8208;new structural paradigm for HOIP ferroelectrics and highlights exceptional promise in emerging flexible ferroelectric applications.

However, the strategic potential of alkaline earth metals (e.g., Ca, Sr, and Ba) in HOIP assembly remains largely unexplored, with ferroelectric implementations yet to be realized, despite their historical roots in perovskite evolution dating back to the eponymous CaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; mineral discovered in 1839. Here, for the first time, we report a new family of alkaline earth metal-based HOIP-like ferroelectrics. Benefiting from three-dimensional cage-like structure and multiaxial characteristics, (pyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a representative shows pronounced ferroelectricity with robust polarization switching in both bulk single crystals and compressed polycrystalline powder pellets. Molecular fluorination strategy on pyrrolidinium cation further optimizes the comprehensive ferroelectric properties (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-3-fluoropyrrolidinium)Ba(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, enhancing Curie temperature, increasing polar axes and doubling polarization values. Combined with their easy preparation and good plasticity, this discovery provides a brand-new structural paradigm for HOIP ferroelectrics and highlights exceptional promise in emerging flexible ferroelectric applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving Charge Extraction and Operational Stability in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Conjugated Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated block copolymers, featuring a polyfluorene block for rapid electron transport and a quaternized conjugated block that effectively passivates both cation and anion defects, serve as interfacial modulators in inverted perovskite solar cells, achieving an efficiency of 26.11% with exceptional long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
A defect&#8208;passivated, electronically benign interface is essential for high&#8208;performance, stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Most conventional surface passivation strategies frequently introduce electrically resistive interlayers that compromise charge transport/extraction between the perovskite and charge&#8208;transport layers. We resolve this challenge through the rational implementation of all&#8208;conjugated block copolymers (CBCPs). The CBCPs demonstrate dual&#8208;functional capabilities of offering charge transport channels while facile integrating multiple defect&#8208;passivating moieties, thereby enabling efficient charge carrier transport and defect passivation. This dual&#8208;functional synergy yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.11% in our best device. The target PSCs maintained &gt;90% of their initial PCEs after maximum power point tracking for &gt;1400&#160;hours at 65&#160;&#176;C. This approach offers a promising strategy for interface engineering that improves both charge extraction and defect reduction using conjugated block copolymers.

         <title>Harnessing Electrochemistry for Direct Deoxygenative Silylation of Alcohols and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically driven deoxygenative C&#9472;Si bond formation strategy was developed for the synthesis of organosilicon compounds. The reactions operate under mild conditions without transition metal catalysts and sacrificial electrodes, providing an efficient avenue for the direct conversion of feedstock alcohols (1&#176;, 2&#176;, and 3&#176;) and ketones directly to valuable organosilanes.








Abstract
Alcohols and ketones are abundant and structurally diverse feedstocks, yet their direct transformation into organosilicon compounds remains challenging due to the difficulty in selective cleaving C&#9472;OH and C&#9552;O bonds. Here, we report an electrochemically driven deoxygenative C&#9472;Si bond formation strategy that converts alcohols and ketones directly to organosilicon compounds. The reactions operate under mild conditions without external redox reagents and sacrificial electrodes. A wide range of alcohols, including primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, as well as ketones, are efficiently converted to the corresponding organosilane products. Overall, this study provides a step&#8208;economical, highly efficient, and synthetically versatile platform for the direct conversion of feedstock chemicals into valuable organosilicon compounds.

         <title>Localized Hydrolysis&#8208;Based Proximity Reporting Platform for Protein Hierarchical Structure Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a localized hydrolysis&#8208;based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for protein hierarchical structure profiling across diverse biological specimens. LHPR enables quantitative mapping of protein&#8208;specific glycoforms and glycosylation stoichiometry dynamics during physiological transitions. This capability provides a powerful tool for the development of new glyco&#8208;markers and glyco&#8208;intervention&#8208;based personalized treatments.








Abstract
The substrate&#8208;specific bond cleavage capability of hydrolases provides a unique strategy for engineering off&#8208;on switches. This prompted our hypothesis that confining hydrolases and substrates to distinct biomolecular hierarchies (e.g., a protein and its modifying glycans) could enable transmission of spatial proximity information through localized hydrolysis. Using New Delhi metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase 1 (NDM&#8208;1), we developed a localized hydrolysis&#8208;based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for in situ elucidation of the hierarchical architecture of glycoproteins. We constructed protein probes by conjugating target&#8208;recognizing molecules with NDM&#8208;1, and designed click chemistry&#8208;reactive, substrate&#8208;caged fluorescent molecules as glycan probes. Programmed NDM&#8208;1 activity enabled in situ protein&#8208;specific imaging of glycans via proximity&#8208;dependent activation within various biological specimens. Within a unified enzymatic framework, we successfully quantified distinct glycans of individual proteins and established the principle of protein&#8208;specific glycosylation stoichiometry analysis. Our work provides a powerful tool for developing glycoprotein&#8208;based disease biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and diagnostic approaches, offering new possibilities for precision medicine research.

         <title>Architecture Engineering and Phase Engineering of Rhodium Metallene Co&#8208;Boost Nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium metallene nanoarchitectonics (Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR) integrating architecture engineering and phase engineering are well&#8208;designed to boost nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electroconversion. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique structure of Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR, which exposes more active sites due to its ultrathin nature and abundant pores. Meanwhile, amorphous regions enhance nitrite adsorption and lower the reaction energy barrier, guiding catalyst design.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) offers an effective strategy for sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis and N&#8208;pollutants wastewater degradation. Herein, we propose a dual&#8208;engineering strategy by combining architecture engineering and phase engineering on nanosheet&#8208;like rhodium metallene (Rh&#8208;NS) coupled with twisted nanoribbon&#8208;like rhodium metallene (Rh&#8208;NR) nanoarchitectonics (Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR) to boost NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electroconversion. Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR, characterized by a high density of unsaturated coordination sites and a large specific surface area, greatly enhances the adsorption capacity of NO2&#8722; and crucial intermediates and lowers the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NOH formation from *NO. Consequently, Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR exhibits satisfactory Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.7% and a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 44.3&#160;mg mgcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for NO2RR at high reduction potential (0.00&#160;V). Using Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR as cathode, the assembled zinc&#8211;nitrite battery delivers excellent discharge performance (24.2&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and promising NH3 synthesis capacity (5.96&#160;mg mgcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). This work not only guides the architecture&#8208;engineering design of metallene but also demonstrates the practical potential of zinc&#8211;nitrite batteries in integrated energy&#8208;environmental applications.

     alt="Architecture Engineering and Phase Engineering of Rhodium Metallene Co-Boost Nitrite-to-Ammonia Electroconversion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhodium metallene nanoarchitectonics (Rh-NS/Rh-NR) integrating architecture engineering and phase engineering are well-designed to boost nitrite-to-ammonia electroconversion. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique structure of Rh-NS/Rh-NR, which exposes more active sites due to its ultrathin nature and abundant pores. Meanwhile, amorphous regions enhance nitrite adsorption and lower the reaction energy barrier, guiding catalyst design.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Toward Narrow&#8208;Band, Stable Blue MR&#8208;TADF Emission via Combined Heterocyclic Analogues Marching B.T.2020</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust molecular design strategy for MR&#8208;TADF emitters via heterocyclic carbazole integration to strengthen weak C&#9472;N bonds was proposed. Blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters m&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA and tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA have achieved ultra&#8208;narrow FWHMs (24/21&#160;nm), high PLQYs (88%/95%), and record&#8208;high EQEs (23%/26%). The tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA OLED achieved LT90 of &#8764;81&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 for being among the longest for CIEy&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.10 blue OLEDs, approaching BT.2020 coordinates.








Abstract
The development of efficient and stable ultra&#8208;narrowband pure&#8208;blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is critical for next&#8208;generation wide&#8208;gamut OLED displays. Herein, we present a molecular design strategy that enhances emitter stability and efficiency by reinforcing the weak C&#9472;N bonds through selective incorporation of heterocyclic carbazole (Cz) units into the MR framework. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters, m&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA and tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA, were synthesized via high&#8208;yield, lithium&#8208;free borylation. These emitters exhibit pure&#8208;blue emissions at 453 and 463&#160;nm with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 24 and 21&#160;nm in solution and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 88% and 95%, respectively. OLED devices based on m&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA and tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA show emissions at 456&#160;nm (FWHM 24&#160;nm, EQEmax 23%, CIEy 0.06) and 467&#160;nm (FWHM 24&#160;nm, EQEmax 26%, CIEy 0.10), respectively, holding among the highest efficiencies for blue OLEDs without sensitizers. Notably, the tBu&#8208;Cz&#8208;DABNA&#8208;based device shows an LT90 of &#8764;81&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 (EQE 8.95%), representing one of the longest operational lifetimes for blue fluorescent OLEDs with CIEy&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.10. These results demonstrate a versatile and scalable molecular design strategy for the realization of high&#8208;efficiency, long&#8208;lifetime blue OLEDs approaching the BT.2020 color standard.

Sustainable Nickelaelectro&#8208;catalysis provided access &#946;&#8208;arylated pyrroles via an efficient anodic dehydrogenative C&#9472;H activation.








Abstract
Nickel electrocatalysis has emerged as a powerful strategy for sustainable C&#9472;H activation, offering an environmentally benign alternative to traditional methods based on stoichiometric oxidants. We, herein, report a nickela&#8208;electrocatalyzed approach for the expedient synthesis of &#946;&#8208;arylated pyrroles via a unique multiple dehydrogenative C&#9472;H activation approach. Hence, direct C&#9472;C bond formation between pyrroles and arenes was enabled, obviating the need for prefunctionalized substrates. The reaction proceeded under electrochemical conditions in a user&#8208;friendly undivided cell, utilizing electricity as a traceless oxidant. Mechanistic studies, including cyclic voltammetry, provided support for a nickel(II/III/IV) regime, wherein anodic oxidation facilitates the dehydrogenation and C&#9472;H activation paired with the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our findings highlight the potential of electrocatalysis to unlock distinct reaction manifolds and provides a sustainable platform for accessing complex heteroaryl frameworks.

         <title>Hooked for Decay with Hydrophobic&#8208;Coated Magnetic Beads to Grapple and Disintegrate Nanoplastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

Biohybrid catalysts based on the material&#8208;binding peptide LCI_F16C, which is conjugated with a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda cofactor, were immobilized on the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The immobilized biohybrid catalysts catalyzed a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles to form a hydrophobic polynorbornene film. These film&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibited bifunctional activity toward both capturing of nanoplastics and degrading of styrene&#8208;butadiene rubber nanoparticles.








Abstract
Degradation of synthetic polymers inevitably leads to the formation of nanoplastics (NPs), and recent studies associate health risks with NPs. Therefore, catching and degrading NPs are important to manage environmental and human health risks. In this study, we developed a biohybrid catalyst system with two functionalities to capture (Hook) and degrade (Decay) NPs. The biohybrid catalyst is composed of a Grubbs&#8208;Hoveyda (GH) type cofactor conjugated to the material&#8208;binding peptide LCI_F16C, which immobilizes the GH&#8208;cofactor onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The anchored biohybrid catalyst initiates a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization to generate a hydrophobic polynorbornene film around iron oxide core, which enables to efficiently capture and remove a broad spectrum of hydrophobic NPs, including polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and styrene&#8208;butadiene rubber (SBR), with hydrophobic interaction as the main driving force. This hydrophobic coating facilitated rapid adsorption of PS&#8208;COOH500 nm NPs within 10 min, reaching an impressive adsorption capacity of 5.53 &#177; 0.29&#160;g/g on PS NPs, and demonstrated a high recovery efficiency of 99% for SBR NPs. Notably, the embedded GH&#8208;cofactor preserved its ethenolysis activity, cleaving internal C&#9552;C bonds of SBR and resulting in 6.5% degradation, thereby validating the concept of simultaneous nanoplastic capture and catalytic breakdown.

         <title>Accelerated Porosity Screening Using a Multichannel Colorimetric Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput porosity screening method was developed for rapid porosity evaluation, offering a cost&#8208;effective and scalable approach to identifying candidate porous materials that is 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption methods with 98&#8211;100% classification accuracy. A multichannel six&#8208;dye array was used as a proxy measurement for porosity, eliminating false results that would result from the use of a single dye.








Abstract
Porous materials are important for many technologies, but the measurement of porosity by gas adsorption isotherms is slow, taking around one day per sample using a single&#8208;port gas sorption analyzer, even when using a &#8220;quick&#8221; analysis method with relatively few data points. With the increased use of automated platforms for material generation, porosity analysis is now frequently the bottleneck in the discovery of new porous materials. Here, we present a semiautomated pre&#8208;screening strategy that uses dye adsorption to create a colorimetric array that is combined with computer vision analysis for porosity screening. By using a six&#8208;dye multichannel array and a defined porosity threshold, our method rapidly screened 50 candidate materials that spanned molecular solids, polymers, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The method showed a 98&#8211;100% classification accuracy compared with gas uptake measurements. While this method is more qualitative than quantitative, it is more than 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption measurements, and it has the scope to be made much faster with greater parallelization and automation. This makes this colorimetric method suitable for pre&#8208;screening arrays of materials to choose samples that merit more detailed conventional porosity analysis.

         <title>Highly Stable Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Adapted to Fluctuating Renewable Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating renewable energy with electrocatalysis can cut carbon emissions and boost energy efficiency, greening the chemical industry. Our research tackles the challenge of renewable energy's variability by introducing a stable, efficient oxygen reduction system that produces eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen peroxide. This system, using O&#8208;coordinated cobalt catalysts, maintains high performance even with fluctuating power, with over 55 start&#8722;&#8208;stop cycles and 96% Faradic efficiency.








Abstract
The integration of renewable energy with electrocatalytic technology affords an effective pathway to reduce carbon emissions and enhance energy efficiency, thereby promoting the green electrification of the chemical industry. However, the inherent contradiction between the fluctuating nature of renewable energy and the need for stable operation in electrochemical processes significantly hinders their development and implementation. To mitigate this, we propose a robust two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction system using O&#8208;coordinated Co single&#8208;atom catalysts for the electrosynthesis of environmentally friendly hydrogen peroxide. It excels in stability and efficiency across various operating conditions, including steady&#8208;state, start&#8722;stop cycles, and fluctuating power inputs. At a current density of &#8722;50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the system sustains over 55 stable start&#8722;stop cycles with an average Faradic efficiency above 96%. The high selectivity and durability are attributed to the reservoir&#8208;containing O&#8208;coordinated Co single&#8208;atom sites and the self&#8208;healing capability of gas diffusion electrodes. Furthermore, we evaluate its practicality under simulated photovoltaic power supply scenarios in the field of smart agriculture, particularly for integrated fertilization, disinfection, and irrigation. By addressing the variability of renewable energy and optimizing the integration of electrochemical processes, our work paves the way for fully realizing green electrification in sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Green Fluorescent Protein SELEX: Immobilization Chemistry and His&#8208;Tag Epitope Bias</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using green fluorescent proteins (GFP) as a target for SELEX, the untagged protein results in true protein&#8208;binding aptamers, whereas using the His&#8208;tagged protein results in aptamers biased toward the His&#8208;tag epitope. The His&#8208;tagged GFP provides a simple test for potential artifacts in previously selected aptamers for other His&#8208;tagged proteins.








Abstract
Despite numerous DNA aptamers for proteins having been reported, a model system allowing the use of cost&#8208;effective proteins, unmodified DNA, and convenient homogeneous assays is still lacking, which has in turn limited not only fundamental studies of aptamers but also their translation to practical applications. Herein, three separate green fluorescent protein (GFP) selections were carried out using both non&#8208;tagged and His&#8208;tagged GFP immobilized on either NHS&#8208;activated resin or Co2+ affinity resin. Only the GFP/NHS system resulted in aptamers that consistently bind to unmodified GFP, whereas the His&#8208;tagged GFP yielded aptamers biased toward the His&#8208;tag epitope. Sequence alignment and fluorescence polarization assays indicate that many previously published aptamers bound to the His&#8208;tag instead of the intended protein. This work not only obtained a model aptamer for proteins but also revealed critical information on bias toward His&#8208;tags during aptamer selections.

         <title>Indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene Quasi[8]circulenes Through Intramolecular Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of curved, chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emerges from the fusion of indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene and quasi[8]circulene motifs. These redox&#8208;active, antiaromatic scaffolds offer great synthetic utility, tunable properties, and modular functionalities for organic electronics and functional materials. 








Abstract
The study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has become a cornerstone of chemical sciences, providing crucial guidance for advancing a wide range of fields. Within this context, quasi[8]circulenes and indenofluorenes (IFs) have gained considerable attention due to their rich chiroptical, optoelectronic, supramolecular, and redox properties. However, their combined integration into a single molecular framework has not yet been realized. This work demonstrates that curved indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes are easily accessible through an intramolecular cyclization of a readily available helicene diketone. The cyclization is high yielding and accompanied by an unexpected regioselective triflation that&#8212;alongside both ketones&#8212;allows orthogonal functionalization. This synthetic utility offers great potential for incorporating 8&#8208;membered rings and formally antiaromatic as&#8208;indacene moieties into complex architectures. Herein, a series of fully conjugated antiaromatic indeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes were synthesized and studied spectroscopically and electrochemically, showcasing the rich properties of these rare, purely carbon&#8208;based quasi[8]circulenes. It is shown that the studied compounds display multiple accessible redox states at mild potentials, which can be significantly altered through adequate substituents. These substituents additionally induce unprecedented aggregation behavior for one of the compounds. Furthermore, the studied IFs exhibit chirality arising from the curved structure of the quasi[8]circulenes, which allowed studying chiroptical properties for one of the structures.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Active, Irreversible Covalent Inhibitors Targeting a Surface&#8208;Exposed Non&#8208;Catalytic Lysine on Aurora a Kinase by Using Squarate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel class of covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) targeting surface&#8208;exposed, non&#8208;catalytic lysines by using chemically tunable squarate warheads. The optimized AL8 achieved selective, irreversible inhibition of endogenous Aurora A kinase in cancer cells and with negligible off&#8208;targets. This work establishes a general strategy for modification of weakly nucleophilic, non&#8208;catalytic lysines through rational design of different squarate&#8208;based aminophiles, thus expanding the toolbox of targeted kinase drug discovery. 








Abstract
Targeting surface&#8208;exposed lysines in kinases through covalent modification presents a major challenge due to their high pKa and inherently low reactivity. While current research primarily targets more reactive catalytic lysines buried in the ATP&#8208;binding pocket, no systematic rational strategy has yet been developed for selectively engaging surface&#8208;exposed lysines. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for developing cell&#8208;active covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) by selectively targeting unique surface&#8208;exposed lysines using squarate chemistry. By using Aurora A (AURKA) as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we systematically evaluated this approach against other well&#8208;known lysine&#8208;reactive warheads (e.g., EBA, SO2F, and OSO2F) and demonstrated, for the first time, squarates&#8217; superior efficacy in engaging these challenging low&#8208;reactivity lysines. Amongst various AURKA CKIs, AL8 emerged as the first&#8208;in&#8208;class squarate&#8208;based, cell&#8208;active inhibitor, exhibiting excellent selectivity in both biochemical and cellular assays with long&#8208;residence time in covalently engaging endogenous AURKA. Detailed investigation of effects of leaving groups on squaric esters provided valuable insights for future development of lysine&#8208;reactive CKIs.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a novel class of covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) targeting surface-exposed, non-catalytic lysines by using chemically tunable squarate warheads. The optimized &lt;b&gt;AL8&lt;/b&gt; achieved selective, irreversible inhibition of endogenous Aurora A kinase in cancer cells and with negligible off-targets. This work establishes a general strategy for modification of weakly nucleophilic, non-catalytic lysines through rational design of different squarate-based aminophiles, thus expanding the toolbox of targeted kinase drug discovery. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting surface-exposed lysines in kinases through covalent modification presents a major challenge due to their high p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and inherently low reactivity. While current research primarily targets more reactive catalytic lysines buried in the ATP-binding pocket, no systematic rational strategy has yet been developed for selectively engaging surface-exposed lysines. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for developing cell-active covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) by selectively targeting unique surface-exposed lysines using squarate chemistry. By using Aurora A (AURKA) as a proof-of-concept, we systematically evaluated this approach against other well-known lysine-reactive warheads (e.g., EBA, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F, and OSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F) and demonstrated, for the first time, squarates&#8217; superior efficacy in engaging these challenging low-reactivity lysines. Amongst various AURKA CKIs, &lt;b&gt;AL8&lt;/b&gt; emerged as the first-in-class squarate-based, cell-active inhibitor, exhibiting excellent selectivity in both biochemical and cellular assays with long-residence time in covalently engaging endogenous AURKA. Detailed investigation of effects of leaving groups on squaric esters provided valuable insights for future development of lysine-reactive CKIs. Our finding has established squarate-containing ligands as a unique and readily tunable platform for covalent modification of surface-exposed, non-catalytic lysines in targeted kinase drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Fluorogenic Hydrazino&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorogenic hydrazino&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler (HIPS) ligation reaction is used to label lipid&#8208;derived aldehydes under wash&#8208;free conditions in live cells. This innovative technique enables wash&#8208;free imaging within biological systems, offering invaluable insights into the extent and localization of oxidative stress.








Abstract
Lipid peroxidation generates diverse aldehydic lipids associated with oxidative stress and signaling, yet methodologies capable of their detection in live cells are currently lacking. Here, we report a fluorogenic hydrazino&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler (HIPS) probe for lipidic aldehydes &#8220;FLipA&#8208;HIPS&#8221; that generates bright, wash&#8208;free fluorescent reaction products in vitro and in cellulo. FLipA&#8208;HIPS is essentially nonfluorescent but reacts with aldehydes to give an environmentally sensitive fluorophore with a higher quantum yield in SDS micelles as compared to aqueous buffer alone. FLipA&#8208;HIPS reacts with lipidic aldehydes to give 10&#8208; to 25&#8208;fold higher fluorescence intensities than reactions containing either short&#8208;chain aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes in aqueous buffer. Confocal microscopy shows that&#160;live cells pretreated with potassium bromate or the aldehydic phospholipid &#8220;POVPC&#8221; display rapid and selective FLipA&#8208;HIPS staining that co&#8208;localizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consistent with the ER's known role in accumulating lipidic aldehydes. These results demonstrate that HIPS reactions can exhibit useful fluorogenic properties for aldehyde biosensing applications in live cells.

         <title>Interactome Profiling of a Lysine Deacetylase Trapping Probe Library Uncovers Crosstalk Between HDAC6 and NF&#8208;&#954;B Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a peptide probe library containing hydroxamic acids based on putative substrate sites of lysine deacetylase HDAC6. Analyzing substrate selectivity and turnover combined with proteomics profiling resulted in identification of novel HDAC6 interaction partners, such as components of the transcription factor NF&#8208;&#954;B. Importantly, HDAC6 counteracted the activity of acetylated NF&#8208;&#954;B p50, indicating a potential role in NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling. 








Abstract
Lysine or histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from lysine residues of numerous proteins, thereby regulating their function and activity. HDAC6 is involved in multiple cellular processes, yet its protein interaction network remains poorly understood. To uncover novel HDAC6 substrates, we performed an acetylome analysis of HDAC6 knockdown cells, which served as a basis for the design of an HDAC6&#8208;trapping peptide library containing hydroxamic acids. Most probes enriched HDAC6 from cell lysates stronger than HDAC1. Proteomic profiling of the trapping probes revealed a preferential enrichment of HDAC6 and resulted in the identification of novel putative HDAC6 interaction partners. Among those were several components of the pro&#8208;inflammatory transcription factor NF&#8208;&#954;B that were independently confirmed as HDAC6 binders. Mechanistically, HDAC6 counteracted NF&#8208;&#954;B activity induced upon p300&#8208;catalyzed acetylation of NF&#8208;&#954;B p50. These findings indicate a potential anti&#8208;inflammatory function of HDAC6 in NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling.

         <title>The Importance of Si&#9472;ONa&#9472;Al Moieties in Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Catalysts for Selective Oxidation of Methane to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated that Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;0.25Na, with abundant Si&#9472;ONa&#9472;Al moieties, catalyzed methane conversion to acetic acid using H2O2 in the presence of CO, yielding&#160;144.1 &#181;mol&#160;of oxygenates (81.8% acetic acid selectivity, 50 &#176;C, 2&#160;h)&#8212;superior&#160;to Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 (Br&#248;nsted acid sites,&#160;131.4&#160;&#181;mol,&#160;58.4% acetic acid selectivity). Our approach bypasses traditional Br&#248;nsted acid reliance, instead employing metal&#8208;electronic modulation to enhance catalytic efficiency, presenting an innovative pathway for methane conversion.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of methane to acetic acid with high activity and selectivity remains a significant challenge. Br&#248;nsted acid sites (Si&#9472;OH&#9472;Al) are well&#8208;known for their crucial role in facilitating methane oxidation to acetic acid over zeolite&#8208;based catalysts. Here, we reported that Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;0.25Na with abundant Si&#9472;ONa&#9472;Al moieties outperformed Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 (rich in Br&#248;nsted acid sites) in methane oxidation to acetic acid using H2O2 in the presence of CO. The Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;0.25Na yielded 144.1 &#181;mol&#160;of oxygenated products, achieving an acetic acid selectivity of 81.8% at 50&#160;&#176;C for 2.0&#160;h. These results surpass the performance of the Fe/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst, which produced 131.4&#160;&#181;mol of oxygenated products with an acetic acid selectivity of 58.4%. Spectroscopic characterizations and mechanistic studies revealed that the Si&#9472;ONa&#9472;Al moieties in Fe/ZSM&#8208;5&#8208;0.25Na facilitated electron donation to iron species, forming electron&#8208;rich iron sites. These electron&#8208;rich iron species promoted CO insertion and enhanced the formation of acetic acid through carbon&#8211;carbon coupling of methane and CO.

         <title>Anchoring and Competition: Weakly Solvated Structure of Glymes Enhances Stability in Lithium Metal Batteries Operating under Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Originally, lithium ions coordinate with multiple O atoms on diglyme, which would result in a strong binding energy. With the addition of LiNO3, the strong binding energy of NO3&#8722; anchors the solvation structure on one side, and by adding a co&#8208;solvent, diglymes with single O atom coordination are generated, which significantly reduces the desolvation energy of the solvation structure to improve the performance of Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) face challenges from unstable and fragile solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). In this work, we successfully develop a novel electrolyte by effectively modulating the competitive solvation process in LMBs. In this formulation, the C&#9472;O&#9472;C motifs of glymes are competitively substituted by other anions and solvents to achieve single oxygen site coordination, thereby facilitating a weak solvation effect. At an apparent concentration of 1.25&#160;M, a solvated sheath enriched with anions and single oxygen&#8208;bound complexes is formed, which significantly enhances lithium metal compatibility and promotes rapid desolvation kinetics. The designed electrolyte using weakly solvated structures exhibits remarkable stability at both 25&#176; and 80 &#176;C, enabling the lithium iron phosphate (LFP)||Li cell to achieve over 2000 cycles (capacity retention: 90%) and 500 cycles (capacity retention: 96%), respectively. Interestingly, the low N/P ratio LFP||Li (N/P&#160;=&#160;1.8) full battery maintains a stable capacity over 50 cycles, and the commercial 1.1 Ah LFP||Li pouch cell shows a great stability (capacity retention: 91.0%, CE: 99.82%) over 20 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;Originally, lithium ions coordinate with multiple O atoms on diglyme, which would result in a strong binding energy. With the addition of LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the strong binding energy of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anchors the solvation structure on one side, and by adding a co-solvent, diglymes with single O atom coordination are generated, which significantly reduces the desolvation energy of the solvation structure to improve the performance of Li metal batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) face challenges from unstable and fragile solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). In this work, we successfully develop a novel electrolyte by effectively modulating the competitive solvation process in LMBs. In this formulation, the C&#9472;O&#9472;C motifs of glymes are competitively substituted by other anions and solvents to achieve single oxygen site coordination, thereby facilitating a weak solvation effect. At an apparent concentration of 1.25&#160;M, a solvated sheath enriched with anions and single oxygen-bound complexes is formed, which significantly enhances lithium metal compatibility and promotes rapid desolvation kinetics. The designed electrolyte using weakly solvated structures exhibits remarkable stability at both 25&#176; and 80 &#176;C, enabling the lithium iron phosphate (LFP)||Li cell to achieve over 2000 cycles (capacity retention: 90%) and 500 cycles (capacity retention: 96%), respectively. Interestingly, the low N/P ratio LFP||Li (N/P&#160;=&#160;1.8) full battery maintains a stable capacity over 50 cycles, and the commercial 1.1 Ah LFP||Li pouch cell shows a great stability (capacity retention: 91.0%, CE: 99.82%) over 20 cycles. The distinctive solvation regulation strategy has paved a novel research avenue for the realization of high-performance LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wacker Oxidation of Trisubstituted Alkenes: Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Ring Expansion of Exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl to 2&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
First examples of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation of trisubstituted alkenes, coupled with electrophilic fluorination, enable a one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of exocyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls to 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8208;acyl&#8208;cycloalkanones.








Abstract
The Wacker oxidation is a powerful synthetic method widely employed for the transformation of monosubstituted alkenes into methyl ketones. Its substrate scope has progressively expanded to include internal disubstituted and, more recently, gem&#8208;disubstituted alkenes. Herein, we report the first examples of Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of trisubstituted alkenes under Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalysis. In the presence of Selectfluor (2.3 equiv) and a catalytic amount of Pd(MeCN)4(BF4)2 (10 mol%), exocyclic trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds undergo a fluorinative one&#8208;carbon ring expansion to deliver 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in good yields. The reaction displays broad functional group tolerance, including alkyl halide, aryl halide, alkyl tosylate, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, ester, secondary amide, ketone, cyano, and N&#8208;phthalimide. While a semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement of the Pd(IV) intermediate is a plausible mechanistic pathway given the excellent nucleofugality of the Pd(IV) atom, preliminary studies suggest that a 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement is operative in product formation.

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Capture and Functionalization from a Molecular Ti(III) Oxo Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their communication, Mindiola and coworkers demonstrate how a reduced Ti complex can reversibly bind CO2 to produce organic and inorganic carbonates. They access this chemistry through a unique TiIII oxo anion that can be generated both chemically and electrochemically. The subtle electronic and structure parameters of this species promote its reactivity and establish an exciting route to the capture, functionalization, and release of CO2.








Abstract
Carbon dioxide capture and functionalization sequesters carbon dioxide in more robust products and offers a viable route to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We present herein a unique molecular TiIII&#160;oxo anion that reversibly binds CO2 to allow both its sequestration and functionalization. The reduction of [(PN)2Ti&#9552;O] (1) [PN = (2&#8208;PiiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)(mesityl)amide] with KC8 and 2.2.2&#8208;cryptand (crypt) resulted in formation of [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti&#9552;O] (2), which was fully characterized and shown to contain a Ti&#8208;centered radical. Complex 2 reacts with Al(CH3)3 to form [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti{O(Al(CH3)3}] (3), which can be independently prepared from [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti(OCP)] and Al(CH3)3. Whereas 1 does not react with CO2, 2 rapidly captures the gas (1 atm, 25&#160;&#176;C) to produce a TiIII carbonate [K(crypt)][(PN)2Ti(&#954;2&#8208;O2C&#9552;O)] (4). Chemical and electrochemical oxidation of 4 releases CO2 to regenerate 1 while a soluble organic carbonate [Me3SiOC(O)OSiMe3, Me = CH3]&#160;is obtained from reaction of 4 with ClSiMe3.

         <title>Behavior Regulation of *CO over Self&#8208;Evolution Tandem Catalysts Under Tuned Interfacial Electric Field Boosts CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, three kinds of self&#8208;evolution tandem catalysts (Ag/Cu, Pd/Cu, and Au/Cu) are designed and the adsorption and migration behaviors of *CO are evaluated by DFT calculations, COMSOL multiphysics simulations and in situ characterizations. The research figures out that although strong interfacial electric fields weaken the internal migration of *CO, the enhanced adsorption capacity for *CO is a key factor for C&#8211;C coupling in tandem catalysts.








Abstract
Tandem or self&#8208;evolution Cu&#8208;based catalysts effectively regulate *CO to promote the conversion of CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon (C2+) products. DFT calculations reveal that the adsorption capacity of *CO varies under different interfacial electric field intensities for the Cu, Ag/Cu, Pd/Cu, and Au/Cu models. Accordingly, we design three kinds of self&#8208;evolution tandem catalysts and investigate the adsorption and migration behaviors of *CO under interfacial electric fields. Electrochemical CO2 reduction test results indicate that the higher CO selectivity of Au/Cu is attributed to its weak *CO adsorption capacity, confirmed by in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;infrared and in situ Raman. The low C2+ selectivity of Pd/Cu is owing to its high reaction energy barrier and low catalytic activity. In contrast, Ag/Cu achieves a high FEC2+ of 89.2% and a partial current density (jc2+) of 553.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 thanks to the low reaction energy barrier and moderate *CO adsorption capacity. COMSOL multiphysics simulations reveal that the effect of the interfacial electric field on *CO external migration could be neglected in the nanometer range. Although a strong interfacial electric field increases the energy barrier for internal migration of *CO, the enhanced adsorption capacity of *CO still dominates C&#8211;C coupling in the *CO&#8208;rich microenvironment over tandem catalysts.

         <title>Bioorthogonal In Situ Formation of AIE Luminogens for Imaging Disease Progression via Sigmoidal Signal Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal strategy featuring a double&#8208;lock mechanism has been developed for the in situ formation of AIEgens, enabling ultralow background, up to 1033&#8208;fold fluorescence turn&#8208;on, and sigmoidal amplification for high&#8208;sensitivity, multiplexed live&#8208;cell imaging and effective disease monitoring.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens are promising tools for biological imaging, yet their utility is often limited by nonspecific aggregation and elevated background fluorescence. Here, we present a bioorthogonal in situ formation strategy that enables precise, organelle&#8208;specific activation of AIEgens within live cells. This system employs a dual&#8208;lock mechanism&#8212;combining tetrazine quenching and twisted intramolecular charge shuttle (TICS) dynamics&#8212;to maintain an ultra&#8208;low fluorescence background in the precursor state, even under aggregating conditions. Upon bioorthogonal reactions and molecular aggregation, the resulting AIEgens exhibit tunable emission peaks ranging from 605 to 665&#160;nm, large Stokes shifts (up to 201&#160;nm), and an exceptional fluorescence enhancement (up to 1033&#8208;fold). Their high biocompatibility and spatial precision allow for multiplexed, simultaneous labeling of intracellular targets. Compared to conventional fluorogenic and bioorthogonal probes, these AIEgens exhibit a sigmoidal amplification response, enabling the sensitive discrimination of subtle biomarker expression differences and the effective identification of injured cells during disease progression. This strategy significantly enhances the specificity and sensitivity of live&#8208;cell imaging, expands the functional utility of AIE luminogens, and offers a versatile platform for high&#8208;resolution, multiplexed bioimaging in biomedical research and diagnostics.

         <title>A Streamlined Approach to Indoles, Pyrroles, and Benzimidazoles via Redox&#8208;Neutral Aromatization and CO Reduction Mediated by Cs2CO3</title>

We have discovered a general method to convert vicinal alkyl and nitro groups on arenes or alkenes into various heteroaromatic compounds, including indoles, pyrroles, and benzimidazoles avoiding any transition metal. This protocol uses a redox&#8208;neutral aromatization and CO reduction sequence just using Cs2CO3, with high atom, step, and redox efficiency.








Abstract
The synthesis of nitrogen heteroarenes has a rich history, including many illustrious name reactions. These reactions often involve complex oxidative processes or the need for transition metal catalysts, and the synthesis of different N&#8208;heteroarenes typically requires a case&#8208;by&#8208;case approach. Here, we have discovered the conversion of vicinal alkyl and nitro groups on arenes or alkenes into an array of N&#8208;heteroarenes, including indoles and pyrroles. Moreover, our approach also facilitates the synthesis of benzimidazoles from ortho NH&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes. This versatile method leverages a redox&#8208;neutral aromatization and CO reduction sequence, uniquely utilizing Cs2CO3, and is remarkable for its omission of any transition metals. Our strategy is particularly noteworthy for its exceptional atom, step, and redox efficiency, offering significant advantages for the synthesis of alkaloids that are important in pharmaceutical applications. Extensive experimental and computational studies have allowed us to understand the preferred mechanistic pathways for these heteroarene formations.

         <title>Decoration of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Coenzyme Mimics for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>

The simple molecule of 3&#8208;carboxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide, mimicking the NAD(P)H coenzyme, is modified onto a metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. This simulant behaves like a redox&#8208;active coenzyme, promoting proton and electron transfer by serving as their relays. The coenzyme&#8208;like regeneration mechanism is demonstrated in the involved photocatalytic process, giving rise to improved charge separation and significantly enhanced activity.








Abstract
Despite remarkable progress achieved in biomimetic catalysis, the majority of studies have primarily concentrated on mimicking the structures of catalytic sites in metalloenzymes, while frequently neglecting the crucial roles of multifunctional coenzymes therein. In this study, the coenzyme mimics of nicotinic acid (NA) and 3&#8208;carboxy&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide (NA&#8208;Me, simply denoted as NM) have been modified onto the metal&#8208;organic framework UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, affording UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X&#9552;NA, NM) with varying the degree of mimicry for the nicotinamide nucleotide coenzyme. Remarkably, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NM showcases approximately five&#8208; and seven&#8208;fold activity higher than UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NA and the pristine UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, respectively, in the photocatalytic hydrogen production. Both experimental and computational results reveal that the NM dangling on the MOF undergoes structural redox change similar to that in the regeneration process of NAD(P)H coenzyme, which serves as the proton and electron relays surrounding catalytic Pt sites, facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and thereby boosting photocatalytic activity. This work offers new insights and strategies for the design and fabrication of biomimetic heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Azaarene Migration to &#945;&#8208;Azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Esters Enabled by a Tailored Ligand</title>

The first enantioselective catalytic benzilic ester rearrangement of vicinal dicarbonyl compounds is reported, providing a variety of synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters in good yields and high enantiopurities. This transformation features an asymmetric 1,2&#8208;azaarene shift, which is systematically investigated here for the first time. A newly designed chiral BOX ligand with extended and rigid side arms was critical for achieving effective stereocontrol.








Abstract
Despite their prevalence in bioactive molecules, the stereoselective construction of &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylates remains a formidable challenge. Notably, although the benzilic ester rearrangement (BER) is an efficient approach to &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylates, asymmetric catalytic BER remains poorly developed, largely due to poor stereorecognition of the vicinal diketone substituents by common chiral catalysts. In response to these issues, here we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric BER of azaarene&#8208;derived 1,2&#8208;diketones with simple alcohols to give diverse &#945;&#8208;azaaryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters. It is proposed that the azaarene nitrogen and the adjacent carbonyl group chelate copper to form a five&#8208;membered metallacycle, initiating the subsequent stereoselective 1,2&#8208;nucleophilic addition step. Meanwhile, enantiocontrol over vicinal diketones was achieved by a tailored bisoxazoline (BOX) ligand with two rigid, long, and terminally bulky sidearms. This study overcomes the incompatibility between azaarenes and BOX ligands, and also unlocks asymmetric catalytic 1,2&#8208;azaarene migrations.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Ir(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydrocarbonation of Allenes: Access to Branched Products with All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir(I) catalysts featuring the electron&#8208;deficient bisphosphine ligand dFppe promote the hydrocarbonation of allenes with precise control over the selectivity to yield highly valuable branched products. This reaction is highly effective with C(3)&#8208;dialkylcarboxamidepyrroles as well as with other C&#9472;H donors, such as furans and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxamides. Employing 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes as partners enabled the access to challenging products featuring all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers. DFT computational analysis that offers relevant mechanistic insights.








Abstract
An iridium complex featuring the perfluorinated bisphosphine ligand dFppe can catalyze intermolecular hydrocarbonation reactions of allenes with precise control over the selectivity to yield highly valuable branched products instead of the more common linear derivatives. Using N&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;carboxamide pyrroles as C&#9472;H donors, the reaction gives exclusively C&#8208;4 substituted products, while furan analogues yield C&#8208;2 substituted derivatives. &#946;&#8208;Unsubstituted acrylamides can also be used as C&#9472;H sources to give chiral skipped dienes. The additions are equally efficient using monosubstituted and 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes, enabling the efficient formation of products bearing tertiary and all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. Moreover, a preliminary analysis with chiral bisphosphinite ligands confirms the feasibility of an enantioselective variant. Computational (DFT) studies provide relevant insights into this remarkable ligand&#8208;driven branched selectivity.

Using &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-substituted 3-carboxamide pyrroles as C&#9472;H donors, the reaction gives exclusively C-4 substituted products, while furan analogues yield C-2 substituted derivatives. &#946;-Unsubstituted acrylamides can also be used as C&#9472;H sources to give chiral skipped dienes. The additions are equally efficient using monosubstituted and 1,1-disubstituted allenes, enabling the efficient formation of products bearing tertiary and all-carbon quaternary stereocenters. Moreover, a preliminary analysis with chiral bisphosphinite ligands confirms the feasibility of an enantioselective variant. Computational (DFT) studies provide relevant insights into this remarkable ligand-driven branched selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active &#960;&#8208;Extended Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Carbon Nanohoop Featuring Unique Kasha/Anti&#8208;Kasha Dual Emissions: Structure, Photophysical Properties, and Photoconductivity</title>

exTTF[10]CPP, featuring shape&#8208;persistent architecture and curved conjugation, exhibits tunable Kasha/anti&#8208;Kasha dual emissions. Meanwhile, exTTF[10]CPP not only exhibits reversible redox responsiveness but also shows redox&#8208;dependent tunability in its binding interaction with C60. Moreover, its complex with C60 displays exceptional charge&#8208;transfer property, enhancing the photocurrent in C60&#8834;exTTF[10]CPP&#8208;based cast film.








Abstract
Developing functionalized cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) that respond to various stimuli, particularly redox, remains challenging yet crucial for advanced nanocarbon applications. Here, we report the exploration of the synergy between the concave &#960;&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene (exTTF) and the curved CPP scaffold for constructing the rigid, conjugated nanohoop exTTF[10]CPP. X&#8208;ray analysis reveals a unique spherical packing arrangement in which six adjacent nanohoops interlock through concave and convex interactions. Interestingly, fluorescence studies revealed that exTTF[10]CPP exhibited unexpected anti&#8208;Kasha emissions originating from higher excited states, along with Kasha emission from S1 excited state in toluene and THF. However, in a PMMA film, it displayed a redshifted Kasha emission. The unique Kasha/anti&#8208;Kasha dual&#8208;emission behavior represents a rarely explored photophysical phenomenon within exTTF derivatives and nanocarbon&#8208;based systems. Ultraviolet&#8208;Visible (UV&#8211;vis) absorption investigations showed that exTTF[10]CPP demonstrated reversible redox responsiveness with tunable binding affinity for C60 up to 1.92&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;M&#8722;1. Notably, femtosecond transient absorption measurements further revealed a prolonged lifetime of the charge&#8208;separated state, C60&#8226;&#8722;/exTTF[10]CPP&#8226;+, which provides sufficient time for charge utilization. This exceptional charge&#8208;transfer property enhances the photocurrent in C60&#8834;exTTF[10]CPP&#8208;based cast film, which is 2.43 times higher than that of exTTF[10]CPP alone, highlighting its potential in photoelectronic device.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stimulus Programmed Multiphase Separation and Organization in Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;stimulus programmed coacervate transformation system is developed. The sequential application of pH and salt concentration induces transition of membrane&#8208;less coacervates into nested multiphase coacervates and, ultimately, into vesicular&#8208;like multiphase coacervates. This transition endows selective client recruitment and exclusion by resultant coacervates, and facilitates the spatial orchestration of enzymatic reactions.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive (multiphase) coacervates deserve significant attention as cell&#8208;like entities that can adapt to their environment and undergo morphological reconfiguration. In this study, a tandem&#8208;triggered transition system is presented that enables the transformation of single&#8208;phase coacervates into multiphase structures through the sequential application of two external stimuli: pH and salt concentration. A polyanion containing acid&#8208;labile amide bond is incorporated into the membrane&#8208;less coacervates. Upon exposure to an acidic pH, hydrolysis of the amide bond induces charge reversal from polyanion to polycation, triggering the first transition from single&#8208;phase to nested multiphase coacervates. This transformation alters the spatial redistribution and viscosity of coacervate components and influences sequestration behavior toward various (macro) molecules. Subsequently, the introduction of hypertonic environment as secondary stimulus induces selective dissociation and structural reconfiguration of nested multiphase coacervates into vesicular&#8208;like multiphase coacervates, further altering the coacervate components' fluidity and partitioning properties. Notably, the diverse inherent properties of coacervates among this tandem&#8208;triggered transition enables the variation of spatial organization for enzymatic reactions. Overall, the findings demonstrate a strategy for the sequential control of coacervate structural reconfiguration through dual stimuli, providing a versatile platform for the development of programable and adaptive coacervate&#8208;based protocells.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Relay for C&#9472;N Cleavage and Ring Expansion: Accessing Medium&#8208;Sized Lactams From Unstrained Cyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical relay approach has been successfully developed for the direct cleavage of the C&#9472;N bond in unstrained cyclic amines. This method allows for the efficient construction of highly functionalized 9&#8211;11&#8208;membered lactams containing a Z&#8208;olefin moiety. Control experiments and computational investigations have confirmed that the ring&#8208;expansion mechanism commences with the C&#9472;N bond cleavage induced by reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover. 








Abstract
The synthesis of medium&#8208;ring lactams constitutes a formidable yet pivotal frontier in modern chemical research. Persistent endeavors in this field are essential for overcoming the prevailing obstacles, particularly in the realm of ring expansion strategies for unstrained cyclic amines. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical relay process that accomplishes direct C&#9472;N bond cleavage in unstrained cyclic amines, thereby enabling the efficient construction of highly functionalized 9&#8211;11&#8208;membered lactams adorned with a Z&#8208;olefin moiety. Remarkably, our methodology exhibits exceptional compatibility with a broad spectrum of acids, encompassing &#945;&#8208;amino acids, peptides, and carboxylic acids, thus facilitating the ring expansion of readily accessible propiolamides. Control experiments and computational investigations provide compelling evidence that the ring expansion mechanism is initiated via a reductive radical&#8208;polar&#8208;crossover&#8208;induced C&#9472;N bond cleavage, offering profound insights into the underlying reaction dynamics. This advancement not only broadens the synthetic methodology for medium&#8208;ring lactam construction but also paves the way for future explorations in complex molecule synthesis and drug discovery.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Modular Assembly of Polar Chains for Rational Construction of UV Nonlinear Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure design strategy, Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Modular Assembly, has been successfully devised. Leveraging donor&#8211;acceptor pairing of hydrogen bonds, &#960;&#8208;conjugated units are selectively screened and self&#8208;assembled into polar chains, which are interwoven into NCS structures. According to this strategy, we successfully designed two promising ultraviolet nonlinear optical crystals, [C(NH2)3]C3H3O4 and [C(NH2)3]C4H5O4.








Abstract
Non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) materials underpin a host of emerging technologies&#8212;from high&#8208;power lasers to optical communications and sensors&#8212;yet their targeted design remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a &#8220;Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directed Modular Assembly&#8221; strategy for the rational construction of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. In this strategy, programmable hydrogen&#8208;bonding schemes serve as a predictive handle to propagate local asymmetry into a macroscopic polar network. Using an explicit modular design algorithm, we selected three building units&#8212;C3H3O4&#8722;, C4H5O4&#8722;, and C(NH2)3+&#8212;and assembled them into two one&#8208;dimensional polar chain modules, [C(NH2)3C3H3O4]&#8734; and [C(NH2)3C4H5O4]&#8734;. These modules crystallize as two new UV NLO materials, C(NH2)3C3H3O4 and C(NH2)3C4H5O4, which exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties. By shifting the synthetic focus from serendipitous screening to hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;guided, module&#8208;level engineering, our strategy establishes a predictive framework for the a priori design of NCS structures with tailored properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-centrosymmetric (NCS) materials underpin a host of emerging technologies&#8212;from high-power lasers to optical communications and sensors&#8212;yet their targeted design remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a &#8220;Hydrogen-Bond-Directed Modular Assembly&#8221; strategy for the rational construction of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. In this strategy, programmable hydrogen-bonding schemes serve as a predictive handle to propagate local asymmetry into a macroscopic polar network. Using an explicit modular design algorithm, we selected three building units&#8212;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8212;and assembled them into two one-dimensional polar chain modules, [C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt; and [C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;. These modules crystallize as two new UV NLO materials, C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties. By shifting the synthetic focus from serendipitous screening to hydrogen-bond-guided, module-level engineering, our strategy establishes a predictive framework for the a priori design of NCS structures with tailored properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Synergistic Interactions Between Multi&#8208;Hydroxyl Molecules and Perovskite to Alleviate Mechanical&#8208;Thermal Mismatch for Achieving High&#8208;Performance Flexible Solar Cells</title>

We introduced three hydroxy&#8208;substituted phenylacetic acid molecules into the perovskite films to investigate how the interaction patterns between multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules and perovskite affect the mechanical&#8208;thermal properties of flexible photovoltaic cells. The multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules reduced the Young's modulus and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the perovskite film by 11.1% and 38.5%, respectively, ultimately achieving a PCE of 25.01%. Additionally, these devices maintained 90% of their initial PCE after 3000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Due to the presence of residual tensile strain, as well as the inherent brittleness and film quality of the perovskite, flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) face ongoing challenges in stability. To address these issues, this study introduces a multi&#8208;hydroxyl regulated stress management strategy for f&#8208;PSCs. Three hydroxyl&#8208;substituted phenylacetic acids (p&#8208;hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid) are incorporated into the perovskite films to investigate the significance of their interaction modes with perovskite in regulating f&#8208;PSC performance. These multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules, through their progressively enhanced synergistic interactions with the perovskite, effectively promote greater energy dissipation during stress deformation, reducing the Young's modulus of the perovskite by 11.1% and decreasing the thermal expansion coefficient of perovskite film by 38.5%, thereby improving the mechanical strength of the f&#8208;PSCs. Additionally, the multi&#8208;hydroxyl molecules regulate the excess PbI2 during the fabrication process of perovskite, enhancing the film quality and optimizing the energy level alignment. As a result, the inverted f&#8208;PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.01%. These devices demonstrated excellent mechanical and thermal stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after 3000 bending cycles, and maintaining 83% of their initial PCE after continuous heating at 85&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h.

         <title>Harnessing the Dynamic Nature of a Zirconium&#8208;Oxo Nanocluster for Reversible Protein Capture and Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Zr17&#8208;oxo nanocluster&#8208;based solid enables efficient, site&#8208;selective hydrolysis of myoglobin, mimicking enzymatic proteolysis. Its recyclable, heterogeneous nature and tunable ligand shell allow control over peptide product profiles. This work highlights how nanocluster surface chemistry governs protein interaction and reactivity, enabling advanced catalyst design and nanocluster recovery for reuse.








Abstract
Selective proteolysis remains a significant challenge with relevance to industrial and pharmaceutical applications, motivating development of chemical strategies emulating the specificity of natural proteases. Here, we report that the discrete Zr&#8208;oxo nanocluster&#8208;based solid, [Zr17O8(OH)24(OH2)12(HCO2)12(SO4)8] &#183; 6 HCl &#183; 30 H2O (Zr17) serves as an efficient, recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for site&#8208;selective proteolysis with tunable fragment selectivity. A combination of solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy highlighted the importance of the ligand environment of solid Zr17 for enabling efficient protein&#8208;cluster interaction and controlling reactivity. We demonstrate that Zr17 achieves a proteolytic performance comparable to natural enzymes while allowing fine modulation of peptide product profiles by adjusting reaction parameters. Substrate adsorption and product desorption were found to be governed by the net charge of both catalyst and substrate, as well as rapid reorganization of the cluster's capping ligands, according to UV&#8208;Vis/IR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Crucially, the insoluble nature and excellent stability of Zr17, evidenced by pair distribution function analysis, allowed reuse across multiple catalytic cycles, overcoming a major limitation of proteolytic systems. This study reveals how cluster surface chemistry governs substrate interaction and catalysis, guiding rational design of next&#8208;generation cluster&#8208;based catalysts, including hybrid materials such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks.

         <title>Chiral Single Molecule with Biphenyl Component Exhibiting Both TADF and RTP Emissions Enables Highly Efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel chiral biphenyl&#8208;based single molecule emitter, CP&#8208;D3, with both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions, achieving the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 32.44% in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). This represents the first report of a chiral single&#8208;molecule emitter incorporating a biphenyl component that exhibits simultaneous TADF and RTP emissions, as well as highly efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs. 








Abstract
Chiral single molecules that exhibit both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) pose significant challenges, primarily due to their competitive luminescence mechanisms and the scarcity of studies on their applications in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). In this work, we develop a novel chiral emitter, CP&#8208;D3, with an axially chiral biphenyl segment selected as the chiral center. As a result, CP&#8208;D3 successfully exhibits both TADF and RTP properties with a high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of 91%. The high dissymmetry factors (gCPPL) of &#8722;7.98&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and +7.47&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 are obtained for (R/S)&#8208;CP&#8208;D3, respectively. Notably, the CP&#8208;D3&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 32.44%, which represents the highest value among chiral luminance materials based on an axially chiral biphenyl component. The gCPEL is recorded as &#8722;8.13&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4/+5.92&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 for (R/S)&#8208;CP&#8208;D3&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs. This work presents the first report on a chiral single&#8208;molecule emitter incorporating an axially chiral biphenyl component, which exhibits simultaneous TADF and RTP emissions and enables highly efficient CP&#8208;OLEDs.

The homo&#8208;dispersed and high dielectric binders formed a flexible ion&#8208;conductive network with Li&#8208;salts that creates Li+ pathways while providing cushioning to stabilize interfaces and enable long&#8208;term ASSB cycling. The thermal transfer printing renders ultrathin SSE compatible with industrial winding and lamination for scalability.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) demand ultra&#8208;thin electrolytes to achieve low impedance and high energy density, yet scalable fabrication remains bottlenecked by the incompatibility between binder/ solvent and sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, we introduce a pioneering slurry&#8208;based strategy leveraging Hofmeister &#8220;salting&#8208;in&#8221; effect to disperse binders in a poor&#8208;solvent environment, dramatically expanding the applicable binder spectrum. The copolymer poly(vinylidenefluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVTC) was uniformly dispersed in tetrahydrofuran via Li&#8208;salts mediation, reducing chain aggregate to hundreds of nanometers. PVTC with reduced size was homo&#8208;dispersed in the Li6PS5Cl slurry, enabling the film&#8208;formation of SSE/ PVTC composite electrolytes (SCEs) with an ultra&#8208;low resistance of 0.69&#160;&#937; cm&#8722;2, synchronously facilitating the formation of continuous polymer networks to provide mechanical cushioning that stabilizes interfaces during cycling. The high dielectric PVTC enhances Li&#8208;salts dissociation, eradicating conduction barriers and establishing efficient Li+&#8208;pathways. Notably, the excellent thermal transfer capability of SCEs enables direct lamination onto electrodes, enabling industrial manufacturing. ASSBs featuring LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes and silicon&#8208;based anodes exhibited energy densities exceeding 380&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and retained 80% capacity over 750 cycles. This work breakthrough traditional binder limitations for sulfide SSEs, addresses the transport obstruction through rational structure design, and ushers in a new era for scalable ASSB production.

         <title>Decoupling Roles of Cationic Dimensionality and Valence&#8208;Electron Compatibility on Structural Resilience and Kinetics in High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy Prussian blue with great mechanochemical compatibility is proposed as cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, contributing high reversible specific capacity, great rate capability and long&#8208;term lifespan over 9000 cycles due to the suppressed Jahn&#8211;Teller lattice distortion as well as the enhanced electron/ion transfer kinetics benefited from high&#8208;entropy effect. 








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have considered as high&#8208;performance cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the impact of high&#8208;entropy component compatibility on electrodes&#8217; lattice stress and kinetics remains underexplored. Herein, a series of high&#8208;entropy PBAs are served as cathode materials for SIBs. The tailoring Na2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2[Fe(CN)6] (HE&#8208;Cu) with superior mechanochemical compatibility shows superior phase stability without obvious lattice stress and faster electron/ion transfer kinetics. Intrinsic and accumulated lattice stresses can be obtained by ion&#8208;incompatible Sn&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy PBA (HE&#8208;Sn) and valence&#8208;electron mismatched Ti&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy PBA (HE&#8208;Ti), thereby exhibiting poor structure stability and dynamics. Serious Jahn&#8211;Teller structural distortion and unstable octahedron, observed in Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] with complicated Na&#8208;ion storage phase evolution (monoclinic &#8596; cubic &#8596; tetragonal), can be entirely suppressed by high&#8208;entropy effect, appearing a zero&#8208;strain solid&#8208;solution reaction mechanism for HE&#8208;Cu employing Mn, Fe, and Co&#8208;ions as redox centers to involve in charge compensation. Consequently, HE&#8208;Cu presents high initial specific capacity of 120.4&#160;mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, superior rate capability and outstanding cyclability with ultra&#8208;long cycling life of 9000 cycles with the lowest capacity&#8208;decay&#8208;rate of 0.0042% per cycle. Na&#8208;ion full cell demonstrates high initial energy density of 397.0&#160;Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 and perfect cycling stability with long lifespan over 2000 cycles.

         <title>Helical Poly(isocyanide anthraquinones)&#8208;Based Cathodes for Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Using a palladium catalyst of Pd&#8208;II for living polymerization of side&#8208;chain anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;type pendant polyisocyanide achieves controllable molecular weight and a low polymer dispersity index (PDI). This cathode maintains stability with no significant degradation after 2000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1 in the lithium metal batteries (LMBs). What is more, polymer ionic liquid electrolytes are used to construct soft PIC&#8208;2AQ pouch batteries, which maintain performance after bending and cutting, combining safety and practicality.








Abstract
Thanks to the unique rigid conformation and designable side&#8208;chain structure, helical polymers are starting to be more widely considered as ideal electrode materials in secondary batteries. In this study, a series of helical poly(isocyanide anthraquinones) (PIC&#8208;AQs), including PIC&#8208;1AQn and PIC&#8208;2AQn, were designed and synthesized via living polymerization using a palladium catalyst (Pd&#8208;II). The polymers feature a helical polyisocyanide main chain and anthraquinone (AQ) pendants, offer high yields (approximately 90%), controlled number&#8208;average molecular weight (Mn), and a low polymer dispersity index (PDI). Attributed to a narrow energy band gap, low unoccupied molecular orbitals, and high spatial freedom of PIC&#8208;2AQ, it exhibits excellent long&#8208;term stability in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), maintaining 141 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1. Additionally, an in situ polymerized poly(ionic liquid) electrolyte was prepared for assembling a PIC&#8208;2AQ all&#8208;solid&#8208;state soft&#8208;pouch battery. And it remained stable under extreme operations like bending or cutting. Such a battery significantly broadens the application scope of organic LMBs and offers great potential for their use in flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Ligand Coordination Equilibria&#8211;Drived Homogeneous Electrodeposition Enables Coatings with Superior Corrosion Resistance and Mechanical Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand coordination equilibrium (LCE) was proposed to precisely control the morphology of alloy electrodeposits. By synergistically regulating ion solvation structures, concentration distributions, and electrochemical reduction pathways, this approach achieved uniform and compact alloy coatings with substantially improved corrosion resistance and mechanical strength, highlighting its potential for industrial applications.








Abstract
Electroplating technology is crucial for interfacial engineering due to its flexible controllability and excellent protective performance. However, electroplated coatings often exhibit uneven deposition morphology due to the uncontrollable nucleation and growth of metal grains, which results in degraded coating performance. Here, we propose ligand coordination equilibria (LCE) that creates a dense coating by simultaneously modulating the solvation structure and optimizing the reduction process, exemplified by Al/Zr alloy electroplating. Multiscale calculations revealed that Cl&#8722; coordination with AlCl3 and ZrCl4 forms a dynamic equilibrium between active ionic species Al2Cl7&#8722; and ZrCl5&#8722;, which is predominantly governed by AlCl3 due to its stronger Lewis acidity. This coordination mechanism was directly validated by Raman spectroscopy. The dynamic equilibrium between Al2Cl7&#8722;, which dominates nucleation density and growth rate, and ZrCl5&#8722;, which increases the interfacial diffusion barrier, synergistically promotes the small&#8208;sized alloy grain. The resulting compact microstructure significantly enhanced the hardness (268 HV) and corrosion resistance (&#8722;0.78&#160;V versus SCE) of the coating, far surpassing that of conventional aluminum alloys coatings. This work highlights the innovative use of LCE for interfacial engineering by tailoring the dynamic equilibrium of active ionic species, providing new insights for the industrial electroplating of high&#8208;performance alloys.

         <title>Organic Surface Passivation on Rh@CeO2 Cocatalysts for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

Rh@CeO2 cocatalysts modified with PPOA as a surface passivation layer, effectively suppresses the reverse reactions by blocking the redox cycle of exposed Rh sites and defective CeO2 overlayers, leading to a significantly enhanced performance in photocatalytic overall water splitting.








Abstract
Decorating Rh cocatalysts with Cr2O3 overlayers can enhance the performance of photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS). However, there is a general concern on the dissolution of Cr2O3, calling for the development of environment&#8208;friendly metal oxides. Here, we employ phenylphosphonic acid (PPOA) as a model surface modifier to decorate the model Rh@CeO2 cocatalysts and demonstrate the critical role of organic surface passivation in H2 evolution catalysis. We identify a &#8220;surface passivation effect&#8221; in photocatalysis, wherein the PPOA modification on CeO2 overlayers not only suppress the adsorption and activation of oxygen but exhibit strong resistance to hydrogen reduction during POWS. This dual functionality effectively suppresses the reverse reactions by blocking the redox cycle of exposed Rh sites and defective CeO2 overlayers, resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability. Importantly, this strategy is not limited to Rh@CeO2&#8208;PPOA systems; it also improves POWS performance in systems where other reducible oxides&#8208;organophosphonic acids structure are used as passivation layers on other noble metal cocatalysts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the universal principles of surface passivation in photocatalysis and offer a practical framework for regulating the reverse reactions and provide guidance for optimizing POWS through targeted surface organic modification.

         <title>Exploring Spin&#8208;Electric Coupling in an Electrically&#8208;Controlled Rare&#8208;Earth Molecular Qubit</title>

This work demonstrates electric&#8208;field manipulation of a Ce(III)&#8208;based molecular qubit, uncovering a spin&#8208;electric coupling strength (|Txyz | = 2.04 (16) &#215;10&#8722;10 m &#8901; V&#8722;1) 194 times larger than the effective value. This contradiction is resolved by our simulation program. Pulsed experiments give a coherence time of 24.1(13) &#181;s under dynamic decoupling and an electric control efficiency approaching 0.1 Hz &#8729; m &#8729; V&#8722;1, establishing rare&#8208;earth molecules as viable candidates for electrically addressable quantum technologies.








Abstract
Magnetoelectric materials have attracted considerable interests due to their unique capability to facilitate reciprocal control between the charges and spins in matter. Based on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) involving modulated and pulsed electric fields, we have studied a Ce (III)&#8208;based molecular qubit under electric control. We observed linear spin&#8208;electric coupling (SEC) in the powder sample, which challenges the previous routine of spectral analysis and strength estimation for SEC. We determined the SEC parameter |Txyz| to be 2.04(16) &#215; 10&#8722;10 m &#183; V&#8722;1, two orders of magnitude&#160;larger than the effective value directly extracted from comparing the signal intensity, as validated by our electric&#8208;field&#8208;modulated (EFM) continuous&#8208;wave EPR experiments and simulation program. The coherence time of this Ce(III) qubit is 24.1(13) &#181;s at 5&#160;K with dynamical decoupling and the electric control efficiency is approaching 0.1 Hz &#183; m &#183; V&#8722;1. Our work provides an insight into the EFM detection of the SEC effect of the uniaxial molecule and offers a reference for the coherent electric manipulation of rare&#8208;earth molecular quantum systems.

         <title>From Flue Gas to Syngas: Composite Electrode Based on Ionic Liquid and Microporous Polymer for MEA&#8208;Based CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite gas&#8208;diffusion electrode (GDE) with a thin CO2&#8208;selective interlayer beneath the catalyst facilitates direct MEA electrolysis of simulated flue gas (with O2) to CO/syngas, eliminating costly pre&#8208;purification. The interlayer&#8212;an intrinsically microporous polymer scaffold infused with CO2&#8208;philic [Emim][BF4]&#8212;delivers high CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 selectivity, directing CO2 to the catalyst layer, and greatly enhancing process economics.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2R) offers a promising pathway to convert CO2 into value&#8208;added products. While catalyst advances remain crucial, gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (GDEs) architecture is equally vital in CO2 electrolyzer design. Most ECO2R studies use pure CO2 feeds, whereas industrial sources like flue gas contain &#8764;15% CO2, requiring costly purification. Eliminating this step demands electrolyzers that directly process impure streams via in situ separation. Here, we introduce a composite GDE (CGDE) featuring a thin CO2&#8208;selective interlayer of intrinsically microporous polymer (PIM&#8208;1) reinforced with the CO2&#8208;philic ionic liquid [Emim][BF4]. This layer selectively adsorbs CO2 and suppresses N2/O2 existence at the catalyst interface. In simulated flue gas (15% CO2, 5% O2 in N2), the CGDE with 20 wt% [Emim][BF4]/PIM&#8208;1 achieved &gt;70% CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, versus &#8764;20% FE for a pristine GDE. Multiphysics simulations confirmed effective CO2 delivery through the selective layer, with minimal O2 permeation. Cost estimation analysis indicates around 25% reduction in CO's minimum selling price using the integrated design and &gt;50% under ideal performance metrics by eliminating compression/transport. These results demonstrate that advanced electrode design with CO2&#8208;selective interlayer enables direct mixed&#8208;gas ECO2R, establishes key design criteria for selective layers, and significantly improves process economics.

The degradation mechanism of zinc&#8208;bromine (Zn&#8208;Br2) batteries is systematically investigated. Subsequently, a Taiji&#8208;inspired dual&#8208;electrode stabilization strategy is developed to synergistically regulate interfacial chemistry at both electrodes, thereby effectively suppressing polybromide shuttling and Zn corrosion. Consequently, the optimized Zn&#8208;Br2 cell achieves a high areal capacity of 5.5&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 and exceptional cycling stability exceeding 20000 cycles.









Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine (Zn&#8208;Br2) batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, their practical deployment is hindered by the dissolution of polybromide species at the cathode and their subsequent shuttling and corrosive reactions at the zinc anode, which severely limit areal capacity and cycling stability. Herein, a Taiji&#8208;inspired dual&#8208;electrode stabilization strategy is developed to synergistically regulate interfacial chemistry at both electrodes, enabling durable high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8208;Br2 batteries. This design leverages the dynamic balance of opposing yet complementary electrostatic interactions, facilitating targeted attraction (Yin) and repulsion (Yang) of polybromides at cathode/anode interfaces, respectively. At the cathode, positively charged quaternary ammonium groups in poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) enable strong electrostatic binding to polybromides, effectively confining them within the cathode and preventing diffusion into the electrolyte. Simultaneously, a lotus&#8208;leaf&#8208;biomimetic interphase with high electronegativity and hydrophobicity is constructed on Zn anode to repel polybromides and suppress parasitic reactions. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopic analyses confirm the effective suppression of polybromide shuttling and Zn corrosion. Consequently, the optimized KB&#8208;PDDA//Zn@ZnO&#8208;PFNA cell achieves a high areal capacity of 5.5&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 and exceptional cycling stability exceeding 20000 cycles, highlighting the critical importance of dual&#8208;interface engineering for advancing practical Zn&#8208;Br2 battery technologies.

&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-bromine (Zn-Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, their practical deployment is hindered by the dissolution of polybromide species at the cathode and their subsequent shuttling and corrosive reactions at the zinc anode, which severely limit areal capacity and cycling stability. Herein, a Taiji-inspired dual-electrode stabilization strategy is developed to synergistically regulate interfacial chemistry at both electrodes, enabling durable high-areal-capacity Zn-Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. This design leverages the dynamic balance of opposing yet complementary electrostatic interactions, facilitating targeted attraction (Yin) and repulsion (Yang) of polybromides at cathode/anode interfaces, respectively. At the cathode, positively charged quaternary ammonium groups in poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) enable strong electrostatic binding to polybromides, effectively confining them within the cathode and preventing diffusion into the electrolyte. Simultaneously, a lotus-leaf-biomimetic interphase with high electronegativity and hydrophobicity is constructed on Zn anode to repel polybromides and suppress parasitic reactions. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopic analyses confirm the effective suppression of polybromide shuttling and Zn corrosion. Consequently, the optimized KB-PDDA//Zn@ZnO-PFNA cell achieves a high areal capacity of 5.5&#160;mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and exceptional cycling stability exceeding 20000 cycles, highlighting the critical importance of dual-interface engineering for advancing practical Zn-Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Rearrangement Averaged Dye Design for Precise, Real&#8208;Time, and Portable Monitoring of Complex Solvent Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;rearrangement&#8208;averaged dye design was proposed to achieve high LE/TICT emission efficiency, exhibiting ratiometric dual&#8208;fluorescence with solvent&#8208;dependent emission modulation instead of quenching. Integrated into crosslinked polymers, these dyes enable precise mixed&#8208;solvent visualization and reusable heterogeneous detection. A portable sensor achieves self&#8208;calibrated ethanol tracking in E10 ethanol gasoline via smartphone photography, with a robust working curve.








Abstract
Although solvatochromic materials provide visual function to differentiate solvents, they fail to precisely monitor complex solvent environments where solvent composition varies dynamically, because of an insensitive absorptional shift in these environments. Relatively, their fluorescence signal change, which should be more sensitive, has always been inefficient, resulting from inherent challenges in excited&#8208;state dynamics. Here, we present a charge&#8208;rearrangement averaged dye design, instead of traditional donor&#8208;acceptor structures, to enable a high locally excited or twisted intramolecular charge transfer emission efficiency. A ratiometric dual&#8208;fluorescence behavior can be observed along with a solvent&#8208;dependent emission trade&#8208;off rather than complete quenching. In this case, the dyes can not only precisely visualize various mixed solvents but also enable heterogeneous detection with over hundreds of reuse cycles after being integrated into a crosslinked polymer. The leading portable material achieves a self&#8208;calibrated visual tracking of ethanol content (error&lt;0.2%) with a robust working curve (R2&#160;=&#160;0.9992) while applied to E10 ethanol gasoline, operable via user&#8208;friendly software analysis through mobile phone photography.

         <title>Fluorine&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; Induced Alkyne Concentrating and Orderly Arranged Sulfonate&#8208;Adjusted Interfacial Water Structure Promote Alkene Electrosynthesis at Large Current Densities</title>

Nafion ionomer&#8208;modified palladium nanotips are designed to achieve electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes with an 83% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The F&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; effect induces the alkyne concentrating around the electrode surface and the orderly arranged SO3&#8722; under bias potentials repels the water cation away from the electrode surface, which contributes to increasing the interfacial alkyne&#8211;water ratio, thus suppressing H2 evolution and improving the FE at a high current density.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes with water at nearly industrial current densities is highly important. However, a low interfacial alkyne&#8211;water ratio leads to severe hydrogen evolution, making it extremely challenging to obtain alkenes with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE). Here, a strategy involving fluorine&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction&#8208;induced alkyne concentration and orderly arranged sulfonate&#8208;repelled interfacial water&#8208;cation is developed over commercial Nafion&#8208;modified palladium nanotips, enabling electrolysis of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;buten&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBE) with up to 83% FE under &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The fluorine&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; effect concentrates the alkyne via its adsorption enhancement, promotes electron transfer, and lowers the activation energy, thus accelerating hydrogenation kinetics. Under the bias potential, the side chain of Nafion undergoing rearrangement from disordered to nearly ordered significantly decreases the interfacial free water coverage and activity, thereby reducing the amount of in situ&#8208;generated surface&#8208;active hydrogen, which contributes to suppressing hydrogen evolution and improving the FE. An 82% FE and 18.9&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 reaction rate of MBE is achieved in a 10&#160;h continuous electrosynthesis at 1.25 A, demonstrating potential utility. Furthermore, the hydrogenation and deuteration of different alkynes with improved Faradaic efficiencies at &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 rationalize the design concept.

Fe&#8208;triazolate (Fe(ta)2) and its metal&#8208;substituted derivatives (Fe&#8208;Metal(ta)2) MOFs are reported as dual&#8208;function materials for light absorption and water oxidation catalysis in acidic media, achieving a highest photocurrent of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 A cm&#8722;2 at bias&#160;+&#160;1.4&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis is an emerging technology that achieves renewable fuels, such as hydrogen, from sunlight. Its realization depends on finding highly active and stable catalysts of water splitting and photoactive materials for light absorption. To be scalable, these should contain only abundant elements. Here, for the first time, Fe&#8208;triazolate (Fe(ta)2) and its metal substituted derivatives (Fe&#8208;Metal(ta)2) Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are characterized as new dual&#8208;function materials for photo&#8208;absorption and water oxidation catalysis in acidic media. The materials were studied by a range of structural, spectroscopic, and computational density functional theory (DFT) techniques. Fe(ta)2 and Fe&#8208;Mn(ta)2 were found to be highly active and stable in chemical and photochemical water oxidation, and in addition function as photoanodes, with photo&#8208;electrocatalytic currents (&#8764;2.00 x 10&#8722;3 Acm&#8722;2 at&#160;+&#160;1.4&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl) at pH&#160;=&#160;1. The possibility of a unique catalytic mechanism where O&#9472;O bond formation is possible from the coupling of two adjacent FeIV&#160;=&#160;O fragments was demonstrated by DFT analysis. Thus, Fe&#8208;triazolate MOF has been established as a new, stable, scalable, versatile, and efficient platform for sustainable energy conversion in the realm of artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Correlated Luminescence Enabled by Bright&#8211;Dark Radical Pairing in a Diradical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric luminescent diradical comprising a non&#8208;luminescent (dark) radical and a luminescent (bright) radical was designed. The dark radical significantly modulates the photoluminescence (PL) of the bright radical, yielding a unique three&#8208;stage magnetoluminescence (ML) response across distinct low&#8208;temperature magnetic field regimes: hyperfine coupling (HFC) (B&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05 T), &#916;g&#8208;induced spin mixing (0.05&#8211;0.8 T), and spin polarization (0.8&#8211;7 T).








Abstract
Spin&#8208;optical modulation lies at the core of emerging technologies in spintronics, spin&#8208;based optoelectronics, and quantum materials. Open&#8208;shell luminescent diradicals, featuring two unpaired and synthetically tunable spins, offer a molecular platform to achieve such control. However, previous studies have been restricted to symmetric systems, where spin interactions occur between two identical, luminescent radicals. Here, we demonstrate that a non&#8208;luminescent (dark) radical can effectively modulate the spin and photophysical behavior of a luminescent (bright) radical within an asymmetric diradical framework. The resulting molecule exhibits a unique three&#8208;stage magnetoluminescence (ML) response at low temperatures, arising from hyperfine coupling (HFC) (B&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05 T), the &#916;g&#8208;induced spin mixing (0.05&#8211;0.8 T), and spin polarization (0.8&#8211;7 T). Notably, the system exhibits pronounced ML enhancement (&gt;14%) under ultra&#8208;low magnetic fields (B&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05 T), a previously unreported phenomenon in molecular spin&#8208;optical systems. These findings establish asymmetric bright&#8211;dark diradicals as a powerful new motif for spin&#8208;photon interface design, providing fresh insights into the fundamental photophysics of open&#8208;shell systems.

     alt="Spin-Correlated Luminescence Enabled by Bright&#8211;Dark Radical Pairing in a Diradical System"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An asymmetric luminescent diradical comprising a non-luminescent (dark) radical and a luminescent (bright) radical was designed. The dark radical significantly modulates the photoluminescence (PL) of the bright radical, yielding a unique three-stage magnetoluminescence (ML) response across distinct low-temperature magnetic field regimes: hyperfine coupling (HFC) (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;0.05 T), &lt;i&gt;&#916;g&lt;/i&gt;-induced spin mixing (0.05&#8211;0.8 T), and spin polarization (0.8&#8211;7 T).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin-optical modulation lies at the core of emerging technologies in spintronics, spin-based optoelectronics, and quantum materials. Open-shell luminescent diradicals, featuring two unpaired and synthetically tunable spins, offer a molecular platform to achieve such control. However, previous studies have been restricted to symmetric systems, where spin interactions occur between two identical, luminescent radicals. Here, we demonstrate that a non-luminescent (dark) radical can effectively modulate the spin and photophysical behavior of a luminescent (bright) radical within an asymmetric diradical framework. The resulting molecule exhibits a unique three-stage magnetoluminescence (ML) response at low temperatures, arising from hyperfine coupling (HFC) (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;0.05 T), the &lt;i&gt;&#916;g&lt;/i&gt;-induced spin mixing (0.05&#8211;0.8 T), and spin polarization (0.8&#8211;7 T). Notably, the system exhibits pronounced ML enhancement (&amp;gt;14%) under ultra-low magnetic fields (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;0.05 T), a previously unreported phenomenon in molecular spin-optical systems. These findings establish asymmetric bright&#8211;dark diradicals as a powerful new motif for spin-photon interface design, providing fresh insights into the fundamental photophysics of open-shell systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Diversified Biisoquinoline&#8208;Containing Polymers by Multicomponent C&#9472;H Activation/Annulation Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient multicomponent C&#9472;H activation/annulation polymerization was established for the in situ synthesis of diversified biisoquinoline&#8208;containing polymers (BCPs). The obtained BCPs possess good solution processability, film&#8208;forming ability, and tunable luminescent properties, and can be applied to fluorescent photopatterns. By using chiral rhodium catalysts, a series of optically active BCPs and BCP&#8211;metal complex are prepared.








Abstract
Biisoquinoline scaffolds with unique photophysical properties and latent axial chirality have received considerable attention in medical chemistry, asymmetric catalysis, and materials science. However, limited by the large synthetic difficulties, functional biisoquinoline&#8208;containing polymers (BCPs) have rarely been reported. Furthermore, the construction of optically active BCPs via asymmetric catalytic polymerization have not been achieved so far. Herein, we developed a multicomponent cascade C&#9472;H activation/annulation polymerization (CAAP) strategy that can facilely convert readily available benzil derivatives, internal diynes, and ammonium acetate into structurally diverse BCPs via successive C&#9472;H activation and N&#8208;annulation processes in a one&#8208;pot and one&#8208;step operation. The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed CAAP reactions proceed efficiently under air, affording a variety of multisubstituted BCPs with high molecular weights (Mw up to 49900&#160;g mol&#8722;1) in good yields. Benefiting from the unique structures, the resulting BCPs exhibit excellent solubility, good film&#8208;forming capability, and readily tunable luminescent properties. The luminescent thin films of a photosensitive BCP can be applied for the generation of multiscale fluorescent photopatterns with high resolution. Moreover, by using different chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium catalysts, a series of optically active BCPs and BCP&#8211;metal complex with stable axially chiral configurations are in situ generated from the asymmetric CAAP reactions.

         <title>Stable Ultramicroporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Domains for Selective Gas Adsorption</title>

The ultramicroporous pores of TUB41 selectively host water and CO2 molecules at distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic compartments without competition. 








Abstract
Herein, we report the thermal and chemical stability, and the gas adsorption behavior, of a mixed&#8208;linker phosphonate MOF, [Cu(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)0.5(1,4&#8208;NDPAH2)], namely TUB41 (where bpy&#160;=&#160;bipyridine and NDPAH4&#160;=&#160;naphthalenediphosphonic acid). TUB41 demonstrates remarkable chemical stability across a wide pH range (1&#8211;11) and retains its structural integrity after 2 years of repeated adsorption cycles and activation at 80&#160;&#176;C under ambient humidity. Cryogenic adsorption experiments reveal that TUB41's pores selectively exclude gases with larger kinetic diameters, such as N2 and Ar, while accommodating smaller molecules like CO2 and H2O at elevated temperatures. The enthalpies of adsorption for CO2 at a loading 0.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 and H2O at a loading of 0.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 are &#8722;41 and &#8722;38&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, reflecting their strongly attractive interactions with TUB41 under different conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that CO2 molecules adopt ordered arrangements in the central hydrophobic regions of the pores, guided by strong nonbonding interactions, while H2O molecules preferentially bind to the hydrophilic secondary building units. Mean&#8208;squared displacement analyses confirm that both gases remain spatially constrained within the pores. These findings highlight TUB41 as a chemically robust and highly selective MOF, with potential for applications in gas separation, photocatalytic water splitting, and CO2 reduction under challenging conditions.

A continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical C&#8211;H amination strategy enables efficient and scalable synthesis of (hetero)arylamines from electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arenes via a pyridination&#8211;aminolysis sequence. The method avoids strong oxidants and metal catalysts, delivering over 100 grams of product with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance.








Abstract
The direct C&#9472;H amination of arenes is a powerful strategy for synthesizing arylamines, yet existing methods often suffer from limited substrate scope, poor selectivity, or scalability issues, particularly for electron&#8208;deficient arenes. Here, we introduce a continuous flow electrochemical C&#9472;H amination via a pyridination&#8208;aminolysis sequence, enabling the efficient functionalization of arenes with diverse electronic properties. The method operates under continuous flow electrochemical conditions, avoiding the need for divided cells, strong chemical oxidants, or homogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts. The broad substrate scope includes a wide range of electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;deficient, and halogenated arenes, as well as heterocycles, demonstrating excellent functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the process is readily scalable, as shown by a 4&#8208;day continuous operation in parallel microreactors, producing over 100 grams of aniline product with high efficiency. This study highlights the potential of continuous&#8208;flow electrochemistry as a versatile and practical platform for sustainable C&#9472;H functionalization in organic synthesis.

A poorly soluble organic molecule, N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimide (NDI&#8208;DTMA), with a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure, has been demonstrated to be an efficient anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries with fast Na+ transport kinetics. This has led to a reversible capacity of 200&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after stable 2000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Carbonyl&#8208;containing organic electrodes have been widely considered as ideal substitutes for traditional inorganic compounds in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their excellent redox reversibility and structural tunability. However, constructing effective Na+ diffusion channels in these materials is very challenging. To address this issue, we design a new organic molecule, N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenediimide (NDI&#8208;DTMA), containing a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure. The D&#8211;A&#8211;D architecture significantly enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation extent of single organic material while narrowing its bandgap, facilitating electron transportation along the NDI&#8208;DTMA skeletons. Moreover, 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl groups not only suppress dissolution issue but also enlarge the intermolecular planar spacing for&#160;Na+ mobility through constructing efficient transport channels. As an electrode material for SIBs, NDI&#8208;DTMA achieves a reversible capacity of 200&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1 owing&#160;to its fast Na+ kinetics. Through systematic investigation on the anomalous capacity increase and the dynamic evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), we have elucidated the fundamental mechanisms that the distinctive NDI&#8208;DTMA architecture enables exceptional energy storage performance. This work pioneers a design paradigm of organic small molecules that simultaneously address low solubility, high conductivity, and rapid ion transport, thereby providing a transformative strategy for SIBs.

&lt;p&gt;A poorly soluble organic molecule, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (NDI-DTMA), with a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure, has been demonstrated to be an efficient anode in sodium-ion batteries with fast Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport kinetics. This has led to a reversible capacity of 200&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after stable 2000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbonyl-containing organic electrodes have been widely considered as ideal substitutes for traditional inorganic compounds in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their excellent redox reversibility and structural tunability. However, constructing effective Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion channels in these materials is very challenging. To address this issue, we design a new organic molecule, &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (NDI-DTMA), containing a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure. The D&#8211;A&#8211;D architecture significantly enhances &#960;-conjugation extent of single organic material while narrowing its bandgap, facilitating electron transportation along the NDI-DTMA skeletons. Moreover, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl groups not only suppress dissolution issue but also enlarge the intermolecular planar spacing for&#160;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mobility through constructing efficient transport channels. As an electrode material for SIBs, NDI-DTMA achieves a reversible capacity of 200&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 2000 cycles at 1&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; owing&#160;to its fast Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; kinetics. Through systematic investigation on the anomalous capacity increase and the dynamic evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), we have elucidated the fundamental mechanisms that the distinctive NDI-DTMA architecture enables exceptional energy storage performance. This work pioneers a design paradigm of organic small molecules that simultaneously address low solubility, high conductivity, and rapid ion transport, thereby providing a transformative strategy for SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Paired Pulse Electrocatalytic Conversion of Phenol for Co&#8208;Production of Cyclohexanol and Para&#8208;Benzoquinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed paired pulse system achieves the selective conversion of phenol in wastewater for co&#8208;production of valuable cyclohexanol and para&#8208;benzoquinone, with an unexpected Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and an ultra&#8208;low energy consumption of 0.064&#160;kWh&#160;mol&#8722;1.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of organic pollutants in wastewater into value&#8208;added chemicals presents a dual solution for water treatment and sustainable synthesis, yet achieving high Faradaic and energy efficiencies remains challenging. Here we, for the first time, report the paired electrolysis strategy to produce valuable cyclohexanol and para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) simultaneously from phenol in wastewater. More importantly, to address the dilemma of mismatched operation conditions between cathodic hydrogenation and anodic oxidation, we propose a pulse current strategy with alternating high&#8208;/low&#8208;current periods, which ensures the reduction kinetics of phenol at the cathode while effectively preventing the over&#8208;oxidation of generated p&#8208;BQ at the anode. By using tailored PdRu/C and NiRu/C as the cathode and anode, the paired pulse system realizes 84.9% phenol conversion and 83.9% cyclohexanol yield at the cathode, alongside 100% phenol conversion and 68.5% p&#8208;BQ yield at the anode, with an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and ultra&#8208;low energy consumption of 0.064&#160;kWh&#160;mol&#8722;1. Carbon emission accounting and techno&#8208;economic analysis highlight its environmental benefits and economic feasibility (US$1.36 profit per kg phenol). This work offers a green and efficient route for environmental remediation and resource recovery.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Polyoxometalate Supramolecular Nanosheets for Efficient and Durable Water Oxidation</title>

Three self&#8208;assembled polyoxometalate superstructures with ultrathin graphene&#8208;like morphologies exhibit enhanced conductivity and increased exposure of activity sites, leading to a significant improvement in catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Superstructures assembled from nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs) attract considerable interest due to their well&#8208;defined architectures and outstanding physicochemical properties. However, the targeted synthesis of self&#8208;assembled POM&#8208;based superstructures with high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalytic performance remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the rational design and construction of three POM&#8208;based superstructures with ultrathin graphene&#8208;like morphologies and well&#8208;organized frameworks via a simple self&#8208;assembled method, in which transition metals (TMs) bridge POMs into graphene&#8208;like planes, while cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) serves as an intercalation agent, endowing the structures with high surface area and enhanced electronic conductivity. Among the resulting materials (denote as POM&#8208;CTAB&#8208;TM, TM&#9552;Co, Ni, or Cu), POM&#8208;CTAB&#8208;Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving a low overpotential of 292&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical calculations underscore that the Co atoms within the POM serve as active sites and facilitate the rate&#8208;determining step of *OOH formation. Moreover, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer employing POM&#8208;CTAB&#8208;Co as the anode and Pt/C as the cathode demonstrates exceptional performance, delivering a current density of 2&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 2.247&#160;V, along with remarkable durability exceeding 2000&#160;h at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This study develops a simple and efficient method for synthesizing supramolecular POM&#8208;based nanosheets as OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>De Novo Designed &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Peptides Mimicking the Copper&#8208;Binding Histidine Brace Motif of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the copper&#8208;binding histidine brace (His&#8208;brace) motif found in lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) enzymes was engineered in de novo designed peptides that fold as &#946;&#8208;hairpins (HisPins). Cu&#8208;HisPins complexes showed LPMO&#8208;like activity, including light&#8208;stimulated melanin&#8208;mediated oxidative cellulose degradation. Hence, they represent the first structural and functional LPMO mimics based on folded peptide scaffolds.








Abstract
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are Cu&#8208;containing enzymes that play a crucial role in lignocellulosic biomass degradation for use in biofuel production. These enzymes carry out the selective oxidation of C&#9472;H bonds in the sugar units, leading to the cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Creating LPMO mimics facilitates the study of the mechanism of action, the characterisation of the reactive species responsible for the C&#9472;H bond activation and the potential scale up for industrial application. Here, we report the design, structural and functional characterisation of two novel Cu&#8208;binding &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptides, called HisPins, that mimic the Histidine&#8208;brace site of LPMOs. Activity assays were conducted with p&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside (PNPG) and demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;HisPins show LPMO&#8208;like activity on the model substrate. Furthermore, the Cu&#8208;HisPins can also perform light&#8208;driven oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) in the presence of melanin, similarly to some LPMO enzymes. Hence, the Cu&#8208;HisPins represent the first structural and functional LPMO mimics based on short, folded peptide sequences and show a light&#8208;stimulated melanin&#8208;mediated oxidative activity, which is unreported for any LPMO mimic characterised so far. Thus, this work paves the way to further exploration of LPMO mechanism, structure&#8208;activity relationship and substrate scope expansion.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Cleavage of C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C Bonds in Lignin Linkages by Water Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>

Spontaneous and ultrafast C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavage of various lignin models was achieved by taking advantage of the unique and strong alkaline environment at the air&#8211;water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, yielding value&#8208;added aromatic chemicals.








Abstract
Bulk water serves as an inert environment for lignin linkages, resulting in their natural half&#8208;lives that extend over centuries. In this study, we present the striking results of the spontaneous and ultrafast C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavage of various lignin models in water microdroplets, yielding value&#8208;added aromatic chemicals.

&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous and ultrafast C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavage of various lignin models was achieved by taking advantage of the unique and strong alkaline environment at the air&#8211;water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, yielding value-added aromatic chemicals.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulk water serves as an inert environment for lignin linkages, resulting in their natural half-lives that extend over centuries. In this study, we present the striking results of the spontaneous and ultrafast C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavage of various lignin models in water microdroplets, yielding value-added aromatic chemicals. The &#946;-O-4 linkages, the most abundant interunit linkages in natural lignin, were selectively cleaved at C&lt;sub&gt;&#946;&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;O bonds, producing phenols in yields exceeding 70%. Mechanistic studies elucidated that the cleavage of &#946;-O-4 linkages is derived from the unique alkaline environment at the air&#8211;water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, even in the absence of extra alkalis.

         <title>Asymmetric Radical Coupling to Form &#946;2,2,3&#8208;Amino Acid Esters by Synergistic Chiral Phosphoric Acid and Photocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A mild, modular approach is described for the stereocontrolled assembly of structurally complex &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino acid esters, overcoming long&#8208;standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency. Beyond its synthetic utility, this method offers new opportunities for expanding the chemical space of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives and holds promise for advancing medicinal chemistry and peptide&#8208;based drug discovery.








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Amino acids are essential building blocks in bioactive molecules, offering unique properties and potential in peptide and drug synthesis. Among them, &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino acids&#8212;characterized by a contiguous quaternary and tertiary stereocenter&#8212;represent a structurally unique subclass with promising biological potential. However, their broader application has been hampered by the scarcity of general and efficient synthetic methods. To address these challenges, we have developed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical&#8208;radical coupling strategy enabled by chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. In this synergistic dual catalytic system, &#946;&#8208;keto esters are activated by CPA and undergo single&#8208;electron oxidation to generate tertiary carbon radicals, while redox&#8208;active NHPI esters derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids are reduced via SET to form &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals. Under the chiral environment provided by CPA, these radicals engage in highly selective cross&#8208;coupling to afford &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino esters in good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This strategy provides a mild, modular approach for the stereo&#8208;controlled assembly of structurally complex &#946;2,2,3&#8208;amino esters, overcoming long&#8208;standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency. Beyond its synthetic utility, this method offers new opportunities for expanding the chemical space of &#946;&#8208;amino acid derivatives and holds promise for advancing medicinal chemistry and peptide&#8208;based drug discovery.

         <title>Extending the Chemistry of Scheelite&#8208;type Oxides with Borates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the first successful isolation of [BO2F2] tetrahedra in a crystalline solid. This was enabled by employing Sb's stereochemically active lone pair electrons to stabilize these discrete [BO2F2] units, ultimately leading to the discovery of SbBO2F2&#8212;the first borate compound adopting a scheelite&#8208;type structure.








Abstract
Scheelite&#8208;type oxides have been extensively investigated in diverse inorganic systems due to their exceptional structural versatility and promising multifunctional properties, ranging from luminescence to ionic conduction. However, despite decades of research, borates have remained conspicuously absent from this important structural family. This exclusion stems from a fundamental synthetic and structure chemistry challenge: the difficulty in achieving the essential zero&#8208;dimensional anionic framework composed of isolated tetrahedral units, a defining characteristic of scheelite&#8208;type materials. In this work, we break this long&#8208;standing barrier by reporting the first successful isolation of [BO2F2] tetrahedra in a crystalline solid. This breakthrough was enabled by employing Sb's stereochemically active lone pair electrons to stabilize these discrete [BO2F2] units, ultimately leading to the discovery of SbBO2F2&#8212;the first borate compound adopting a scheelite&#8208;type structure. Through a combination of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, spectroscopic techniques, and first&#8208;principles calculations, we unequivocally confirm the scheelite&#8208;type framework of SbBO2F2 and demonstrate its remarkable multifunctional properties, including anisotropic thermal expansion, ionic conductivity, and large birefringence. This work not only expands the structural chemistry of scheelite&#8208;type oxides with borates but also opens new avenues for designing multifunctional materials through targeted anionic group isolation.

         <title>Efficient Glycine Electrosynthesis via CO2&#8208;Recyclable Hydrogen Donation on Pb/Pb7Bi3 Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CO2&#8208;assisted Pb/Pb7Bi3 catalytic system enables efficient and selective electrochemical glycine synthesis from oxalic acid and nitrogen sources. The PbBi&#8208;II catalyst achieves a high glycine Faradaic efficiency of 91.8% via a cyclic hydrogen&#8208;donation pathway and maintains stable performance over 120 h, highlighting the effectiveness of heterointerface engineering and CO2 co&#8208;catalysis in facilitating C&#9472;N bond formation.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a sustainable platform in constructing C&#9472;N bonds for amino acid production. Glycine, a particularly valuable target compound, continues to experience escalating global demand, yet achieving simultaneous high efficiency and operational stability remains a persistent challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a CO2&#8208;mediated strategy for glycine electrosynthesis using oxalic acid and N2/nitrate as feedstocks. By using Pb/Pb7Bi3&#8208;CO2 catalytic system, a very high glycine Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.8% with durable stability over 120 h could be achieved. Moreover, when using nonthermal plasma&#8208;activated N2 as the nitrogen source, the glycine production rate could maintain at 94.4&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with N&#8208;selectivity as high as 93.2%. Mechanistic investigations combining experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that CO2 undergoes facile protonation on the Pb/Pb7Bi3 heterointerfaces to form *OCOH intermediate, which donates hydrogen for the reduction of oxalic acid and nitrate into glyoxylic acid and NH2OH, respectively, while CO2 is simultaneously regenerated. Notably, hydrogenation via the *OCOH intermediate significantly lowers the energy barriers compared to direct protonation, thereby promoting the subsequent spontaneous C&#9472;N bond formation and enabling highly efficient electrosynthesis of glycine.

One&#8208;step purification of ethylene (C2H4) from the ternary mixtures of acetylene/carbon dioxide/ethylene (C2H2/CO2/C2H4) is a critical industrial challenge due to their similar physical and chemical properties. Herein, we reported a cage engineering strategy in anion&#8208;pillared metal&#8208;organic frameworks (APMOFs) for efficient C2H2 and CO2 capture simultaneously. Specifically, two stable ZrF62&#8722; anion&#8208;pillared cage&#8208;type MOFs (ZNU&#8208;17 and ZNU&#8208;27) are prepared with both ultramicroporous (&#8764;4&#160;&#197;) and microporous (&gt;7&#160;&#197;) cages but featuring different shapes. While ZNU&#8208;17 allows the efficient binary C2H2/C2H4 separation, ZNU&#8208;27 enables the benchmark ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 separation by increasing the adsorption affinity toward CO2. Notably, remarkably increased C2H2 (170.1&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;versus 120.1 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) and CO2 (91.8&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;versus 64.5 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) adsorption capacities are achieved in ZNU&#8208;27, and the IAST selectivity of ZNU&#8208;27 for CO2/C2H4 is 4.3 times as high as that of ZNU&#8208;17 (6.5&#160;versus 1.5). The C2H2, CO2 and C2H4 binding sites in ZNU&#8208;27 are studied by gas loaded in situ single crystal structure and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, which revealed that the unique fluorinated 8.5&#160;&#197; spherical cages provide strong hydrogen binding or electrostatic interactions for C2H2 and CO2. Dynamic breakthrough tests show that from a C2H2/CO2/C2H4 (1/9/90) mixture, polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&#8805;99.99%) can be obtained in ZNU&#8208;27 with a high productivity of 12.04&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Preparation of Degradable Polymers Containing Tunable Ratios of Dithioacetals and Disulfides via Mixed Mode Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the preparation of redox degradable polymers containing tunable ratios of dithioacetals and disulfides via a one&#8208;pot mixed&#8208;mode reaction. The amount of dithioacetals is able to be increased by adding more of the methylene source.








Abstract
Degradable polymers hold promise for their recyclability and their potential to facilitate the transition toward a circular economy of plastics. As such, a consecutive di&#8208;SN2 reaction between dithiols and polyhalogenated compounds was used to produce degradable polymers with tunable amounts of redox&#8208;enabled dithioacetal and disulfide linkages. The reaction employed bases of varying strengths and different thiol types, allowing for control over molecular weights ranging from &lt;1&#160;kDa to 16&#160;kDa, with tunable degrees of polymerization ranging from 3 to over 75. The ratio of dithioacetals to disulfides was adjusted by manipulating the concentration of the methylene source, enabling the formation of polymers with up to 100% disulfide linkages or up to 93% dithioacetal linkages. This tunability resulted in polymers with multiple redox degradation pathways, capable of being degraded by either reduction or oxidation. Vinyl ether functionalized, telechelic oligomers were used as crosslinkers in network formation, yielding materials with multiple degradation pathways. This di&#8208;SN2 approach provides a promising and straightforward method for creating materials with tailored degradation characteristics.

         <title>The Natural Redox Cofactor Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ) Enables Photocatalytic Radical Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural alcohol and sugar dehydrogenases that utilize the redox cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) can be repurposed for enantioselective photoredox catalysis. Upon blue&#8208;light irradiation, redox&#8208;neutral radical cyclizations are catalyzed. This work adds a new class of enzymes to the toolbox of photobiocatalysis.








Abstract
Photoenzymatic catalysis facilitates stereoselective new&#8208;to&#8208;nature chemistry under mild conditions. In addition to the rational design of artificial photoenzymes, naturally occurring redox enzymes can be repurposed to promote photoredox catalysis in the chiral protein environment. Here, we show that enzymes utilizing the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor expand the toolbox of photobiocatalysis. PQQ absorbs visible light and is capable of single&#8208;electron transfer. It thus exhibits mechanistic similarities to flavin cofactors, which are widely used for photoenzymatic approaches. First, we established the trimethyl ester PQQMe3 as a stand&#8208;alone photoredox catalyst in pure organic solvent. Upon excitation, PQQMe3 enables the redox&#8208;neutral radical cyclization of an N&#8208;(bromoalkyl)&#8208;substituted indole. We then tested a panel of PQQ&#8208;dependent sugar and alcohol dehydrogenases for photoenzymatic catalysis in aqueous buffer, focusing on a redox&#8208;neutral radical reaction to form oxindoles. Under optimized reaction conditions, we obtained a 69% yield and an 82:18 enantiomeric ratio. Our work thus demonstrates that PQQ enzymes are capable of stereoselective photoredox catalysis. Future enzyme engineering efforts based on computational modeling and directed evolution will fully unlock their synthetic potential.

         <title>Engineering Anion&#8208;Diluent Matrix for Ion&#8208;Decoupled Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes toward Highly Stable Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte with a unique anion&#8208;diluent matrix (ADM) formed by amphiphilic zinc salt and diluent is proposed. The locally concentrated Zn2+ and de&#8208;anionized Zn2+ solvation structure reduce ionic transport barriers, yielding a high transference number (0.72). The electrolyte spontaneously segregates into biphasic H2O&#8208;rich/poor nanodomains that disrupt continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, restricting proton&#8208;hopping, and mitigating parasitic reactions.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries suffer from electrolyte&#8208;induced degradation despite their inherent safety advantages. While localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) mitigate interfacial instability, the excessive cation&#8211;anion association elevate ionic transport barriers, resulting in sluggish migration kinetics. Herein, ion&#8208;decoupled LHCE (ID&#8208;LHCE) are proposed using amphiphilic 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;1&#8208;propanol (TFP) as anion&#8208;affinity diluent. The TFP&#8208;mediated anion&#8208;diluent matrix (ADM) liberates anion OTF&#8722; from Zn2+ solvation sheaths, which maintains Zn2+&#8208;enriched nanodomains while significantly reducing ionic transport barriers with an elevated Zn2+ transference number of 0.72. ADM decouples aqueous networks into biphasic H2O&#8208;rich/poor nanodomains, establishing a localized environment with attenuated water activity that suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction. Concurrently generated water&#8208;deficient interfaces and dehydrated OTF&#8722; coordination environment synergistically facilitate the construction of dense gradient heterogeneous SEI: an inner ZnF2&#8208;ZnS inorganic layer and an outer oligomer layer, enabling dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition with ultralong cyclability (3,000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 99.88% coulombic efficiency. Full cells paired with NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O cathodes retain 72.5% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Practical viability is demonstrated by the stable operation of high mass loading ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level pouch cells (1.04&#160;Ah). By correlating molecular interactions, nanoscale phase separation, and macroscopic ion migration, this work establishes a multiscale design paradigm for electrolyte nanostructure.

Concurrently generated water-deficient interfaces and dehydrated OTF&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; coordination environment synergistically facilitate the construction of dense gradient heterogeneous SEI: an inner ZnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ZnS inorganic layer and an outer oligomer layer, enabling dendrite-free zinc deposition with ultralong cyclability (3,000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 99.88% coulombic efficiency. Full cells paired with NaV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;1.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O cathodes retain 72.5% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Practical viability is demonstrated by the stable operation of high mass loading ampere-hour-level pouch cells (1.04&#160;Ah). By correlating molecular interactions, nanoscale phase separation, and macroscopic ion migration, this work establishes a multiscale design paradigm for electrolyte nanostructure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Construct Local Acidic Microenvironment of Boron&#8208;Intercalated Osmium with Anti&#8208;Precipitation and Corrosion&#8208;Resistant for Seawater&#8208;splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 40, September 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interstitial boron in B&#8208;Os catalysts exhibit lower overpotential and superior stability compared with commercial Pt/C. Experimentally, the electron&#8208;rich Os can effectively inhibit precipitation formation and chloride corrosion in natural seawater environment, which is highly consistent with theoretical calculations and experimental observations. In addition, the catalyst also demonstrates outstanding performance in anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, which shows excellent prospects for commercial applications.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis represents a promising avenue for hydrogen production, nevertheless, the Cl&#8722; corrosion and surface deposition of Ca(OH)2/Mg(OH)2 hinder its practical application by deactivation. Herein, an interstitial boron doped osmium (B&#8208;Os) is ultrafast (10&#160;s) constructed by microwave quasi&#8208;solid approach, where theoretical and experimental analysis proves that the interstitial boron triggers electron enrichment at the Os site and the formation of negative charge centers. The modified electronic structure electrostatically inhibits Cl&#8722; corrosion as well as promotes H3O+ adsorption, creating a local acidic microenvironment in the natural seawater, neutralizing OH&#8722; and effectively avoiding Ca2+/Mg2+ deposition. In situ spectroscopy and local pH monitoring confirm the pivotal role of the microenvironment in regulating reaction kinetics and stability. Therefore, B&#8208;Os exhibits a remarkably low overpotential, for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), of 7 mV@10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater, while maintaining stable performance over 400 h of stable operation in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C. Economic evaluation highlights its hydrogen production costs ($0.81 GGE&#8722;1) undercutting the U.S. DOE target.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Cages for Ultrafast Photocatalytic Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel metallo&#8208;cages were designed and self&#8208;assembled, exhibiting exceptional photocatalytic activity for H2O2 production. Through a bottom&#8208;up strategy, the metallo&#8208;cage were dispersed into ultrasmall nanoscale particles, achieving a record H2O2 production rate of 77, 401&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.97%, outperforming most reported systems.








Abstract
In the realm of photocatalytic production, discrete metallo&#8208;organic cages have emerged as promising photocatalysts. However, their performance is often constrained by limited substrate accessibility and sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. Herein, we designed and synthesized two novel nonnoble metallo&#8208;cages, S1 and S2, and evaluated their photocatalytic activities. Benefit from the high structural stability, low exciton binding energy (52.9&#160;meV), ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer (49.50&#160;ps), and prolonged excited&#8208;state lifetime (1, 970&#160;ps), S2 exhibits efficient charge carrier separation. In addition, a bottom&#8208;up approach was employed to disperse S2 into ultrasmall nanoscale particles, which significantly enhanced substrate accessibility and the reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the addition of sodium oxalate not only optimizes charge carrier separation and utilization but also provides a kinetically favorable pathway for superoxide radical anion (&#183;O2&#8722;) generation, overcoming ORR kinetic bottlenecks. These synergistic effects culminate in a record production rate of 77, 401&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1h&#8722;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.97%, outperforming most reported organic photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Oriented Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Activation via Proximal Oligoalkyl Quaternary Ammonium Grafting Enhances Long&#8208;Chain PFAS Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical modifications of MOFs enhance per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) removal potential but remain limited by unfavorable surface chemistry modulation. Our work introduces a surface&#8208;localized oligomeric grafting strategy to functionalize water&#8208;stable MOFs with dense, accessible, and highly active sorption sites. This structure&#8208;engineered sorbent exhibits strong synergistic PFAS capture through dual&#8208;mode coordination, demonstrating superior long&#8208;chain PFAS removal performance. 








Abstract
A structure&#8208;oriented design of zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) for long&#8208;chain per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is critically needed, as current efficacy faces limitations, including restricted micropore functionalization, limited coordination sites, and weak host&#8211;guest interactions. Here, we present a surface&#8208;localized oligomeric grafting strategy to functionalize UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 with proximally arranged oligoalkyl&#8208;quaternary ammonium (PAOQ) motifs, yielding UiO&#8208;66&#8208;L3 sorbent. Unlike conventional grafting approaches, the PAOQ motifs containing repetitive functional groups predominantly extend beyond surface pore layers, circumventing intrinsic grafting limitations of the MOF backbone and achieving a 2.2&#8208;fold increase in group loading. This tailored architecture enables strong synergistic interactions through precise spatial alignment of quaternary ammonium moieties and conformationally flexible oligoalkyl chains, promoting dual&#8208;mode coordination with long&#8208;chain PFAS. Consequently, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;L3 exhibits rapid kinetics (equilibrium within 5 min) and high sorption capacities (403&#8211;1872&#160;mg g&#8722;1) for long&#8208;chain PFAS and derivatives, outperforming alkylated/quaternized analogs by up to 13.3&#8208;fold. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that electronic redistribution induced by oligoalkyl segments enhances the electrostatic potential at adjacent ammonium centers, enabling chain&#8208;length&#8208;dependent selectivity with sorption coefficients ranging from 2.3 to 4.9. Our work highlights the critical role of surface chemistry modulation in Zr&#8208;MOFs and advances structure&#8208;oriented design of high&#8208;performance sorbents for long&#8208;chain PFAS and derivatives.

         <title>Synergistic Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis and Photocatalysis via TiO2@PTFE Composites for Efficient N2 to NH3 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step synthesized TiO2@PTFE catalyst integrates contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis with photocatalysis, achieving 133.6 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 NH3 production under mild conditions. The synergy arises from improved dispersion, electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven charge separation, Fermi&#8208;level upshift, and enhanced N2 adsorption. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations confirm dual&#8208;field&#8208;driven activation, providing a sustainable pathway for efficient nitrogen fixation and advanced catalyst design.








Abstract
Catalytic nitrogen fixation from N2 and water under mild conditions offers a sustainable NH3 synthesis route. Herein, we report a synergistic nitrogen fixation strategy combining contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC) with photocatalysis via one&#8208;step in situ hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 @PTFE catalyst, and achieved an activity of 133.6 &#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. It represents 10.9&#8208;fold and 7.5&#8208;fold enhancements over pristine TiO2 and PTFE, respectively, outperforming current CEC systems and many photocatalytic systems operating without sacrificial agents. Further characterization and theoretical calculations reveal the synergy: the composite catalyst enhances the CEC catalyst dispersion; the CEC&#8208;generated electric fields promote photogenerated charge separation and elevate the semiconductor's Fermi level, bolstering photocatalytic N2 reduction; conversely, the semiconductor boosts CEC efficiency via enhanced N2 adsorption and supplemental electron donation. We anticipate that this work establishes a &#8220;two birds with one stone&#8221; strategy, providing novel insights into CEC&#8208;photocatalysis synergy and a pathway for rational design of high&#8208;performance nitrogen fixation catalysts.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic nitrogen fixation from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water under mild conditions offers a sustainable NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis route. Herein, we report a synergistic nitrogen fixation strategy combining contact-electro-catalysis (CEC) with photocatalysis via one-step in situ hydrothermally synthesized TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; @PTFE catalyst, and achieved an activity of 133.6 &#181;mol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It represents 10.9-fold and 7.5-fold enhancements over pristine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PTFE, respectively, outperforming current CEC systems and many photocatalytic systems operating without sacrificial agents. Further characterization and theoretical calculations reveal the synergy: the composite catalyst enhances the CEC catalyst dispersion; the CEC-generated electric fields promote photogenerated charge separation and elevate the semiconductor's Fermi level, bolstering photocatalytic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction; conversely, the semiconductor boosts CEC efficiency via enhanced N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and supplemental electron donation. We anticipate that this work establishes a &#8220;two birds with one stone&#8221; strategy, providing novel insights into CEC-photocatalysis synergy and a pathway for rational design of high-performance nitrogen fixation catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Single&#8208;Cluster Rhodium Catalyst for Efficient CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh single&#8208;cluster catalysts were designed for efficient thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. An unprecedented TOFRh of 595.2 h&#8722;1 with 95.3% ethanol selectivity and 17.5&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 ethanol yield was achieved over RhSC/CN. Mechanisms revealed by extensive characterizations and simulations demonstrate that Rh4 single&#8208;clusters facilitate efficient coupling of CH3* with CO* and benefit ethanol formation.








Abstract
Thermocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into ethanol is a promising strategy for efficient utilization of CO2. However, it remains a grand challenge to achieve a high ethanol yield due to the difficulty in accurate control of CO2 activation and C&#8211;C coupling under thermocatalytic reaction conditions. Herein, a precise rhodium (Rh) single&#8208;cluster catalyst on carbon nitride support (RhSC/CN) was designed for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol. The RhSC/CN catalyst, with an average Rh&#8211;Rh coordination number of 2.06, exhibits a record turnover frequency (TOFRh) of 595.2&#160;h&#8722;1, a high ethanol selectivity of 95.3% and an ethanol yield of 17.5&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 240&#160;&#176;C and 5.0&#160;MPa (H2/CO2&#160;=&#160;3), surpassing previously reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and H2/D2 isotope exchange probing experiments altogether reveal the reaction mechanism, and show that the synergetic interaction between Rh&#8211;Rh and Rh&#8211;N sites boosts CO2 adsorption and asymmetric C&#8211;C coupling between CH3* and CO* to form CH3CO*, leading to a high ethanol selectivity. This discovery provides new insights into the design of single&#8208;cluster catalysts for simultaneously promoting CO2 reactivity and ethanol&#160;selectivity.

         <title>Dual Spatial and Electronic Regulation in van der Waals Cu3Se2 Nanosheets for Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu3Se2 NSs are synthesized via chemical vapor transport and electrochemical exfoliation and feature in&#8208;plane Cu&#9472;Se frameworks and layered van der Waals structure. Spatial confinement and Cu 3d&#8211;Se 4p hybridization synergistically modulate Cu active sites, enabling &#960;&#8208;activation of acetylene, efficient H* utilization, and 90.6% FEethylene at 502&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with long&#8208;term stability. 








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based catalysts are promising for electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation to sustainable ethylene production, yet conventional catalysts suffer from a dilemma: contiguous Cu ensembles induce C&#9472;C coupling, while isolated Cu atoms on electronegative supports cause over&#8208;polarization and competing hydrogen evolution reaction, limiting selectivity and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ethylene. Here, we report atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals Cu3Se2 nanosheets featuring a unique Cu&#9472;Se coordination that enables simultaneous spatial confinement and electronic modulation of Cu sites. The catalyst delivers a FEethylene over 90% at a current density of 502&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and maintains &gt;90% FE for 25&#160;h at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, outperforming commercial and advanced Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic studies show that Cu 3d&#8208;Se 4p orbital hybridization tailors the density of states and d&#8208;band center, facilitating &#960;&#8208;orbital activation of acetylene, boosting active hydrogen utilization, and reducing the hydrogenation barrier. Simultaneously, it raises energy barriers for C&#9472;C coupling and H* recombination, suppressing C4 and H2 byproducts. This work positions van der Waals Cu3Se2 as a robust platform for selective ethylene production.

         <title>Submolecular&#8208;Resolution Probing of Vibrational Anharmonicity Using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores how tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy achieves submolecular resolution in detecting vibrational overtones and combination bands. This breakthrough reveals site&#8208;specific anharmonicities and energy transfer pathways within single molecules, advancing chemical analysis with unprecedented spatial and spectral detail.








Abstract
Vibrational spectroscopy can reach atomic spatial resolution via highly confined optical probes, offering local chemical insight. Yet, overtones and combination bands have not fully benefited due to weak transition moments. Here, we show submolecular&#8208;resolution detection of intense overtones and combination bands using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) for an asymmetric perylene derivative on silicon. The Raman peaks, barely visible in tunneling regime, are &#8764;10 times enhanced when the tip&#8208;apex contacts the molecule. This point&#8208;contact&#8208;mode TERS enables analysis of two anharmonicities with submolecular contrast: one arising from deviations of potential energy surfaces from harmonic shape (mechanical anharmonicity), the other from high&#8208;order polarizability derivatives (electrical anharmonicity). Spatial variation of mechanical anharmonicity reveals a vibrational energy exchange channel at the submolecular scale, highlighting potential to map energy transfer in real space.

Herein, we propose a self&#8208;phase&#8208;separating electrolyte design strategy based on heterogeneous LiPSs dissolution characteristics, using co&#8208;solvents of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) to induce spontaneous phase separation during LiPSs dissolution through solvation disparity. The constructed electrolyte system facilitates formation of a strong&#8208;solvation region at the cathode to maintain rapid sulfur redox kinetics while establishing a weak&#8208;solvation region at the anode to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), thereby achieving dual objectives of &#8220;kinetics promotion and shuttle suppression&#8221; via a spatially partitioned dual&#8208;zone synergistic mechanism. This strategy enables steady cycling above 170 cycles of single&#8208;layer Li&#8208;S pouch cells with ultra&#8208;thin Li anodes (50&#160;&#181;m) and high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading cathodes (4.3 mgs cm&#8722;2). Moreover, under practical lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions (6.2 mgs cm&#8722;2 sulfur loading, 50&#160;&#181;m Li, 3&#160;&#181;L mgs&#8722;1 electrolyte), a 1.8 Ah multi&#8208;layer pouch cell delivers 323&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 energy density with stable cycling above 50 cycles. This work provides an effective solution for resolving the critical trade&#8208;off between rapid sulfur conversion kinetics and stable anode interfacial behavior in metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries face a critical challenge in synergistically optimizing high-sulfur-loading redox kinetics and suppressing soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) shuttle effects. Herein, we propose a self-phase-separating electrolyte design strategy based on heterogeneous LiPSs dissolution characteristics, using co-solvents of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) to induce spontaneous phase separation during LiPSs dissolution through solvation disparity.

         <title>Synthesis of Bridge&#8208;Substituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentanes by Catalytic Metal Carbene Insertion into Bicyclo[1.1.0]Butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed carbene insertion reaction into bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been developed. This method enables access to previously unattainable 2&#8208;functionalized BCPs featuring quaternary and tertiary bridges, with high yields and broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies support a stepwise addition pathway with excellent regioselectivity, which avoids diene fragmentation. 








Abstract
1,2,3&#8208;Trisubstituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are emerging saturated hydrocarbon bioisosteres for polysubstituted benzenes; however, their synthesis from bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) via direct metal carbene insertion remains unrealized. Herein, we report the first catalytic metal carbene insertion into BCBs using triftosylhydrazones as safe and stable carbene precursors, which circumvents the use of [1.1.1]propellane in the synthesis of the BCPs scaffold. This operationally straightforward method accommodates a wide range of substituted BCB esters and triftosylhydrazones, enabling the synthesis of valuable 1,2,3&#8208;trisubstituted BCPs, including those bearing a trifluoromethylated quaternary all&#8208;carbon center, in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Selective post&#8208;synthetic transformations of the product BCP esters into other useful small&#8208;ring building blocks, as well as the preparation of the BCP analogue of a drug molecule fragment, demonstrate the versatility and utility of this chemistry. Mechanistic investigations, including density functional theory calculations, support a direct, stepwise metal carbene addition into the C&#9472;C bond of the BCB.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Engineering of Au&#8211;Ag Nanoclusters Enables Divergent Triplet Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle structural changes in Au&#8211;Ag nanoclusters with an identical Au6 core give rise to distinct triplet&#8208;state photoluminescence: Au6Ag2 exhibits phosphorescence, while Au6Ag4 shows dual emission involving phosphorescence and TADF, driven by differences in metal&#8211;ligand interactions and excited&#8208;state electronic coupling.








Abstract
Triplet&#8208;state&#8208;based luminescence holds great promise for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic materials, yet its mechanistic modulation through structural control remains a fundamental challenge for nanomaterials. Here, we present a comparative study of two atomically precise nanoclusters, Au6Ag2 and Au6Ag4, which feature an identical Au6 core but differ subtly in Ag atom count and ligand coordination. Despite their structural similarity and triplet dominated emission origin, the results herein reveal that Au6Ag2 exhibits phosphorescence, whereas Au6Ag4 demonstrates dual emission involving both phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The contrasting behaviors arise from fine&#8208;tuning the silver contents and organic ligands, which alters photoluminescence nature without modifying the metal core. This work highlights a structure&#8208;driven approach to regulating triplet&#8208;state photoluminescence in metal nanoclusters and offers a blueprint for designing next&#8208;generation triplet&#8208;emissive materials.

         <title>Polycyclic Heteroaromatics with Planar&#8208;Curved Hybrid Skeletons for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One kind of polycyclic heteroaromatics with the unique planar&#8208;negatively curved hybrid skeletons was constructed through the fusion of N&#8208;arylcarbazole on one side of NBN&#8208;embedded dibenzophenalene. Their photophysical properties, electrochemical behaviors, and hydrogen bond interactions can be significantly improved through tuning their curvatures. Upon visible&#8208;light stimulation, they enable high&#8208;performance photocatalytic H2O2 production.








Abstract
Creating curvature in the scaffolds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) enables breaking their molecular planarity or even symmetry, leading to some exceptional optoelectronic activities and assembling behaviors, but rarely explored for promoting photoredox catalysis. Herein, we report the synthesis of two PAHs through the fusion of N&#8208;arylcarbazole on one side of a dibenzophenalene precursor edged with a pristine zigzag nitrogen (N)&#8211;boron (B)&#8211;nitrogen (N) unit. Their unique planar&#8208;negatively curved molecular skeletons were revealed by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis. Fusing another benzene ring at the terminal positions of such kinds of PAH molecules resulted in a more contorted structure, which led to the successive reversible electrochemical behaviors, stronger hydrophilicity, and better photogenerated charge generation and separation as evidenced by experimental and theoretical data. Upon visible&#8208;light activation, the as&#8208;prepared PAHs showed a curvature&#8208;strengthened photocatalytic activity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production (yield: up to 6696&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) with good recyclability and reusability. Finally, the femtosecond transient absorption spectra (fs&#8208;TAS) indicate that the more curved structure Nap&#8208;NBN&#8208;PAH has more photogenerated charges and a longer excited state lifetime, which is consistent with better photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Prediction of One&#8208;Dimensional Metallicity and &#960;&#8208;Band Superconductivity in Rhodizonate Radical Pancakes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Equidistant stacking of radicals is typically unstable due to symmetry&#8208;lowering distortions. We predict that such arrangements can be stabilized by multicentered covalent (&#8220;pancake&#8221;) bonding and Coulombic repulsion between negatively charged radicals. This leads to design principles for a new class of organic conductors&#8212;potentially superconductors&#8212;based on abundant, environmentally benign elements. 








Abstract
Computational exploration of condensed phases made of potassium and carbon monoxide leads to predictions of stable salts composed of cyclic six&#8208;membered oxocarbon anions and K+ cations, Kn(C6O6)m. The states of reduction in these systems are wide&#8208;ranging, with C6O6 molecules formally reduced by &#8722;2, &#8722;3, &#8722;3.5, and &#8722;6 in semiconducting and metallic phases. Special attention is paid to K3C6O6, in which triply charged radical anions stack closely and equidistantly in one dimension. Equidistant interactions of radicals are exceedingly rare and typically unstable due to spontaneous symmetry breaking, Peierls or Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion. The predicted exception of K3C6O6 is explained by inter&#8208;ring multicenter bonding, also known as pancake bonding, in combination with large ionic repulsion. This fascinating interplay of interactions facilitates an exceptionally high density of states at the Fermi level and leads us to predictions of metallicity, a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity, and rare &#960;&#8208;band superconductivity. These predictions reinvigorate the search for new organic conductors and superconductors using molecular design of metallic salts.

The states of reduction in these systems are wide-ranging, with C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; molecules formally reduced by &#8722;2, &#8722;3, &#8722;3.5, and &#8722;6 in semiconducting and metallic phases. Special attention is paid to K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, in which triply charged radical anions stack closely and equidistantly in one dimension. Equidistant interactions of radicals are exceedingly rare and typically unstable due to spontaneous symmetry breaking, Peierls or Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion. The predicted exception of K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is explained by inter-ring multicenter bonding, also known as pancake bonding, in combination with large ionic repulsion. This fascinating interplay of interactions facilitates an exceptionally high density of states at the Fermi level and leads us to predictions of metallicity, a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity, and rare &#960;-band superconductivity. These predictions reinvigorate the search for new organic conductors and superconductors using molecular design of metallic salts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>24&#8208;Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow from Single Polymer Chains Through Engineering&#8208;Compatible One&#8208;Pot Polycondensation Approach</title>

24&#8208;Hour&#8208;long afterglow from single polymer chains has been reported. The polymer chains emit an afterglow that lasts longer than 24&#160;h under ambient conditions. At &#8722;&#160;18&#160;&#176;C, afterglow persists for up to 10 days after photoexcitation cessation, making them the longest&#8208;lasting afterglow polymers reported to date. They can be activated by sunlight and maintain a green afterglow for over 6&#160;h at room temperature in air with potential applications in flexible displays and wearable devices.








Abstract
We report the unprecedented observation of 24&#8208;h&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) emission from single polymer chains. The polymer chains were synthesized through a straightforward engineering&#8208;compatible one&#8208;pot polycondensation reaction. These polymers exhibit afterglow emissions exceeding 24&#160;h under ambient conditions through charge separation and recombination mechanisms. Remarkably, these HLA polymers can be activated by sunlight and sustain a green afterglow for over 6&#160;h at room temperature in air, rendering them suitable for practical engineering applications. Notably, the HLA is temperature&#8208;dependent, with lower temperatures substantially prolonging emission duration. At &#8722;&#160;18 &#176;C, afterglow persists for up to 10 days after ceasing photoexcitation, establishing these polymers as the longest&#8208;lasting afterglow polymeric materials reported to date. Moreover, the excellent processability of the 24&#8208;HLA polymers allows their facile fabrication into diverse forms including films and fibers using conventional polymer processing techniques, positioning them as promising candidates for flexible displays and wearable electronics.
