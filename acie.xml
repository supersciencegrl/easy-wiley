         <title>GOAT: A Global Optimization Algorithm for Molecules and Atomic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present GOAT, a new global optimization algorithm that hops over the potential energy surface until it finds the global minimum and conformational ensembles. The algorithm does not rely on molecular dynamics, which makes it useful to run even with hybrid DFT and deal with systems withs complicated electronic structures.







Abstract
In this work, we propose a new Global Optimization Algorithm (GOAT) for molecules and clusters of atoms and show how it can find the global energy minima for both systems without resorting to molecular dynamics (MD). This avoids the potential millions of time&#8208;consuming gradient calculations required by a long MD run. Because of that, it can be used with any regular quantum chemical method, even with the costlier hybrid DFT. We showcase its accuracy by running it on various systems, from organic molecules to water clusters, metal complexes, and metal nanoparticles, comparing it with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods such as the Conformer&#8208;Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST). We also discuss its underlying theory and mechanisms for succeeding in challenging cases. GOAT is, in general, more efficient and accurate than previous algorithms in finding global minima and succeeds in cases where others cannot due to the free choice for the Potential Energy Surface (PES).

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Theranostic Materials and their Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasound (US) is a promising external excitation modality for bioapplications, offering significant advantages over X&#8208;rays or laser, due to its low cost, high biosafety, and ideal tissue penetration depth. US&#8208;activated theranostic materials, comprising organic, inorganic, and hybrid&#8208;based compounds&#8212;hold particular value in synergistic cancer therapeutic and diagnostic applications. These materials exhibit excellent imaging properties, high drug delivery and release efficiency, and enhanced ROS production, making them suitable for clinical diagnostic imaging and therapeutic interventions. This review summarizes recent research on the design, performance, and optimization of US&#8208;mediated molecules/nanosystems for a wide range of biomedical applications. Additionally, the multifunctional use of these sonosensitizers in imaging, drug delivery, and sonodynamic therapy, especially in combination with other treatment could pave the way for innovative strategies in disease therapy. Finally, an overview of this field&#8217;s challenges and potential future directions is provided, highlighting pathways to promote clinical translation and application.</dc:description>

         <title>Homologation of Alkenes Using Acetylene as a C2 Feedstock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for the homologation of alkenes that employs acetylene as a C&#8322; feedstock and proceeds via an alkyl borane intermediate has been developed. Commercially available but expensive and unavailable alkenes can be synthesized by this methodology from their C&#8322; shorter homologues, which can be much less expensive. A variety of functional groups and a series of alkene substitution patterns were tolerated, and a chain length increase of up to twelve carbon atoms was achieved by iterative homologation.








Abstract
The preparation of diverse homologs from lead compounds has been a common and important practice in medicinal, mechano, polymeric, and many other branches of chemistry. The homologation of alkenes, though important, remains challenging due to the difficulty of (CH2)n insertion into the main carbon chain of alkenes compared to chains containing other polar functional groups. Here, we report the homologation of both terminal and internal alkenes by using acetylene as a cheap and abundant C2 feedstock. The process involves an in&#8208;situ transformation of alkenes into boranes and then into elongated alkenes, during which direct (CH2)n insertion is avoided. The reaction can be carried out iteratively to achieve up to a 12&#8208;carbon elongation.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Robust Supraparticles for Spatially Orthogonal Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the preparation of multicomponent, millimeter&#8208;sized, robust ionic supraparticles via electrostatic assembly within water droplets is developed. This strategy enables the synthesis of spatially orthogonal cascade catalysts in which incompatible acidic, basic, and metal sites are integrated in a single millisphere. The developed catalysts work well in industrially preferred fixed&#8208;bed reactors, exhibiting significantly enhanced cascade catalysis efficiency and outstanding operational stability. 








Abstract
Macroscopically sized supraparticles (SPs) are emerging as cutting&#8208;edge materials for industrial applications because of their unique properties unachievable for their nano&#8208;building blocks, but their effective methods are lacking. Here, a conceptually novel strategy is developed to assemble binary or ternary nanoparticles (NPs) within compartments of droplets through electrostatic interactions, making it possible to facilely fabricate millimeter&#8208;sized multicomponent ionic supraparticles (ISPs). The assembled ISPs possess unexpectedly high mechanical strength (50&#160;N per bead), being amenable to practical applications. The key factors governing the assembly behavior of nano&#8208;building blocks within water droplet compartments are identified through regulating the size and charge density of NPs or ionic strength, providing key insights into the multileveled assembly of NPs beyond the conventional assembly. The strategy is demonstrated to be versatile since a library of tailor&#8208;made ISPs containing multicomponent, diversely shaped, and differently sized NPs can be facilely fabricated. As proof of this concept, it is showcased that this method enables the preparation of spatially orthogonal cascade catalysts by co&#8208;assembling acidic, basic, and metal sites in single millimeter&#8208;scaled particles. The catalysts exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency in a one&#8208;pot cascade synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkylated nitriles and high operational stability (200&#160;h) in industrially preferred fixed&#8208;bed reactors.

         <title>Electronic Excitation and High&#8208;Energy Reactions Originate From Anionic Microdroplets Formed by Electrospray or Pneumatic Nebulization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplet evaporation can lead to ion emission or droplet fission. In negatively charged droplets, charge can also be lost through electron emission. These ejected electrons can subsequently lead to ionization or electronic excitation in excess of 10&#160;eV.








Abstract
Formation of energetic species at the surface of aqueous microdroplets, including abundant hydroxyl radicals, oxidation products, and ionized N2 and O2 gas, has been previously attributed to the high electric field at the droplet surface. Here, evidence for a new mechanism for electronic excitation involving electron emission from negatively charged water droplets is shown. Droplet evaporation can lead to the emission of ions and droplet fission, but unlike positively charged droplets, negatively charged droplets can also shed charge by electron emission. With nanoelectrospray, no anions or negatively charged droplets are produced with a positive electrospray potential. In contrast, abundant O2+&#8226; and H3O+(H2O) are formed with negative electrospray. When toluene vapor is introduced with negative electrospray, abundant toluene radical cations and fragments are produced. Both O2+&#8226; and toluene radical cations are produced with pneumatic nebulization. The electrons produced from evaporating negatively charged droplets can be accelerated by an external electric field in electrospray, or by the field generated between droplets with opposite polarities produced by pneumatic nebulization. This electron emission/ionization mechanism leads to electronic excitation &gt;10&#160;eV, and it may explain some of the surprising chemistries that were previously attributed to the high intrinsic electric field at the surface of aqueous droplets.

         <title>Degradation of Glyphosate to Benign N&#8208;Formyl Glycine Using MOF&#8208;808 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF&#8208;808) with different crystal sizes and designed defect sites was employed as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the complete degradation of glyphosate at room temperature. The degradation mechanism produces N&#8208;formyl glycine and hydroxymethyl&#8208;phosphonate.








Abstract
Glyphosate (N&#8208;phosphonomethyl glycine, GPh) is an industrial herbicide used worldwide in modern agricultural practices. With the growing concerns regarding cumulative environmental and health effects, pathways for catalytic GPh degradation to benign products are becoming a pressing societal need. This report demonstrates that Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF&#8208;808) with different crystal sizes and designed defect sites can be employed as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the complete degradation of GPh at room temperature. Importantly, the degradation mechanism produces N&#8208;formyl glycine and hydroxymethyl&#8208;phosphonate, which are largely innocuous chemicals, especially when compared to more common GPh degradation products. Nanocrystalline MOF&#8208;808 (nMOF&#8208;808) exhibits enhanced reactivity than larger MOF&#8208;808 crystals, attributed to the higher coordination of hydroxyl and water molecules to the secondary building units (SBU) as determined using a range of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques. These studies indicate that the crystal size&#8208;dependency in GPh degradation is related to structural modifications on coordinative unsaturated Zr site that promote the fast exchange of weakly bonded ligands. Taken together, this study demonstrates that GPh degradation can be optimized through ligand field tuning in MOFs, which can help improve overall reactivity while also pushing the reaction toward desirable, nontoxic products.

         <title>Photo&#8208;RAFT Polymerization Under Microwatt Irradiation via Unimolecular Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding a base to PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization significantly enhances the reactivity of acidic CTAs with Zn&#8208;based photocatalysts, enabling polymerization under low light intensity (0.25&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). This approach outperforms traditional PET&#8208;RAFT, which showed no conversion under the same conditions. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerized efficiently. Mechanistic studies suggest base addition shifts activation from bimolecular to more efficient unimolecular PET&#8208;RAFT.








Abstract
Photoinduced radical addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization typically requires high light intensity (&gt;5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), limiting energy efficiency, and scalability. We demonstrate that adding a base to PET&#8208;RAFT systems drastically enhances the reactivity of acidic chain transfer agents (CTAs) with Zn&#8208;based photocatalysts (Zn porphyrin and Zn phthalocyanine). This approach enables complete polymerization under microwatt light intensity (0.25&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), a significant improvement over traditional PET&#8208;RAFT, which showed no conversion under the same conditions. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerized efficiently with excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity. Reactivity was triggered chemically (via base addition) or electrochemically (via electrolytic reduction). Mechanistic studies reveal that base addition promotes a CTA&#8208;Zn photocatalyst complex, shifting the activation from bimolecular to more efficient unimolecular PET&#8208;RAFT.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;Triazenylarenes Enable Vicinal Sandmeyer&#8208;Type Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;Bis&#8208;triazenylarenes enable vicinal disubstitution reactions. The reactions can be performed in one step or in a sequential fashion, and they allow introducing a range of different nucleophiles including fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, hydroxide, methoxide, and acetamide.








Abstract
The introduction of two nucleophiles in the vicinal position of arenes via Sandmeyer&#8208;type reactions is compromised by the problematic diazotization of ortho&#8208;diaminoarenes. Herein, it is shown that vicinal substitution reactions are facilitated by the use of 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;triazenylarenes. Two distinct methodologies for the synthesis of these triazenes are presented. The first approach involves the sequential conversion of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;iodoarenes into first mono&#8208; and then bis&#8208;triazenylarenes. The second procedure is based on Ru&#8208;catalyzed [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions between diynes and a 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;triazenylalkyne. The two triazene groups in the products can be substituted sequentially by a range of nucleophiles including fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, hydroxide, methoxide, and acetamide.

         <title>Advancing Propylene Epoxidation: the Role of Ethyl Acetate Autoxidation via Cobalt&#8208;Nickel Catalyzed C(acyl)&#9472;O Bond Scission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt/nickel catalytic aerobic epoxidation of propylene is described, where the autoxidation of carboxyl esters, as in ethyl acetate, ultimately provides peracetic acid as the oxidizing reagent, resulting in a remarkable epoxide selectivity. The confirmed Co(III)/Co(II) active center is stabilized through its interaction with nickel, involvement in the oxidation of the ethoxy radical (an intermediate from the ester C&#9472;O bond cleavage), as well as the single&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen.








Abstract
The selective autoxidation for the synthesis of valuable oxygenates has provoked keen interest from both academic and industrial sectors. Although the generation of reactive oxygen species via oxygen attack on C&#9472;H bonds near ester linkages is well&#8208;established, research into aliphatic ester oxidation has primarily focused on combustion, neglecting their potential utility in oxidation processes. Herein, a protocol for producing propylene oxide through the autoxidation of ethyl acetate in tandem with propylene epoxidation is demonstrated. The ethoxy radical, generated by ester C(acyl)&#9472;O bond cleavage in situ, subsequently underwent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer with the Co(OAc)(&#956;&#8208;H2O)2Ni, followed by the formation of the peracetic acid optimally suited for the epoxidation reaction. The research not only eliminates the need for co&#8208;substrates in the epoxidation process but also fills the application gap in bulk&#8208;ester autoxidation, offering insights into the effective utilization of oxy&#8208;intermediates in autoxidation reactions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene as a Primer in a Dual&#8208;Layer Coating for Corrosion Protection on Iron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) monolayer is electrodeposited on Fe foil and effectively functioned as a binder for a secondary layer of a cross&#8208;linked polymer network, which is photo&#8208;polymerized on the NHC monolayer. The dual coating, constructed of NHC monolayer and polymer film, as a primary and a secondary coating, respectively, effectively preventes corrosion formation on Fe.








Abstract
The development of highly stable coatings on iron is essential for mitigating corrosion formation. Herein, it is demonstrated that a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) can be electrodeposited on iron foil and function as a binder for a secondary, crosslinked polymer network coating. The dual layer coating, constructed of a monolayer of NHCs and a polymer film, as a primary and a secondary coating, respectively, effectively preventes corrosion formation with a protective efficiency of 99.6&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;%, as determined by polarization measurements in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. Spectroscopic analysis identified the formation of a chemical interaction between the NHC monolayer and the polymer film. The strong anchoring of NHC to iron along with its chemical interaction with the polymer film induced high stability and durability of the dual&#8208;layer coating to effectively protect the coated iron from corrosion formation.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Activated Platform for Controlled Hydrogen Sulfide Release with Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable H2S releasing motif was developed, enabling the encapsulation of payloads featuring diverse functional sites. The delivery of H2S was achieved through a COS mediate pathway characterized by an adjustable releasing profile. Additionally, drugs possessing function sites could be readily integrated into this platform, thereby facilitating the construction of prodrugs.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is increasingly recognized for its critical role in various physiological and pathological processes. The development of synthetic donors with controllable release profiles is essential for elucidating H2S's complex involvement in cellular signaling, which remains a challenge. Herein, we report a diverse collection of photocaged N&#8208;methylation thiocarbamates and thiocarbonates, designed to explore how electronic properties and the leaving efficiency of payloads affect H2S release behaviors. These compounds are engineered to release carbonyl sulfide (COS) following the removal of photoprotective group (PPG). The COS could be rapidly converted into H2S by carbonic anhydrase, and the entire reaction progression was monitored by changes in fluorescence signals. Furthermore, this H2S&#8208;releasing platform is suitable for conjugation with active pharmaceutical ingredients, facilitating the creation of H2S&#8208;releasing hybrid prodrugs. Collectively, this novel class of H2S donor not only provides valuable tool for H2S&#8208;related research but also holds significant potential as therapeutic agent.

         <title>Unlocking Reactivity of Unprotected Oximes via Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Dual Copper/Organophotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct N&#9472;O bond fragmentation of free oximes is challenging due to their tendency to engage in other side reaction pathways, which severely restricts their utilization in organic synthesis. To overcome this limitation, a novel strategy is developed for the direct cyclization of unprotected oximes with enals through green&#8208;light&#8208;promoted dual copper/photoredox catalysis. This protocol activates free oximes via single&#8208;electron reduction&#8208;induced N&#9472;O bond fragmentation, enabling facile construction of highly functionalized pyridines, including bioactive and solvatochromic fluorescent molecules.








Abstract
Oximes are widely used precursors in synthetic chemistry due to their broad availability and versatile chemical properties, in which N&#9472;O bond fragmentation represents a key reactivity mode. However, these transformations typically require the use of oxygen&#8208;protected oximes, and a general strategy to directly utilize free oximes remains challenging due to their vulnerability to side reaction pathways, rendering low tendency towards N&#9472;OH bond cleavage. Here a unified platform is reported to achieve direct cyclization of unprotected oximes with enals, as well as other coupling partners through dual copper/organophotoredox catalysis under green light irradiation. This protocol enables concurrent activation of both N&#9472;OH and &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds of free oximes to form multisubstituted pyridines with exceeding structural diversity and functional group tolerance. In this process, Rose Bengal serves as a hydrogen atom transfer agent to generate radical intermediates. In the meanwhile, copper catalyst activates of free oximes via single&#8208;electron reduction&#8208;induced N&#9472;O bond fragmentation and controls the selectivity for intermediate trapping. The synthetic utility of this approach is further demonstrated by its successful applications in late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active compounds and rapid assembly of solvatochromic fluorescent materials.

         <title>First Encapsulation of Organometallic Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet into Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An air&#8208;sensitive DyCp3 (Cp&#8722; = cyclopentadienyl) single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) complex (1) was encapsulated into single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to construct hybrid materials that are resistant to moisture and oxygen. The hybrid materials with independent slow&#8208;magnetic&#8208;relaxing centers are expected to become a key component of the next generation of information process devices based on spintronics. The resilience to moisture and oxygen further broadens its manufacturing methods and application scenarios. Furthermore, upon encapsulation into SWCNTs, DyCp3 exhibited clear ac frequency dependence in the ac magnetic susceptibility at a zero&#8208;dc field. This indicates that the guest molecule's slow magnetic relaxation properties are preserved, which is crucial and necessary to realize SMMs&#8208;based quantum information processing, by allowing a sufficient time window for quantum gate operations. Our result exemplifies that encapsulation of air&#8208;sensitive organometallic SMMs into SWCNTs enhances their chemical stability and their magnetic relaxation time at a zero&#8208;dc magnetic field, which provides a novel method for their further applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust p&#8208;d Orbital Coupling in PtCoIn@Pt Core&#8211;Shell Catalysts for Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the p&#8208;block element indium into PtCo results in a ternary L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst. This integration promotes p&#8208;d orbital coupling, enhancing the ORR activity and durability. Impressively, even after 60&#8201;000 square wave potential cycles, this catalyst preserved its initial mass activity, showing no degradation in an H2&#8208;O2 fuel cell.








Abstract
Pt&#8208;based catalysts are playing increasingly important roles in fuel cells owing to their high catalytic activity. However, harsh electrocatalytic conditions often trigger atomic migration and dissolution in these catalysts, causing rapid performance deterioration. Here, a novel L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst is introduced, where indium (In) is incorporated into a PtCo matrix. This integration promotes p&#8211;d orbital coupling, optimizing the electronic structure of Pt and causing additional lattice strain within PtCo. Impressively, L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt exhibits remarkable activity and durability, with only a 5.1% reduction in mass activity (MA) after 120&#8201;000 potential cycles. In H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells, this cathode achieves a peak power density of 1.99&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and maintains a high MA of 0.73 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V. After enduring 60&#8201;000 square wave potential cycles, the catalyst maintains its initial MA and sustains the cell voltage at 0.8 A cm&#8722;2, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 2025 targets. Theoretical studies highlight the enhancements originating from the modulated electronic structures and shifted d&#8208;band center of Pt induced by In doping and increased vacancy formation energies in Pt and Co atoms, affirming the catalyst's superior durability.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Pair Hydrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis Enables Cr&#8208;Catalyzed Allylation of Ketones Using Hydrocarbon Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the allylation of ketones using simple alkenes promoted by a chromocene catalyst and an ion&#8208;pair hydrogen atom transfer (IP&#8208;HAT) catalyst. This catalytic system can be applied to a wide range of ketones, including aliphatic ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with high functional group tolerance.








Abstract
We report a catalytic allylation of ketones using simple hydrocarbon alkenes, enabled by a synergistic system comprising chromocene and photo&#8208;activatable ion&#8208;pair hydrogen atom transfer (IP&#8208;HAT) catalysts derived from a thiophosphoryl imide and N&#8208;heteroaromatics. This catalyst system generates highly nucleophilic, electron&#8208;rich allylchromium(III) species directly from unactivated alkenes, demonstrating broad applicability to various ketones, including aromatic, aliphatic, and multifunctional ketones. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with high functional group tolerance. The modular design of the IP&#8208;HAT catalysts allows precise tuning of redox potential and HAT activity, with the enhanced reduction potential of the reduced N&#8208;heteroaromatics catalyst playing a pivotal role in efficiently regenerating the electron&#8208;rich chromocene(II) catalyst.

         <title>Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes Enable High&#8208;Efficiency, Long&#8208;Cycling, and Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Trivalent Antimony Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a concentrated chloride electrolyte to address the Sb3+ hydrolysis issue and achieved highly reversible three&#8208;electron Sb plating chemistry, leading to high efficiency (99.7%&#8211;99.8%), long life (10 months), and dendrite&#8208;free spherical morphology.








Abstract
Aqueous trivalent metal batteries are promising energy storage systems, which can leverage unique three&#8208;electron redox reactions to deliver high capacity and high energy. Among them, antimony (Sb) stands out with a high capacity (660 mAh g&#8722;1), abundant availability, and low cost. However, the severe Sb3+ hydrolysis reaction drastically hinders the development of aqueous antimony batteries. Herein, we address this issue by employing a concentrated lithium chloride electrolyte, which stabilizes reactive Sb3+ ions via forming robust antimony&#8208;chloride complexes. This approach effectively mitigates hydrolysis and achieves highly reversible Sb plating behavior, leading to high efficiency (99.7%&#8211;99.8%), long lifespan (7300 h, 10 months), and uniform spherical deposition morphology. When paired with a manganese dioxide (MnO2) cathode, the Sb&#8214;MnO2 battery demonstrates a high capacity of 309 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability of 50&#160;000 cycles (&#8764;70% retention). Additionally, Sb shows promise as a high&#8208;capacity cathode, which can integrate with low&#8208;potential zinc into novel dual&#8208;metal plating batteries with long cycling life (4,000 h). This work not only deepens our fundamental understanding of trivalent Sb3+ redox chemistry but also opens new opportunities to stabilize hydrolysable and high&#8208;charge&#8208;density cations for multivalent battery applications.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Accelerated Design of High&#8208;Efficient Lithium Adsorbents for Salt Lake Brines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building on data from previous experiments, we developed a machine learning&#8208;guided screening protocol to rapidly discover efficient doping schemes for aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbents. The recommended doped adsorbent demonstrated a nearly 40% increase in stable adsorption capacity in various brine types, which could significantly advance the Salt Lake&#8208;based lithium extraction industry.








Abstract
The urgent demand for lithium resources has been advancing the development of highly efficient lithium extraction from brines. Aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbent, as the only one used in the Salt Lake industry, is limited in further improving the extraction efficiency due to the low adsorption capacity. Here, we develop a high&#8208;throughput screening framework via interpretable machine learning (ML) to rapidly determine high&#8208;performance modification strategies for the aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbent, avoiding the huge workload of traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error doping experiments in view of multiple doping schemes and the unique trade&#8208;off between performance and structural stability. Relying on the recommended modifications, a series of doped adsorbents are prepared and the structure stability and cyclic adsorption performance are verified, which match well with the uncovered correlation between dopant features and adsorption capacity. Experimental validations confirm the screened doped one exhibits an increased stable adsorption capacity by nearly 40% in various types of brine. These results indicate that ML&#8208;accelerated approach can significantly promote the upgrading of lithium resource adsorption industry in Salt Lakes.

         <title>Exploiting Antisite Defects in FeWN2 Nanosheets for Enol Electro&#8208;oxidation Coupled with H2 Evolution at a Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel layered 2D FeWN2 electrocatalyst with a rock&#8208;salt structure and abundant antisite defects is designed to enhance the electrocatalytic upgrading of ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). The presence of antisite defects effectively modulates the electronic structure, facilitating the activation of enol groups in AA.








Abstract
Hydrogen production from biomass electro&#8208;oxidation offers a promising alternative to water electrolysis by lowering the anodic oxidation barrier and producing valuable chemicals. However, current biomass electro&#8208;oxidation systems have difficulties in achieving an industrial&#8208;scale current density due to the difficulty in cleaving high&#8208;energy C&#9472;H and O&#9472;H bonds. Here, we report a ternary layer nitride FeWN2 electrocatalyst with abundant antisite defects (ASDs), which significantly improves its electrocatalytic performance for ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation. The catalyst works at a remarkable current density of 2.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.69&#160;V (vs RHE) and achieves 4 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.12&#160;V in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer at 60 &#176;C with 100% Faraday efficiency for H2 production. Theoretical calculations reveal that W atoms near antipodal Fe sites replenish the electron density of Fe, maintaining moderate Fe&#8208;DHA adsorption strength induced by ASDs that achieve superior catalytic efficiency for AA&#8208;to&#8208;DHA conversion This study provides new insight for developing high&#8208;performance organic oxidation catalysts with ASDs.

Abstract
The precise regulation of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) distribution and interfacial modification is pivotal for advancing the performance of p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a new co&#8208;assembly material, 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;diphenylaniline iodide (TPAI), is developed to make SAM orderly assembled. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy reveal that TPAI binds with SAM via &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, effectively suppressing SAM aggregation and enhancing the orderliness of self&#8208;assembly. Further characterization by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrates that &#9472;NH3 group in TPAI coordinates with undercoordinated Pb2+ to passivate defects of cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) film. The TPAI modification creates a defect&#8208;minimized buried interface with optimized energy alignment, significantly improving hole extraction and transport kinetics. Consequently, the TPAI&#8208;treated CsPbI3 PSCs achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.60%, the highest reported value for inverted CsPbI3 PSCs, maintaining 96.71% initial PCE after tracking at maximum power point (MPP) for 1400&#160;h. This work provides a molecular&#8208;level strategy for interfacial engineering, advancing the development of efficient and durable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Graphene Nanoribbon Core Thermotropic Liquid Crystal with a Well&#8208;Defined Molecular Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a unique strategy to align graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) by using the principles of thermotropic liquid crystallinity to form a GNR&#8208;based thermotropic liquid crystal (GNR&#8208;LC). The inherent self&#8208;assembly capability of GNR&#8208;LC facilitates the homeotropic alignment, thereby establishing efficient 1D charge transport pathways and generating significant hole mobility.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with hierarchical and well&#8208;ordered structures are believed to deliver superior performance in semiconductor device applications. Despite this potential, traditional alignment techniques for GNRs often fall short in producing defect&#8208;free and precisely defined molecular architectures. Here, we introduce a strategy for the fabrication of highly ordered GNR by empowering them with thermotropic liquid crystallinity, utilizing a bottom&#8208;up solution synthesis approach. The resulting GNR liquid crystal (GNR&#8208;LC) molecule can self&#8208;assemble into a hexagonal columnar phase. The homeotropic alignment of GNR&#8208;LC is enabled by the intrinsic self&#8208;assembly capabilities of the thermotropic liquid crystalline state, thereby forming 1D charge transport pathways. Devices incorporating GNR&#8208;LC have demonstrated significantly enhanced hole mobility, reaching up to 2.4 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, underscoring their viability as organic semiconductors for optoelectronic applications.

&lt;p&gt;Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with hierarchical and well-ordered structures are believed to deliver superior performance in semiconductor device applications. Despite this potential, traditional alignment techniques for GNRs often fall short in producing defect-free and precisely defined molecular architectures. Here, we introduce a strategy for the fabrication of highly ordered GNR by empowering them with thermotropic liquid crystallinity, utilizing a bottom-up solution synthesis approach. The resulting GNR liquid crystal (&lt;b&gt;GNR-LC&lt;/b&gt;) molecule can self-assemble into a hexagonal columnar phase. The homeotropic alignment of &lt;b&gt;GNR-LC&lt;/b&gt; is enabled by the intrinsic self-assembly capabilities of the thermotropic liquid crystalline state, thereby forming 1D charge transport pathways. Devices incorporating &lt;b&gt;GNR-LC&lt;/b&gt; have demonstrated significantly enhanced hole mobility, reaching up to 2.4 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, underscoring their viability as organic semiconductors for optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Symmetry Face&#8208;Capped Fe(II) Tetrahedra Through Anisotropic Ligand Extension</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the formation of low&#8208;symmetry face&#8208;capped Fe(II) tetrahedra using anisotropic ligand extension is reported. The degree of distortion in the resulting tetrahedra correlates to the stability of the assemblies and the oxidation potentials of their metal ions.








Abstract
Low&#8208;symmetry cages are attractive metallo&#8208;supramolecular targets, as they may possess different characteristics to their higher symmetry analogs. There are no current generalizable routes for the formation of low&#8208;symmetry face&#8208;capped tetrahedra. We report here a strategy using tritopic tris&#8208;bidentate ligands with arms of different lengths to access novel tetrahedra. The use of &#8220;isosceles&#8221; ligands (two arms the same, one different) gives tetragonal disphenoid structures, while a &#8220;scalene&#8221; ligand (all three arms different) gives a rhombic disphenoid structure. In this last case, diastereoselectivity is also achieved. Distortion away from a perfect tetrahedron resulted in alteration of the character of the respective cage. More distorted cages were more prone to loss of structural integrity upon introduction of highly coordinating dimethyl sulfoxide solvent into the cage in acetonitrile solution. As well, increasing distortion was shown to increase the ease of oxidation from Fe(II) to Fe(III) within the cages.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysts with Fe Single Atoms and Fe3C Clusters for Accelerated Oxygen Adsorption Kinetics in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonprecious tandem catalyst incorporating Fe single atoms and Fe3C clusters within nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers is developed. The Fe3C clusters modulate the electronic structure of the Fe centers, optimizing the adsorption energies of intermediates, lowering reaction barriers, and thereby enhancing ORR activity and stability. This work provides a cost&#8208;effective strategy for designing high&#8208;performance tandem electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The design of cost&#8208;effective and efficient catalysts based on transition metal&#8211;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial yet challenging for energy&#8208;conversion devices like metal&#8211;air batteries. In this work, we present a cost&#8208;effective strategy for preparing catalysts consisting of single&#8208;atomic Fe sites and Fe3C clusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers (FeSA&#8208;Fe3C/NC). The FeSA&#8208;Fe3C/NC electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding ORR performance in alkaline electrolytes, achieving a high half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2&#160;=&#160;0.902&#160;V), 4e&#8722; ORR selectivity, and robust methanol tolerance. The exceptional ORR catalytic performance is credited to the relatively substantial specific surface area and the optimal arrangement of active sites, including atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N sites and synergistic Fe3C clusters. In situ spectroelectrochemical characterization and theoretical calculations verify that Fe3C clusters disrupt the symmetric electronic structure of Fe&#8211;N4, optimizing 3d orbitals of Fe centers, thereby accelerating O&#9472;O bond cleavage in *OOH to boost ORR activity. Furthermore, a zinc&#8211;air battery constructed with FeSA&#8208;Fe3C/NC demonstrates excellent potential in energy storage application, yielding a maximum power density of 151.3&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and robust cycling durability surpassing that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. This study establishes a cost&#8208;effective route for producing metal&#8208;based carbon electrocatalysts with exceptional performance using environmentally friendly raw materials.

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Control of Chiral Phases for Higher Performance and Inverted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of calamitic axially chiral luminescent liquid crystals with high&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were synthesized. A near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (98.4%) and high glum value (up to 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2) were achieved with an exceptional figure of merit of 0.02. Crucially, in situ CPL switching is realized through pathway&#8208;dependent phase control, which driven by slight excited&#8208;state molecular packing differences, enables reversible CPL tuning without altering molecular chirality.








Abstract
Chiral luminescent materials have garnered increasing attention for their exceptional ability to emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) along with their excellent applications. Here, a cyclohexylidene scaffold was conceptualized as a chiral source for developing higher&#8208;performance CPL materials in terms of simultaneously enhanced quantum yields (PLQYs) and dissymmetry factor. It was found that the axially chiral scaffold attached with a cyanostilbene showed a pathway&#8208;dependent assembly route to form chiral luminescent liquid crystals and crystals upon fast and slow cooling, respectively. A significant enhancement of PLQYs (98.4%) and a dissymmetry factor (glum) value (2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2), and consequently, a high figure of merit (FM) of up to 0.02 was achieved in the chiral liquid crystal phase. Moreover, the liquid crystal and crystal phases showed the opposite CPL signals while maintaining the same circular dichroism signs. Through a thorough evaluation of UV absorption, CPL emission, wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray diffraction, and theoretical calculations, it was revealed that the reversal of the CPL sign was linked to distinct phases of excited state molecular packing. This research utilized a novel intrinsically axially chiral source to develop a pathway&#8208;dependent and higher&#8208;performance CPL materials.

         <title>Customizing Room&#8208;Temperature Perovskite Ferroelectrics&#160; toward the Multichannel Domain Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have customized a series of perovskite ferroelectrics with controllable phase transition temperatures, which allows unprecedented multichannel manipulation of domain dynamics toward future applications in smart memory devices.








Abstract
Manipulating domain structure in ferroelectrics by external stimuli presents a fascinating avenue for new&#8208;generation electronic devices. However, multichannel controlling of ferroelectric domains is still a challenge, due to the lack of knowledge on their bistability to diverse physical stimuli. Herein, we have customized a series of perovskite ferroelectrics, (CnH2n+1NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3Br10 (n&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;7), of which the Curie temperatures are modulated in a wide temperature range (&#916;T&#160;=&#160;74&#160;K) by tailoring chain length of organic spacers. Strikingly, the n&#160;=&#160;7 member is a room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric with bistable characteristics, thus endowing the manipulation of domains via four channels (i.e., thermal, stress, light, and electric fields). Such a non&#8208;volatile memory behavior of the stress&#8208;switching domain is unprecedented in hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics. This manipulation of domains reveals the unique bistability of its ferroelectric orders, which sheds light on the future advance of customizing electric&#8208;ordered materials toward smart device applications.

Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the smartest of them all? The combination of B(C6F5)3 with a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole unleashed remarkable new possibilities, as reported by Biprajit Sarkar et al. in their Research Article (e202422702). The mirror images show the three different compounds to which the starting material can convert to: a strongly donating anionic mesoionic carbene ligand (MIC), metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane adducts and bis&#8208;borane adducts of MICs. This simple yet astonishing concept provides a platform for new, intriguing MIC&#8208;based compounds with high potential in catalysis.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Exceptional CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol via Precise Single&#8208;Atom Ir Deposition on Functional P Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol is substantially enhanced by the precise deposition of single&#8208;atom Ir on P islands constructed on In2O3 nanosheets. In their Research Article (e202422744), Tsz Woon Benedict Lo and co&#8208;workers report the significant enhancement of ethanol production performance by constructing P islands with excellent hydrogen dissociation capabilities. This facilitates CO2 activation and C&#63743;C coupling at Ir sites and In2O3, thereby boosting the overall catalytic efficiency of CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol.

         <title>Integrating Electronic&#8208;Storage Piperazine into Covalent Organic Frameworks for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as potential electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in new environmental&#8208;friendly electrochemical energy conversion technologies. However, their catalytic activity is hindered by inefficient electron transfer from electrodes to catalytic sites along extended frameworks. To overcome this bottleneck, herein, we first incorporated redox&#8208;active piperazine units into the COFs to catalyze ORR. The redox&#8208;active piperazine units enable to storage electrons, and thus accelerate the electron transferring to the catalytic sites. Furthermore, the introduction of &#8722;OH group&#8208;containing building blocks induces keto&#8208;enol tautomerism (enabling reversible &#8722;OH / &#8722;C=O interconversion), improving framework polarity with a dipole moment of 6.87 Debye (5.8 times increase compared to non&#8208;hydroxylated COFs). This polarity enhancement strengthens the intermediates binding ability, thereby improving the catalytic activity. As a result, the optimized PD&#8208;COF&#8208;OH exhibits a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76 V, turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.045 s&#8722;1, and electrochemically active surface area of 9.4 mF cm&#8211;2, surpassing most reported metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations further reveal synergistic roles of &#8722;OH and &#8722;C=O groups in stabilizing OOH* and OH* intermediates, contributing to the improved catalytic activity. This work establishes a novel design paradigm for catalytic COFs through rational integration of electron reservoir units and tautomerism&#8208;enabled polarity modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>SiO2 Nanoparticles&#8208;Induced Anti&#8208;Freezing Hydrogel Electrolyte Enables Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries with Complete and Reversible Four&#8208;Electron&#8208;Transfer Mechanisms at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries hold significant promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high specific capacities. However, achieving four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanisms under subzero temperatures remains challenging due to freezing point limitations of conventional aqueous electrolytes and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an anti&#8208;freezing hydrogel electrolyte (HC&#8208;SiO2) is developed through the spontaneous gelation of a high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (1 m Zn(OAc)2 + 21 m LiCl, HC) with SiO2 nanoparticles, enabling low&#8208;temperature operation of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;I2 batteries with complete and reversible four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes. Abundant interactions between dispersed SiO2 nanoparticles and cations enlarge ion&#8208;pair distances, reducing close ion&#8208;pair formation and lowering the freezing temperature (&#8208;60.7 &#176;C). Furthermore, the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state hydrogel electrolyte combines advantages of reduced water activity and disrupted hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, effectively suppressing I+ hydrolysis while inhibiting ice nucleation. Additionally, the utilization of low&#8208;concentration Zn(OAc)2 combined with high&#8208;concentration LiCl increases availability of free Cl&#8208; by mitigating strong ionic interaction in conventional ZnCl2&#8208;based concentrated electrolytes, thereby enhancing reaction kinetics of the I2/I+ conversion. Benefiting from synergistic manipulation of ionic interaction, water activity and Cl&#8208; activity, the HC&#8208;SiO2 hydrogel achieves a high capacity of 490.9 mAh g&#8208;1 and durable lifespan exceeding 11,000 cycles at &#8208;20 &#176;C. These findings offer valuable insights for advancing practical low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Electric&#8208;Dipole Coupling Ion&#8208;Dipole Engineering Induced Rational Solvation&#8208;Desolvation Behavior for Constructing Stable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with high ionic conductivity, a wide voltage window, and an ultra&#8208;stability electrolyte/electrode interface are essential for practical applications of solid lithium&#8208;metal batteries but particularly challenging. The key to overcoming these long&#8208;term obstacles lies in the rational design of the Li+ solvation&#8208;desolvation behavior in SPEs. Herein, we propose an electric&#8208;dipole coupling ion&#8208;dipole strategy to modulate the  Li+ solvation structure and enhance Li+ desolvation kinetics. The experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the free solvents and FSI&#8722; are anchored by ion&#8208;dipole interactions, which facilitate the transfer of Li+ and obtain a wide electrochemical stability window. Coupling the electric&#8208;dipole interactions that promote lithium salt dissociation and rapid ion desolvation contributes to obtaining more mobile Li+ and realizing an inorganic&#8208;rich electrolyte/electrode interface. Benefiting from the above benefits, the assembled lithium symmetric cells and the full cells demonstrate ultra&#8208;long cycling life. More importantly, full cells with high&#8208;loading cathodes (LiFePO4 with 11.25 mg cm&#8722;2, NCM811 with 7.84 mg cm&#8722;2) and pouch cell still display stable cycling.This research gives valuable insights into regulating the solvation&#8208;desolvation behavior in SPEs and facilitates the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Structural Design in Cobaloxime&#8208;Integrated Covalent Organic Frameworks to Facilitate Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting&#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular hybrid composed of a cobaloxime complex and a covalent organic framework (COF) that achieves photocatalytic overall water splitting. The designed COF features ternary units and dual linkages, which induce asymmetric linkers. Upon photoexcitation, this asymmetry facilitates directed electron transfer and spatially separated redox sites, resulting in a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state. Consequently, the COF, hydrogen&#8208;bonded with cobaloxime as an H2 production cocatalyst, enables visible&#8208;light photocatalytic overall water splitting, simultaneously producing H2 and H2O2, outperforming the COFs with symmetric linker structures. This strategy of asymmetric structural design offers new insights for the design of photocatalysts with suppressed charge recombination for photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Methyl Group Reinforced Amphiphilic Poly (ionic liquid) Additive for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries are prospective on energy storage, yet the practical application is severely hindered by side reactions of Zn metal and the shuttle effects for polyiodide. Herein, a polymer additive PVEMA was copolymerized by 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (VEImOTf) and methacrylamide (MAAm) to alleviate the above issues. The polymer chain of PVEMA endows amphipathic properties for Zn2+ diffusion and solvation structure regulation, and the &#945;&#8208;methyl of MAAm enhances the hydrophobic properties to avoid side reactions on Zn metal. In addition, the imidazole groups adsorb onto Zn metal with electrostatic shielding effect for further side reaction alleviation, and mitigate shuttle effects by electrostatic interactions with polyiodides. Consequently, the PVEMA confers the symmetrical Zn battery with great cycling stability for over 400 h at 20 mA cm&#8208;2 and high depth of discharge (DOD) of 77.7%. The Zn&#8208;I2 batteries with PVEMA also demonstrate stable cycling performance under various current densities and temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>A Titanium Silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) Catalyst with Abundant Active Ti&#8208;VI Species for Efficient Conversion of Ethylene to Glycol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot synthesis of glycol from ethylene and H2O2 is simple and environmentally friendly, making it a potential alternative for glycol production. The key to the success of this is to have a bifunctional catalyst with both oxidative activity for ethylene in the presence of H2O2 and acidic centers for the subsequent hydration of ethylene oxide. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;chemical post&#8208;treatment regime to introduce acid centers in TS&#8208;1 while simultaneously improve the oxidative activity. The study shows that the combined tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) + (NH4)2CO3 post&#8208;treatment not only produces abundant Ti(OSi)2(OH)4 (Ti&#8208;VI) species from Ti(OSi)4, but also creates numerous internal cavities within crystals of the post&#8208;treated TS&#8208;1. Ti&#8208;VI possesses both high oxidative activity and acidic sites. The presence of internal cavities within TS&#8208;1 crystals enhances the diffusion on the catalyst as well as increases the accessibility of Ti&#8208;VI species. Consequently, when applied as a catalyst, the combined&#8208;treated TS&#8208;1 demonstrates an outstanding catalytic performance, achieving 98.6% conversion of H2O2 and 99.8% selectivity of EG, which is nearly 2 times of the conventional TS&#8208;1. This study also unveils the formation mechanism of Ti&#8208;VI during the post&#8208;treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Z&#8208;Selective Alkyne Semireduction by an Organic Photoreductant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The semireduction of alkynes is an indispensable transformation for the synthesis of&#160;Z&#8208;alkenes. Although extensive studies with mostly transition metal&#8208;based catalysts have enabled it to produce a broad scope of alkenes, a Scifinder search and a robustness screen of Lindlar&#8217;s catalyst indicate that highly Lewis&#8208;basic nitrogen and sulfur&#8208;containing motifs, which are prevalent in drugs, remain problematic. Herein, we report an alkyne semi&#8208;reduction using an organic photoreductant that tolerates all 10 of the most common Lewis&#8208;basic motifs in drugs. The reaction reduces&#160;terminal alkyl and aryl, dialkyl, alkyl aryl, and diaryl alkynes in high yields and&#160;Z&#8208;selectivities, while tolerating other reducible motifs like sulfones, nitriles, ketones, and electron&#8208;poor arenes. UV/Vis and NMR titration studies indicate that the reaction occurs by formation of a photoexcitable electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex. Furthermore, a time study indicated that the reductant enforces a&#160;Z&#8208;selective reaction, which is unusual for alkyne reductions via electron transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Water and Air over Water&#8208;Dispersible Anthraquinone&#8208;Based Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide from earth&#8208;abundant water and air over organo&#8208;based semiconducting materials is a promising alternative to the traditional anthraquinone (AQ) method. However, the generally hydrophobic nature of organic semiconductors has led to their poor dispersibilities in aqueous systems, which built huge barriers for photon capture and reactant contact in water&#8208;based photocatalysis. Aiming at this issue, this study reports the facile synthesis of AQ&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (AQ&#8208;PAFs) by coupling of AQ fragments with thiophene&#8208;derived linkers via robust carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Remarkably, the interfacial hydrogen bonding interactions between water molecules and AQ sites on the surface improves the general hydrophilicity of AQ&#8208;PAFs, which can be well&#8208;dispersed in water only systems with uniform particle size distributions. Moreover, the AQ moieties also function as mediators of photoinduced electrons, and the protons produced from water oxidation reaction (WOR), which would kinetically favor the charge separation and subsequent electron transfer reactions. The mono&#8208;dispersed AQ&#8208;PAF photocatalyst promotes H2O2 photosynthesis from water and air under visible light achieving a high productivity of 7124 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 in the absence of any organic alcohol reagents, among organic semiconductor photocatalysts. Furthermore, a continuous H2O2 photosynthesis for 190 hours is also achieved in a flow system.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying Spatially Segregated Ir Sites within ZSM&#8211;5 for Enhanced Redox Cycle in NOx Reduction by CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing high&#8211;performance Ir&#8211;based catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NOx by CO(CO&#8211;SCR) under low temperatures remains challenging. This study presents an Ir&#8211;based catalyst encapsulated in ZSM&#8211;5 (Ir@ZSM&#8211;5), with Ir species partially confined in micropores (Ir&#948;+) and partially aggregated on the surface (Ir0), achieving ~88% NOx conversion at 230 &#176;C in the presence of 5% O2 and 100 ppm SO2. The confined Ir&#948;+ species exhibit enhanced stability and oxidized states, while surface&#8211;aggregated Ir0 species, with weaker oxygen coordination, remain in a metallic state. The dynamic equilibrium between Ir&#948;+ and Ir0 significantly improves the balance of CO oxidation and NO reduction. O2 promotes the oxidation of Ir0 to Ir&#948;+, while SO2 facilitates the reverse, forming a reversible cycle that sustains catalytic efficiency. This work underscores the strategic interplay of Ir valence states and highlights a pathway for designing stable, high&#8211;performance Ir&#8211;based catalysts tailored for CO&#8211;SCR under complex reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable and Simple Water&#8208;Induced Separation of Ionic Liquid Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic liquids (ILs) are often considered inseparable once mixed, posing a major challenge for their reuse and recy&#8208; cling. We demonstrate a simple and effective method to sep&#8208; arate ILs containing hydrophobic ([NTf2]&#8211;&#160;) and hydrophilic ([OAc]&#8211;&#160;) anions under ambient conditions. This process is driven by the thermodynamic behavior of the ILs in presence of water that enables the near&#8208;complete (&#8805;&#160;99 %) recovery of pure components without complex purification steps. Our findings prove that pure ILs can easily be recovered after being mixed and open new pathways for the sustainable use of ionic fluids in various applications.

Ionic liquids (ILs) are often considered inseparable once mixed, posing a major challenge for their reuse and recycling. We demonstrate a simple and effective method to separate ILs containing hydrophobic (NTf2&#8208;) and hydrophilic (OAc&#8208;) anions under ambient conditions.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;containing hybrid SEI layer enabling high mass loading and anode&#8208;less sodium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous rupture and rebuilding of unstable solid electrolyte interphase layer during cycling would block Na+ diffusion and induce Na dendrite formation, ultimately limiting the practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium metal batteries. Herein, a hybrid SEI layer containing Li&#8208;species is dexterously constructed on the surface of sodium metal anode. Li&#8208;containing inorganic components (Li3N, LiF and Li2CO3) are introduced to stabilize the Na/electrolyte interface and enhance the mechanical and diffusion kinetic properties of the SEI layer, which can reduce the side reactions and gas generation, regulate Na+ flux during cycling and promote rapid Na+ migration for uniform dendrite&#8208;free Na deposition. As a result, the constructed Na symmetric cells achieve low overpotential and long cycle life of 5900 h, 1800 h and 500 h at current densities of 3, 10 and 30 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Furthermore, the full cells paired with the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrate high specific capacity and excellent cycle stability, even at an ultra&#8208;high cathode loading of 39.3 mg cm&#8722;2 and a low N/P ratio (negative/positive electrode capacity ratio of 1.21).</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Construction of C&#8208;B Axial Chirality via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed&#160;Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;B axially chiral architectures are valuable in materials science and medicinal chemistry, but their enantioselective synthesis remains a challenge. Herein, we report an efficient method for the enantioselective synthesis of C&#8208;B axially chiral 1,2&#8208;azaborines through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution. Treatment of racemic 1,2&#8208;azaborine&#8208;based arylaldehyde with a chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst under oxidative conditions in the presence of an alcohol leads to atroposelective esterification with up to 97% yield and 98% ee. The practicality of this method has been demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and further synthetic transformations. Mechanistic studies indicate that the chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst differentiates between rapidly equilibrating atropoisomeric 1,2&#8208;azaborine&#8208;based arylaldehyde. DFT studies suggest that the formation of the Breslow intermediate via [Cs]HCO3&#8208;assisted [1,2]&#8208;proton transfer is the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Monocarboxylic Acid Structural Analogues Facilitate In Situ Composite of Functional Complexes for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In situ composite methods have aroused research interest in materials science and acted as a novel strategy to achieve structural tailoring of materials. However, the controllable preparation of composites containing functional groups remains a challenge. Herein, we report an approach based on competitive coordination between structural analogues, by which the functionally composite metal complex (NiSH@Ni&#8208;FSA) was synthesized. The introduction of different functional groups allows precise control of the functionality of composites, ranging from NiSH@Ni&#8208;ClSA&#8208;D, NiSH@Ni&#8208;BrSA to NiSH@Ni&#8208;CF3SA. More interestingly, the synthesized material retained the microporous and mesoporous structure of the original complexes. The incorporation of hydrophobic functional groups effectively protects the electrode materials from degradation and corrosion. Meanwhile, the presence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding facilitates new composite nanomaterials with better performance for advanced energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching On Supramolecular DNA Junction Binding Using a Human Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;canonical DNA&#8208;junction structures are important in human disease and nucleic acid nanoscience and there is a growing interest in how to bind and modulate them. A key next step is to exert &#8216;on command&#8217; control over such binding. Herein we develop a new metallo&#8208;supramolecular triple&#8208;helicate cylinder agent that is inert to DNA junction binding until activated by human enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and its cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). This inactive cylinder bears six flexible arms each with a quinone group at the termini. Reduction by the enzyme leads to all six arms being removed, transforming the inert cylinder into a new and active metallo&#8208;supramolecular agent that binds junctions. This gives the ability to &#8216;switch&#8208;on&#8217; DNA junction formation and binding in response to the presence of two external stimuli &#8211; a human enzyme overexpressed in many disease states, and NADPH &#8211; and absence of inhibitor, giving NAND logic control. Modelling indicates the binding activation originates not in steric unblocking but changes in conformational flexibility. The work provides the foundation for and a route map towards future designs of sophisticated, inert, supramolecular structures which are transformed by enzymes into new, active, supramolecular structures for a variety of potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Crystalline Polymer Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;organic batteries (SOBs) are widely recognized as a rising star in large&#8208;scale energy storage technology because of their abundant resources, high energy density, and environmental friendliness. However, the poor cyclability and rate performance due to high solubility and poor conductivity with organic electrode materials limit their practical applications. Here, we constructed a new crystalline polymer poly(tetraaminobenzoquione) (PTABQ) featuring a layered structure with conjugated backbone and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Benefiting from the crystalline structure with one&#8208;dimensional O&#8208;channels and highly conjugated backbone, PTABQ shows high electronic conductivity (10&#8208;7&#160;S cm&#8208;1) and fast ion diffusion ability (~10&#8208;8&#160;cm2&#160;s&#8208;1). PTABQ displays a discharge capacity of 380 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;with an average voltage of 2.0 V and nearly 90% capacity retention after ultra&#8208;long 2800 cycles at 3 A g&#8208;1&#160;(~8 C),&#160;which is superior to the reported organic cathode materials. It also exhibits an impressive rate performance of 290 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at 8 A g&#8208;1&#160;(~20 C). Our work highlights the importance of constructing the crystal structure for effective utilization of active sites and fast ion diffusion, which sheds light on the development of an efficient and sustainable energy storage system.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Tuning and Anchor Effect Achieving Stable High&#8208;Voltage Layered Metal Oxides for Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered metal oxides (LMOs) that can stably operate at high voltage are vital to developing high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the irreversible oxygen redox reaction of LMOs at the high voltage region (i.e., &gt;4.0 V vs. Na+/Na) will cause serious oxygen evolution and structural instability, and therefore sharp capacity fading. Herein, we report the charge tuning and anchor effect of La doping to enhance the cycling stability of layered NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) under extreme conditions (e.g. high voltage and temperature). The La doping introduces additional negative charges to the oxygen ligands of transition metals (TM) and facilitates charge transfer, thereby reducing oxygen evolution at 4.1 V and enhancing the kinetics of the redox process. Moreover, the as&#8208;formed LaO6 octahedra serve as stable anchors for the TM layers, preventing the formation of lattice nanocracks. As a result, the La&#8208;modified NFM exhibits a high capacity of 173.4 mAhg&#8208;1 at 0.1C (1C=150 mA g&#8208;1) and capacity retention of 71.21% at 2.0&#8208;4.2 V after 500 cycles at 1C, which are higher than those of NFM. Additionally, the full cell achieves &#160;high energy density of 438.78Wh/kg (based on cathode mass), with a retention of 70.2% over 400 cycles, implying the great application potential of this concept.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Layered metal oxides (LMOs) that can stably operate at high voltage are vital to developing high-energy sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the irreversible oxygen redox reaction of LMOs at the high voltage region (i.e., &amp;gt;4.0 V vs. Na+/Na) will cause serious oxygen evolution and structural instability, and therefore sharp capacity fading. Herein, we report the charge tuning and anchor effect of La doping to enhance the cycling stability of layered NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) under extreme conditions (e.g. high voltage and temperature). The La doping introduces additional negative charges to the oxygen ligands of transition metals (TM) and facilitates charge transfer, thereby reducing oxygen evolution at 4.1 V and enhancing the kinetics of the redox process. Moreover, the as-formed LaO6 octahedra serve as stable anchors for the TM layers, preventing the formation of lattice nanocracks. As a result, the La-modified NFM exhibits a high capacity of 173.4 mAhg-1 at 0.1C (1C=150 mA g-1) and capacity retention of 71.21% at 2.0-4.2 V after 500 cycles at 1C, which are higher than those of NFM. Additionally, the full cell achieves &#160;high energy density of 438.78Wh/kg (based on cathode mass), with a retention of 70.2% over 400 cycles, implying the great application potential of this concept.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combining the Active Site Construction and Microenvironment Regulation via a Bio&#8208;Inspired Strategy Boosts CO2 Electroreduction under Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of CO2 reaction (CO2RR) is recognized as a complicated process involving multiple steps on gas&#8208;electrode&#8208;solution interface. Hence, it is equally important to construct highly&#8208;efficient active sites and regulate favorable microenvironments around the reaction interface. Herein, we propose a biomimetic strategy to address both issues simultaneously in one catalytic system. We firstly evaporate isolated Au sites on the surface of the Cu layer to tune the intrinsic activity of Cu catalyst, then fix hexanethiol (HEX) molecules onto the Au sites through Au&#8208;S bonds to regulate reaction microenvironments (CuAu&#8208;HEX). Specifically, those Au/Cu bimetallic active sites can decrease the energy barriers for C&#8208;C coupling procedure and accelerate the generation of multi&#8208;carbon products. More importantly, those stable and non&#8208;dense HEX molecules on Au sites can ensure long&#8208;term hydrophobicity and high local concentration of CO2 around active sites, rather than block the channels for reactant transfer. Consequently, this unique structure is favorable for the pathways towards multi&#8208;carbon products, generating &gt;70% faraday efficiencies (FE) for multi&#8208;carbon products even at under ampere&#8208;level current densities. Intriguingly, this modification layer is very similar to animal hair follicles, which might present a new strategy to regulate the interfacial environments in various electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Network Assisted Ultrafast Ion Transport of Anion Exchange Membrane Grafting with Covalent Organic Frameworks for Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) capable of facilitating rapid hydroxide ion transport, while maintaining robust mechanical stability, is considered a key direction for advancing hydrogen energy conversion systems. Herein, we synthesized a series of AEMs by grafting covalent organic frameworks (COFs) onto triphenylpiperidine copolymer and systematically evaluated the performance of AEMs. The tailored COFs, characterized by an extensive hydrogen bond network and high micro&#8208;porosity, created interconnected high&#8208;speed ion transport channels, significantly reducing the resistance to hydroxide ion conduction. Remarkably, the COF&#8208;grafted membranes exhibited superior ionic conductivity compared to pristine triphenylpiperidine, even at lower ion exchange capacities. Additionally, the crystalline and highly rigid structure of the grafted COFs effectively preserved the mechanical stability of the membranes. The optimized COF&#8208;grafted AEMs demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving a peak power density of 1.54 W cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells and exceptional current densities of 4.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.0 V in 1 M KOH and 1.1 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.0 V in pure water at 80&#176;C. The present work provides an effective strategy for enhancing AEM performance through grafting of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Access to Piezoelectric Polyamides by Polyamidation of Carboxylic Acids and Ynamides for Potent Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyamides are a fascinating group of piezoelectric materials that are largely synthesized by the polycondesation of dicarboxylic acids with diamines or the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of special lactams. However, developing a green polymerization approach for the facile synthesis of piezoelectric polyamides is highly desirable but also challenging. Here, a simple polyamidation of carboxylic acids and ynamides is successfully established to synthesize versatile piezoelectric polyamides. This polymerization also possesses the merits of 100% atom economy, no waste generation, and additive&#8208;free as well as catalyst&#8208;free system. A range of polyamides are synthesized in moderate to good yields with satisfactory molecular weights. Importantly, piezoelectric polyamides containing tetraphenylethene (P1e/2b) can generate abundant ROS under US exposure, thereby eliciting robust immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction for augmented piezoelectric immunotherapy. Furthermore, P1e/2b exhibits distinctive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property that allows fluorescence imaging. In vivo evaluation using a bilateral tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model manifested that P1e/2b administration reinforced systemic immunity and triggered immune memory under US exposure, thereby leading to primary tumor eradication and distant tumor suppression. Therefore, this work represents a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and waste&#8208;free polymerization paradigm for the construction of piezoelectric polyamides, providing a distinct strategy to designing new piezoelectric polymers for effective tumor immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of Dimethyl Ether from Syngas over Nanoparticle&#8208;Derived Bifunctional Pd/CeO2/Al2O3 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of a bifunctional Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst that exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability in the single&#8208;step syngas&#8208;to&#8208;dimethyl ether reaction. Comprehensive results obtained from HAADF&#8208;STEM, XPS, and in&#8197;situ UHV&#8208;FTIRS demonstrate the formation of highly dispersed Pd clusters/particles confined on a nanoparticulate ceria matrix with interfacial Pd2+ sites, accounting for the superior catalytic performance.







Abstract
The single&#8208;step syngas&#8208;to&#8208;dimethyl ether (STD) process offers both economic and technical advantages over the current two&#8208;step industrial process that utilizes Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts. Here, we report a highly active bifunctional Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, in which Pd colloids dispersed in a nanoscale CeO2 matrix serve as the key building block for the methanol&#8208;active component, efficiently catalysing the STD reaction. For Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 with a high Pd&#8208;CeO2 interface concentration, CO conversion and dimethyl ether yield are significantly increased compared to Pd supported on Al2O3. Systematic investigations using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques reveal the formation of highly dispersed palladium clusters/particles confined within the nanoparticulate CeO2 matrix. The superior catalytic performance in both activity and stability observed for the Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 in the STD reaction stems from the active cationic palladium interfacial species and the presence of adjacent O vacancies.

         <title>Regiochemistry and Side&#8208;chain Engineering Enable Efficient N&#8208;type Mixed Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting (OMIEC) polymers with simple structural motifs is still challenging. We show that high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;threshold&#8208;voltage n&#8208;type OMIEC polymers can be achieved using a simple diketopyrrolopyrrole unit flanked by thiazole groups, which is functionalized with glycolated side chains. Interestingly, the regiospecific sp2&#8208;N position in the repeating unit's thiazole governs the polymer chains' solvation and molecular packing. This specific backbone chemistry enhances conjugation efficiency, reduces trap density, and improves electrochemical doping efficiency. Moreover, systematic variation of glycolated side&#8208;chain lengths induces a sequential shift in molecular orientation&#8212;from edge&#8208;on through bimodal to face&#8208;on preferential alignment. This structural evolution achieves optimized ionic&#8208;electronic transport balance, resulting in exceptional device metrics: a geometrically normalized transconductance of 31.9 S cm&#8208;1, a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit &#956;C*&#160;of 96.3 F cm&#8208;1 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, and a threshold voltage of 0.31 V, positioning these materials among the highest&#8208;performing n&#8208;type OMIECs. An organic complementary inverter made from the optimized n&#8208;type OMIEC polymer and a reported p&#8208;type polymer exhibits a voltage gain of 198 VV&#8208;1, effectively amplifying the ECG signal and enhancing signal quality. This work establishes structure&#8208;property guidelines for designing bioelectronic n&#8208;type OMIECs.</dc:description>

An organic complementary inverter made from the optimized n-type OMIEC polymer and a reported p-type polymer exhibits a voltage gain of 198 VV-1, effectively amplifying the ECG signal and enhancing signal quality. This work establishes structure-property guidelines for designing bioelectronic n-type OMIECs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photobiocatalytic Reaction: From Single Component to Triple Components</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under visible light, an enantioselective multicomponent reaction was achieved by exploiting natural enzyme diversity and biocompatible photochemistry.







Abstract
Despite remarkable advances in photoenzymatic methodologies, the development of photoenzymatic multicomponent reactions remains a significant challenge. In this Highlight, we showcase a recent breakthrough by Prof. Xiaoqiang Huang and co&#8208;workers, who achieved enantioselective triple&#8208;component radical sorting via visible light&#8208;induced biocatalysis under mild conditions. This innovative approach opens new avenues for the synthesis of complex molecules with high precision and efficiency, marking a remarkable advance in the field of enzymatic photocatalysis.

         <title>Competition Between One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Electron Unimolecular Reactions of Late 3d&#8208;Metal Complexes [(Me3SiCH2)nM]&#8211; (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu; n = 2 &#8211; 4)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although organometallic complexes of the late 3d elements are known to undergo both one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reactions, their relative propensities to do so remain poorly understood. To gain direct insight into the competition between these different pathways, we have analyzed the unimolecular gas&#8208;phase reactivity of a series of well&#8208;defined model complexes [(Me3SiCH2)nM]&#8722; (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu; n = 2 &#8211; 4). Applying a combination of tandem&#8208;mass spectrometry, quantum&#8208;chemical computations, and statistical rate theory calculations, we find several different fragmentation reactions, among which the homolytic cleavage of metal&#8208;carbon bonds and radical dissociations are particularly prominent. In all cases, these one&#8208;electron reactions are entropically favored. For the ferrate and cobaltate complexes, they are also energetically preferred, which explains their predominance in the corresponding fragmentation experiments. For [(Me3SiCH2)4Ni]&#8722; and, even more so, for [(Me3SiCH2)4Cu]&#8722;, a concerted reductive elimination as a prototypical two&#8208;electron reaction is energetically more favorable and gains in importance. [(Me3SiCH2)3Ni]&#8722; is special in that it has two nearly degenerate spin states, both of which react in different ways. A simple thermochemical analysis shows that the relative order of the first and second bond&#8208;dissociation energies is of key importance in controlling the competition between radical dissociations and concerted reductive eliminations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Cancer Photoimmunotherapy by Harnessing Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Activated Nanoparticles Containing Charge Transfer Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C. Wang et&#8197;al. recently developed a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;activated charge transfer complex&#8208;based nanoparticle with donor&#8208; acceptor (D&#8211;A) units, which enhances photothermal conversion and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) synergistically combines photothermal and photodynamic therapies (PTT/PDT). Preclinical experiments have shown a strong immunotherapeutic effect by integrating programmed cell death protein 1 antibody combination therapy. While the use of D&#8211;A units in nanosystems for photoimmunotherapy is still emerging, it holds great potential to revolutionize cancer treatment.







Abstract
Phototherapy&#8212;which includes photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8212;has evoked interest as a promising cancer treatment modality on account of its noninvasiveness, spatiotemporal precision, and minimal side effects. C. Wang et&#8197;al. recently reported a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;activated charge transfer complex&#8208;based nanoparticle which consists of a donor (D) and an acceptor (A). Experimental results have demonstrated a potent immunotherapeutic effect of integrating programmed cell death protein 1 antibody combination therapy in preclinical models. Incorporating D&#8211;A interactions into nanosystems for photoimmunotherapy (PIT) is still a novel approach. This approach offers a multifaceted strategy for synergistic cancer PIT which holds promising potential to transform cancer treatment paradigms.

         <title>Miniaturized Separation&#8208;Sensing Tandem Enabled by Fluorescent Monoliths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discriminative sensing for mixture by either fluorescent sensor or other sensors remains a challenge. This issue is attributed to the absence of a separation unit prior to the sensor. Here, we report a new sensing medium, named porous fluorescent monolith, which can separate mixture and meanwhile be integrated into a sensor for discriminative detection. The fluorescent monoliths are prepared via polymerization of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8244;&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzaldehyde with diamines. Their photophysical property and hierarchical porosity are systematically studied. On this basis, we set up a separation&#8208;sensing platform and realize quantitative analysis for trace water in methanol, a sarin simulant, perfluoroalkyl compounds and metal ions. The separation&#8208;sensing platform furthermore demonstrates baseline separation for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, with limit of detections of 86, 54, 19 and 58 ng, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a fluorescent monolith is used to realize a separation&#8208;sensing tandem. We anticipate our findings will provide a promising strategy for producing portable devices with the on&#8208;site discriminative sensing ability for real samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile C&#8211;H alkylation and alkylidenation via catalytic alkylidene transfer of enones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkylidene transfer reactions of alkenes are of particular significance but challenging. Here, we report that enones can serve as diverse alkylidene sources for catalyst&#8208;controlled selective C&#8211;H alkylation and/or alkylidenation of various nucleophiles. Treatment of a mixture of ketone (or lactam), enone and diarylmethanol with a catalytic amount of Y[N(TMS)2]3, gave the corresponding &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond alkylation products derived from the alkylidene transfer from enones to ketones/lactams, whereas the reaction of enones with various C&#8208;nucleophiles in the presence of KOH as a catalyst resulted in C&#8211;H alkylidenation. Moreover, the application of these strategies for the late&#8208;stage modification or structural simplification of some bioactive molecules is also presented. These alkylidene transfer reactions are characterized by operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions, and remarkable catalyst&#8208;controlled product outcomes. These results not only demonstrate a significant potential for easily accessible and recyclable enones to serve as versatile alkylidene sources in C&#8211;H alkylation and alkylidenation, but also provide an attractive and concise method for hydrodealkylidenation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Activation of Asymmetry Amplification Effects in Helical Polymer&#8208;Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) exhibit different asymmetry amplification effects, e.g. helix inversion or screw&#8208;sense induction, in the presence of different external stimuli such as temperature, solvents or metal ions that usually operate independently through interaction with the pendant on the monomer repeating units. In this work, we will demonstrate that the helical structure of a chiral PPA can be tamed by playing with two different external stimuli such as temperature and metal ions. Thus, when a metal ion salt is delivered to a chloroform solution of a chiral PPA to generate a chiral PPA monomer repeating unit (m.r.u.)/Mn+ complex in a ratio of 1.0/&lt;0.5 mol/mol, a temperature&#8208;responsive material is obtained. Interestingly, when the temperature is lowered to about 278&#8208;283 K, the metal ion decomplexes, which recovers the initial helical structure adopted by the PPA. This complexation/decomplexation between the chiral PPA and the metal ions is fully reversible and triggers different asymmetry amplification effects &#8212;helix inversion, screw&#8208;sense induction or Sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;Soldiers, among others&#8212;, allowing the creation of a temperature&#8208;responsive helical polymer&#8208;metal complex (HPMC) from a metal&#8208;responsive helical polymer.</dc:description>

This complexation/decomplexation between the chiral PPA and the metal ions is fully reversible and triggers different asymmetry amplification effects &#8212;helix inversion, screw-sense induction or Sergeants-and-Soldiers, among others&#8212;, allowing the creation of a temperature-responsive helical polymer-metal complex (HPMC) from a metal-responsive helical polymer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Biomimetic Channels in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework via Post&#8208;Synthesis for Enhanced Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton transport channels in biological systems are constructed by the specific amino acid residues with hanging carboxylic acid groups acting as proton donors and acceptors, enabling rapid proton conduction via the Grotthuss mechanism. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are promising candidates for artificially simulating proton channels due to their designable structure and abundant proton sources in the network. However, these protons were usually immobilized within hydrogen bonds between two building blocks, which require a high energy barrier for initiating proton transport. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) may be a viable solution to the above problems but has yet to be achieved in HOFs. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that unoccupied carboxylic acid groups can be created through post&#8208;synthesis which further stabilizes water molecules to construct continuous proton channels, bringing boosted proton conductivity by three orders of magnitude. The structure transformation process and the intermediate can be identified clearly by crystallography with an unveiled mechanism. This work offers a new approach to constructing biomimetic channels for proton conduction and HOF functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Divergent Photocatalytic C&#8208;Glycosylation of Glycosyl Benzoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolically robust C&#8208;glycosides are crucial in various biological and medical applications, underscoring the need for efficient synthesis methods. While radical C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are known for their reliability and functional group tolerance, challenges such as glycosyl donor stability and atom economy persist. In this study, we investigate the underexplored potential of condition&#8208;controlled divergent synthesis of C&#8208;glycosides through a switchable photocatalytic C&#8208;glycosylation strategy, involving reductive anomeric C&#8211;O bond cleavage. Utilizing simple, readily available, and bench&#8208;stable glycosyl benzoates as novel O&#8208;based glycosyl radical precursors, we successfully achieve deoxygenative glycosylation of simple alkenes and styryl boronic acids, establishing a versatile platform for C&#8208;glycoside synthesis. A critical aspect of the challenging reductive cleavage of these benzoate esters is the introduction of strong single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reductants, combined with Br&#248;nsted acids to accelerate fragmentation following substrate reduction. Notably, CO2&#8226;&#8722;, generated via the consecutive photon&#8208;induced electron transfer process, is utilized for the first time in glycosylation reactions. By meticulously tuning the reaction conditions, including photocatalysts and formate additives, we facilitate the divergent synthesis of alkyl and alkenyl C&#8208;glycosides with good to high stereoselectivity and yields. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the reaction pathway and the underlying rationale behind this finely tuned, easily controlled photocatalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Cobalt&#8208;Zeolite Propane&#8208;Dehydrogenation&#160;Catalysts Enabled by Reaction&#8208;Driven Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt&#8208;based catalysts have emerged as promising substitutes for Pt&#8208; and Cr&#8208;based propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts. However, controlling the distribution of Co species and achieving stable active centers remains challenging. Here, we report that reaction&#8208;driven reconstruction of metallic cobalt (Co0) species within pure silica MFI zeolite (S&#8208;1) into CoOx clusters within silanol nests during PDH yields efficient and durable performance. Atomically dispersed CoOx clusters exhibit exceptional durability and high propylene space&#8208;time yield (STY), maintaining an ultrahigh propylene STY of 17.2 mmolC3H6 gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for over 260 hours under industrially relevant conditions, surpassing previous cobalt&#8208;based PDH catalysts. Moreover, the catalyst operates stably at 520 &#176;C for 170 hours with near&#8208;equilibrium propane conversions. Comprehensive characterizations indicate the dynamic evolution process from the silanol nests effectively capturing and stabilizing Co0 species within S&#8208;1 zeolite, thereby promoting the dynamic formation of CoOx clusters during the PDH process. We also demonstrate that stable Co&#8208;O active centers formed by this unique anchoring strategy improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation and promoting efficient propane dehydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Aqueous Electrolytes with Vicinal S&#8208;based Organic Additives for Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The commercial deployment of Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries (AZIBs) is hampered by dendrites, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and corrosion reactions. To tackle these challenges, we have introduced 3,3'&#8208;dithiobis&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid disodium salt (SPS), a symmetrical sulfur&#8208;based organic salt, as an electrolyte additive for AZIBs. Unlike conventional electrolyte additives that favour (002) deposition, SPS enables dense (100) growth through a unique symmetrically aligned concentration&#8208;controlled adsorption network, affording structural uniformity and compactness to the Zn deposit layer. The dual&#8208;action symmetrical SPS additive adsorbs onto the Zn surface via vicinal sulfur atoms, blocking electrolyte access to the Zn anode, enhancing the transportation kinetics of Zn2+ and simultaneously promoting desolvation by displacing water molecules from the solvation shell. This synergistic effect improves the stability of Zn anode by mitigating HER and corrosion, resulting in over 1100 hours of cycling at 5 mA cm&#8208;2, 5 mAh cm&#8208;2, stable operation at even 15 mA cm&#8208;2, 15 mAh cm&#8208;2 and achieving impressive Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.41%. As validation, the Zn/NaV3O8&#8729;1.35H2O cell with SPS&#8208;additive afforded high cycling stabilization and excellent capacity retention of 95.5%. This study offers valuable insights for advancing AZIBs and other metal&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Molybdenum Peroxide Scissors for Converting Polyamide Plastic into Low Carbon Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct chemical conversion of plastic waste into low&#8208;carbon oxygenates, rather than carbon dioxide, with renewable energy, is important yet challenging. Due to the high C&#8208;X (X = C, H, N) bond energy, fully optimized catalysts are required to enable precise bond cleavage for boosted efficiency and selectivity. Here, we report adaptable and recyclable molybdenum peroxide photocatalysts that demonstrate chemical scissors for the selective conversion of polyamide to alcohol. Our experiments and calculations show that the dimensionally adaptable Mo(+5.8)&#8208;(O2) is activated via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) process for localized catalysis under illumination to precisely cleave C&#8208;X bonds to generate C2 and C1 alcohols. The additional hydrogen peroxide provides proton and peroxide conditions that facilitate the activation and regeneration of the catalytic scissors. The precise structures of the chemical scissors ultimately create the conditions for the precise oxidation and cutting of PA6 into methanol with an efficiency of 2.55 mmol&#183;L&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 82.4%. This work provides insights into the role of adaptable metal peroxides in precisely cutting C&#8208;X bonds, which are critically important for the efficient and selective chemical conversion of plastic wastes.</dc:description>

         <title>Illuminating Lead Coordination in Perovskite Precursors via Fluorescence Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of perovskite precursors critically determine the ultimate performance of perovskite devices, yet simple and accessible real&#8208;time precursor characterization methods remain scarce. Here, we systematically investigate the lead (Pb) coordination environment in perovskite precursors using fluorescence spectroscopy. By examining lead halide [PbX6]&#8308;&#8722; octahedra (X = Cl, Br, I) and monitoring their luminescence under different solvents and A&#8208;site cation compositions, we unveil how [PbX6]&#8308;&#8722; distinct aggregation states give rise to characteristic fluorescence &#8220;fingerprints.&#8221; We find that halide choice, solvent coordination, and A&#8208;site cations collectively exert pronounced effects on the photoluminescence (PL) peak positions, full width at half maximum (FWHM), and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Moreover, we demonstrate that fluorescence spectroscopy can capture subtle changes in intermediate perovskite structures&#8212;including low&#8208;dimensional nanoscale clusters and the formation of higher&#8208;dimensional networks. This robust optical method offers a powerful and straightforward approach for tracing the nucleation stage, evaluating solvent&#8208;solute and solute&#8211;solute interactions, and differentiating Pb coordination states in real time. The aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) phenomenon of inorganic systems and the structure&#8208;activity relationship at the aggregate level have important guiding significance for the design of materials.</dc:description>

The aggregation-induced emission (AIE) phenomenon of inorganic systems and the structure-activity relationship at the aggregate level have important guiding significance for the design of materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stability and Mitochondrial Localization of a Highly Cytotoxic Organogold(III) Complex with Diphosphine Ancillary Ligand in Lung Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a comprehensive study on the chemical reactivity in gas phase, with amino acids and peptides and in cell, the anticancer activity and localization of a series of seven cationic biphenyl gold(III) complexes with aryl, alkyl and chiral diphosphine ancillary ligands. Despite some structural differences, all the complexes similarly featured high stability toward reduction or ligand exchange in cell&#8208;free conditions. The biphenyl Au(III) complex including the 1,2&#8208;diphenylphosphinoethane (dppe) ligand manifested the same high stability in cellular setting, as attested by a combination of cryo&#8208;Synchrotron Radiation&#8208;X&#8208;Ray Fluorescence (cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XRF) nano&#8208;imaging and cryo&#8208;Synchrotron Radiation&#8208;X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XAS) measurements. Tandem cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XRF elemental mapping and confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated the selective accumulation of the dppe complex in mitochondria. This represents the first study of the speciation and distribution of an organogold(III) complex in cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering Chemical Principles Governing Nanophase Formation in Ternary Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoscopic phases, such as oil&#8208;enriched pockets dispersed in water, have been observed in ternary mixtures of oil, water, and cosolvent in the absence of surfactants. Such nanophases are found across a portion of compositions within the single&#8208;phase region of the ternary phase diagram. However, the principles governing the formation of nanophases under certain conditions but not others, regarding both volumetric and chemical makeup, are unclear. Here, the nanophase behavior of ternary mixtures of water with a suite of cosolvents and oils containing strategically chosen functional groups is systematically analyzed to probe the role of intermolecular interactions. Dynamic light scattering is used to quantify the nanophase structure. It was found that stronger classes of intermolecular interactions such as H&#8208;bonding or n&#8208;&#928;* interactions between oil and cosolvent notably contribute to forming thermodynamically stable nanophases. Ternary mixtures in which the oil has only van der Waals interactions with the water and cosolvent do not stabilize nanophases detectable by dynamic light scattering. Aromatic groups favor nanophase formation. The most prominent structuring (highest number and largest sizes of nanophases) is found in water&#8208;rich compositions near the miscibility gap. This experimental study provides chemical insight into the chemical formulation of ternary solvent mixtures favoring nanophase formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophotocatalysis for Reductive Defluorination of PTFE and PFASs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is among the most inert poly&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and its degradation under mild conditions remains underdeveloped. We report a supercapacitor assisted electrophotocatalysis, incorporating the strength of both electrochemical and photochemical energy, for the efficient defluorination of PTFE and other PFASs at low temperature. CBZ6 worked as a photoreductant for injecting electrons to the inert carbon&#8208;fluorine bond, whereas the supercapacitor enabled the generation of the catalytically active species via an electrochemical process. Furthermore, the utilization of sunlight as the light source and supercapacitor as the electrical energy source makes the reaction portable and enables its outdoor applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances and Challenges in Low&#8208;temperature Upcycling of Waste Polyolefins&#160;via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyolefin waste is the largest polymer waste stream that could potentially serve as an advantageous hydrocarbon feedstock. Upcycling polyolefins poses significant challenges due to their inherent kinetic and thermodynamic stability. Traditional methods, such as thermal and catalytic cracking, are straightforward but require temperatures exceeding 400 &#176;C for complete conversion because of thermodynamic constraints. We summarize and critically compare recent advances in upgrading of spent polyolefins and model reactants via kinetic (and thermodynamic) coupling of the endothermic C&#8722;C bond cleavage of polyolefins with exothermic reactions including hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, metathesis, cyclization, oxidation, and alkylation. These approaches enable complete conversion to desired products at low temperatures (&lt; 300 &#176;C). The goal is to identify challenges and possible pathways for catalytic conversions that minimize energy and carbon footprint.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Chemistry of Tetrazenes: Access to Polymers with Pristine Tetrazenyl Chain Ends and Depolymerization Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first radical reaction of tetrazenes &#8211;&#160;i. e. functions with four consecutive nitrogen atoms with a linear N&#8211;N=N&#8211;N chain&#160;&#8211; that retains the characteristic 4N pattern. Selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) in the &#945;&#8208;position of the 4N chain enables the free radical polymerization of various polar and non&#8208;polar monomers. The tetrazene units play a dual role. Its decomposition generates aminyl radicals that can undergo HAT and lead to initiating C&#8208;centered radicals. Contrary to what was previously thought the aminyl radicals never add to the monomers. The polymers obtained feature tetrazene chain ends, which can be harnessed as macro&#8208;initiators to further grow the polymer chains. Heating of the former above the ceiling temperature leads to cleavage of the tetrazene function, which enables depolymerization by unzipping of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS).</dc:description>

         <title>Intercalation of Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes into 2D Hybrid Perovskites for Tailored Dual&#8208;Band Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recently emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead&#8208;halide perovskites are mostly templated by &#8220;inert&#8221; organic cations, limiting their light emission solely from the inorganic components. Using &#8220;optically active&#8221; organic cations can grant access to the coupling between&#160; two luminescent components, potentially leading to new excitation and emission pathways. However, employing optically active organic cations requires delicate design and complicated synthesis. To circumvent these problems, transition&#8208;metal complexes (Cu2+ and Ni2+) were intercalated in 2D perovskites and reported, for the first time, the photoluminescence (PL) profiles. 2D perovskites incorporating transition&#8208;metal complexes can be considered a molecular &#8220;type II&#8221; heterostructure where&#160;&#8220;conduction band&#8221; is localized on the complexes and&#160;&#8220;valence band&#8221; on the haloplumbate layers. As evident in the absorption and PL spectra of the materials, the &#8220;type II&#8221; configuration allows inter&#8208;band transitions to occur in addition to intraband within 2D Pb&#8211;Br layers. This makes the material's PL excitation wavelength dependent, allowing activation of only inter&#8208;band or inter&#8208;band plus intraband transitions by certain wavelengths. As the transition&#8208;metal complexes are highly tunable, this extra variable renders 2D hybrid perovskites a fertile playground for PL engineering as desired outcome can be targeted through fine&#8208;tailoring of inorganic lattice structures and selection of complexes with specific electronic configuration.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mounting concerns regarding per&#8208;/poly&#8208;fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on human health are focusing attention on trace level PFAS detection in aqueous environments. Here we report a readily prepared small molecule, 2,6&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;diethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (receptor 1), that displays high binding affinities (logKa = 4.9&#8208;6.2) and produces a strong &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; emission response when exposed to representative PFAS in hexanes. The hydrophobic nature of 1, and its strong affinity for various PFAS, allowed hexanes solutions of 1 to be used as "turn&#8208;on" emission sensors for dilute aqueous solutions of long&#8208;chain (&#8805;C8) PFAS under acidic conditions (pH = 2) by liquid&#8208;phase extraction (LPE). In the case of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the response was rapid (under 10 min) and sensitive. Limits of detection (LOD) as low as 250 ppt were readily achievable by direct naked&#8208;eye observation. LOD as low as 40 ppt and 100 ppt, respectively, could be reached for deionized and tap water solutions of PFOA using a smartphone color&#8208;scanning application. Little change in the sensitivity was seen in the presence of a range of inorganic and organic species that could act as potential interferants. Support for the present findings came from UV&#8208;vis absorbance, fluorescence, 1H/19F NMR spectroscopic analyses, DFT calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>A d&#8208;electron Deficient Pd Trimer for Exceptional Pyridine Hydrogenation Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective hydrogenation of pyridines containing reducible groups such as 2&#8208;phenylpyridine typically has low yields due to strong nitrogen coordination with the metal as well as non&#8208;selective and over&#8208;hydrogenation. We report the synthesis of a novel Pd trimer catalyst through confined growth on an ordered mesoporous carrier, characterized by a 0.42 d&#8208;electron deficiency to address this challenge. This catalyst achieved a nearly complete conversion of 2&#8208;phenylpyridine and selectivity to 2&#8208;phenylpiperidine, maintaining its performance across 8 batch cycles and continuous flow in the liquid phase for 800 h with negligible loss of activity or selectivity. We discuss the roles of active sites, including Pd d charge and ensemble structure, in relation to activation entropy, a Hammett study, and the adsorption configuration of the reactant. The exceptional 2&#8208;phenylpyridine hydrogenation activity and selectivity are attributed to the adsorption constraint of the pyridyl ring and the stabilization of the negatively charged transition state in the rate&#8208;determining step produced by d&#8208;electron deficient Pd trimer.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification, Characterization, and Catalytic Mechanism of Regioselective UbiA Prenyltransferases in Morus Plants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>UbiA prenyltransferases (PTs) play an indispensable role in the prenylation of plant metabolites, yielding numerous natural products with enhanced pharmacological activities. These enzymes typically target specific carbon atoms or hydroxyl groups of aromatic substrates. Despite the recent identification of dozens of plant&#8208;derived UbiA PTs, their catalytic mechanism remains poorly understood, particularly regarding the precise control of regioselectivity. Here we identified&#160;10 MaPTs that catalyzed the regioselective prenylation and geranylation of moracin substrates in Morus alba. Molecular dockings, dynamics simulations, and quantum chemical calculations revealed the substrate&#8208;induced conformational changes leading to the formation of the hydrophobic reaction pocket, as well as the differential binding between various MaPTs and moracin M. Additionally, the recognition of prenyl donors by MaPT27 and the potential mechanism underlying the reversal of regioselectivity induced by different donors were disscussed. Finally, structure&#8208;based rational mutation altered the site preference from C7 to C5. These findings suggest that the regioselectivity of plant UbiA PTs is governed by both the inherent chemoselectivity of reaction sites and intricate protein&#8208;substrate interactions. These results provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of plant UbiA PTs, facilitating their application in protein engineering and synthetic biology for the production of prenylated compounds with medicinal potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Dehydrogenation of Methyl Formate Catalyzed by a Recyclable Polymer&#8208;Grafted Manganese(I) Pincer Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are an effective solution for the long&#8208;term storage of hydrogen and its long&#8208;distance transportation, but one that requires efficient catalysis for hydrogen uptake and release. Homogeneous molecular catalysts employed in LOHC systems usually exhibit high reactivity and selectivity, but are difficult to recover and reuse, a fact that severely limits their practical application. Herein, we report an easily synthesized polymer&#8208;grafted pincer&#8208;type complex of earth&#8208;abundant manganese, which can catalyze the aqueous dehydrogenation of methyl formate, an emerging LOHC material. Importantly, this immobilized Mn&#8208;pincer catalyst retains the high reactivity of the corresponding molecular catalyst, yet is also recyclable, exhibiting high stability and achieving a total hydrogen&#8208;based turnover number of more than 230,000 after 5 consecutive recycling rounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>While remote functionalization has emerged as a powerful strategy for modifying unactivated sites that are traditionally challenging to functionalize, there has been no remote hydrogermylation known to date. This work reports the first remote hydrogermylation of alkenes, achieved through a rare base&#8208;catalyzed approach &#8212; completely free of added transition metal catalysts. The methodology is operationally simple, versatile, and capable of achieving up to 8&#8208;carbon chain walks, overcoming the previous two&#8208;carbon limit of base&#8208;mediated processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism Switch between Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover and Radical Buffering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;polar crossover is a classic concept that bridges one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron chemistry. It has been widely used in Cr&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl addition reactions to clarify the formation of alkyl chromium(III) intermediate and subsequent carbonyl insertion. Herein, we proposed an orthogonal bonding model, the radical buffering scenario, for Cr&#8208;catalyzed carbonyl alkylation. This radical bonding model features the radical dissociation from the alkyl chromium(III) complex followed by the Cr(II)&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;coupled radical addition to form the C&#8211;C bond. The mechanism switch between the radical and polar bonding models is affected by the radical stability, radical nucleophilicity, radical size, and the presence of &#945;&#8208;heteroatom or &#945;&#8208;&#960; bond. The collaborative computational and experimental studies have verified the reliability of the radical mechanism. More importantly, we demonstrated that this radical buffering scenario possesses a different stereoselectivity control model from that in the radical&#8208;polar crossover scenario. A general enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity control model derived from the multiple ligand&#8208;radical interactions is thus established for CrCl2/bisoxazoline&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric radical addition.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and In&#8208;situ Active Sites Regeneration for OER Activity Recovery and Greatly Prolonged Water&#8208;Splitting Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the continuous regeneration of enzymes in living organisms that enables sustained long&#8208;term enzymatic reactions, we propose an active site regeneration strategy to rapidly and in&#8208;situ recover the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the electrode through switching anode solution, to substantially prolong the service life of the electrolytic cell. The OER activity of anodic NiFe(S)/NM catalyst synthesized by coating S&#8208;doped NiFe&#8208;LDH on nickel mesh (NM) exhibited excellent initial activity, then experienced gradual active site and activity losses due to the nanosheet detachment from NMs after a long&#8208;term OER process. Attractively, such a damaged catalyst and its active sites can be effectively regenerated by in&#8208;situ redox reaction followed by electrochemical oxidation through switching the anode into the different solutions, resulting in the full recovery of the OER activity to its initial value. The recovered catalyst (R&#8208;NiFe(S)/NM) retains 90% of the initial activity and can be operated stably for over 80 h at 300 mA/cm2 even after four cycles of being damaged and recovered, and the established electrolyzer equipped with in&#8208;situ recovered catalyst can be operated at the identical current density and almost the same cell voltage to that of the initial one.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Fortimicin B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fortimicins, featuring with a pseudodisaccharide scaffold, are an unusual class of aminoglycosides with potent efficacy against several aminoglycoside&#8208;resistant bacterial strains. Notably, these molecules also exhibit lower inherent ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity than common aminoglycosides. Consequently, fortimicins are a promising type of protypical molecules for the development of the next&#8208;generation of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Here, we report the asymmetric total synthesis of fortimicin B in 12 steps (longest linear sequence, LLS) from readily available starting materials. An enantioselective Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones and N&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;oxazolones was developed for the efficient synthesis of the fortamine fragment, which previously required a lengthy multi&#8208;step synthesis owing to its complex stereochemistry. The 6&#8208;epi&#8208;purpurosamine B fragment was efficiently synthesized through a Cr(II)/Co(I)&#8208;mediated C&#8211;C bond coupling between aldehydes and alkyl halides. Within these two fragments, the stereoselective construction of the &#945;&#8208;glycosidic bond of fortimicin B was realized via the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation. Overall, this study provides an efficient synthetic platform&#160;for future&#160;investigations into the structure&#8211;activity relationships of fortimicins.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Ru&#8208;O Coordination for Switching Redox Centers in Acidic Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Avoiding lattice oxygen involvement (oxygen redox) while promoting the coupling of adjacent adsorbed oxygen (metal redox) during the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for gaining high activity and robust stability in RuO2&#8208;based catalysts but remains elusive. Here, we present a precise strategy to selectively activate the metal redox process while suppressing the undesired oxygen redox pathway by fine&#8208;tuning the Ru&#8208;O coordination number in amorphous RuOx. The optimized catalyst exhibits outstanding acidic OER performance, achieving a low overpotential of 215 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and maintaining stability for 300 hours with a negligible degradation rate of 100 &#956;V h&#8208;1. X&#8208;ray absorption measurements and multiple operando spectra reveal that only Ru2&#8208;O11 moieties can selectively activate the metal redox process, whereas Ru2&#8208;O9 and Ru2&#8208;O8 moieties either trigger both redox pathways or bypass them. Theoretical calculations reveal that Ru2&#8208;O11 moiety reduces crystal field splitting energy at active Ru sites, disables lattice oxygen activation, and lowers the energy barrier for oxygen coupling. The strategy developed in this work offers new avenues for switching redox centers and refining OER mechanisms to enhance catalytic performance and long&#8208;term stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lugdunomycin via Sequential Photoinduced Spiroketalization and Isobenzofuran Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of sterically rigid contiguous quaternary stereocenters in natural products imposes conformational constraints with significant effects on their biological activities. However, achieving the direct synthesis of multiple contiguous quaternary stereocenters in a single step remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present the total&#160;synthesis of the antibacterial metabolite lugdunomycin (1) in&#160;thirteen&#160;steps&#160;via a sequence of photochemical transformations. A photoenolization, keto&#8211;enol tautomerization, and spiroketalization sequence was developed to generate the spiroketal 4&#160;from actinaphthoran B (3). Subsequently, a photoinduced isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between elmonin (4) and iso&#8208;maleimycin (5) was developed to construct the polycyclic benzaza[4,3,3]propellane framework bearing three contiguous quaternary stereocenters&#160;in the compact C&#8208;ring along with a distal hydroxyl group at C19. The mechanism of these photochemical reactions was investigated using synthetic and computational approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding as a Tool to Control Morphology and Charge Transport Properties in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solid&#8208;state structure and morphology of organic semiconductors are critical in determining the performance of organic electronic devices, as they directly influence charge carrier mobility. Improved molecular packing and ordering are key to achieving better device performance. While halogen bonding (XB) has been extensively used in supramolecular crystal engineering, its potential for organic electronics remains largely untapped. Here, we show that strong and directional XB can significantly enhance the morphology and optoelectronic properties of pyridine&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives. By employing various XB donors with differing interaction strengths and comparing them to a non&#8208;bonding reference compound, we achieve a two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in field&#8208;effect mobility and ION&#8208;IOFF&#160;ratio. Furthermore, the geometric substitution pattern of the XB donors is found to strongly influence molecular packing, crystalline domain formation, and, ultimately, device performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing Spontaneous Acidic Corrosion and Hydrogen Evolution for Stable Zn//MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aqueous Zn//MnO2 batteries have attracted significant attention due to their high safety and cost&#8208;effective for potential large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the severe acidic corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Zn anodes in acidic electrolytes pose critical challenges to their practical application. Here, we introduce trace amounts of p&#8208;Hydroxybenzaldehyde (M4) into the electrolyte to address the above anode issues. Leveraging its strong affinity for Zn2+ and H2O, M4 molecules reconstruct the Zn(H2O)62+ solvation sheath and adsorb onto the anode surface, effectively blocking direct contact between H+ and Zn. This dual action significantly mitigates acidic corrosion and HER, enhancing Zn anode reversibility and stability. Benefiting from these merits, symmetric cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability of over 2000 hours at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, delivering a fivefold increase in lifespan compared to conventional electrolytic cells. Moreover, Zn//MnO2 batteries demonstrate stable operation for more than 3000 cycles in acidic electrolyte with an average coulombic efficiency exceeding 97.3%. The assembled pouch cell delivers a high capacity of 1.68 Ah, maintaining stable operation for over 100 cycles. This work presents unique perspectives and offers promising avenues to improve the stability and efficiency of aqueous battery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Silylation of Aryl and Alkyl Chlorides by a Seven&#8208;Membered Dialkoxysilyl Group Si(pan)Me via an in situ Generated Silylpotassium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon&#8208;containing compounds are increasingly vital in pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications, yet existing silylation methods face critical limitations: poor reactivity of unactivated silanes and instability of activated silylation reagents and their products. Here, we present a seven&#8208;membered dialkoxysilyl unit, dioxasilepane, abbreviated as Si(pan), that combines exceptional stability with controllable reactivity. We demonstrate a versatile method for Si(pan)Me incorporation into organic molecules through reactions with diverse aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl chlorides. Notably, we have isolated and structurally characterized the key silylpotassium intermediate as its 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 complex through X&#8208;ray crystallography. Experimental mechanistic studies reveal that this silylpotassium species mediates the transformation primarily through halogen&#8208;metal exchange (HME). Computational investigations confirm the HME pathway while suggesting a concurrent SN2 mechanism for specific primary alkyl chlorides. This methodology establishes Si(pan) as a robust building block for constructing silicon&#8208;containing molecular frameworks, addressing a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fluorescently labeled collagen model peptides (CMPs) are useful tools for monitoring fibrotic processes and tissue repair. Fine&#8208;tuning the propensity of the CMP to form a collagen triple helix is crucial since only single&#8208;stranded but not triple&#8208;helical CMPs integrate efficiently into damaged or remodeling tissue. Yet the impact of fluorophores on the folding behavior of CMPs and triple helix stability has so far been underappreciated. Here, we show that N&#8208;terminal fluorophores enhance triple helix stability and nucleation. Thermal denaturation and temperature jump experiments showed that triple helix stability and nucleation are proportionally affected by the accessible surface area of the fluorophore. For biological applications, fluorophores with a small surface area are therefore beneficial. Furthermore, we show that fluorophores bearing ionizable groups with an appropriate pKa value, such as commonly used fluorescein, can be used to create pH&#8208;responsive assemblies. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully selecting appropriate fluorophores and spacers when developing fluorescent probes for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Itinerancy&#160;Mediated by Oxygen Vacancies Breaks the Inert Electron Chain to Boosts Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The complex interaction between dopants and oxygen vacancies (Vo) in metal oxides is crucial for enhancing the adsorption and electron transfer processes of&#160;Li&#8208;O2&#160;batteries. However, the synergetic mechanism among Vo, dopants, and the host matrix remains unclear. Herein, Ru single&#8208;atom&#8208;modified TiO2&#160;nanorod&#160;(Ru1&#8208;TiO2&#8208;x) with abundant Vo&#160;were fabricated, serving as an efficient catalyst for Li&#8208;O2&#160;batteries. Experimental and theoretical investigations have demonstrated that Vo&#160;as an "electron pump", facilitating electron itinerant behavior, while Ru1&#160;serves as an "electron buffer" to further activate the [Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Ti] electronic chain, implements the Li&#8208;O2&#160;batteries highly active and stable in the process of circulation two&#8208;way self&#8208;adjusting characteristics. Consequently, the Ru1&#8208;TiO2&#8208;x&#8208;based Li&#8208;O2&#160;batteries exhibit an ultra&#8208;low charge polarization&#160;and stable&#160;performance. Vo and Ru1&#160;synergistically coordinate their control over the d&#8208;band center at the Ti site to establish a flexible and tunable Ru&#8208;Ti dual active site. This adjustment effectively balances the binding strength with the interface oxygen intermediate (*O), thereby significantly reducing the activation barrier. The Hamiltonian layout further revealed the crucial role of remote orbital coupling in maintaining the structural stability. This study provides insights into Vo&#8208;dependent electron transfer kinetics and introduces new strategies for activating catalytically inert materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Amino&#8208;Oxygenation Cyclization via Alkene Radical Cation/Bisnucleophile Engagement to Saturated N/O&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical amino&#8208;oxygenation of alkene radical cations with bisnucleophiles enabled the formation of saturated N/O&#8208;heterocycles. In situ EC&#8208;MS data offered valuable insights into the radical cation&#8208;initiated difunctionalization, allowing precise control over regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.








Abstract
Regioselective functionalization of alkenes to create nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles remains a significant challenge in organic synthesis. Because of their unique electronic and biological properties, these heterocycles are crucial in pharmaceuticals and materials. Herein, we present an electrochemical amino&#8208;oxygenation of alkenes using alkene radical cations and bisnucleophiles, enabling the synthesis of saturated N/O&#8208;heterocycles in an undivided cell. This method employs readily available amides and alkenes, eliminating the need for additional oxidants or redox catalysts. The in situ generation of alkene radical cations results in high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. Our approach offers a direct route to six&#8208;, seven&#8208;, and eight&#8208;membered N/O&#8208;heterocycles from simple starting materials, broadening access to complex molecules essential for medicinal chemistry and materials science.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly for Bimodal In Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, rationally designed self&#8208;assembled dyes are introduced&#8212;which offer controllable aggregate sizes and tunable NIR absorption and emission&#8212;as a unique and efficient platform for simultaneous multimodal [fluorescence reflectance imaging (FRI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI)] and multiscale (50&#160;nm&#8211;1&#160;&#181;m) biomedical imaging.








Abstract
Contrast agents (CAs) are essential in biomedical imaging to aid in the diagnosis and therapy monitoring of disease. However, they are typically restricted to one imaging modality and have fixed properties such as size, shape, toxicity profile, or photophysical characteristics, which hampers a comprehensive view of biological processes. Herein, rationally designed dye assemblies are introduced as a unique CA platform for simultaneous multimodal and multiscale biomedical imaging. To this end, a series of amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes are synthesized with varying hydrophobic domains (C1, C8, C12, and C16) that self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media into nanostructures of tunable size (50&#160;nm&#8211;1&#160;&#181;m) and photophysical properties. While C1 exhibits oblique&#8208;type exciton coupling and negligible emission, C8&#8208;C16 bearing longer alkyl chains undergo J&#8208;type aggregation with NIR absorption and emission and excellent photoacoustic properties. Given these advantageous features, aza&#8208;BODIPY specific, semi&#8208;quantitative fluorescence reflectance and photoacoustic imaging both in vitro and in vivo are established. Additionally, in vitro cell viability as well as murine in vivo biodistribution analysis with ex vivo validation showed excellent biocompatibility and a size&#8208;dependent biodistribution of nanostructures to different organ beds. These results broaden the scope of aqueous self&#8208;assembly to multimodal imaging and highlight its great potential for rationalizing numerous biomedical questions.

         <title>A General and Mild Two&#8208;Step Strategy Using Bioderived Diols and CO2 for Chemically Recyclable Polycarbonates and Closed&#8208;Loop CO2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and mild two&#8208;step synthetic strategy was developed to synthesize chemically recyclable polycarbonates for CO2 closed&#8208;loop fixation. This approach involves the synthesis of a series of six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate monomers from bio&#8208;derived diols and CO2, followed by organocatalytic living/controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization.








Abstract
Developing chemically recyclable polymers using CO2 and sustainable co&#8208;feedstocks is an important strategy for achieving carbon&#8208;neutral production of new polymers and mitigating plastic pollution. Herein, a series of six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate monomers with different alkyl &#945;&#8208;substituents were synthesized using CO2 and bioderived 1,3&#8208;alkanediol as raw materials at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization was systematically studied using a range of common and readily available organocatalysts. Phosphazene base (t&#8208;BuP2) was identified as the most effective catalyst, offering excellent control over the entire polymerization. The regioselectivity of the synthesized polycarbonates, ranged from 0.74 to 0.99, with the highest value achieved when the side group was isopropyl (highest steric hindrance). Notably, the &#945;&#8208;substituent in the monomers reduced the ring strains, allowing the resulting polycarbonates to be fully recycled to the monomers without decarboxylation. The recycling process effectively traps CO2 in a closed loop between monomers and polymers, preventing its release into the atmosphere. The alkyl side groups enhanced the hydrophobicity of the polycarbonates, thereby reducing the likelihood of CO2 release through hydrolysis during their lifecycle, achieving a robust CO2 closed&#8208;loop fixation. The utility of CO2&#8208;based aliphatic polycarbonates as adhesives and the ability of copolymerization with l&#8208;lactide were explored.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks in Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the concept of computational screening for two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2DCOFs), proposing strategies to enhance their conductivity based on detailed statistical data and exploring their applications in organic electronic devices. It provides a comprehensive guide to the development of novel 2DCOFs and 2DCOF&#8208;based organic electronic devices. 








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2DCOFs) are a unique class of crystalline porous materials interconnected by covalent bonds, which have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their chemical and structural diversity, as well as their applications in adsorption, separation, catalysis, and drug delivery. However, research on the electrical properties of 2DCOFs remains limited, despite their potential in organic electronics. Early studies recognized the poor electrical conductivity of 2DCOFs as a significant obstacle to their application in this field. To overcome this challenge, various strategies have been proposed to enhance conductivity. This review first introduces the concept of computational screening for 2DCOFs and explores approaches to improve their intrinsic conductivity, with a focus on four key aspects: in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport, topology, bandgap, and morphology. It then examines the application of pristine 2DCOFs in organic electronics, including applications in field&#8208;effect transistors, memristors, photodetectors, and chemiresistive gas sensors. We support these strategies with detailed statistical data, providing a comprehensive guide for the design and development of novel 2DCOFs for organic electronics. Finally, we outline future research directions, emphasizing the challenges that remain to be addressed in this emerging area.

         <title>A Magnetic Field&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries with Enhanced Reaction Kinetics by Spin&#8208;Polarization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic field&#8208;assisted lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) battery was established by the spin&#8208;polarization strategy. The spin&#8208;polarized catalysts are capable of promoting electron transfer and improv ing the carrier separation efficiency, contributing to the accelerated kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions for Li&#8211;O2 battery. With the magnetic field, the Li&#8211;O2 battery exhibited a low overpotential of 0.40 V, an ultralow overpotential of 0.12 V and a high energy efficiency of 96.3% under illumination. 








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries have attracted significant attention due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, but are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and high overpotential. Our previous researches have proved that energy fields such as light, force, and heat are effective strategies to improve the reaction kinetics of Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Herein, we proposed a novel magnetic field&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 batteries via a spin polarization strategy. By doping magnetic Mn2+ ions with spin polarization characteristics into CsPbBr3 (Mn&#8211;CsPbBr3) perovskite, a magnetic field&#8208;responsive cathode was designed and prepared. The incorporation of Mn2+ ions drives the charge redistribution and spin polarization of CsPbBr3, which remarkably improve the carrier separation efficiency and the oxygen species adsorption energy. The&#160;Increased spin&#8208;polarization of the magnetic elements by Zeeman effect in an external magnetic field results in the enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. In the magnetic field, a low overpotential of 0.40&#160;V was obtained for Li&#8211;O2 batteries with Mn&#8211;CsPbBr3 cathodes, demonstrating an ultralow overpotential of 0.12&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 96.3% with the further illumination. The introduction of magnetic fields into the Li&#8211;O2 battery system provides a new avenue for improving the reaction kinetics of rechargeable Li&#8211;O2 battery.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Enabled Asymmetric C&#9472;H Acylation of Trifluoroethanol by Dual Nickel/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric C&#9472;H acylation of trifluoroethanol under nickel/photoredox cocatalysis gave products that could be further reduced through a one&#8208;pot process to generate fluoroalkyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;antidiols with adjacent stereocenters. Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the transition state control the stereoselectivity of the reaction. 








Abstract
Serving as a bioisostere for methyl groups, the incorporation of the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) has become a key area of interest in pharmaceutical lead optimization for its unique combination of steric bulk and high electronegativity. Recognizing the widespread application of optically pure &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy carbon centers in drug molecules, the introduction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxytrifluoroethyl groups into stereogenic centers holds significant potential. Herein, we describe an asymmetric trifluoroalkylation protocol utilizing nickel/photoredox cocatalysis to synthesize enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl acyloins via a 1,2&#8208;hydrogen atom migration strategy. Density functional theory calculations guided the reaction design, revealing hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the transition state that control the chiral outcome. The resulting products can be further reduced through a one&#8208;pot process to yield fluoroalkyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols with adjacent stereocenters. This hydrogen&#8208;bonding synergistic methodology demonstrates excellent stereochemical control, mild conditions, and broad functional group tolerance, enabling the efficient asymmetric trifluoroalkylation of complex molecules and offering new avenues for chiral drug development.

         <title>Alternating Binary Droplets&#8208;Based Protocell Networks Driven by Heterogeneous Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binary liquid droplet&#8208;based protocell network, composed of coacervate and aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS) droplets from associative and segregative LLPS, facilitates the spatially segregated and reconfiguration&#8208;mediated biological reactions by spatial recruitment of biomacromolecules and morphological&#8208;regulation based on external stimulus.








Abstract
As the emergence of prototissues promotes the evolutionary transformations of protolife, tissue&#8208;like networks derived from cytomimetic systems have been studied by using artificial cells as building blocks to mimic prototissues at a higher organizational level. However, liquid&#8208;like networks originating from liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS), especially heterogeneous LLPS, are less reported. Herein, we report a binary liquid droplet&#8208;based protocell network composed of coacervates and aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS) droplets arranged in an alternating sequence, integrating both associative and segregative LLPS. This network with worm&#8208;like chains can be specifically achieved only when the attached droplets are partially engulfed, mediated by the interfacial tension between coacervate and ATPS droplets. Notably, the interconnected droplets within the network are capable of spatially self&#8208;sorting of biomacromolecules into separate domains, thereby facilitating biomacromolecular extraction and biological reactions within designated droplets. Upon changes in the external environment, the network can be reconfigured to enable morphological regulation of trienzymatic cascade reactions. Overall, this work highlights that an all&#8208;aqueous network, coupling both associative and segregative LLPS, can be engineered as a possible route toward a hybrid prototissue&#8208;like system, offering new insights into the design of higher&#8208;ordered biomimetic systems utilizing liquid soft matter.

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Cerium&#8208;Mediated C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage for the Deconstructive Diversification of Cyclic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The decarboxylative ring&#8208;opening functionalization of strained and non&#8208;strained cyclic tertiary acids (3&#8211;12&#8208;membered rings) under Ce/photocatalysis, with air as the sole oxidant, is reported. This strategy enables the construction of C&#9472;CN, carbon&#8211;halide, C&#9472;C, C&#9472;Se, and carbon&#9472;oxime bonds to form various functionalized carbonyl compounds. Late&#8208;stage modifications generate valuable molecular modules, providing a pathway for antipsychotic drug synthesis. 








Abstract
The selective cleavage of inert carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in unstrained rings continues to pose a formidable challenge in chemical synthesis. Current methods for C(sp3) &#9472;C(sp3) bond cleavage are highly limited, typically relying on transition&#8208;metal catalysis to facilitate ring&#8208;opening via small&#8208;ring strain or inducing &#946;&#8208;fragmentation after generating radicals from oxygen or nitrogen atoms pre&#8208;installed in the substrate. Herein, we introduce an effective strategy for the decarboxylative ring&#8208;opening functionalization of &#945;&#8208;trisubstituted carboxylic acids, mediated by both light and cerium. This method enables the ring&#8208;opening of carboxylic acids with ring sizes ranging from 3 to 12 members, allowing the construction of C&#9472;CN, C&#8208;halide, C&#9472;C, C&#9472;Se, and C&#9472;oxime bonds. Notably, this reaction does not require the pre&#8208;installation of an oxygen atom in the substrate, as the carbonyl group is derived from atmospheric oxygen. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage modification establishes distally functionalized carbonyl compounds, which serve as versatile synthons for accessing valuable building blocks.

Current methods for C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) &#9472;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond cleavage are highly limited, typically relying on transition-metal catalysis to facilitate ring-opening via small-ring strain or inducing &#946;-fragmentation after generating radicals from oxygen or nitrogen atoms pre-installed in the substrate. Herein, we introduce an effective strategy for the decarboxylative ring-opening functionalization of &#945;-trisubstituted carboxylic acids, mediated by both light and cerium. This method enables the ring-opening of carboxylic acids with ring sizes ranging from 3 to 12 members, allowing the construction of C&#9472;CN, C-halide, C&#9472;C, C&#9472;Se, and C&#9472;oxime bonds. Notably, this reaction does not require the pre-installation of an oxygen atom in the substrate, as the carbonyl group is derived from atmospheric oxygen. Furthermore, late-stage modification establishes distally functionalized carbonyl compounds, which serve as versatile synthons for accessing valuable building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Developing the Tandem Structure to Regulate Interfacial Chemistry and Promote Ion Transport Kinetics Toward High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem separator (CYANO&#8208;COF|PP|SnF2) is designed to construct &#9472;CN&#9472;TM complexation and lithiophilic/electron&#8208;blocking interlayer for high voltage lithium metal batteries. The stable &#9472;CN&#8208;enriched CEI weakens the catalytic reaction of TM ions into the electrolyte. A hybrid SEI composed of Li&#8211;Sn alloy and LiF achieves dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition. With the synergistic effect of dual interfaces, the battery shows excellent cycle performance.








Abstract
The chemical properties of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) are crucial for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries, especially under extreme operating conditions. Herein, we propose a delicately designed tandem separator (CYANO&#8208;COF|PP|SnF2) to regulate the chemical stability&#160;of dual interfaces. The cyano group in CYANO&#8208;COF induces a stable CN&#8208;enriched CEI on the surface of high&#8208;nickel LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode through the adsorption/coordination effect with transition metals (TMs), inhibiting irreversible phase transitions, TMs dissolution, and other side reactions. Meanwhile, a straightforward in&#8208;situ conversion is used to construct an artificial hybrid SEI layer comprising LiF and Li&#8211;Sn alloy. As demonstrated theoretically and experimentally, the hybrid SEI with enhanced electron&#8208;blocking ability and rapid transmission characteristics can decrease the electron from the Li anode into the SEI and allow Li+ to rapidly diffuse through the SEI layer, achieving even dendrite&#8208;free lithium plating at the SEI/Li interface. With the synergistic effect of dual interfaces, the NCM811||Li battery maintains a capacity retention of 81.8% within 200 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and 55&#160;&#176;C. This work emphasizes the significance of regulating the chemical properties of double interfaces and provides new insights into the rational design for tandem separators.

         <title>Homochiral Helical Poly(thiophene)s Accessed via Living Catalyst&#8208;Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of helical conjugated poly(thiophene)s via living catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization. The polymers have narrow dispersities (&#272;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.10), can be accessed with controlled molecular weights (n&#160;=&#160;10&#8211;100), and are stable in acids, bases, and strong nucleophiles. We envision these polymers will be useful in biomimetic and organic electronic applications due to the degree of control over the polymer structure and stability.








Abstract
Synthetic helical polymers form compact, ordered, and inherently chiral structures, enabling their uses in biomimetic applications as well as catalysis. A challenge in using synthetic helical polymers, however, is their tendency to be sensitive to pH and the presence of nucleophiles, Lewis&#8208;acids, or metal ions. We report a strategy to overcome these shortcomings by adapting catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization, a living chain&#8208;growth polymerization typically used to access linear conjugated polymers, for the synthesis of helical poly(thiophene)s. We demonstrate that the helical poly(thiophene)s can be synthesized with a single helicity, incorporated into block copolymers, and functionalized at the chain&#8208;ends, enabling further conjugation and functionalization. The helical poly(thiophene)s are stable to a variety of conditions, providing benefits over other helical polymers which contain sensitive imine or carbonyl&#8208;based functional groups. We anticipate that the ability to access homochiral, heterotelechelic helical conjugated polymers and copolymers will enable new uses of these materials in optoelectronics as well as in applications for mimicking biomacromolecules and other polymers with precisely defined sequences.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Catalysis System Coupled with Redox Mediator Effect for Ultra&#8208;Long Cycle Life Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn(acac)3 with weak electrolyte properties had an ion&#8208;molecule coexistence state. The ionized Mn3+ is reduced and doped Li2O2 through in situ electrochemical implantation, altering its insulating properties. Mn(acac)3 molecule stabilized the intermediate LiO2 and facilitated its further disproportionation to Li2O2, as well as enhancing its decomposition, leading to an ultra&#8208;low overpotential and remarkable cycle stability for Li&#8208;O2 battery.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 batteries significantly limit their performance. To address this issue, the insulating characteristics of the discharge product Li2O2 and the reactivity of highly active superoxide species are examined. Herein, organic metal salts with weak electrolyte properties are utilized as bifunctional additives. The ionized metal ions can be reduced and doped Li2O2 through in situ electrochemical implantation, thereby altering its insulating properties. Additionally, organic metal salts function as redox mediators (RMs), stabilizing the intermediate LiO2 and facilitating its further disproportionation to Li2O2, as well as enhancing the decomposition reaction during charging, which are further proven by the in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy. Notably, Li&#8208;O2 batteries incorporating Mn(acac)3 demonstrate an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 0.43&#160;V and sustain 250 long cycles at 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, when combined with the optimized cathode, a remarkable cycle stability of 3850 cycles at 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 is achieved. These findings offer novel insights into the design of advanced Li&#8208;O2 battery systems and the enhancement of their performance.

         <title>Formulating Electrophilic Electrolyte for In Situ Stabilization of 4.8 V Li&#8208;Rich Batteries with 100% Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an electrophilic electrolyte engineering to extraordinarily stabilize the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces on both the cathode and anode. The core of this electrolyte strategy lies in stabilizing surface lattice oxygen through nucleophilic interactions between electrolyte additive and LLO cathode, ultimately boosting reversible anion redox and fast reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathodes are expected to overcome the energy density limitations, but their applicability is hindered by low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases with sluggish kinetics. Here an elaborate electrophilic electrolyte is proposed that effectively stabilizes the surface lattice oxygen of the LLO cathode, facilitates the formation of dense and fast&#8208;ion&#8208;transport electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases, and prevents Li&#8208;dendrites on the anode. The nucleophilic reaction mechanism driven by the electrolyte enables LLO to exhibit a reversible capacity of 310 mAh g&#8722;1 with a record ICE of 100%, as well as impressive 3C fast&#8208;charging stability, remarkably superior to that in the basic electrolyte. Using this engineered electrolyte, the assembled 4.5 Ah&#8208;class pouch cell of graphite||LLO displays high energy density and remarkable reversibility during cycling, demonstrating wide applicability. This work provides valuable insights and pragmatic strategies in electrolyte chemical engineering for advancing high&#8208;energy density and fast&#8208;charging batteries.

         <title>Unveil the Failure of Alkali Ion&#8208;Sulfur Aqueous Batteries: Resolving Water Migration by Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first reveal an overlooked issue of water migration in decoupled systems, which leads to sulfur species dissolution and thus irreversible sulfur redox reactions. By investigating the alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;driven water migration, the MPI of the electrolyte is proposed as a universal descriptor. In practice, an alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy is proven effective in resolving water migration and constructing stable alkali ion&#8208;SABs effectively.








Abstract
Sulfur aqueous battery (SAB) is promising owing to its high theoretical capacity and cost competitiveness. Although decoupled electrolyte design has successfully endowed transition metal ion&#8208;SABs with customizability to achieve high energy density, its effectiveness in alkali ion&#8208;SABs remains problematic. Here, we identify for the first time an intractable phenomenon of alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;driven water migration between decoupled electrolytes through ex situ NMR, which is recognized as the origin of the irreversible sulfur redox reactions. To address the challenge, we propose an alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy to effectively regulate water migration by incorporating low molecular polarity index (MPI) anions. In situ Raman, synchrotron spectroscopy, and molecule dynamic simulations reveal that the repulsion of low MPI anions to water effectively disrupts the hydration patterns around the alkali cations, and thereby minimizes the concomitant water migration. The elaborated Na+&#8208;SAB achieved an ultrahigh capacity of 1634&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (97.7% sulfur utilization) and prolonged stability over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the versatility of the alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy is further substantiated in Li+&#8208;SAB and K+&#8208;SAB batteries, boosting the scope of the following SAB systems.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Shelled Hollow Covalent Organic Framework Nanospheres for Stable Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;free synthesis of MH&#8208;COFs is reported. Treating the designed crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneous covalent organic polymer nanospheres (COPs) with acetic acid solution produces hollow COFs. Subsequent expansion through seeded growth and acid treatment yields MH&#8208;COFs, whose applied implication is demonstrated by an MH&#8208;COFs/S composite as stable high&#8208;capacity K&#8208;ion battery anodes. 








Abstract
Multi&#8208;shelled hollow covalent organic framework nanospheres (MH&#8208;COFs) with at least two shells integrate the merits of the porous crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) matrix with the complex hollow architecture, which can motivate new functions for exceptional performance. However, the fabrication of MH&#8208;COFs is still uncultivated and remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we reported a facile template&#8208;free protocol for the general synthesis of different MH&#8208;COFs by controlling the simultaneous processes of surface crystallization and core etching of the crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity nanospheres of COFs precursor. The crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity solid covalent organic polymer nanospheres (COPs) with robust crystalline surface but vulnerable amorphous core were designed. Subsequently, an acetic acid aqueous solution treatment of crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity COPs not only induced selective etching of the vulnerable cores but also promote the further crystallization of the surface layers, thereby producing hollow COFs. A further step&#8208;by&#8208;step expansion of seeded growth for inhomogeneous COP layers and then similar acid solution treatment can output the intriguing MH&#8208;COFs. An extraordinarily stable K&#8208;ion battery anode with high capacity was demonstrated with a MH&#8208;COFs/S nanocomposite fabricated by covalently bonding chain sulfur into the MH&#8208;COFs matrix. This work opened a simple but powerful avenue in designing complex hollow COFs architectures to boost their potential for applications.

         <title>Surface Nonbonding Oxygen State Regulation for Reversible Anionic Redox Chemistry in Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activated by the Li&#8208;O&#8208;Li configuration with nonbonding O2p state (lO2p), anionic redox reaction (ARR) in Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) contributes to additional capacity but exhibits significant irreversibility, leading to severe surface oxygen loss. Herein, surface nonbonding oxygen state (SNBOS) is regulated by the integrated surface structure engineering to suppress surface oxygen loss and enhance the reversibility of ARR. On the outermost layer, the conversion of layered structure into a LiLaO2 layer and spinel phase structure eliminates lO2p, thereby preventing the activation of ARR and suppressing side reaction between electrolyte and oxidized oxygen ions. Besides, by introducing 5d metal La on the near surface, the energy of lO2p is decreased corresponding to the increased charge&#8208;transfer gap &#916; and the d&#8208;d coulomb repulsion term U is reduced, making U/2 decrease close to &#916; and enhancing ARR reversibility. Furthermore, it&#8217;s demonstrated that the oxidized oxygen of the modified sample cannot become O2 gas and escape, but rather exists more in the form of high&#8208;valance oxygen dimer anions O_2^(n&#8208;), reducing the reaction depth of surface ARR and inhibiting oxygen loss. Therefore, the designed material demonstrates outstanding cycling stability and kinetics performance.</dc:description>

         <title>High Entropy Boosts the Low Temperature Na+&#8208;Storage Performance of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, spherical high entropy (HE) Na4Fe2.95(MgCaAlCrMn)0.01(PO4)2P2O7 (HE&#8208;NFPP) cathode materials have been produced by utilizing a spray&#8208;drying combined with solid&#8208;state reaction method. The transition metals (TMs) co&#8208;doping in NFPP through HE strategy can effectively mitigate the volume change and improve its electronic conductivity by reducing the bandgap between the conduction and valence bands. While, the 3D network Na+ ions diffusion channels formed in NFPP by TM ions co&#8208;doping through HE strategy facilitate the Na+ ions diffusion, leading to an enhanced electrode reaction kinetics at low temperatures. 








Abstract
Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP) is considered a promising cathode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the inferior electronic conductivity and inadequate Na+ ions diffusion kinetics of NFPP at low temperatures hinder its practical applications. In this study, high entropy Na4Fe2.95(MgCaAlCrMn)0.01(PO4)2P2O7 (HE&#8208;NFPP) has been synthesized via a spray&#8208;drying and high temperature sintering technique. The incorporation of transition metal (TMs) ions into NFPP through HE strategy facilitates electron transportation by reducing the bandgap between the conduction and valence bands. Meanwhile, the 3D network Na+ ions diffusion channels formed in HE&#8208;NFPP can effectively improve the Na+ ions diffusion efficiency, resulting in enhanced electrode reaction kinetics at low temperatures. Moreover, it leads to a significantly mitigated volume expansion/contraction in HE&#8208;NFPP caused by Na+ ions extraction/insertion during (de)sodiation process. Consequently, the fabricated HE&#8208;NFPP exhibits an excellent rate and cyclic performance at low temperatures.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of S(IV)&#8208;Stereogenic Sulfinimidate Esters&#160;by Sulfinamide Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208;controlled approaches for the synthesis of S&#8208;stereogenic compounds have propelled significant advancements in asymmetric synthetic chemistry. In contrast, control over S&#8208;heteroatom (e.g. O) bond formation to access sulfinimidate esters remains an underexplored area. Drawing inspiration from recent progress in electrophilic amide activation, herein, we present a sulfinamide activation strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of S&#8208;chiral sulfinimidate esters. This method involves the activation of racemic sulfinamides by sulfonyl chloride, yielding a reactive aza&#8208;sulfinyl mixed anhydride intermediate. Employing a naturally occurring cinchonidine catalyst, the process achieves excellent enantiocontrol in the subsequent formation of S&#8208;O bonds with alcohols involving a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process, resulting in sulfinimidate esters with excellent enantioselectivity. The catalytically obtained enantioenriched sulfinimidate esters offer a versatile platform for the construction of S&#8208;stereogenic frameworks, including sulfilimines and sulfoximines, with promising applications in asymmetric synthesis and drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetrical Triatomic Sites with Long&#8208;Range Electron Coupling for Ultra&#8208;durable and Extreme&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reversable zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) is a promising alternative for sustainable fuel cell, but the performance is impeded by the sluggish oxygen redox kinetics owing to the suboptimal adsorption and desorption of oxygen intermediates. Here, hetero&#8208;TACs uniquely incorporate an electron regulatory role beyond the primary and secondary active sites found in dual&#8208;atom catalysts. In&#8208;situ XAFS and Raman spectroscopy elucidate Fe in FCN&#8208;TM/NC functions as the main active site, leveraging long&#8208;range electron coupling from neighbouring Co and Ni to boost catalytic efficiency. The ZAB equipped with FCN&#8208;TM/NC exhibits ultra&#8208;stable rechargeability (over 5500 h at 1 mA cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;60 &#176;C). The in&#8208;depth theoretical and experimental investigations attribute such superior catalytic activity to the asymmetric FeN4 configuration, long&#8208;distance electron coupling, modulated local microenvironment, optimized d orbital energy levels, and lower energy barrier for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. This work provides a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the structure&#8208;reactivity relationship in TACs for energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Programmable Matteson&#8208;Type Annulation: Construction of Spirocycles from Simple Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the recent advancement, Matteson&#8208;type reactions are almost exclusively used to construct linear molecules. Herein we report an iterative boron&#8208;homologation approach to construct various carbocycles from a single precursor. This method utilizes an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) as a handle to enable intramolecular Matteson&#8208;type couplings, leading to diastereoselective and enantioselective ring formation. An intriguing role of the Lewis acid additive is identified. This approach proves to be general for preparing carbocycles with different ring sizes and multiple stereocenters. The annulation processes are also scalable, and the products can undergo various transformations to provide synthetically valuable structural motifs. In addition, this method can be extended to the preparation of diverse hard&#8208;to&#8208;make spirocyclic compounds from simple cyclic ketones. Moreover, an iterative approach to synthesize double spirocycles is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Allenylidene Phosphonium Ion: An Isoelectronic Phosphorus Analogue of [3]Cumulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we disclose the synthesis, characterization and bonding analysis of a crystalline allenylidene phosphonium ion ([R2P=C=C=CAr2]+) [2]+ (R = 1,3&#8208;diisopropylphenylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino, CAr2 = 9&#8208;fluorenylidene), an isolobal analogue of [3]cumulenes. The cation was prepared via methoxide ion abstraction of an alkynyl phosphine 1. Electron rich N&#8208;heterocylic imine substituents and a pi&#8208;conjugated fluorenyl scaffold together stabilize the resulting three&#8208;coordinate phosphonium center of [2]+. [2]+ features a trigonal planar phosphorus atom which is electrophilic, as evidenced experimentally by the preparation of a Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct with 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine, and fluoride ion affinity calculations. Crystallographic and computational investigations of [2]+ support a structure with considerable P=C double bond character. Furthermore, this P=C double bond participates in a thermally reversible intramolecular dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition with an arene moiety of one of its supporting 1,3&#8208;diisopropylphenylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino substituents to give a tetracyclic isomer [2cyclo]+. The isolation of a free [R2P=C=C=CAr2]+ draws further parallels between the properties and reactivity of low&#8208;coordinate phosphorus compounds and related carbon compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>p&#8208;Type TiO2 Nanotubes: Quantum Confinement and Pt Single Atom Decoration Enable High Selectivity Photocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesize p&#8208;type TiO2 nanotubes that allow band&#8208;gap adjustment by quantum confinement. These tubes therefore enable reductive photocatalytic reactions that are not thermodynamically possible on classic titania photocatalysts. Here we demonstrate the direct photocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia without any need of hole scavengers. The quantum confinement effect (and thus the thermodynamic driving force) can be controlled by the thickness of the nanotube walls. Notably, the use of Pt single atoms as co&#8208;catalysts decorated on the TiO2 nanotubes additionally offers a superior ammonia production and a remarkable enhanced selectivity compared to Pt nanoparticles. Overall, the work not only highlights the potential of size&#8208;controlled modifications of electronic properties in extending the utility of a most classical photocatalyst but also exemplifies its use in technologically relevant reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Assembly of Homo&#8208; and Heterotypic Ubiquitin Chains from Functionalized, Expressed Monomers via Thiol&#8208;Ene Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature constructs ubiquitin tags with high spatiotemporal precision to execute defined functions which critically rely on the exact molecular composition of the ubiquitin chain. Deciphering the complex ubiquitin code is of paramount interest in biology and requires flexible access to homogeneous ubiquitin tags. As enzymatic approaches suffer from inherent drawbacks such as hardly controllable chain length or connectivity and substrate&#8208;specificity, we apply a combination of expression and chemical tools to assemble ubiquitin chains. &#8232;Our strategy includes expression of ubiquitin&#8208;intein fusion constructs to obtain large quantities of defined ubiquitin monomers with C&#8208;terminal modifications such as hydrazides and propargylamides. Linkages between ubiquitins are generated via photoinitiated thiol&#8208;ene click (TEC) chemistry resulting in a nearly native isopeptide bond. We demonstrate the generation of homo&#8208; and heterotypic ubiquitin oligomers with K27, 29, 48 and 63 linkages up to a K48&#8208;linked tetramer. The presented toolbox allows selective installation of ubiquitin on target peptides and proteins with reactive cysteine residues as demonstrated for segments of the microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau. Such segments can be implemented into protein semi&#8208;syntheses as shown here for ubiquitylated full&#8208;length Tau4. The presented work combines minimal synthetic effort with high fidelity linkage chemistry paving the way towards homogeneously ubiquitylated proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Disentangling Radiative and Non&#8208;Radiative Deactivation Pathways in CuI &#8208;Based TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature dependence of individual non&#8208;radiative decay rates of the lowest singlet and triplet states has been determined in a series of Cu(I) thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds. Such temperature dependence is usually neglected, which is shown here to lead to significant errors in the determination of the singlet&#8208;triplet splittings.








Abstract
The analysis of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters traditionally neglects the temperature dependence of the non&#8208;radiative singlet and triplet decay rates, which, for systems with quantum yields significantly departing from unity, unavoidably leads to inaccurate determination of the relevant photophysical parameters. Here we address this issue by performing a detailed photophysical study in three solid&#8208;state CuI complexes with the general formula [Cu(dmp)(PPh3)X] (X = Cl, Br, I). Decomposition of the measured temperature&#8208;dependent lifetimes &#964;(T) into their radiative and non&#8208;radiative contributions demonstrates a significant temperature dependence of the non&#8208;radiative rates, which leads to large deviations of the singlet&#8208;triplet gaps &#916;EST from those determined in the traditional way. Our detailed analysis further confirms that non&#8208;radiative parameters follow the energy gap law and that zero field splitting effects, which are unrecognizable in the bare &#964;(T) data, are governed by the heavy atom effect. Our analysis is supported by measurements of the decay of the prompt fluorescence which is dominated by kISC in the studied compounds.

&lt;p&gt;The analysis of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters traditionally neglects the temperature dependence of the non-radiative singlet and triplet decay rates, which, for systems with quantum yields significantly departing from unity, unavoidably leads to inaccurate determination of the relevant photophysical parameters. Here we address this issue by performing a detailed photophysical study in three solid-state Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with the general formula [Cu(dmp)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)X] (X = Cl, Br, I). Decomposition of the measured temperature-dependent lifetimes &#964;(&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;) into their radiative and non-radiative contributions demonstrates a significant temperature dependence of the non-radiative rates, which leads to large deviations of the singlet-triplet gaps &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Engineering Solvent&#8208;Coordinated Heterometallic&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Wide&#8208;Range Tuning of Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence toward Time&#8208;Resolved Anticounterfeiting</title>

         <dc:description>
The coordination solvent and second metal ion costrategy is firstly proposed to synthesize seven robust heterometallic&#8211;organic frameworks (HMOFs, ZnAe&#8208;sol) with ultralong room temperature phosphorescence. Theoretical calculations confirm this strategy can effectively regulate the excited state lifetime of ZnAe&#8208;sol. Based on the diverse afterglow times, the ZnAe&#8208;sol have been used for information encryption and anticounterfeit.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proven promising ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials for anticounterfeit due to their unique optical properties. However, it remains a major challenge to achieve the desired phosphorescent properties due to the limited regulatory methods and indistinct mechanism. Herein, the coordination solvent and second metal ion costrategy is firstly proposed to prepare seven robust heterometallic&#8211;organic frameworks (HMOFs) with two configurations, ZnMg/Ca&#8208;sol [sol&#160;=&#160;H2O, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), and formyldiethylamine (DEF)] and ZnSr/Ba&#8208;H2O, exhibiting different ultralong RTP. The tunable phosphorescence lifetimes within 14.5&#8211;195.4&#160;ms are achieved gradually by altering the type of alkaline earth metals, coordination solvent, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding in the HMOFs. Significantly, the theoretical calculations reveal that the promotion of spin&#8211;orbit coupling by heavy metals and the rigid constraint on the skeleton by solvent result in excellent balance between high phosphorescence quantum yield (&#1060;P) and long lifetime, especially for ZnSr&#8208;H2O (6.8%, 195.4&#160;ms). Depending on the wide&#8208;range tuning of ultralong RTP and great stability, the HMOFs are successfully applied in spatial&#8208;time resolved anticounterfeiting and multilevel information encryption. This work may provide a new approach to designing target phosphorescent materials while resolving the contradiction between high &#1060;P and long lifetime.

         <title>Yb3+&#8208;Induced Bright Ligand Up&#8208;Conversion Luminescence in 1D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Doping Yb3&#8314; ions into Ln coordination polymers (Ln&#8208;CPs) with the formula [Y2(FCA)6]n (FCA = 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) has led to the preparation of 1D chain Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2&#8208;2xYb2x(FCA)6]n. Up&#8208;conversion luminescence (UCL) of the ligand is visibly observed in [Y0.6Yb1.4(FCA)6]n, with an absolute up&#8208;conversion quantum yield (UCQY) of 0.003&#160;%.








Abstract
Ln3+&#8208;induced ligand up&#8208;conversion luminescence (UCL) in coordination polymers (CPs) effectively overcomes the inherent limitations of conventional organic UCL mechanisms. However, current research on UCL in Ln&#8208;CPs has predominantly focused on the UCL of Ln3&#8314; ions themselves, while investigations into Ln3&#8314;&#8208;induced ligand UCL is overlooked in Ln&#8208;CPs. Herein, by doping Yb3&#8314; into the Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2(FCA)6]n 1) (FCA&#160;=&#160;9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid), Yb3+&#8208;doped 1D chain Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2&#8208;2xYb2x(FCA)6]n (x&#160;=&#160;0.2, 2) x&#160;=&#160;0.5, 3) x&#160;=&#160;0.7, 4) x&#160;=&#160;0.9, 5) x&#160;=&#160;1, 6) are prepared. Investigation of the UCL of FCA in these CPs reveals that Ln3&#8314;&#8208;induced ligand UCL are achieved for the first time. Notably, 4 not only displays bright UCL under both 10 and 15&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 excitation power of 980&#160;nm laser but also achieves an absolute UCQY of 0.003&#160;%, opening new avenues for the development of Ln&#8208;CPs as UCL materials.

         <title>Tailoring the Surface Curvature of the Supporting Carbon to Tune the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Zinc&#8208;Urea&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The strain&#8208;induced change in the charge redistribution and binding strength of *O2&#8722;, *OOH and *OH of Fe SA/NhcC contributes to the enhanced catalytic ORR/UOR activity. Due to a lower equilibrium potential for the UOR and the superior catalytic activity of Fe SA/NhcC, the zinc&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery delivers a low charge voltage, high energy efficiency and long lifespan compared to conventional Zn&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
The catalytic activities of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are associated with the varying atomic interactions through its characteristic coordination geometry. Yet, modulation of the surface curvature of carbon acting as a supporting body has not been investigated. Herein, we report the superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and enhanced performance for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) of single Fe atoms anchored on a highly curved N&#8208;doped carbon dodecahedron with concave morphology (Fe SA/NhcC). Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopy disclose that the curvature of the carbon support helps to shorten the bond length of Fe&#8722;N, spatially redistributing the charges around the Fe and thereby lowering the d&#8208;band center toward optimal adsorption for oxygenated species. The Fe SA/NhcC catalyst displays an ultrahigh half&#8208;wave potential of 0.926&#8197;V for ORR and a small potential difference of 0.686&#8197;V for bifunctional ORR/UOR. A rechargeable Zn&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery with the Fe SA/NhcC cathode displays robust discharge durability, excellent cycling lifespan and higher energy efficiency compared to conventional Zn&#8208;air batteries. This work provides new insight into promoting the catalytic activity of SACs through varying the surface curvature of the supporting carbon, tailoring geometric configuration and electronic states of SACs.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene vs. Thiophene &#8211; Chiral Adsorption and Unidirectional Rotation on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single NHC molecules carrying a thiophene (NHCiPr&#8722;T) and a bromo (NHCiPr&#8722;Br) substituent are investigated by STM on the Au(111) surface. Both derivatives adsorb flat on the surface and are bound to a gold adatom via the carbene. NHCiPr&#8722;T is anchored to Au(111) via the sulfur atom, thus allowing unidirectional rotation by voltage pulses with the STM tip. In comparison, NHCiPr&#8722;Br shows lateral displacement by voltage pulses.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes are highly effective ligands for anchoring functional organic molecules to metal surfaces and nanoparticles, facilitating the formation of self&#8208;assembled monolayers. However, their adsorption on surface is difficult to predict and control, and there is an ongoing debate on the geometry of NHC derivatives on gold surfaces and on the role of gold adatoms. We present two single molecules based on a benzimidazole NHC, one equipped with a thiophene substituent, and the other ending with a Br atom. By low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy we show that both molecules adsorb planar on Au(111) and are chiral on the surface. Our results indicate that in both cases a complex between NHC and a gold adatom is formed. Upon voltage pulses with the STM tip, both complexes move excited by inelastic tunneling electrons. For the derivative with thiophene, we observe a stepwise 60&#176; unidirectional rotation around the S atom. The direction of rotation is determined by both the chirality and the position of the applied pulse. On the contrary, the NHC derivative without thiophene moves laterally on the surface. Adsorption, binding to gold atoms, and motion are discussed with the support of density functional theory calculations and image simulations.

         <title>Selective Masking of Active Sites in Zinc Metal via Galvanic Replacement Reaction for Highly Reversible Ah&#8208;Level Zinc&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin, hydrophobic copper phosphate (CP) membrane passivates Zn anodes via galvanic replacement, selectively masking active Zn sites to curtail corrosion and dendrite growth. Achieving &gt;11000 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a 1.2&#8209;Ah Zn||I2 pouch cell, this approach promises high&#8209;energy, long&#8209;life aqueous Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Zinc metal anodes suffer from severe dendrite formation and corrosion due to active Zn sites. Here, an ultrathin, hydrophobic copper phosphate (CP) membrane is introduced that selectively masks active Zn sites with electrochemically inactive copper through a galvanic replacement reaction (Zn0 + Cu2+&#160;=&#160;Cu0 + Zn2+). Copper is deliberately chosen for its higher redox potential (Cu2+/Cu0; +0.34&#160;V vs SHE), which effectively inhibits both the corrosion reaction (H+/H2; 0&#160;V vs SHE) and dendrite formation (Zn2+/Zn0; &#8722;0.76&#160;V vs SHE). In this way, the CP layer masks protrusions and grain boundaries on the zinc anode surface with inactive copper, blocking corrosion and dendritic growth, while its hydrophobic top layer reduces water activity at the interface. Benefiting from the deactivated anode surface, the resulting CP/Zn anode demonstrates exceptional stability, sustaining over 11,000 plating/stripping cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98&#160;%. Moreover, a CP/Zn||I2 full cell with an N/P ratio of 1.85 achieves an energy density of 187&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1electrodes, while a 1.2&#8208;Ah pouch cell validates its practical feasibility. This work highlights the importance of designing suitable surface chemistry to protect the Zn metal anode and indicates promising applications in other metal anodes.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Coupled NIR Organic Hybrid Solar Cells Achieving an 84.2% Fill Factor and a 25.2% Efficiency: A Comprehensive Mechanistic Exploration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we eliminate the need for p&#8208;type polymers and achieve a remarkably higher FF (exceeding 84%), thanks to the excellent compatibility between our new NIR dye and PCBM, which enables ultrafast charge separation for the first time.








Abstract
The integration of organic dyes in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to utilize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons remains a challenge. In this study, a selenium&#8208;incorporated ortho&#8208;benzodipyrrole&#8208;based NIR dye CB&#8208;2Se was developed. CB&#8208;2Se, featuring a lower bandgap of 1.35&#160;eV, was blended with PCBM to form a bulk&#8208;heterojunction layer in PSCs for electron extraction and transport. Compared to Y6&#8208;16 acceptor, the removal of the Tz unit in CB&#8208;2Se suppresses self&#8208;aggregation, improving its compatibility with PCBM. A CB&#8208;2Se:PCBM&#8208;incorporated PSC achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.18% with a VOC of 1.164&#160;V, a JSC of 25.71&#160;mA/cm2, a Fill Factor of 84.15%, outperforming that of the PCBM&#8208;only reference device (24.35%) and the PCBM:Y6&#8208;16&#8208;based device (24.49%). The PCBM:CB&#8208;2Se layer enhanced the long&#8208;term stability of PSCs, retaining 88% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h under ambient air and thermal conditions. The photophysical interactions between NIR dyes and PSCs have been comprehensively investigated by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Ultrafast exciton separation into free charges occurs within 200 femtoseconds at the interfaces between PCBM and CB&#8208;2Se. For the first time, a transfer of holes from CB&#8208;2Se back to the perovskite was detected, providing valuable insights into the charge dynamics of PSCs utilizing NIR dyes.

         <title>Assembly of Functionalized Organic Fragments via Reductive Activation and (Cross)&#8208;Coupling of C2H4, CO, CO2 and/or H2 Using a Magnesium&#8208;Dinitrogen Complex</title>

A dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of N2 acts as a &#8220;masked&#8221; source of a dimagnesium(I) diradical in formal reductive coupling and cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving various combinations of the simple gaseous small molecules, C2H4, CO, CO2, and H2. A range of more complex &#8220;value&#8208;added&#8221; organic fragments have been accessed from these processes.








Abstract
Reactions of 1,2&#8208;dimagnesioethane compound [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C2H4)] (TCHPNON = 4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene), formed by the two&#8208;electron reduction of ethene with a dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of reduced N2, viz. [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)], with CO and CO2 have been explored. In the case of the reaction with CO, cross&#8208;coupling of the reduced ethene fragment with two molecules of CO gave a heterobimetallic complex of the parent cyclobutenediolate dianion, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O2C4H4)], which when exposed to THF gave adduct [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O2C4H4)(THF)]. Treating [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C2H4)] with CO2 led to the insertion of CO2 into both Mg&#9472;C bonds and all Mg&#9472;N bonds, yielding a magnesium succinate complex, [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C4H4)], in which the diamide ligands have been converted to xanthene bridged dicarbamates. The reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] with CO2, proceeded via reductive coupling of the heterocumulene to give the oxalate dianion, in addition to the insertion of CO2 into all Mg&#9472;N bonds of the magnesium&#8208;dinitrogen complex, forming dimeric [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C2)]2. When treated with THF this yields monomeric [{K(THF)(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg(THF)}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C2)]. Related chemistry results from the reaction of a dianionic magnesium(I) compound with CO2. In contrast, C&#9472;C bond formation was not observed in the reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] with a CO2 analog, i.e., the carbodiimide CyNCNCy (Cy = cyclohexyl). Instead, H abstraction by a proposed radical intermediate gave polymeric formamidinate complex [K(TCHPNON)Mg{(CyN)2CH}]&#8734;. Reaction of CO2 with the magnesium hydride complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;H)}2] gave the unusual trimeric magnesium formate complex [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;CO2)Mg}(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)]3 in which CO2 has inserted into only one Mg&#9472;N bond of each TCHPNON ligand. This study highlights the capacity of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductive coupling or cross&#8208;coupling of the simple gaseous reagents, C2H4, CO, CO2 and H2, to give value&#8208;added organic fragments.

         <title>Polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) for Next Generation Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant piperidinium structures are effectively designed and synthesized, laying the foundation for the development of next&#8208;generation AEMs for applications in highly stable AEM&#8208;WEs.








Abstract
Terawatt&#8208;scale hydrogen production using anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs) requires the development of facilely prepared, alkali&#8208;stable, and high&#8208;performance anion exchange membranes (AEMs). State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyarylpiperidinium AEMs fail to match the alkaline stability of piperidinium due to conformational deformation caused by the stiff cardo structure. Herein, polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant structure is constructed by utilizing 4&#8208;formylpiperidine as a functional monomer. The inclusion of an aldehyde group in the synthesis enhances polymerization reactivity, reduces the amount of superacid required, and ensures that the piperidinium is suspended from the ether&#8208;free polymer backbone. The accelerated aging analysis demonstrates that the pendant structure of piperidinium effectively suppresses the Hofmann elimination, resulting in PAMP AEM with exceptional alkali stability, surpassing that of the commercial PiperION&#8208;A40. Most importantly, when assembled with non&#8208;noble metal OER/HER catalysts, the related AEM&#8208;WE achieves a remarkably high transient current density of 7.35 A cm&#8722;2 (@2&#160;V, 80&#160;&#176;C, 1&#160;m KOH). Moreover, the AEM&#8208;WE can operate stably at industrial current density over 1500&#160;h (&#8776;1.70&#160;V at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Concurrent Folding and Fluorescent Functionalization of Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles via Heterogeneous Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous photochemistry achieves single&#8208;chain polymer folding alongside concurrent fluorescent functionalization. Amphiphilic heterograft random copolymers pre&#8208;fold into hetero&#8208;aggregates, creating distinct domains that enable two concurrent photochemical processes: intrachain crosslinking via photodimerization in aggregated domains, and fluorescent functionalization via photocyclization to form a green fluorophore in dispersed regions.








Abstract
The controlled folding of synthetic polymers, mimicking the complex behaviors of biomacromolecules, offers the potential to create sophisticated nanostructures with diverse functionalities. Of great significance is the integration of functionalization directly with chain folding, especially through the incorporation of artificial elements not found in nature, which allows unprecedented flexibility in materials design. However, this approach faces significant synthetic challenges, owing to the intricate integration of multiple chemical processes within a single chain. Here, a heterogeneous photochemistry strategy is presented to achieve single&#8208;chain polymer folding alongside concurrent fluorescent functionalization, inspired by the stepwise folding mechanism of green fluorescent protein. This method involves pre&#8208;folding amphiphilic heterograft random copolymers in water, which facilitates heterogeneous aggregation into distinct domains within single&#8208;particle nanostructures, including closely aggregated and molecularly dispersed regions. By employing spatial organization&#8208;dependent photochemical reactivity of cyanostilbene moieties, two concurrent processes are enabled: intrachain crosslinking via photodimerization in aggregated domains and fluorescent functionalization via photocyclization to form a green fluorophore in dispersed regions. Additionally, the incorporation of fluorescent dyes via intrachain excitation energy transfer allows for the modulation of emission properties, extending from green to red, and even including white light, making them promising candidates for bioimaging and related applications.

         <title>&#8220;Naked Nickel&#8221;&#8208;Catalyzed Heteroaryl&#8211;Heteroaryl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that an air&#8208;stable &#8220;naked nickel&#8221;, Ni(4&#8208;CF3stb)3, can efficiently catalyze heteroaryl&#8211;heteroaryl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (SMC) reactions in the absence of exogenous ligands. This protocol permits the construction of &gt;15 different heterobiaryls containing multiple Lewis basic heteroatoms from a broad set of 6&#8208;membered heteroaryl bromides with 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered heterocyclic B&#8208;nucleophiles. 








Abstract
In this article, we report that the air&#8208;stable &#8220;naked nickel&#8221;, [Ni(4&#8208;CF3stb)3], is a competent catalyst in the catalytic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction (SMC) between heteroaryl bromides and heteroaromatic boron&#8208;based nucleophiles. The catalytic system is characterized by its ability to avoid decomposition or deactivation in the presence of multiple Lewis basic sites. The protocol permits the formation of C&#8210;C bonds between two heteroaryl moieties in the absence of complex exogenous ligands, thus minimizing screening procedures and simplifying reaction setups. This method accommodates combinations of distinct 6&#8208;membered heteroaryl bromides and 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered heterocyclic B&#8208;based nucleophiles.

         <title>Uniform Ion Flow Effect of Dynamic Electrostatic Shielding Layer for Facilitating Homogeneous Nucleation and Deposition on Aluminum Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study optimizes the Al anode/electrolyte interface by incorporating anionic surfactants (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate) to achieve stable Al anode. The alkyl chains preferentially adsorb on Al surface, forming dense adsorption layer that mitigates corrosion from the electrolyte. Additionally, &#9472;SO3 and phenyl rings provide electrostatic shielding layer with moderately electronegative that regulates ion migration. The uniform ion flow effect facilitates the uniform nucleation and deposition of Al, suppressing dendritic growth and tip effects, thereby enhancing the cycling stability and lifespan of the rechargeable aluminum battery.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) present considerable potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, particularly within power stations. Nonetheless, their operational lifespan and commercialization are hindered by issues like Al anode dendrite formation and electrolyte corrosion. To address the aforementioned issues, a stabilizer has been proposed to enhance the electrolyte/anode interface. Experimental and computational simulation results indicate that the surface tension of the SDBS alkyl chain facilitates its preferential adsorption onto the electrode surface, thereby establishing a protective layer that mitigates the corrosion of the chloroaluminate ionic liquid (ILs). Additionally, the suitable electronegativity of the phenyl&#8208;SO3 group generates an electrostatic shielding effect that not only dynamically regulates ion flow but also equilibrates the nucleation and deposition velocity, ultimately promoting the stable planar Al deposition. Consequently, the SDBS&#8208;modified Al//Al symmetric battery demonstrates stable cycling for 500 and 1000&#160;h under high current density (5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and large area capacity (5&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), respectively. The Al//flake graphite full battery achieves reversible capacity of 90.01&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, significantly improving capacity retention. This study also further explores the effect of additive functional groups and ions on Al anodes, offering insights for the rational design of RABs electrolytes.

         <title>Combining Two Mechanistically Distinct Reactions from a Single Iron Complex: A Tandem Approach to Thermally Stable and Recyclable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;based catalytic system can act as an efficient and selective tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s, followed by the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide, providing direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. The study emphasizes the potential for chemical recycling, making these materials environmentally friendly and suitable for various applications.








Abstract
A shift from petrochemical feedstocks to renewable resources has the potential to address some of the environmental concerns associated with petrochemical extraction, thereby making the production of plastics a sustainable process. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of selective techniques for the conversion of abundant renewable feedstocks into environmentally friendly polymers. We present a one&#8208;pot iron&#8208;based catalytic system, which is active, efficient, and selective under mild conditions for producing of renewable copolymers. We demonstrate that this system can function as a tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s (PSEs), followed by the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide. This effective approach provides direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. Furthermore, we detail the quantitative chemical recycling of such copolymers, underscoring their potential as new environmentally friendly materials.

This effective approach provides direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. Furthermore, we detail the quantitative chemical recycling of such copolymers, underscoring their potential as new environmentally friendly materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>La3ZrGa5O14: Band&#8208;Inversion Strategy in Topology&#8208;Protected Octahedron for Large Nonlinear Response and Wide Bandgap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy involving electron band inversion to enhance the SHG response of LGS while preserving its advantageous wide bandgap. The highly symmetrical ZrO6 structure in the LGZr framework effectively mitigates the bandgap reduction typically associated with cation energy level splitting. This distinctive electronic structure of the Zr4+ facilitates a promising pathway to enhance the SHG response without compromising its essential bandgap characteristics. LGZr crystal exhibits an impressive bandgap of 5.16&#160;eV, a high LDT, a large SHG response, and an extended infrared absorption edge. Our innovative band&#8208;inversion approach not only elucidates the underlying mechanisms but also paves the way for designing new IR NLO crystals.








Abstract
The contradictory relationship between band gaps and the second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response constitutes a formidable challenge in the rational design of infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. In oxide&#8208;based crystals, the incorporation of strongly distorted octahedra containing d&#176; cations as central elements are a common approach to enhance SHG responses, while inadvertently leading to a significant decrease in band gaps due to the unfavorable energy level splitting. In this study, an innovative &#8220;4d/5s electron band&#8208;inversion&#8221; strategy is introduced to enhance SHG response while preserving a wide band gap within the octahedron&#8208;symmetry&#8208;protected langasite structure. A novel high&#8208;performance IR NLO crystal, La3ZrGa5O14 (LGZr) is successfully synthesized, where the unoccupied 4d orbitals of the Zr4+ cation underwent a transition from the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band, and the ZrO6 octahedra exhibited minimal distortion. Consequently, LGZr exhibited the largest SHG response observed to date (reaching up to 2.4 &#215; La3Nb0.5Ga5.5O14) and the broadest band gap (5.16&#160;eV) within the langasite family. Furthermore, LGZr is revealed with a remarkable laser damage threshold (1.66&#160;GW/&#8764;cm2) and broad IR transmission capabilities (&#8764;7.8&#160;&#181;m) and supported the growth of centimeter&#8208;sized single crystal. The &#8220;band&#8208;inversion strategy&#8221; offers significant advantages to realize high&#8208;performance IR NLO crystals.

The highly stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation has been achieved via synergistic combinations of reagent modulation, remote participation, and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects. A variety of &#945;&#8208;xylosides motifs have been effectively prepared by this 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation protocol, including hemicellulose xyloglucan, xyloglucosyl trisaccharide motif from mammalian cells, core M3 matriglycan motif, and even &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;xylosides up to 12&#8208;mer.








Abstract
Stereoselective constructions of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic bonds are long&#8208;standing challenges in chemical synthesis. In particular, achieving highly stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation remains a difficult task in carbohydrates chemistry. Here, we report that highly stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation could be achieved via synergistic combinations of reagent modulation, remote participation, and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects. A variety of &#945;&#8208;xylosides motifs have been effectively prepared by this 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation protocol, including hemicellulose xyloglucan, xyloglucosyl trisaccharide motif from mammalian cells, core M3 matriglycan motif, and even &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;xylosides up to 12&#8208;mer. Furthermore, DFT calculations provided the origins of this stereoselective and synergistic 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation through SN1 and SN2 pathways.

         <title>Atropisomerism in Triarylboranes: Lewis Base Assisted Rotation at C&#8722;B Stereogenic Axis in Asymmetrical Boron Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From decades to minutes: regulation of the rotation speed at the C&#8722;B chirality axis by peri&#8208;substituents and Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions in unprecedented triarylboranes with a C&#8722;B stereogenic axis enabled to reach atropostable and enantiopure triarylboranes.







Abstract
The synthesis, properties and structural requirements for atropisomerism at the C&#8722;B bond in boron Lewis acids such as triarylboranes have been understudied so far. We report the first series of atropisomeric triarylboranes constituted of a naphthyl rotor and a dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;bora&#8208;anthracenyl stator subunits, connected by a C&#8722;B stereogenic axis. Through systematic crystallographic, kinetic, photophysical and quantum chemical studies, the mechanisms, rates and barriers of diastereomerization and enantiomerization were determined. The orthogonal arrangement between the naphthyl and the dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;bora&#8208;anthracenyl scaffold moiety hamper the rotation of these two moieties around their Csp2&#8722;B bonds, enabling chiral resolution leading to enantiopure triarylboranes of high configurational stability. Furthermore, we fully elucidated a Lewis&#8208;base assisted pathway controlling the rotation speed at the C&#8722;B stereogenic axis, enabling the atropisomerical behavior of these triarylboranes be controlled by a Lewis base.

         <title>Breaking Aggregation State to Achieve Low&#8208;Temperature Fast Charging of Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By optimizing the solvent chemistry, the aggregation states have been disrupted, leading to the formation of contact ion pairs within weakly solvating electrolytes. This approach effectively isolates the solvation structure, reducing interactions between structures. Consequently, it maintains a favorable low desolvation energy barrier and anions&#8208;driven SEI. Simultaneously, it enhances ion migration kinetics, enabling fast charging at low temperatures.







Abstract
Insufficient ionic conductivity and elevated desolvation energy barrier of electrolytes limit the low&#8208;temperature applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Weakly solvating electrolytes (WSEs), with limited lithium salt dissociation capability, are prone to desolvate and drive anion&#8208;rich aggregates (AGGs). However, significant AGGs result in increased viscosity and low ionic mobility, contributing to battery failure at low temperatures (&#8804;&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). Here, we propose and achieve a transformation of WSEs&#8217; solvation structures from AGGs to contact ion pairs (CIPs) through modulating the overall solvation capability, thereby achieving the balance between weak Li+&#8208; solvent interactions and desired ion migration kinetics. Remarkably, CIPs&#8208;dominated electrolyte shows a ten&#8208;fold increase in ionic conductivity compared to conventional WSEs. The Li||LiFePO4 (LFP) battery achieves more than 1400 cycles with 86.9&#8201;% capacity retention at 5&#8197;C. The practical 1.2&#8197;Ah LFP pouch cell delivered 69&#8201;% of the capacity at 25&#8201;&#176;C when cycled at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.

&lt;p&gt;By optimizing the solvent chemistry, the aggregation states have been disrupted, leading to the formation of contact ion pairs within weakly solvating electrolytes. This approach effectively isolates the solvation structure, reducing interactions between structures. Consequently, it maintains a favorable low desolvation energy barrier and anions-driven SEI. Simultaneously, it enhances ion migration kinetics, enabling fast charging at low temperatures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insufficient ionic conductivity and elevated desolvation energy barrier of electrolytes limit the low-temperature applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Weakly solvating electrolytes (WSEs), with limited lithium salt dissociation capability, are prone to desolvate and drive anion-rich aggregates (AGGs). However, significant AGGs result in increased viscosity and low ionic mobility, contributing to battery failure at low temperatures (&#8804;&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). Here, we propose and achieve a transformation of WSEs&#8217; solvation structures from AGGs to contact ion pairs (CIPs) through modulating the overall solvation capability, thereby achieving the balance between weak Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;- solvent interactions and desired ion migration kinetics. Remarkably, CIPs-dominated electrolyte shows a ten-fold increase in ionic conductivity compared to conventional WSEs. The Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LFP) battery achieves more than 1400 cycles with 86.9&#8201;% capacity retention at 5&#8197;C. The practical 1.2&#8197;Ah LFP pouch cell delivered 69&#8201;% of the capacity at 25&#8201;&#176;C when cycled at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy for solvation structure transformation in WSEs provides a novel approach for the development of electrolytes for low-temperature batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Sulfated Ganglio&#8208;Oligosaccharides for Probing Ligand Requirements of Glycan Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of orthogonal protected tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharides combined with chemical sulfation and enzymatic sialylations gave a panel of sulfated ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides that were printed as microarray and screened for binding to lectins, glycan binding proteins, and antibodies. It revealed that sulfation modulates recognition in complex manners.







Abstract
Sulfoglycolipids are an important class of acidic glycosphingolipids that have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes. Little is known about the interactome of sulfated gangliosides, and it is not well understood how a possible interplay between sialylation and sulfation influences molecular recognition. Here, we describe a chemoenzymatic strategy that readily provided a panel of twenty&#8208;one sulfated and sialylated ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides. It is based on the chemical synthesis of a core tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharide that are equipped with the orthogonal protecting groups allyloxycarbonate (Alloc), levulinate ester (Lev) and t&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl ether (TBS). Selective removal of one or more protecting groups followed by sulfation of the resulting alcohol(s) and deprotecting gave several ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides. Compound lacking an internal sialic acid could be prepared by exposing several derivatives to a sialidase. Compounds having an unmodified terminal galactoside could enzymatically be sialylated to give hybrid structures, which could be further extended to provide 2,8&#8208;sialosides. The synthetic glycans were printed as a microarray which was used to examine ligand requirements of a series of glycan&#8208;binding proteins including antibodies, toxins, galectins and siglecs. It was found that sulfation regulates protein binding in complex manners and in general sulfation and sialylation of C&#8208;3 of the terminal Gal influences protein binding in different ways.

         <title>Regioregular Poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane): A Strictly Alternating BN&#8208;Isostere of Poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inorganic poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) analogue with a strictly alternating arrangement of BN units along the chain was prepared by an AB&#8208;polymerization process. The polymer and monodisperse oligomers show emission from locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) states, respectively, which can be addressed by various stimuli, giving rise to solvatochromic, thermochromic, and reversible mechanochromic behavior.







Abstract
Incorporation of BN units into &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds, as substitutes for specific CC couples, often leads to new hybrid materials with modified physical and chemical properties. Poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane)s are derived from well&#8208;known poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) by replacement of the vinylene groups by B=N linking units. Herein, an unprecedented poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane) is presented that features a strictly alternating sequence of BN units along the main chain. The synthesis thereof was achieved by AB&#8208;type polymerization of a monomer featuring an N and a B terminus. Monodisperse oligomers with up to three BN units in the chain were additionally prepared and structurally characterized. Associated with the introduction of a dipole in the regioregular backbone structure, they display notable fluorescence already in solution and large Stokes shifts, distinct from their previously reported BBNN&#8208;sequenced congeners. All compounds show aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) properties. Computational studies provided evidence for emission from either locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) states. These processes can be optionally addressed by various stimuli, giving rise to dual emission, solvatochromic, thermochromic, and reversible mechanochromic behavior.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Hetero&#8208;Interlayer Enabling Sub&#8208;Bandgap Photovoltaic Conversion for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

The low&#8208;dimensional hetero&#8208;interlayer of HQ2ZnI4 acts as the sensitizer actualizing additional near&#8208;infrared photovoltaic conversion, the buffer layer with strong interaction and suitable binding interval, the energy modification interface for facilitating carrier transfer, and the buffer preventing instability decomposition, making devices achieving sub&#8208;band gap photovoltaic gain and enhancement in photoelectric performance.







Abstract
Actualizing sub&#8208;band gap photovoltaic conversion is effective in remitting energy loss and pushing theoretical efficiency limits for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide based on hydroxyquinoline (HQ) is developed to sensitize PSCs for near&#8208;infrared region gain to implement sub&#8208;band gap photovoltaic conversion for enhancing power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. [ZnI4]2&#8722; skeletons containing heavy atoms intensify the direct singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet state transition of organic chromophores HQ. Meanwhile, the triplet energy of HQ is close to resonance with perovskite band gap, favoring the energy transfer to perovskite and exciting the additional electron&#8208;hole pairs, which was observed by transient absorption spectroscopy, confirming the sensitization of perovskite to increase sub&#8208;band gap photocurrent. HQ2ZnI4 modifies electronic and crystal structure, optimizes energy&#8208;level arrangement, and acts as a protective layer, realizing considerable PCEs in small (6.25&#8197;mm2)&#8208;/larger&#8208;area (1&#8197;cm2) devices and excellent operational stability. This low&#8208;cost strategy brings vitality to the light management of PSCs and expands low&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>In/Outside Catalytic Sites of the Pore Walls in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

The influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were first explored by constructing metal sites on the channels of one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks. The inside catalytic sites showed higher catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Pore channels play a decisive role in mass transport in catalytic systems. However, the influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were still under&#8208;explored due, because it is difficult to construct sites anchored in or outside of pore walls. Herein, one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks with precisely anchored active sites were used to explore the effects of channels on a typical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. Electrocatalytic evaluations showed that single Pt sites located inside of the channels exhibited higher kinetic activity compared to those anchored outside. The in situ spectroscopic analysis revealed that local reconstruction of Pt&#8722;Cl breaking and potential&#8208;induced anion transport occurred more effectively inside the channels. The superior anion transportability and kinetic activity of the inside&#8208;channel active sites also facilitated *OH desorption during the ORR process outperforming their outside&#8208;channel counterparts. The results of this study provide strategies for designing active sites in porous catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Nitric Oxide Generation via Thermal Decomposition of N&#8208;Trityl Dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;Oxazines</title>

         <dc:description>
This work describes the design and performance of novel nitric oxide donors for gas flow release applications such as inhaled nitric oxide therapies. Dispersions of N&#8208;trityl dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines in hyper cross&#8208;linked polymers are shown to yield consistent gas phase nitric oxide release at therapeutically relevant concentrations and are stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a promising therapy for a&#160;variety of pulmonary conditions but is limited by the cost, portability, and safety limitations of the compressed gas cylinders used in conventional iNO delivery systems. On&#8208;demand generation of iNO via thermally controlled decomposition of an NO&#8208;genic precursor is an attractive alternative to systems based on compressed gas cylinders. However, most NO&#8208;releasing materials, which would form the basis of such a system, are designed for in vivo applications, but not for gas flow release at elevated temperatures. Novel NO donors with tunable kinetics suited for simple thermal generation are needed to realize such iNO delivery systems. Here we report the development of a&#160;new class of NO donors based on N&#8208;trityl 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines. We show that amorphous solid dispersions of these molecules in porous polymers exhibit consistent, thermoresponsive NO release in good yields when heated above 90&#8201;&#176;C&#160;in the presence of a carrier gas. We further demonstrate that these donors undergo NO release in aqueous media at 37&#8201;&#176;C. Collectively, this work adds a new class of NO donor to the basis set of known NO&#8208;genic molecules and establishes a potential chemical basis for a low&#8208;power, small&#8208;footprint iNO delivery system.&#160;&#160;

         <title>Monodisperse Chemical Oligophosphorylation of Peptides via Protected Oligophosphorimidazolide Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The more the merrier: Oligophosphorimidazolide reagents enable the concomitant conjugation of multiple phosphate units to phosphopeptides, yielding derivatives with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths (up to hexaphosphate). This simple transformation occurs chemoselectively under mild conditions. This work paves the way for future development of mass spectrometry&#8208;based analytical methods for &#8220;oligophosphoproteomics.&#8221;







Abstract
Protein poly&#8208; and oligophosphorylation are recently discovered post&#8208;translational modifications that remain poorly characterized due to (1) the difficulty of extracting endogenously polyphosphorylated species without degradation and (2) the absence of synthetic and analytical tools to prepare and characterize poly&#8208; and oligophosphorylated species in biochemical contexts. Herein, we report a methodology for the selective oligophosphorylation of peptides with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths (Pn=3&#8211;6). A library of oligophosphorimidazolide (oligoP&#8208;imidazolide) reagents featuring benzyl and o&#8208;nitrophenylethyl protecting groups was synthesized in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields (65&#8211;93&#8201;%). These oligoP&#8208;imidazolide reagents enabled the selective and simultaneous conjugation of multiple phosphate units to phosphoryl nucleophiles, circumventing tedious iterative processes. The generalizability of this approach is illustrated by a substrate scope study that includes several biologically relevant phosphopeptide sequences, culminating in the synthesis of &gt;60 examples of peptide oligophosphates (Pn=2&#8211;6). Moreover, we report the preparation of oligoP&#8208;diimidazolides (Pn=3&#8211;5) and discuss their application in generating unique condensed phosphate&#8208;peptide conjugates. We also demonstrate that human phospho&#8208;ubiquitin (pS65&#8208;Ub) is amenable to functionalization by our reagents. Overall, we envision the methods described here will enable future studies that characterize these newly discovered but poorly understood phosphorylation modes.

         <title>Degradable Adhesives as Sustainable Alternatives to Acrylics via Ring&#8208;Opening Radical Polymerization of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) using vinylcycloproapne&#8208;based monomers and a crosslinker, achieving molecular&#8208;level degradation while maintaining adhesion and viscoelastic properties comparable to traditional acrylic PSAs.







Abstract
Acrylic pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are loosely crosslinked polymer networks widely used across various industries. However, the network structure and inert nature of the acrylic polymer backbone present sustainability challenges. To address these issues, efforts are being made to incorporate degradable units into the polymer backbone. Yet, two key obstacles remain: i) the polymer does not degrade into sufficiently small fragments, and ii) the adhesive and viscoelastic properties are often inferior to those of conventional acrylic polymers. In this study, we developed a PSA utilizing vinylcyclopropane (VCP)&#8208;based monomers and a VCP&#8208;based crosslinker, achieving molecular&#8208;level degradation while maintaining adhesive performance and viscoelastic properties comparable to traditional acrylic PSAs. Under optimized polymerization conditions, the polymer incorporates ozone&#8208;labile double bonds into its backbone, enabling controlled molecular degradation without compromising its properties. By synthesizing and strategically combining various VCP&#8208;based monomers, we developed PSAs with tailored adhesion and viscoelastic behavior on par with conventional acrylic PSAs. These advancements indicate that the degradable polymers and PSAs developed in this study are poised for practical application in the near future.

         <title>Enhanced Electroluminescence and Stability of Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive was engineered to regulate crystallization, passivate defects, and resist moisture in blue perovskites using the biomimetic additive 2H,2H,3H,3H&#8208;heptadecafluoroundecanoic acid (HFUA). As a result, sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit excellent operational and moisture stability, achieving a champion external quantum efficiency of 22.88&#8201;% at 490&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Although remarkable breakthroughs have been witnessed in the field of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), achieving efficient and stable blue PeLEDs still remains as a critical challenge to towards commercial applications. Inspired by the protection effect and water&#8208;repellent properties of swan feathers, 2H,2H,3H,3H&#8208;heptadecafluoroundecanoic acid (HFUA) has been designed as adsorbed functional molecule for blue perovskites, which can simultaneously enhance the electroluminescence performance and moisture stability. The HFUA molecule features a long&#8208;chain structure where the carboxylic acid group acts as an anchor, coordinating with undercoordinated lead atoms in blue perovskites. The fluorine atoms at the opposite end of the chain form ionic bonds with the halogen octahedron, thereby stabilizing the octahedral structure. In addition, HFUA adsorption lowers the adsorption energy of organic spacers on the perovskite lattice, optimizing the reduced&#8208;dimensional phase distribution to facilitate smooth exciton transfer. Furthermore, the unique molecular structure of HFUA, rich in fluorine atoms, enhances the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface, effectively inhibiting moisture penetration and preventing perovskite hydrolysis. The target blue PeLEDs obtain a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.88&#8201;% at 490&#8197;nm and exhibit greatly improved air stability under humid and high&#8208;temperature conditions. Our findings provide a unique and effective strategy for producing efficient and stable blue PeLEDs.

Multiple donors have been integrated into multi&#8208;resonance moieties to engineer excited states and steric hindrances to generate blue and green thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with enhanced quenching resistance and spin&#8208;flip processes. The resulting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show high external quantum efficiencies, reduced efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and good operational stability across a wide dopant concentration.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials have great potential for applications in ultrahigh&#8208;definition (UHD) organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays, that benefit from their narrowband emission characteristic. However, key challenges such as aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect and slow triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet spin&#8208;flip process, especially for blue MR&#8208;TADF materials, continue to impede their development due to planar skeletons and relatively large &#916;ESTs. Here, an effective strategy that incorporates multiple carbazole donors into the parent MR moieties is proposed, synergistically engineering their excited states and steric hindrances to enhance both the spin&#8208;flip process and quenching resistance. As expected, the designed materials namely 5Cz&#8208;BNO and 5Cz&#8208;BN exhibit bright blue and green emissions with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) around 23&#8197;nm, together with significantly improved reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates. The OLEDs based on 5Cz&#8208;BNO and 5Cz&#8208;BN with doping concentrations from 5 to 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% achieve high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) values exceeding 30&#8201;% with suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;offs and improved operational stability. This work offers an effective approach for designing doping&#8208;insensitive blue and green MR&#8208;TADF materials with fast spin&#8208;flip processes by integrating the engineering of excited states and steric hindrances.

         <title>Glucuronidase&#8208;Instructed Glycopeptide Self&#8208;Assembly for Selective Killing of Cancer Cells through Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glucuronidase&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly of a glycopeptide induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization and apoptosis in cancer cells. This glycopeptide also synergizes with cisplatin and adriamycin to enhance cytotoxicity, including in drug&#8208;resistant cancer strains.







Abstract
Current cancer treatments face significant challenges, including limited tumor specificity and drug resistance. Enzyme&#8208;instructed supramolecular peptide assembly targeting lysosomes offers a promising strategy to address these issues; however, self&#8208;assembling units that withstand lysosomal conditions are still scarce. Herein, we present a versatile glycopeptide incorporating glucuronic acid and glucose that undergoes glucuronidase&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly to form nanofibers, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) in cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that in glucuronidase&#8208;overexpressing HepG2 cells, glycopeptide assembly induces cytoskeletal disruption and apoptosis. The involvement of carbohydrate&#8208;binding receptor in enhancing the cellular entry of glycopeptides and improving proteolytic stability highlights the importance of glycan modification. Notably, combining this glycopeptide with cisplatin or Adriamycin results in synergistic cytotoxicity, including in drug&#8208;resistant cancer cell lines. These findings establish a novel, LMP&#8208;inducing glycopeptide scaffold for developing targeted approaches for cancer treatment.

         <title>Orthogonal&#8208;Group&#8208;Controlled Site&#8208;Selective I&#8208;Branching of Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine Chains Reveals Unique Binding Specificities of Proteins towards I&#8208;Antigens</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly efficient chemoenzymatic approach was developed to achieve site&#8208;selective I&#8208;branching of poly&#8208;LacNAc chains. The approach relies on three orthogonal protecting groups, each of which &#8220;caps&#8221; one branching site for selective &#8220;decapping&#8221; and GCNT2&#8208;catalyzed I&#8208;branching. A diverse library of 41 linear and branched poly&#8208;LacNAc glycans were prepared from a single precursor. Glycan array analysis then revealed unique recognition of I&#8208;branches.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (poly&#8208;LacNAc) is ubiquitously expressed on cell surface glycoconjugates, serving as the backbone of complex glycans and an extended scaffold that presents diverse glycan epitopes. The branching of poly&#8208;LacNAc, where internal galactose (Gal) residues have &#946;1&#8208;6 linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) attached, forms the blood group I&#8208;antigen, which is closely associated with various physiological and pathological processes including cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear as many of the I&#8208;antigen sequences are undefined and inaccessible. In this study, we developed a highly efficient orthogonal&#8208;group&#8208;controlled approach to access site&#8208;selectively I&#8208;branched poly&#8208;LacNAc chains. The approach relies on three orthogonal protecting groups, each of them &#8220;caps&#8221; one internal Gal residue of poly&#8208;LacNAc. These groups can be readily &#8220;decapped&#8221; by specific enzymes or chemical reduction to expose desired sites for GCNT2&#8208;catalyzed I&#8208;branching. This approach enabled the rapid preparation of a diverse library of 41 linear and branched poly&#8208;LacNAc glycans from a single precursor. Glycan microarray analysis using these complex glycans revealed unique recognitions of I&#8208;branches by lectins, anti&#8208;I mAbs, and galectins. Surprisingly, oxidized forms of linear poly&#8208;LacNAc strongly bound to several glycan&#8208;binding proteins (GBPs). These findings help to bridge the gap in recognition of I&#8208;branching and open new avenues for therapeutic development by targeting galectins.

         <title>Co&#8208;Feeding CO2 for Methylfuran Aromatization over Bifunctional Zeolite&#8208;Supported ZnMoO4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZnMoO4/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst effectively facilitates co&#8208;feeding CO2 for 2&#8208;methylfuran aromatization reactions, preferring the dehydro&#8208;aromatization pathways based on cyclopentenones and alkenes over those based on benzofurans. Additionally, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies of ZnMoO4 enhance the adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with coke.







Abstract
Aromatization of biofuran offers promising approaches for sustainable biochemical production. However, this process is often hampered by low yields and severe coking on traditional zeolite catalysts. Herein, we report co&#8208;feeding CO2 for 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF) aromatization (CCMA) over bifunctional ZSM&#8208;5 supported ZnMoO4. This bifunctional catalyst can achieve both MF and CO2 conversions of &gt;97&#8201;%, generating &gt;85&#8201;% carbon yield of target arenes and CO with negligible alkenes (0.05&#8201;%). Meanwhile, coke formation is remarkably suppressed from 22.3&#8201;% to 8.6&#8201;%. ZnMoO4/ZSM&#8208;5 is capable of selectively manipulating the reaction intermediates and pathways of the CCMA reactions, favoring the cyclopentenones&#8208; and alkenes&#8208;based dehydro&#8208;aromatization rather than the benzofurans&#8208;based pathway. This finding challenges the prevailing understanding that MF aromatization follows a hydrocarbon pool mechanism. Moreover, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies of ZnMoO4 facilitate the adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with coke. These insights into reaction mechanism and catalyst design for co&#8208;conversion of CO2 and biofuran can offer guidelines for process intensification in biomass utilization with a carbon&#8208;negative manner.

         <title>Accessing a Carboxyl&#8208;Anhydride Molecular Switch&#8208;Mediated Recyclable PECT Through Upcycling End&#8208;of&#8208;Use PET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel recycling strategy, based on the principles of polycondensation, is proposed for upcycling waste PET to produce high&#8208;value recyclable poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) (PECT) containing molecular switches. Upon activation of the molecular switch, PECT undergoes rapid depolymerization to form a prepolymer.

Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), with an annual production of exceeding 70 million tons, is mainly utilized in disposable fields and subsequently contribute to severe environmental pollution. Conventional chemical recycling, which typically involves depolymerizing polymer into monomers, is limited due to the intricate recycling process, excess using unrecyclable solvents and low polymer conversion. Inspired by protein's molecular switches, we propose a novel polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer recycling strategy based on polycondensation principles upcycling waste PET to high&#8208;value recyclable poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) derivatives containing molecular switches. Upon deactivating the molecular switch, an acidification reaction occurs within the system, leading to a rapid and controllable reduction in molecular weight due to the imbalance of reactive group. Conversely, activating the molecular switch triggers a ring&#8208;closing reaction that detaches acid anhydrides, bringing about equal molar ratio of groups and thereby facilitating an increase in molecular weight. By simply incorporating a molecular switch into condensation products based on melt polycondensation, closed&#8208;loop recycling capability is achieved without necessitating excessive organic solvents or complex depolymerization processes. The present study not only presents a novel pathway for end&#8208;of&#8208;use PET upcycling but also introduces an innovative concept of molecular switching for the closed&#8208;loop recyclability of condensation polymers, thereby demonstrating significant potential for large&#8208;scale implementation.

&lt;p&gt;A novel recycling strategy, based on the principles of polycondensation, is proposed for upcycling waste PET to produce high-value recyclable poly(ethylene-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) (PECT) containing molecular switches. Upon activation of the molecular switch, PECT undergoes rapid depolymerization to form a prepolymer. Conversely, the prepolymer can be efficiently polymerized back into high molecular weight PECT.

         <title>Spatially Preorganized Hybridization Chain Reaction for the Prompt Diagnosis of Inflammation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially preorganized hybridization chain reaction (HCR) probes on a triangular DNA origami nanostructure (TRI&#8208;HCR) enables fast detection of nucleic acid targets. When applied to in vivo imaging of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA in mice afflicted with acute gouty arthritis or sepsis&#8208;associated acute kidney injury, TRI&#8208;HCR can diagnose inflammation in the early stages, significantly earlier than histological examination.







Abstract
Biological systems utilize precise spatial organization to facilitate and regulate information transmission within signaling networks. Inspired by this, artificial scaffolds that enable delicate spatial arrangements are desirable to increase the local concentration of reactants, expedite specific interactions, and minimize undesired interference. In this study, we presented an integrated biosensing nanodevice, termed TRI&#8208;HCR, in which hybridization chain reaction (HCR) probes were precisely organized on a triangular DNA origami nanostructure (TRI) with finely&#8208;tuned distance, quantity, and pattern. Compared to traditional HCR in the free form, this nanodevice demonstrated increased reaction rate and signal level. We further employed the optimized TRI&#8208;HCR for in vivo imaging of a nucleic acid biomarker of inflammatory diseases. In both acute gouty arthritis (AGA) and sepsis&#8208;associated acute kidney injury (SA&#8208;AKI) model mice, TRI&#8208;HCR was capable of diagnosing inflammation in the early stages, significantly earlier than histological examination. We anticipate that this precise spatial preorganization strategy for HCR holds promise for broader applications in early disease detection and monitoring.

         <title>Counterions Determine if Metal&#8208;Organic Cages Convert SO2 to Sulfate or Reversibly Adsorb It</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different counterions modulate the solid&#8208;state SO2 adsorption behavior in M6L8 Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (M=Pd(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Zn(II)). Certain anions induce reversible SO2&#8208;adsorption, while nitrate promotes its transformation to sulfate at room temperature. Among these cages, Pd6L8 exhibits the highest cavity&#8208;mediated SO2 conversion, excellent stability, and is quantitatively regenerated.







Abstract
The continuous emission of harmful gases into the atmosphere damages the environment, air quality, and public health worldwide. To mitigate their impact, materials that capture and chemically inactivate gases are required; however, integrating and precisely controlling both abilities within a single material remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that switching between SO2&#8208;physisorption and chemisorption is possible for porous materials by using different counterions, as illustrated with a series of Pd6L8 Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (MOCs). Pd&#8208;MOCs bearing BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, or SO42&#8722; expressed reversible adsorption (up to 3.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), cyclability, and SO2/CO2 selectivity. NO3&#8722; promoted conversion of SO2 to sulfate, as corroborated with M6L8 cages built on Co(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) ions. Noteworthy, the nitrate derivative of Pd6L8 captures 6.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 of SO2, cleanly transforms it to SO42&#8722; within its cavity in 94&#8201;% yield at room temperature, it is quantitatively regenerated, and tolerates humid SO2; such qualities are unprecedented for SO2 adsorbents. The deliberate use of counterions for modulating adsorption could be applied to charged MOFs, COFs, or POCs, potentially leading to the development of new reactivity or catalysis pathways for advanced applications against contaminant gases.

         <title>Construction of Axially Chiral Dialdehydes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amidation</title>

         <dc:description>
The axially chiral dialdehydes were synthesized via Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H amidation. The reaction proceeded smoothly by using chiral amine as the transient directing group. The detailed mechanistic studies implied that an intramolecular C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction might play a key role in the control of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Achieving axially chiral biaryl dialdehydes through asymmetric catalysis remains significantly challenging due to the lack of efficient strategies. In this report, we developed a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H amidation through chiral transient directing group strategy. With this new approach, a series of axially chiral amido dialdehydes were achieved in up to 86&#8201;% yields with 99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er. Furthermore, detailed mechanistic studies indicated that both the imine formation and C&#8722;H bond cleavage steps were reversible. More interestingly, the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of Int&#8208;2 showed probable C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction between biaryl group and chiral amine moiety. This process offered a convenient route to access axially chiral dialdehyde derivatives. More broadly, it demonstrated a new tool through transient and C&#8722;H/&#960; synergistic interactions, which would stimulate further development of asymmetric catalytic system in enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <title>Adjusting TADF and Phosphorescence for Tailored Dynamic Time&#8208;Dependent Afterglow Colored Carbon Dots spanning Full Visible Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a convenient strategy to achieve TDAC CDs that cover the entire visible region. By optimizing the doping level of Pyr&#8208;CDs and embedding them in different rigid matrices, we can effectively tailor various color variations of the afterglow within the visible region. The successful utilization of 4D coding technique for multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting and advanced dynamic information encryption promotes the practical applications of afterglow materials.







Abstract
Time&#8208;dependent afterglow colored (TDAC) behavior differs from static afterglow by involving wavelength changes, enabling low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;level encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, the existing carbon dot (CD)&#8208;based TDAC materials lack a clear mechanistic explanation and controllable wavelength changes, significantly hindering the progress of practical applications in this field. In this study, we synthesized CDs composites with customizable tunable TDAC wavelengths across the visible region. Furthermore, we elucidated the underlying mechanism of TDAC that exhibits sequential weakening and relative strengthening of long&#8208; and short&#8208;wavelength afterglow centers. This phenomenon arises due to strong emission with a short lifetime originating from long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), along with weak emission having a longer lifetime originating from short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence. The presence of surface&#8208;rich carboxyl groups on CDs determines the short&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their dispersed state while their high conjugation degree governs the long&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their aggregated state. Additionally, appropriate doping levels of CDs enhance color change phenomena during afterglow. Finally, by embedding CDs into different rigid matrix, the range of afterglow changes can be tailored arbitrarily within the visible light region.

     alt="Adjusting TADF and Phosphorescence for Tailored Dynamic Time-Dependent Afterglow Colored Carbon Dots spanning Full Visible Region"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed a convenient strategy to achieve TDAC CDs that cover the entire visible region. By optimizing the doping level of Pyr-CDs and embedding them in different rigid matrices, we can effectively tailor various color variations of the afterglow within the visible region. The successful utilization of 4D coding technique for multimodal anti-counterfeiting and advanced dynamic information encryption promotes the practical applications of afterglow materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time-dependent afterglow colored (TDAC) behavior differs from static afterglow by involving wavelength changes, enabling low-cost, high-level encryption and anti-counterfeiting. However, the existing carbon dot (CD)-based TDAC materials lack a clear mechanistic explanation and controllable wavelength changes, significantly hindering the progress of practical applications in this field. In this study, we synthesized CDs composites with customizable tunable TDAC wavelengths across the visible region. Furthermore, we elucidated the underlying mechanism of TDAC that exhibits sequential weakening and relative strengthening of long- and short-wavelength afterglow centers. This phenomenon arises due to strong emission with a short lifetime originating from long-wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), along with weak emission having a longer lifetime originating from short-wavelength phosphorescence. The presence of surface-rich carboxyl groups on CDs determines the short-wavelength afterglow in their dispersed state while their high conjugation degree governs the long-wavelength afterglow in their aggregated state. Additionally, appropriate doping levels of CDs enhance color change phenomena during afterglow. Finally, by embedding CDs into different rigid matrix, the range of afterglow changes can be tailored arbitrarily within the visible light region. Leveraging these exceptional TDAC characteristics has allowed us to successfully develop advanced 4D coding technologies that facilitate multi-mode anti-counterfeiting and dynamic information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Octahedral Lanthanide Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient circularly polarized luminescence of lanthanide cages was achieved through amino acid induction, the luminescence asymmetry factor and quantum yield are 0.53 and 61&#8201;%, respectively. The induction ability of amino acid is positively correlated with the number of coordination bonds and coordination bond energies in the precursor formed by amino acid and lanthanide ions.







Abstract
Chiral metal organic cage compounds with excellent circularly polarized luminescent performance have broad application prospects in many fields. Herein, two lanthanide complexes with luminescent properties in the form of racemic hexagonal octahedral cages were synthesized using a tri (&#946;&#8208;diketone) ligand. Eu6(C21H6F15O6)8(H2O)6 exhibited red light emission with high quantum yields of 61&#8201;%. Then, we successfully synthesized lanthanide compounds with circularly polarized luminescent activity by chiral induction of the racemic mixture with arginine. The luminescence asymmetry factor was 0.53, and the circularly polarized luminescent merit figure reached 0.323. High&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescent of racemic cage like compound systems have achieved using cheap and readily available chiral amino acid molecules through chiral induction.

         <title>Multiscale Engineered Bionic Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes Breaking the Stiffness&#8208;Damping Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bionic solid&#8208;state electrolyte composed of amorphous titania nanotube arrays intertwined with polymer electrolytes accurately replicates the superstructure of tooth enamel, effectively breaking the stiffness&#8208;damping trade&#8208;off, not only inhibiting dendrites growth, but also ensuring electrolyte/electrode mechanical compatibility.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are regarded as next&#8208;generation devices for energy storage due to their safety and high energy density. The issues of Li dendrites and poor mechanical compatibility with electrodes present the need for developing solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high stiffness and damping, but it is a contradictory relationship. Here, inspired by the superstructure of tooth enamel, we develop a composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte composed of amorphous ceramic nanotube arrays intertwined with solid polymer electrolytes. This bionic electrolyte exhibits both high stiffness (Young&#8242;s modulus=15&#8197;GPa, hardness=0.13&#8197;GPa) and damping (tan&#948;=0.08), breaking the trade&#8208;off. Thus, this composite electrolyte can not only inhibit Li dendrites growth but also ensure intimate contact with electrodes. Meanwhile, it also exhibits considerable Li+ transference number (0.62) and room temperature ionic conductivity (1.34&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which is attributed to oxygen vacancies of the amorphous ceramic effectively decoupling the Li&#8208;TFSI ion pair. Consequently, the assembled Li symmetric battery shows an ultra&#8208;stable cycling (&gt;2000&#8197;hours at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 60&#8201;&#176;C, &gt;500&#8197;hours at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 30&#8201;&#176;C). Moreover, the LiFePO4/Li and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state full cells both show excellent cycling performance. We demonstrate that this bionic strategy is a promising approach for the development of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Selection of Plastic&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers for Microplastics Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), a pyrimidine&#8208;rich DNA aptamer was isolated for PVS and PS microplastics, despite their different chemical structures. The high affinity of the aptamer for plastics allowed fluorescence&#8208;based microplastic detection.







Abstract
Plastics are critical materials for modern technological applications, yet environmental contamination by microplastics has become a growing concern. In this study, DNA aptamers were isolated for two of the most abundant plastic materials: polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS). These aptamers contain approximately 90&#8201;% cytosine and thymine but only 10&#8201;% purine content. Among them, the PVC&#8208;1 aptamer binds to PVC with a six&#8208;fold higher capacity than a random sequenced DNA. Among the tested plastic materials, PVC and PS exhibited the highest specific binding capacity. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled PVC&#8208;1 aptamer, PS/PVC microplastics as low as 1&#8197;mg were detected, and the aptamer was selective for microplastics over other environmentally relevant materials, such as silica. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the aptamer attempted to maximize contact with the plastic surface for adsorption. This plastic&#8208;binding aptamer is expected to find applications in environmental monitoring and has fundamental implications for surface&#8208;binding aptamers.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel method to activate elemental germanium through mechanical force, facilitating the Reformatsky reaction without external reducing agents. We also demonstrate the catalytic activity of elemental germanium for the first time, successfully achieving this through the bromoalkylation of alkenes.







Abstract
In the realm of materials science and chemical industry, germanium emerges as a strategic resource with distinctive properties that extend its applicability beyond traditional electronics and optics into the promising field of chemical catalysis. Despite its significant role in advanced technological applications, the potential of elemental germanium as a catalyst remains unexplored. Leveraging recent developments in mechanochemistry, this study introduces a groundbreaking approach to activate elemental germanium via mechanical force, facilitating the Reformatsky reaction without the reliance on external reducing agents. Meanwhile, we have also demonstrated, for the first time, the catalytic activity of elemental germanium, successfully achieving this through the bromoalkylation of alkenes. These achievements mark a significant advancement in the field of catalysis and open up a new promising avenue for both academic research and industrial applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;Level Spatially Localized Proximity Labeling for Cross&#8208;Biological&#8208;Hierarchy Measurement and Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a &#8220;two&#8208;level spatially localized proximity labeling (P2L)&#8221; platform by cascading galactose oxidase (GAO)&#8208;based oxidation reaction and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;based proximity labeling (PL). P2L integrates enzymatic logic computation and PL, enabling rapid output of spatial localization information across biological hierarchies as covalent tags for cell&#8208;selective assembly programming and microenvironmental proteomic analysis.







Abstract
Proximity labeling (PL) has emerged as a powerful technique for the in situ elucidation of biomolecular interaction networks. However, PL methods generally rely on single&#8208;biological&#8208;hierarchy control of spatial localization at the labeling site, which limits their application in multi&#8208;tiered biological systems. Here, we introduced another enzymatic reaction upstream of an enzyme&#8208;based PL reaction and targeted the two enzymes to markers indicating different biological hierarchies, establishing a two&#8208;level spatially localized proximity labeling (P2L) platform for in situ molecular measurement and manipulation. Using the cellular&#8208; and glycan&#8208;level as the hierarchical models, we demonstrated the ability of P2L to efficiently execute a two&#8208;step logic operation and to discriminate target cells with different levels of glycosylation within mixed cell populations. By mounting clickable handles via P2L, we reprogrammed the robust covalent assembly of cells at designated sites. The combination of P2L with proteomics led to the profiling of the protein microenvironment of specific glycans on target cells, revealing changes in tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;surface interactions under immune pressure from a glycan perspective. P2L provides not only a solution for revealing the heterogeneity of biological systems, but also new insights in the fields of intelligent logic computation, enzyme engineering, tissue engineering, etc.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated [4+2] Annulation of Silylimines with Olefins to 1&#8208;Aminotetralins Enabled by Diradical Hydrogen Atom Transfer of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;mediated diradical hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) of primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;alkyl arylsilylimines and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;formyl arylsilylimines and their subsequent [4+2] annulations with olefins were accomplished via energy transfer. The silyl substituent on the nitrogen atom was crucial for the success of the reaction by modulating the reactivities of the diradical intermediates derived from the excited imines in DHAT and cascade cyclization process.







Abstract
A facile photochemical, one&#8208;pot synthesis of highly functionalized 1&#8208;aminotetralins derivatives (&gt;70 examples) from readily accessible o&#8208;alkyl and o&#8208;formyl aryl silylimines with olefins is described. A diradical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) of primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;alkyl arylsilylimines and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;formyl arylsilylimines enabled a [4+2] annulation with olefins in excellent diastereoselectivity. This was accomplished upon irradiation at &#955; = 420&#8197;nm in the presence of thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the sensitizer via energy transfer. Moreover, sulfur&#8208;substituted o&#8208;alkyl silylimines can undergo such photochemical process in the absence of an external photosensitizer. This effective protocol is compatible with a variety of functional groups and can be applied to the modification of bioactive molecules. Based on mechanistic evidences and computational studies, it is suggested that the silyl substituent enables an efficient energy transfer leading to the formation of a key C,N&#8208;diradical and subsequent [4+2]&#8208;cyclization was supported by a better molecular orbital matching between the HSOMO of the 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediate and the LUMO of the olefins. Thus, upon irradiation, the excited silylimine unlocks a carbon&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen DHAT and subsequent [4+2] cyclization that allows the divergent functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Quantitative Formation of Octa&#8208;substituted Cyclobutanes by the [2+2] Photocycloaddition of Stiff&#8208;stilbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;template strategy has been utilized to generate octa&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes from stiff&#8208;stilbene precursors. The obtained cycloadducts display shape&#8208;persistent geometry and can be reversibly converted into their stiff&#8208;stilbene precursors with a controllable E/Z distribution.







Abstract
The creation of new molecules with specific structural motifs is a primary goal in synthetic chemistry. In this context, cyclobutanes (CBs), the highly strained ring systems, are of great interest because of their wide applications from pharmaceutical chemistry to materials science. The [2+2] photocycloaddition is the most straightforward approach for CBs; however, access to fully substituted cyclobutanes presents a significant challenge due to the steric hindrance imposed by eight substituents. Here, we report an efficient synthesis of structurally unique, octa&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes from stiff&#8208;stilbene precursors, which is enabled by adaptable anion coordination through hydrogen bonding networks. The synthesized spiro&#8208;benzocyclopentyl&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes are confirmed by single&#8208;crystal structures. DFT calculations indicate that these cyclobutanes have high ring&#8208;strain energies (~20.1&#8197;kcal/mol) and can be completely converted back to stiff&#8208;stilbenes. Such a reversible cycloaddition/reversion process offers a promising platform for applications in responsive and energy storage materials.

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of a New Class of Minor Immunosuppressive Plant Sesterterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gracilisoids, a new family of plant sesterterpenoids with highly functionalized bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane carbon skeletons (named neo&#8208;eurysolanes), were discovered from Eurysolen gracilis. The collective total synthesis of nine gracilisoid members has been accomplished by employing a Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization and late&#8208;stage photo&#8208;oxidation as key steps. Immunosuppressive activity of these sesterterpenoids was also found.







Abstract
Plant sesterterpenoids are an extremely rare family of natural products that generally possess novel chemical structures and diverse biological activities. Herein, we report the discovery of an unprecedented group of minor plant sesterterpenoids, gracilisoids B&#8722;E (2&#8211;5), which feature two types of highly functionalized bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane carbon skeletons, along with their biogenetically related precursor gracilisoid A (1), from a Lamiaceae ethnomedicinal plant, Eurysolen gracilis. To confirm their structures and obtain adequate materials for biological research, the asymmetric total syntheses of gracilisoids A&#8722;E (1&#8211;5) and four new biogenetically&#8208;related congeners gracilisoids F&#8722;I (6&#8211;9) were achieved from commercially available (&#8722;)&#8208;citronellal by a bioinspired approach that involves a Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization/&#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone rearrangement tandem reaction and a late&#8208;stage biomimetic photooxidation as key steps. Biological investigations revealed that gracilisoids A&#8722;I (1&#8211;9) significantly inhibited IFN&#8208;&#947; production and/or T cell proliferation probably through inhibition of the STAT pathway. The findings herald the potential of these gracilisoids as novel immunosuppressive agents, and efficient synthetic approaches will facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of their value in future drug development.

         <title>Cooperative Multiscale&#8208;Assembly for Directional and Hierarchical Growth of Highly Oriented Porous Organic Cage Single&#8208;Crystal Microtubes and Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a cooperative multiscale&#8208;assembly method for porous organic cages that controls intermolecular interactions and fluid flow across scales, directing the growth of single&#8208;crystal tubular structures with oriented micropores and defined dimensionality. These nanocage&#8208;based architectures enhance chemoenzymatic reactions by compartmentalizing metal clusters and enzymes, offering powerful efficiency in complex catalysis.







Abstract
The directional assembly of porous organic molecules into long&#8208;range ordered architectures, featuring controlled hierarchical porosity and oriented pore channels with defined spatial arrangements, is a fundamental challenge in chemistry and materials science. Herein, using porous organic cages as starting units, we present a cooperative multiscale&#8208;assembly strategy enabling the simultaneous alignment of pore channels and directional hierarchical growth in a single step. At the microscopic level, we employed double solvents to manipulate the intermolecular packing of microporous tetrahedral [4+6] imine cages (CC1 and CC3), resulting in pore channel orientation. Concurrently, at the mesoscopic level, convective flow in the double&#8208;solvent system directed the spatial distribution of nuclei species, followed by diffusion limited growth, leading to the directional formation of single&#8208;crystal microtubes. By precisely controlling the direction of convective flow, the nanocages were successfully organized into 2D and 3D single&#8208;crystal microtube arrays while maintaining oriented micropores. This hierarchical porous architecture enhanced mass transfer, as confirmed by adsorption measurements. Interestingly, such 3D hierarchical microtube arrays can be utilized to immobilize Pd clusters and enzymes (lipase or Glucose oxidase) within the micro&#8208; and macropores, respectively, showing a 3.8&#8208; to 4&#8208;fold enhancement in one&#8208;pot tandem reaction activity compared to physical mixtures of individual analogues.

         <title>Conformationally Stable and Sterically Hindered Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium Modification of FAPbI3 Enhances the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

The ammonium moiety of the conformationally stable dicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium odide presents significant steric hindrance but boasts a high binding energy at the surface of FAPbI3 perovskite. The surface treatment with this salt leads to FAPbI3 film with smoother surface, lower charge trap densities, and higher iodine migration activation energy, ultimately enhancing both power conversion efficiency and operational stability of solar cells.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films frequently exhibit structural defects and impurities that impede the durable operation of solar cells. In this study, we introduced a conformationally stable, sterically bulky molecular passivator, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium iodide (BCPDAI), by spin&#8208;coating from an isopropanol solution onto the perovskite film surface, followed by thermal annealing. This treatment effectively converted PbI2 and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 into a two&#8208;dimensional perovskite structure and significantly enhanced the crystal quality of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. The BCPDAI&#8208;treated perovskite films exhibited smoother surface morphology and reduced trap densities for charge carriers, leading to improved power conversion efficiency in the solar cells. Notably, the BCPDAI&#8208;modified perovskite films provided the solar cells with enhanced operational stability. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high positive charge density of BCPDA2+ confers greater binding energy at the perovskite surface and elevates the diffusion activation energy of the iodide anion.

         <title>Binder&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Polymerization with Controllable Gel&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Transformation in Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

An intricate binder&#8208;mediated MOC&#8208;based supramolecular assembly has been developed with tunable viscoelastic behavior and a controllable spontaneous gel&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation process. Adjusting the ratio of Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en enables precise control over nanostructure length and evolution by influencing both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the assembly.







Abstract
Controlling supramolecular polymerization across various length scales through metal&#8208;organic polyhedra in aqueous media enables functional nanomaterial fabrication beyond traditional &#960;&#8208;chromophoric systems. Herein, we present a straightforward strategy to tune the nano&#8208; and microscopic structural evolution of a co&#8208;assembled system. Ga&#8208;MOC ([Ga8(ImDC)12]12&#8722;, ImDC = imidazoledicarboxylate) is introduced as a discrete unit, while the Ni&#8208;ethylenediamine complex [Ni(en)3]2+ (Ni&#8208;en), served as the binder towards supramolecular polymerization. Comprehensive investigations revealed that adjusting the binder ratio in the bicomponent (Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en) co&#8208;assembly process allows precise control over nanostructure length and evolution by influencing both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the assembly. At higher concentrations, this assembly forms a hydrogel above a critical binder ratio. Furthermore, the binder&#8242;s ratio significantly influences the viscoelastic strength of the hydrogels by modulating the connectivity between the MOCs through hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding. Intriguingly, the hydrogels gradually transformed into crystals without any external stimuli, with different timescales regulated by the binder ratio. Single crystal structure determination reveals a 3D structure composed of Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en, extended through charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonding (CAHB) interactions, resulting through the transformation from a kinetically controlled gel state to a thermodynamically stable crystal product. This study provides an understanding of binder&#8208;mediated control over nanostructural evolution in co&#8208;assembled MOCs.

         <title>Towards Rational Design of Confined Catalysis in Carbon Nanotube by Machine Learning and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was found that a set of chemical reactions can be accelerated in confined catalysis, while it also negatively suppressed the activity in several cases. In this work, the operando atmosphere of confined catalysis is simulated with Grand Canonical Monte Carlo accelerated by machine learning potential. It was found that compressive strain is a key for confinement effects. This work provides a pathway for the rational design of confined catalysis.







Abstract
The microenvironment is recognized to be as crucial as active sites in heterogeneous catalysis. It was found that the catalytic activity of a set of chemical reactions can be significantly influenced by the confined space of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with some reactions showing superior activity, while others experience a negative impact. The rational design of confined catalysis must rely on the accurate insights of confined microenvironment. However, the structural complexity of confined catalysts and the interaction with microenvironment hinders the deciphering of chemical origins behind experiments. In this work, Grand&#8208;canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are conducted for confined catalysis in CNTs at various reaction atmospheres, accelerated by machine learning potentials. The statistical outcomes of GCMC simulations corroborate a general feature that the electronic interaction (binding energy) inside CNTs is weaker than outside cases. By using Random Forest (RF) model, we ascertain that the shortening of the bond lengths of catalysts within the confined space is the dominant factor, resulting in the weakened binding energy and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center. Using the bond length variation as a simplified descriptor, our microkinetic models successfully reproduced the seemingly contradictive experiments, namely, the observed enhancement and suppression for the same reaction.

Abstract
Methane (CH4), a major greenhouse gas and abundant carbon resource, presents significant challenges in catalysis due to its high symmetry and thermodynamic stability, which tend to cause over&#8208;oxidation to CO2. Traditional catalysts require high temperatures and pressures to facilitate CH4 conversion, constrained by their rigid structures which lack the flexibility needed for optimizing complex reaction steps. This study introduces a novel Cu embedded liquid metal catalyst (Cu&#8208;LMC) based on gallium alloys, characterized by dynamic, self&#8208;adaptive structures that provide enhanced catalytic performance and selectivity. Our findings reveal that Cu&#8208;LMC achieves a high methane conversion to methanol yield (5.9&#8197;mol&#8901;gCu&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1) with a selectivity of 82&#8201;%. The results show that mild surface oxidation significantly boosts the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;LMC by increasing active copper sites through the formation of a Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Ga configuration while preserving the catalyst&#8216;s structural flexibility. In situ X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) analyses, along with ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations, demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;LMC enables self&#8208;adaptive structural adjustments that lower methanol desorption energy and increase the energy barrier for by&#8208;product formation, optimizing the overall methane conversion process. The results underscore the importance of designing catalysts with dynamic and adaptable structures to overcome traditional limitations and improve efficiency in catalytic reactions.

         <title>Diffusion/Modulator Dual&#8208;Mediated Solid&#8208;Liquid/Vapor Interfacial Synthesis of Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thirteen kinds of highly crystalline and oriented COF membranes are grown directly on the inner wall of glass vessel, through a diffusion/modulator dual&#8208;mediated solid&#8211;liquid/vapor interfacial synthesis strategy. Good compatibility of solvent&#8208;monomer&#8208;substrate and the slowed down imine exchange reaction promote heterogeneous nucleation and ordered crystal growth in the interface. The resultant COF membranes exhibit satisfactory adsorption performances and LCMs removal efficiency.







Abstract
Constructing oriented crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with controllable thickness for water purification is highly desirable. Herein, we present a simple and universal protocol to prepare high&#8208;quality COF membranes on the inner wall of a glass vessel using a diffusion/modulator dual&#8208;mediated solid&#8211;liquid/vapor interfacial synthesis strategy. By meticulous control of solvent and temperature, a thin supersaturated spreading liquid layer was formed on the glass wall surface and served as a confined microreactor for incubating crystal nuclei. This induced the aniline&#8208;modulated solid&#8211;liquid/vapor interfacial exchange reaction and upward growth of a highly ordered COF membrane. The experiments and theoretical simulations revealed the underlying mechanisms of solid&#8211;liquid/vapor interfacial nucleation, growth and crystallization. Using this strategy, we created 13 types of new, free&#8208;standing, imine&#8208;linked COF membranes with exceptional performances in crystallinity, porosity, stability, processability and adsorption capacity. As an application demonstration, a COF membrane&#8208;filled filter was coupled with high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography system for the automated removal of multitarget liquid&#8208;crystal monomers in real water samples (removal efficiency&#8805;96&#8201;%). This study enriches the synthesis toolboxes of COF membranes and broadens their application scopes.

         <title>Polyurethane Elastomers Strengthened by Pseudo[1]rotaxanes Based on Pillararenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillar[5]arene&#8208;based pseudo[1]rotaxane is introduced into a linear polyurethane to prepare a class of polyurethane elastomers with spring&#8208;like structures. It is found that intramolecular sliding motions of the pseudo[1]rotaxane can greatly improve the mechanical properties of polyurethane elastomers.







Abstract
As a unique property of the interlocked structures, rotaxane allows for intramolecular motions between its wheel and axle components. Introduction of rotaxanes into polymers can endow them with distinctive macroscopic features and outstanding mechanical properties. Here, we prepare a copillar[5]arene with a hydroxyl and an amino&#8208;group on each end, which can spontaneously form a pseudo[1]rotaxane through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This pseudo[1]rotaxane possesses a releasable extra alkyl chain, which is then incorporated into a linear polyurethane by reacting with a diisocyanate to prepare polyurethane elastomers with spring&#8208;like structures. The results of stress&#8208;strain test and dynamic mechanical analysis all indicate that sliding motions of the axle part on the pseudo[1]rotaxane in the polymer skeleton can greatly dissipate energy, which endows the elastomers with higher toughness and better fatigue resistance. Moreover, the addition of moderate amount of cuprous bromide to form cuprous&#8208;thioether coordination in the polymers can further improve the mechanical properties.

         <title>Electrolyte Decoupling Strategy for Metal Oxide&#8208;Based Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries Free of Crosstalk Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a decoupled electrolyte (DCE) composed of a nonaqueous&#8208;phase (N&#8208;phase) anolyte and an aqueous&#8208;phase (A&#8208;phase) catholyte to prevent the Mn2+ crosstalk while facilitating Zn2+ conduction. The as&#8208;developed Zn|DCE|MnO2 full cells exhibited an extended cyclability over 900&#8197;cycles with negligible Mn2+ crosstalk, a decreased byproducts formation and H2 evolution compared with cells using an aqueous ZnCl2 electrolyte.







Abstract
The crosstalk of transition metal ions between the metal oxide cathode and Zn anode restricts the practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Herein, we propose a decoupled electrolyte (DCE) consisting of a nonaqueous&#8208;phase (N&#8208;phase) anolyte and an aqueous&#8208;phase (A&#8208;phase) catholyte to prevent the crosstalk of Mn2+, thus extending the lifespan of MnO2&#8208;based ZIBs. Experimental measurements and theoretical modelling verify that trimethyl phosphate (TMP) not only synergistically works with NH4Cl in the N&#8208;phase anolyte to enable fast Zn2+ conduction while blocking Mn2+ diffusion toward anode, but also modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure to suppress the dendrite formation and corrosion on Zn anode. Meanwhile, the A&#8208;phase catholyte effectively accelerates the cathode reaction kinetics. The as&#8208;developed Zn|DCE|MnO2 cell delivers 80.13&#8201;% capacity retention after 900&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This approach is applicable for other metal oxide cathode&#8208;based ZIBs, thereby opening a new avenue for developing ultrastable ZIBs.

         <title>Unraveling the Multifunctional Mechanism of Fluoroethylene Carbonate in Enhancing High&#8208;Performance Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

In this work, we comprehensively reveal the two&#8208;step &#8220;chocolate&#8208;cookie&#8221; shaped CEI formation mechanism in RT Na&#8208;S batteries driven by FEC. The solid&#8208;solid conversion of sulfur and impressive performance are achieved in this simplified system (456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C), which has the potential for further improvement.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries has attracted growing attentions in large&#8208;scale energy storage technology, while the serious shuttle effect and interface side reaction limit its practical application. Despite fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) has been widely used as an electrolyte additive or co&#8208;solvent to facilitate the optimization of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase in RT Na&#8722;S batteries, its crucial influence and mechanism have not been clearly understood. Herein, we deeply reveal the two&#8208;steps cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation by using FEC as the exclusive electrolyte solvent.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we comprehensively reveal the two-step &#8220;chocolate-cookie&#8221; shaped CEI formation mechanism in RT Na-S batteries driven by FEC. The solid-solid conversion of sulfur and impressive performance are achieved in this simplified system (456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C), which has the potential for further improvement.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries has attracted growing attentions in large-scale energy storage technology, while the serious shuttle effect and interface side reaction limit its practical application. Despite fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) has been widely used as an electrolyte additive or co-solvent to facilitate the optimization of electrode-electrolyte interphase in RT Na&#8722;S batteries, its crucial influence and mechanism have not been clearly understood. Herein, we deeply reveal the two-steps cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation by using FEC as the exclusive electrolyte solvent. The results demonstrate that FEC participates in both rapid nucleophilic reaction and electrochemical decomposition on cathode, which can effectively in situ construct a unique &#8220;chocolate-cookie&#8221; shaped CEI consisted of NaF-rich double layers. This CEI eliminates the shuttle effect and ensures the solid-solid conversion of sulfur. Along with the stable F-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the Na anode, the RT Na&#8722;S battery delivers an impressive performance (456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C) with almost 100&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency. This significantly simplifies electrolyte design and provides valuable insights into the application of FEC in practical Na&#8722;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Propane Activation on Pt Electrodes at Room Temperature: Quantification of Adsorbate Identity and Coverage</title>

Elucidating propane activation on Pt electrocatalyst, via the use of on&#8208;line electrochemical mass spectrometer, in aqueous acidic electrolyte. Combination of mass spectrometry and reductive coulometry sheds light on adsorption and desorption of propane&#8208;derived adsorbate species.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond activation is the first step in manufacturing chemical products from readily available light alkane feedstock and typically proceeds via carbon&#8208;intensive thermal processes. The ongoing emphasis on decarbonization via electrification motivates low&#8208;temperature electrochemical alternatives that could lead to sustainable chemicals production. Platinum (Pt) electrocatalysts have shown activity towards reacting alkanes; however, little is known about propane electrocatalytic activation and conditions suitable for enabling selective oxidation to valuable products. Herein, we utilize a combination of electrochemical mass spectrometry (ECMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the potential dependence of propane activation on Pt electrocatalysts. Results show a strong dependence of adsorption on the applied potential in room&#8208;temperature aqueous acidic electrolyte, with a maximum coverage of propane&#8208;derived adsorbates at 0.30&#8197;V vs RHE. Using charge deconvolution and deuterated experiments, the mechanism of adsorption was elucidated, and C3H2* was determined as the average dehydrogenated propane&#8208;derived adsorbate species. DFT calculations further corroborate these results, showing that the formation of deeply dehydrogenated species is energetically accessible at room temperature. The combined theoretical and experimental findings yield insights for selective activation of paraffinic C&#8722;H bonds at room temperature, aqueous conditions&#8212;a critical step towards decarbonized chemical manufacturing.

         <title>Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom Porosity Tuning in Calixarene&#8208;Derived Porous Liquids via Supramolecular Complexation Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom porosity tuning in liquid phase was achieved via the constructure and structure engineering in calixarene&#8208;derived type&#8197;II porous liquids through supramolecular complexation. The well&#8208;maintained permanent porosity was confirmed via pressure swing gas adsorption and altered CO2 physisorption behavior. Slight difference between 4&#8211;5&#8197;&#197; in porosity of the calixarene host caused significant dynamic motion and transport behavior of CO2 and Xe molecules.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom&#8208;level porosity engineering, which is appealing in gas separations, has been demonstrated in solid carbon, polymer, and framework materials but rarely achieved in the liquid phase. In this work, a gas molecular sieving effect in the liquid phase at sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom scale is created via sophisticated porosity tuning in calixarene&#8208;derived porous liquids (PLs). Type&#8197;II PLs are constructed via supramolecular complexation between the sodium salts of calixarene derivatives and crown ether solvents. The chemical structure variation and assembly behavior of the porous host upon PL construction are monitored by spectroscopy&#8208;, X&#8208;ray&#8208;, and neutron&#8208;scattering techniques. The presence of permanent porosity in calixarene&#8208;derived PLs is verified by pressure swing gas uptake, altered CO2 physisorption behavior, and molecular simulations. Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom porosity tuning within the PL phase is achieved by introducing bulky substituted groups on the benzene ring of the calixarene host, which then greatly affects the dynamic motion and transport behavior of CO2 molecules and the Xe uptake performance. The approach being demonstrated in this work represents a promising pathway to tune and leverage the porosity effect for enhanced gas uptake capacity and selectivity in liquid sorbents.

         <title>Enzymatic Reaction Network&#8208;Driven Polymerization&#8208;Induced Transient Coacervation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic reaction network (ERN) for polymerization&#8208;induced transient coacervation (ERN&#8208;PIC), with complete control over the system: polymerization, coacervation, dissolution and selective cargo uptake.







Abstract
A living cell has a highly complex microenvironment whereas numerous enzyme&#8208;driven processes are active at once. These procedures are incredibly accurate and efficient, although comparable control has not yet been established in vitro. Here, we design an enzymatic reaction network (ERN) that combines antagonistic and orthogonal enzymatic networks to produce adjustable dynamics of ATP&#8208;fueled transient coacervation. Using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;mediated Biocatalytic Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (BioATRP), we synthesized poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate), which subsequently formed coacervates with ATP. We rationally explored enzymatic control over coacervation and dissolution, using orthogonal and antagonistic enzyme pairs viz., alkaline phosphatase, Creatine phosphokinase, hexokinase, esterase, and urease. ATP&#8208;fuelled coacervates also demonstrate the enzymatic catalysis to prove its potential to be exploited as a cellular microreactor. Additionally, we developed ERN&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced transient coacervation (ERN&#8208;PIC), with complete control over the system, polymerization, coacervation, and dissolution. Notably, the coacervation process itself determines functional properties, as seen in selective cargo uptake. The strategy offers cutting&#8208;edge biomimetic applications, and insights into cellular compartmentalization by bridging the gap between synthetic and biological systems. The development of temporally programmed coacervation is promising for the spatial arrangement of multienzyme cascades, and offers novel ideas on the architecture of artificial cells.

         <title>Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow in Flexible Polymeric Materials through the Introduction of Electron Donor/Acceptor Exciplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymers were fabricated through the introduction of electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. The polymers exhibited a remarkable green afterglow persisting for 12&#8197;hours under ambient conditions. The polymers are flexible and transparent, which are useful properties for flexible display applications. Moreover, the polymers were spun into fibers with the HLA property remaining, which holds promise for application in wearable smart devices.







Abstract
The development of organic afterglow materials has garnered significant attention due to their diverse applications in smart devices, optoelectronics, and bioimaging. However, polymeric afterglow materials often suffer from short emission lifetimes, typically ranging from milliseconds to seconds, posing a significant challenge for achieving hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymers. This study presents the successful fabrication of transparent HLA polymers by introducing electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. Employing aromatic polyesters as the polymer electron acceptor and charge reservoirs, the resulting HLA polymers exhibited a remarkable green afterglow that persisted for 12&#8197;hours under ambient conditions, representing the longest duration achieved for polymeric afterglow materials to date. Intriguingly, these HLA polymers could be activated solely by sunlight, maintaining a green afterglow for over 6&#8197;hours at room temperature in air, which outperformed all previously reported afterglow polymers. The doped polymers exhibited superior flexibility and transparency, making them ideal candidates for flexible display applications. Furthermore, successfully spinning these doped polymers into fibers while retaining their HLA properties opens up exciting possibilities for their use in wearable smart devices.

         <title>Dynamic Passivation of Perovskite Films via Gradual Additive Release for Enhanced Solar Cell Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this, we propose a dynamic passivation strategy that employs a pre&#8208;passivator, formamidinesulfinic acid (FSA), to synchronize the release of additives with the generation of defect sites, thereby enabling in situ and real&#8208;time defect passivation. A champion perovskite solar cell achieves an impressive solar conversion efficiency of 25.33&#8201;%, accompanied with an exceptional stability.







Abstract
Modifying perovskites with functional additives has proven effective in refining the crystallization process and passivating the defects of perovskite films, thereby ensuring high photovoltaic efficiencies. However, conventional methods that involve pre&#8208;mixing additives into the precursor solution often face challenges due to discrepancies in the spatial distribution of slow&#8208;diffused additives relative to dynamically formed defect sites, resulting in limited passivation effectiveness. To address this issue, this study innovatively proposes a dynamic passivation strategy that utilizes a pre&#8208;passivator to gradually release active additives during the thermal crystallization process of perovskite films. By leveraging the principle of energy minimization, these timely&#8208;released additives can interact precisely and selectively with the high&#8208;energy defect sites generated during crystallization, thus facilitating efficient additive utilization and in situ real&#8208;time defect passivation. Through analysis of crystallization kinetics and carrier dynamic, it is demonstrated that this dynamic passivation approach significantly improves film quality and prolongs carrier lifetime, outperforming traditional pre&#8208;mixing tactics. Consequently, the final perovskite solar cell achieves an impressive solar conversion efficiency of 25.33&#8201;%, along with exceptional stability. This work provides strong support of tailored additive strategies aimed at further enhancing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells and their subsequent commercial applications.

         <title>Interfacial Water Orientation in Neutral Oxygen Catalysis for Reversible Ampere&#8208;Scale Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

A significant breakthrough in neutral oxygen catalysis was achieved by altering the orientation of water molecules from conventional O&#8208;down to unexpected H&#8208;down in the hydrogen bond network.







Abstract
The neutral oxygen catalysis is an electrochemical reaction of the utmost importance in energy generation, storage application, and chemical synthesis. However, the restricted availability of protons poses a challenge to achieving kinetically favorable oxygen catalytic reactions. Here, we alter the interfacial water orientation by adjusting the Br&#248;nsted acidity at the catalyst surface, to break the proton transfer limitation of neutral oxygen electrocatalysis. An unexpected role of water molecules in improving the activity of neutral oxygen catalysis is revealed, namely, increasing the H&#8208;down configuration water in electric double layers rather than merely affecting the energy barriers for reaction limiting steps. The proposed porous nanofibers with atomically dispersed MnN3 exhibit record&#8208;breaking activity (EORR@1/2/EOER@10&#8197;mA = 0.85/1.65&#8201;V vs. RHE) and reversibility (2500&#8197;h), outperforming all previously reported neutral catalysts and rivaling conventional alkaline systems. In particular, practical ampere&#8208;scale zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) stack are constructed with a capacity of 5.93 Ah and can stably operate under 1.0&#8201;A and 1.0&#8201;Ah conditions, demonstrating broad application prospects. This work provides a novel and feasible perspective for designing neutral oxygen electrocatalysts and reveals the future commercial potential in mobile power supply and large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Lattice Modulation on Singlet&#8208;Triplet Splitting of Silver Cluster Boosting Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TADF&#8208;active silver cluster exhibiting near&#8208;unity PLQY has been achieved through lattice modulation involving cation exchange followed by desolvation. The removal of the guest solvent via thermal activation in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) transformation fashion effectively controls the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting and surpasses both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay of the clusters, thereby boosting the PLQY from 12% to near&#8208;unity.







Abstract
Developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active silver clusters with near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency is of practical importance in cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic devices, but remains a tremendous challenge due to the difficulty of de novo synthesis and uncertainty of properties. Herein, we demonstrate a lattice modulation on parent TADF&#8208; active silver cluster, achieving TADF&#8208;driven photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 12&#8201;% to near&#8208;unity. Systematic experimental and calculated results reveal that the lattice modulation effectively lowers the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;EST) from 718 to 549&#8197;cm&#8208;1, thereby facilitating thermally activated reverse intersystem crossing: T5&#8594;S5, leading to extremely efficient TADF by surpassing both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay, thus boosting the near&#8208;unity PLQY. Such high PLQY is extremely rare in the TADF&#8208;active silver clusters and even in the whole noble&#8208;metal clusters. This research showcases an unparalleled example of lattice modulation to realize near unity PLQY of TADF&#8208;active silver clusters.

         <title>Precise Separation of Complex Ultrafine Molecules through Solvating Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic and reversible structural deformations in crystallographically oriented two&#8208;dimensional COF membranes upon solvent exposure are disclosed. We leverage this to design molecular separation membranes and correlate sieving pore sizes with the number of COF layers. The membrane delivers exceptional stability, molecular selectivity, and practicality for pharmaceutical purification.







Abstract
Isoporous nanomaterials, with their proven potential for accurate molecular sieving, are of substantial interest in propelling sustainable membrane techniques. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are prominent due to their customizable isopores and chemistry. Still, the discrepancy in experimental and theoretical structures poses a challenge to developing COF membranes for molecular separations. Here, we report high&#8208;selectivity sieving of complex ultrafine molecules through solvating pore&#8208;to&#8208;pore&#8208;aligned two&#8208;dimensional COF membranes. Our structurally oriented membrane shows reversible interlayer expansion with intralayer shift in response to solvent exposure. This dynamic deformation induced by solvents leads to a reduction in the aperture of the membrane's sieving pores, which correlates with the number of COF layers. The resultant membranes yield largely improved molecular selectivity to discriminate binary and trinary complex mixtures, exceeding the conventional COF membranes. The membrane's robustness against solvents and physical aging permits extremely stable microporosity and reliable operation for over 3000&#8197;h. This exceptional performance positions our membrane as an alternative to enriching and purifying value&#8208;added chemicals, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients.

Blue hyper&#8208;OLED devices using the Ir(III) emitter m&#8208;ct16 as the dopant sensitizer at 30&#8197;wt&#8201;% and &#957;&#8208;DABNA as the terminal emitter at 1 (2)&#8197;wt&#8201;% afforded blue emission with a narrowband peak maximum at 471 (472)&#8197;nm, CIEy of 0.157 (0.149), EQE1000 of 32.1 (28.4)&#8201;%, and J90 of 15.0 (31.0)&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, setting a new record of Figure of merit (FOM) and showing minimal quenching at high current density.







Abstract
Ir(III) complexes are particularly noted for their excellent photophysical properties in giving blue OLED phosphors. In this study, two distinctive carbene pro&#8208;chelates LAH2+ and LBH2+ (or LCH2+) were employed in preparation of heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes, to which LAH2+ bears a cyano substituted benzoimidazolium along with N&#8208;mesityl appendage, while LBH2+ (or LCH2+) carries the symmetrical benzoimidazolium entity. Notably, the reversible equilibration at high temperature was observed for m, f&#8208;ct14 and m, f&#8208;ct15 with a single LA chelate. In contrast, only the mer&#8208;substituted m&#8208;ct16 was obtained upon employing two LA chelates. All Ir(III) complexes exhibited blue photoluminescence (&#934;PL

Moreover, the hyper&#8208;OLED based on m&#8208;ct16 and v&#8208;DABNA exhibited EQE1000 of 32.1&#8201;% (EQE recorded at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2) and J90 of 15.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (current density at 90&#8201;% of max. EQE).

         <title>A Hydrolytically Stable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Simultaneous Desulfurization and Dehydration of Wet Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrolytically stable MOF has been reported for capturing SO2 from wet flue gas. Strikingly, the SO2 capture efficiency of the material is barely influenced by humidity, even if the pore filling with water is reached. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that its delicate pore structure featuring diverse pore dimensions and chemistry enables the segregation of trace SO2 and a large amount of water into different domains, paving the way for simultaneous desulfurization and dehydration by a single adsorbent.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have great prospects as adsorbents for industrial gas purification, but often suffer from issues of water stability and competitive water adsorption. Herein, we present a hydrolytically stable MOF that could selectively capture and recover trace SO2 from flue gas, and exhibits remarkable recyclability in the breakthrough experiments under wet flue&#8208;gas conditions, due to its excellent resistance to the corrosion of SO2 and the water&#8208;derived capillary forces. More strikingly, its SO2 capture efficiency is barely influenced by the increasing humidity, even if the pore filling with water is reached. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the delicate pore structure with diverse pore dimensions and chemistry leads to different adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics as well as segregated adsorption domains of SO2 and H2O. Significantly, this non&#8208;competitive adsorption mechanism enables simultaneous desulfurization and dehydration by a single adsorbent, opening an avenue toward cost&#8208;effective and simplified processing flowcharts for flue gas purification.

         <title>Flexible Fiber Sensors for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Redox Signaling Molecules in Exercise&#8208;Mimicking Engineered Skeletal Muscle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has reported the fabrication of dual flexible electrochemical sensors and achieved simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and NO release from engineered skeletal muscle in response to exercise&#8208;mimicking stretch. The results proved that proper warm&#8208;up training could help improve exercise adaptation in skeletal muscle.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in skeletal muscle provides crucial insights into the cause&#8208;and&#8208;effect relationships between physical activity and health benefits. However, the dynamic production of exercise&#8208;induced RONS remains poorly explored, due to the lack of sensing tools that can conform to soft skeletal muscle while monitor RONS release during exercise. Here we introduce dual flexible sensors via twisting carbon nanotubes into helical bundles of fibers and subsequent assembling electrochemical sensing components. These flexible sensors exhibit low bending stiffness, excellent H2O2 and NO sensing abilities, outstanding biocompatibility and compliance with engineered skeletal muscle tissue. This allows real&#8208;time and simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and NO release from engineered skeletal muscle in response to different exercise&#8208;mimicking stretches, which reveals that warm&#8208;up activities before high&#8208;intensity exercise may enhance adaptive responses by down&#8208;regulating H2O2 and up&#8208;regulating NO production. The proposed sensing strategy demonstrates great versatility in monitoring multiple biomarkers of soft tissue and organs.

         <title>C&#8722;H Bond Activation by Sulfated Zirconium Oxide is Mediated by a Sulfur&#8208;Centered Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfated Zirconium Oxide contains pyrosulfates that act as a reservoir of transiently adsorbed SO3 and sulfate. The open form of the pyrosulfate is very reactive towards C&#8722;H bonds in Ph3CH to form Ph3C+ or C&#8722;H bonds in highdensity polyethylene or isotactic polypropylene polymers to form cleavage products under hydrogenolysis conditions.







Abstract
Sulfated zirconium oxide (SZO) catalyzes the hydrogenolysis of isotactic polypropylene (iPP, Mw=13.3&#8197;kDa, &#272;=2.4, &lt;mmmm&gt;=94&#8201;%) or high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE, Mn=2.5&#8197;kDa, &#272;=3.6) to branched alkane products. We propose that this reactivity is driven by the pyrosulfate sites SZO, which open under mild conditions to transiently form adsorbed SO3 and sulfate groups. This adsorbed SO3 is a very strong Lewis acid that binds 15N&#8208;pyridine or triethylphosphineoxide (TEPO) (&#916;Eads&gt;&#8722;39&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), reacts with Ph3CH to form Ph3C+, and mediates H/D exchange in dihydroanthracene&#8208;d4. DFT studies show that pyrosulfate sites open with a modest 26.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 barrier to form the adsorbed SO3 and sulfate in the presence of a tetramer of propylene. Hydride abstraction from the tertiary C&#8722;H in this model is exothermic and subsequent &#946;&#8208;scission forms cleaved products. Analysis of the energetics provided here brackets the hydride ion affinity (HIA) of the adsorbed SO3 between 226.2 to 237.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, among largest values reported for a formally neutral Lewis acid. This study explains how SZO, a classic heterogeneous catalyst, can form carbocations by a redox neutral hydride abstraction reaction by very strong Lewis sites.

We propose that this reactivity is driven by the pyrosulfate sites &lt;b&gt;SZO&lt;/b&gt;, which open under mild conditions to transiently form adsorbed SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and sulfate groups. This adsorbed SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a very strong Lewis acid that binds &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-pyridine or triethylphosphineoxide (TEPO) (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;&#8722;39&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), reacts with Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH to form Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and mediates H/D exchange in dihydroanthracene-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. DFT studies show that pyrosulfate sites open with a modest 26.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; barrier to form the adsorbed SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and sulfate in the presence of a tetramer of propylene. Hydride abstraction from the tertiary C&#8722;H in this model is exothermic and subsequent &#946;-scission forms cleaved products. Analysis of the energetics provided here brackets the hydride ion affinity (HIA) of the adsorbed SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; between 226.2 to 237.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, among largest values reported for a formally neutral Lewis acid. This study explains how &lt;b&gt;SZO&lt;/b&gt;, a classic heterogeneous catalyst, can form carbocations by a redox neutral hydride abstraction reaction by very strong Lewis sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Modular Peptide Nanoparticles for Ferroptosis&#8208;Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an orchestrated nanoparticle system utilizing modular peptide assemblies for optimizing both assembly properties and therapeutic functionalities. The resulting nanoparticles, which integrate a hydrophobic ferroptosis precursor, an IDO1 inhibitor, and a hydrophilic peptidic PD&#8722;L1 antagonist, address the limitations of current IDO1 inhibitors through ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced tumor immunotherapy.







Abstract
Indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitors are promising for treating tumors but have limited efficacy due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In this study, we develop an orchestrated nanoparticle system using modular peptide assemblies, where the co&#8208;assembled sequences are designed for the specific binding to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, guiding the assembly process and enabling the customization of nanoparticle properties. We exploit the modularity of this platform to integrate a hydrophobic ferroptosis precursor, an IDO1 inhibitor, and a hydrophilic peptidic PD&#8722;L1 antagonist for optimizing therapeutic outcomes through ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced tumor immunotherapy. The resulting nanoparticles induce immunogenic ferroptosis, enhance the intratumoral function of T lymphocytes, suppress regulatory T cells, and effectively modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby facilitating regression of tumor growth. This work provides a modular peptide&#8208;based nanoparticle engineering strategy and holds significant potential for advancing cancer treatment.

         <title>In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembly of PROTACs by Bioorthogonal Chemistry for Precision Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

Nano&#8208;click&#8208;formed PROTACs (Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs) are an innovative strategy for tumor protein degradation, using divided precursors encapsulated in cyclic RGDfC peptide&#8208;modified liposomes (cRGD&#8208;LPs). This system enables in situ self&#8208;assembly to form complete PROTACs within tumors, preventing premature bioorthogonal reactions and enhancing targeting to integrin &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;expressing tumors for precise and efficient degradation.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) hold immense promise for targeted protein degradation; however, challenges such as off&#8208;target effects, poor drug&#8208;likeness properties, and the &#8220;hook effect&#8221; remain. This study introduces Nano&#8208;Click&#8208;formed PROTACs (Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs) for precise tumor protein degradation in vivo. Traditional PROTACs with high molecular weight were first divided into two smaller druglike precursors capable of self&#8208;assembling to form functional PROTACs through a bioorthogonal reaction. Then, optimal CLIPTACs precursors (W4 and Z2) were encapsulated individually into cyclic RGDfC&#8208;peptide&#8208;modified liposomes to prepare Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs, enabling tumor&#8208;targeted delivery and subsequent in situ self&#8208;assembly to form PROTACs WZ42 within tumor cells. The degradation abilities of Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs in vitro and in vivo were further verified using a key oncology target, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), validating the safety, efficacy and &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221; of this strategy. Overall, Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs represent a critical step towards the clinical translation of PROTACs technology for precise targeted anti&#8208;cancer therapies.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Sensing Analogue Nanopore for Rapid Detection of Protein&#8208;Related Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;sensing analogue nanopore (CeSa&#8208;nanopore) captures SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by specific receptor proteins ACE2 and changes the charge on the outer surface of the nanopore to enable the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This method eliminates the need for sample pre&#8208;treatment, enables rapid target detection, and allows for the detection of different targets by changing the cell membrane.







Abstract
Nanopores offer significant advantages in biosensing. Conventional nanopore sensors require probe modification within the pore, and there are two major obstacles: inhomogeneity of probe modification within the pore, and distortion of the detection signal due to the uncontrollable dynamics of the target within the pore. Here, we constructed a cell&#8208;sensing analogue nanopore (CeSa&#8208;nanopore), by coating the outer surface of the nanopore with cell membrane. The inhomogeneity of probe modification and the uncontrollable kinetics of target&#8208;probe binding were also addressed. Specific cells are selected to prepare CeSa&#8208;nanopore, for example, cells with high expression of angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are used to achieve the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. When SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 binds to CeSa&#8208;nanopore the surface potential changes, causing a change in the ionic current, thus enabling its detection with a detection rate of 100&#8201;%. In addition, the detection of different proteins, such as follicle&#8208;stimulating hormone (FSH), can be achieved by changing the cell membrane coating. The identification of cancer cells in ascites can also be achieved by utilizing homologous targeting between cancer cells. Importantly, the use of CeSa&#8208;nanopores for the detection of these targets eliminates the need for pre&#8208;processing and significantly reduces detection time.

         <title>Interface Engineering of MOF Nanosheets for Accelerated Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni) nanosheets with the merits of robust structures and efficient catalytic metal sites has been presented for separator modification in Li&#8208;S batteries. The ultrathin modification layer with the uniform pore channels and efficient catalytic species can achieve fast Li+ transportation, effective polysulfides interception, and rapid catalytic conversion of polysulfides.







Abstract
Modifying the separator is considered as an effective strategy for achieving high performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. However, most modification layers are excessively thick, with catalytic active sites primarily located within the material&#8242;s interior. This configuration severely impacts Li+ transport and the efficient catalytic conversion of polysulfides. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a multifunctional separator that integrates ultrathin design, catalytic activity, and ion sieving capabilities. Herein, we successfully linked TCPP(Ni) as a secondary ligand with Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheets to create an ultra&#8208;thin separator modification layer (Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni)) with efficient ion sieving and catalytic properties. The resultant multifunctional separators provide robust ion sieving capabilities that promote rapid Li+ transport and intercept polysulfides shuttling. Therefore, The Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni)@PP cell maintains 70.0&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 600&#8197;cycles at a high rate of 3&#8197;C, while achieving an impressive areal capacity of 4.55&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;cm&#8722;2 even with high sulfur content of 80&#8197;wt% at 0.5&#8197;C. This work provides valuable insights for rational design of MOF interface engineering in high energy density Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Transitioning Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Solid States to Aqueous Phases via a Cyclic Peptide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universally applicable supramolecular strategy to transition room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from solid states to aqueous phases is reported. By utilizing a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, a series of aqueous RTP materials are constructed through the noncovalent dispersion of diverse organic phosphors within its rigid hydrophobic microdomain.







Abstract
Aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered considerable attention for their significant potential across various applications such as bioimaging, sensing, and encryption. However, establishing a universally applicable method for achieving aqueous RTP remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we present a versatile supramolecular strategy to transition RTP from solid states to aqueous phases. By leveraging a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, we have developed a noncovalent approach to molecularly disperse diverse organic phosphors within its rigid hydrophobic microdomain in water, yielding a series of aqueous RTP materials. Moreover, high&#8208;performance supramolecular phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) systems have been constructed. Through the facile co&#8208;assembly of a fluorescent acceptor with the existing RTP system, these PRET systems exhibit high energy transfer efficiencies (&gt;80&#8201;%), red&#8208;shifted afterglow emission (520&#8211;790&#8197;nm), ultralarge Stokes shifts (up to 450&#8197;nm), and improved photoluminescence quantum yields (6.1&#8211;30.7&#8201;%). This study not only provides a general strategy for constructing aqueous RTP materials from existing phosphors, but also facilitates the creation of PRET systems featuring color&#8208;tunable afterglow emission.

         <title>Selective Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Catalysed by Simple Alkali&#8208;Metal Bases in DMSO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple alkali&#8208;metal bases catalyse efficient and selective hydrogen isotope exchange in the presence of the deuterium source dimethyl sulfoxide&#8208;d6. Heterocycles, amides, fluoroarenes and other aromatic motifs can be selectively deuterated at room temperature under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies show the crucial role of the metalated solvent, enabling the design of a new set of conditions for less reactive substrates.







Abstract
Isotope Exchange processes are becoming the preferred way to prepare isotopically labelled molecules, avoiding the redesign of multistep synthetic protocols. In the case of deuterium incorporation, the most used strategy has employed transition metals, that offer high reactivity under mild reaction conditions. Despite their success, the trade&#8208;off is that these metals are precious, so expensive, and often exhibit high toxicity. Therefore, alternative transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocols would be a welcome addition to this field. In this report we show how the simple bases NaHMDS (HMDS=hexamethyldisilazide) and NaCH2SiMe3 can efficiently and selectively promote deuteration of a wide range of C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in DMSO&#8208;d6, providing an easy and direct access to deuterated compounds. Heterocycles, fluoroarenes, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, amides and other aromatic molecules could be deuterated under mild conditions using catalytic amounts of base. Mechanistic studies along with the isolation and characterisation of reaction intermediates have flagged up the importance of the metalated substrate and metalated solvent in solution, establishing an equilibrium between these compounds is crucial for the success of this approach. An alkali&#8208;metal effect was observed, with heavier alkali&#8208;metal amides being more reactive at room temperature, but their lower stability at higher temperatures made sodium bases the optimal reagents for Hydrogen Isotope Exchange.

         <title>Photochromic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Based on Host&#8208;Guest Strategy and Different Viologen Derivatives for Organic Amines Sensing and Information Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the design of three photochromic MOFs (NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3) encapsulating viologen derivatives by host&#8208;guest strategy. NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3 exhibit notable reversible photochromic change from yellow to green under 365&#8197;nm UV irradiation owing to the production of intermolecular viologen radicals. Based on the excellent photochromic properties of viologens, NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3 enable intuitive detection of volatile amine and anticounterfeiting applications.







Abstract
The encapsulation of viologen derivatives in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to construct host&#8208;guest materials has been widely discussed owing to their distinctive spatial arrangement and physical/chemical properties. Herein, three new photochromic MOFs (NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3) have been successfully synthesized by 1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetra(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)ethylene (H4TCPE) ligand as well as three different viologen derivatives based on host&#8208;guest strategy. Remarkably, NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3 exhibit a notable reversible photochromism change from yellow to green under 365&#8197;nm UV irradiation. The distance between the electron&#8208;deficient N atom in the viologens and the electron&#8208;rich carboxylate oxygens satisfies the electron transfer (ET) pathway, and thus ET occurs upon irradiation, producing intermolecular viologen radicals. NWM&#8208;1 is able to produce colored responses to different volatile amines by ET and can be recognizable to the naked eye. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) analysis and comparative experiments have demonstrated that the host&#8208;guest strategy significantly enhances the electron&#8208;accepting ability of viologens, thereby achieving superior amine sensing performance. NWM&#8208;2 and 3 have been realized in various applications, such as security code, fingerprint, and QR codes for anticounterfeiting. This work provides new host&#8208;guest strategy for designing highly sensitive photochromic materials and color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials, advancing the development of assembled photochromic materials closer to commercialization.

         <title>Identifying N Coordination Types of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Spin&#8208;Modulated Luminol Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental and theoretical evidences have been provided that modulating the type of nitrogen coordination in Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) can change the d&#8208;orbital spin&#8208;electron configuration of Co atom and selectively regulate the O2 activation capacity, resulting in the production of different reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn affects the subsequent electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behaviour. Based on the correlation between nitrogen coordination type and luminol/dissolved oxygen cathodic ECL behaviour, we propose a strategy based on luminol cathode ECL to rapidly identify the nitrogen coordination type of SACs.







Abstract
The type of coordinated N atoms in the metal&#8208;N coordination structure is of paramount importance to the catalytic property of N&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for analyzing the coordination environments of SACs. Despite its efficacy, the limited availability of synchrotron light sources and the complexity of data analysis have constrained its broader application in identifying metal&#8208;N coordination types within SACs. In this work, two kind of CoN4 SACs, were prepared by varying the N source. Then their electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behavior in the luminol/dissolved oxygen system during cathodic scanning were investigated. In comparison to CoN4(pyridinic N), for which the spin density displays dz2 orbital characteristics, CoN4(pyrrolic N) exhibits dxz orbital features, which was more conducive to the subsequent cleavage of the O&#8722;O bond in O2&#8901;&#8722; to &#8901;OH, resulting in the generation of more active intermediates *OH and the promotion of cathodic ECL emission. This work demonstrates that the ECL technique provides a novel method for the rapid identification of Co&#8722;N coordination types and the spin nature of the metal center in CoN4 SACs.

         <title>A Gate&#8208;Opening Control Strategy via Nitrate&#8211;Chloride Anion Exchange for Enhanced Hydrogen Isotope Separation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

Gate&#8208;opening control via anion exchange in JCM&#8208;1 enables enhanced hydrogen isotope separation through precise tuning of pore aperture and diffusion barriers. The dynamic interplay between structural flexibility and adsorption energetics maximizes D2/H2 selectivity, establishing a robust platform for cryogenic gas separation applications.







Abstract
Efficient separation of hydrogen isotopes, especially deuterium (D2), is pivotal for advancing industries such as nuclear fusion, semiconductor processing, and metabolic imaging. Current technologies, including cryogenic distillation and Girdler sulfide processes, suffer from significant limitations in selectivity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we introduce a novel approach utilizing an imidazolium&#8208;based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF), JCM&#8208;1, designed to enhance D2/H2 separation through temperature&#8208;dependent gate&#8208;opening controlled by ion exchange. By substituting NO3&#8722; ions in JCM&#8208;1(NO3&#8722;) with Cl&#8722; ions to form JCM&#8208;1(Cl&#8722;), we precisely modulate the gate&#8208;opening threshold, achieving a significant enhancement in isotope selectivity. JCM&#8208;1(NO3&#8722;) exhibited a D2/H2 selectivity (SD2/H2) of 14.4 at 30&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, while JCM&#8208;1(Cl&#8722;) achieved an exceptional selectivity of 27.7 at 50&#8197;K and 1&#8197;mbar. This heightened performance is attributed to the reduced pore aperture and higher gate&#8208;opening temperature resulting from the Cl&#8722; exchange, which optimizes the selective adsorption of D2. Our findings reveal that JCM&#8208;1 frameworks, with their finely tunable gate&#8208;opening properties, offer a highly efficient and adaptable platform for hydrogen isotope separation. This work not only advances the understanding of ion&#8208;exchanged MOFs but also opens new pathways for targeted applications in isotope separation and other gas separation processes.

         <title>CO Adsorption on a Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Stably Embedded in Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the chemical activity of isolated metal atoms confined in graphene on Ni(111), using carbon monoxide as a probe molecule. At room temperature, CO stably adsorbs on Co but not on Ni. Electronic descriptors clarify this behavior, offering valuable insights for designing graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts.







Abstract
Confined single metal atoms in graphene&#8208;based materials have proven to be excellent catalysts for several reactions and promising gas sensing systems. However, whether the chemical activity arises from the specific type of metal atom or is a direct consequence of the confinement itself remains unclear.

         <title>A Catch&#8208;Release Strategy for the Genomics&#8208;Driven Discovery of Antiproliferative Furan&#8208;Functionalized Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A streamlined strategy for the discovery and isolation of pharmacologically relevant furan&#8208;containing nonribosomal peptides is presented. Genome mining prioritizes microbes harboring specialized 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) synthases, and a reversible Fua Diels&#8211;Alder reaction enables the rapid and selective discovery and resin&#8208;based purification of Fua&#8208;bearing compounds. Two new classes of antiproliferative Fua&#8208;harboring peptides were identified in this way.







Abstract
Furan&#8208;functionalized peptides are of significant pharmacological interest due to their pronounced bioactivities and unique potential for orthogonal bioconjugation and derivatization. However, naturally occurring peptides with furyl side chains are exceedingly rare. This study presents a streamlined method to predict and assess the microbial production of peptides incorporating 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) moieties. The approach integrates genome mining and the reversible, chemoselective tagging of furyl residues, utilizing their unique Diels&#8211;Alder reactivity, for mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;guided identification of candidate compounds. By employing the rhizonin Fua synthase as a bioinformatic handle and through heterologous reconstitution of Fua biosynthesis, we identified previously unknown Fua biosynthetic pathways in diverse bacterial phyla, including actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, and &#947;&#8208;proteobacteria, suggesting that Fua&#8208;containing peptides are remarkably widely distributed. Metabolic profiling by reversible tagging facilitated the detection of Fua&#8208;containing metabolites in their native producers. The successful adaptation of this method for solid support enabled the direct enrichment of furyl&#8208;substituted peptides from complex mixtures. This multi&#8208;pronged approach enabled the discovery and characterization of two novel families of Fua cyclopeptides (rubriamides and typhamides) with potent antiproliferative effects against human tumor cells and nematodes. The innovative catch&#8208;and&#8208;release strategy, in conjunction with genome mining, represents a valuable tool for the discovery of new furan&#8208;substituted natural products.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Confined Disordered Hydrogen Bonds Enable Efficient Lithium Transport in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State PEO&#8208;Based Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ASSEs) optimization approach with surface&#8208;confined disordered H&#8208;bonds is developed through the construction of rich donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. The crystallization inhibition of PEO, anchoring of TFSI&#8722;, and weak coordination of Li+ are realized while maintaining the stability of the Li+&#8208;conducting system, which are conducive to efficient Li+ transport in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes are essential to advance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) with high safety/energy density due to their inherent flexibility and scalability. However, the inefficient Li+ transport in PEO often leads to poor rate performance and diminished stability of the ASSLBs. The regulation of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds is regarded as one of the most effective approaches to enable efficient Li+ transport, while the practical performances are hindered by the electrochemical instability of free H&#8208;bond donors and the constrained mobility of highly ordered H&#8208;bonding structures. To overcome these challenges, we develop a surface&#8208;confined disordered H&#8208;bond system with stable donor&#8208;acceptor interactions to construct a loosened chain segments/ions arrangement in the bulk phase of PEO&#8208;based electrolytes, realizing the crystallization inhibition of PEO, weak coordination of Li+ and entrapment of anions, which are conducive to efficient Li+ transport and stable Li+ deposition. The rationally designed LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLB demonstrates a long cycle&#8208;life of over 400 cycles at 1.0&#8197;C and 65&#8201;&#176;C with a capacity retention rate of 87.5&#8201;%, surpassing most of the currently reported polymer&#8208;based ASSLBs. This work highlights the importance of confined disordered H&#8208;bonds on Li+ transport in an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery system, paving the way for the future design of polymer&#8208;based ASSLBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straight&#8208;chain molecule (Scm) with double terminated polar groups was designed as an additive for the aqueous electrolyte. The hydroxyl groups firmly anchor the Scms to the Zn anode surface through horizontal adsorption, which enables high surface coverage. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that selective adsorption of Scms on Zn surface induces the deposition behavior of Zn and protects the Zn anode. The electrochemical performance of cells with Scms is significantly improved, especially at a high temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), which have attracted attentions in the field of energy storage, is affected by dendrites and side reactions of Zn anode, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance of AZIBs. Herein, we propose a biased adsorption strategy mediated by straight&#8208;chain molecule (Scm) for stabilizing Zn anode. The dual polar termini of Scms guaranties securely anchor themselves in a parallel orientation upon the Zn anode surface. This provides a comprehensive coverage, effectively sequestering water molecules from the Zn anode and precipitating the formation of a water&#8208;depleted electric double layer (EDL). Furthermore, the Scms selectively adsorb along the crystallographic planes, guiding the deposition of Zn2+. Consequently, the incorporation of these Scms successfully mitigates anode corrosion, HER, and dendrites. The Zn||Zn, Zn||Cu and Zn||V6O13 cells with Scms display significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, especially at elevated temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work highlights the potential of cost&#8208;effective, straight&#8208;chain electrolyte additives for enhancing Zn anode stability.

         <title>t2 Occupancy as an Effective and Predictive Descriptor for the Design of High&#8208;Performance Spinel Oxide Peroxidase&#8208;like Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
t2 occupancy was first reported as an effective and predictive descriptor for spinel oxide nanozymes. Spinel oxides with a medium t2 occupancy of about 4.4 occupied the volcanic apex, possessing the highest peroxidase&#8208;like activity. By combining t2 occupancy with a dual descriptors strategy (O&#946; as a secondary descriptor) that drove a 3D volcanic curve and a dual&#8208;site optimizing strategy beyond the limits of volcanic curve, a rational design strategy was proposed, obtaining the high&#8208;performance CuCo2O4 nanozyme.







Abstract
Nanozymes are next generation of enzyme mimics. Due to the lack of activity descriptors, most nanozymes were discovered through trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategies or by accident. While eg occupancy in an octahedral crystal field was proven as an effective descriptor, the t2 in a tetrahedral crystal field has rarely been explored. Here, we first identified t2 occupancy as an effective and predictive descriptor. Then, we predicted and demonstrated that spinel oxide nanozymes (AB2O4) with a t2 occupancy of around 4.4 at A site had the highest activity. Furthermore, we introduced O&#946; content as a secondary descriptor. The dual descriptor strategy resulted in a three&#8208;dimensional volcanic curve, converging at a vertex. To surpass the limitations of volcanic curves, a dual site optimizing strategy was proposed, guiding the optimization of both A and B sites as Cu and Co, respectively. The designed CuCo2O4 exhibited the highest activity, achieving around 100&#8208; and 2&#8208;fold enhancement compared to initial material and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spinel oxide nanozyme LiCo2O4, respectively. Density functional theory calculations provided a theoretical basis for the catalytic process. This work provides a new strategy for the rational design of nanozymes, and t2 occupancy may also be applicable to the design of other catalysts.

The reaction region in constrained completely heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like reaction was clarified to within slipping plane rather traditional particle interface, which exhibited outstanding salt resistance, recyclability, and extremely low metal ion loss.







Abstract
Although heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like processes have attracted widespread attention in wastewater treatment, the mass leached active ions lead to secondary pollution and confuse the demarcation of reaction region. By constructing a constrained completely heterogeneous system and highlighting its reaction region concentrated within the slipping plane of particles, this work achieves efficient organic pollutants degradation without leaching of any free active metal components. Based on the Poisson&#8211;Boltzmann equation and electric double layer model, the specific existing of the constrained region is confirmed, and this neglected reaction region between solid interface and slipping plane in traditional heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like reaction is clarified firstly. Due to the unique constrained property, this system demonstrates exceptional potentials application to natural water and actual industrial wastewater for its broad resistance to environmental interference. Furthermore, the alkalization aging process enables this system achieve catalyst recycle and zero metal ions emission with maintaining outstanding pollutants removing performance even in high&#8208;salt wastewater, exhibiting the superiority of the constrained completely heterogeneous system. This work demonstrated the important reaction region within slipping plane and provided a clearer boundary in heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like system.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction through Enhanced Mass Transfer in Cu&#8208;Bipyridine 2D Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabricating Cu&#8208;bipyridine 2D covalent organic framework films with significantly exposed catalytic sites and boosting electrocatalytic nitrate reduction through Cu&#8722;N synergistic deoxidation and hydrogenation mechanism. Cu sites act as key centers for adsorption and activation, while bipyridine sites facilitate water adsorption and dissociation, providing H* and accelerating efficient synthesis of ammonia.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO3RR) is a promising method for pollutant removal and ammonia synthesis and involves the transfer of eight electrons and nine protons. As such, the rational design of catalytic interfaces with enhanced mass transfer is crucial for achieving high ammonia yield rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE). In this work, we incorporated a Cu&#8208;bipyridine catalytic interface and fabricated crystalline 2D covalent organic framework films with significantly exposed catalytic sites, leading to improved FE and ammonia yield (FE=92.7&#8201;%, NH3 yield rate=14.9&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#8197;M nitrate) compared to bulk catalysts and outperforming most reported NO3RR electrocatalysts. The film&#8208;like morphology enhances mass transfer across the Cu&#8208;bipyridine interface, resulting in superior catalytic performance. We confirmed the reaction pathway and mechanism through in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. The Cu sites act as primary centers for adsorption and activation, while the bipyridine sites facilitate water adsorption and dissociation, supplying sufficient H* and accelerating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics. This study provides a viable strategy to enhance mass transfer at the catalytic interface through rational morphology control, boosting the intrinsic activity of catalysts in the NO3RR process.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Conjugated Macrocycles: Synthesis, Conductivity, and Application in Electrochemical CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nitrogen&#8208;rich conjugated macrocycles are reported that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing improved processability and surface tunability. By using electrochemically mediated CO2 capture as an example, it is shown how colloidal phenazine&#8208;based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active&#8208;site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk COF powders.







Abstract
Here we report a series of nitrogen&#8208;rich conjugated macrocycles that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing greater solution processability and surface tunability. Using a new tetraaminotriphenylene building block that is compatible with both coordination chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry reactions, we have synthesized two distinct macrocyclic cores containing Ni&#8722;N and phenazine&#8208;based linkages, respectively. The fully conjugated macrocycle cores support strong interlayer stacking and accessible nanochannels. For the metal&#8211;organic macrocycles, good out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport is preserved, with pressed pellet conductivities of 10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm for the nickel variants. Finally, using electrochemically mediated CO2 capture as an example, we illustrate how colloidal phenazine&#8208;based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk covalent organic framework powders. Together, these results highlight how simple macrocycles can enable new synthetic directions as well as new applications by combining the properties of crystalline porous frameworks, the processability of nanomaterials, and the precision of molecular synthesis.

     alt="Nitrogen-Rich Conjugated Macrocycles: Synthesis, Conductivity, and Application in Electrochemical CO2 Capture"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of nitrogen-rich conjugated macrocycles are reported that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing improved processability and surface tunability. By using electrochemically mediated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture as an example, it is shown how colloidal phenazine-based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active-site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk COF powders.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we report a series of nitrogen-rich conjugated macrocycles that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing greater solution processability and surface tunability. Using a new tetraaminotriphenylene building block that is compatible with both coordination chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry reactions, we have synthesized two distinct macrocyclic cores containing Ni&#8722;N and phenazine-based linkages, respectively. The fully conjugated macrocycle cores support strong interlayer stacking and accessible nanochannels. For the metal&#8211;organic macrocycles, good out-of-plane charge transport is preserved, with pressed pellet conductivities of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S/cm for the nickel variants. Finally, using electrochemically mediated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture as an example, we illustrate how colloidal phenazine-based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk covalent organic framework powders. Together, these results highlight how simple macrocycles can enable new synthetic directions as well as new applications by combining the properties of crystalline porous frameworks, the processability of nanomaterials, and the precision of molecular synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of High&#8208;Performance Infrared Nonlinear Optical PAs3S3 with Perfectly Aligned Polar Molecular Cage via a Bipolar&#8208;Axis&#8208;Symmetry Coupling Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce a bipolar&#8208;axis&#8208;symmetry coupling strategy to enhance the arrangement of polar molecular cages for infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. By substituting C3v symmetric [B3O6] groups with polar [PAs3S3] cages in the &#946;&#8208;BBO lattice, we synthesized PAs3S3 (PAS), which maintains a consistent polar arrangement crucial for optimal NLO performance. PAS exhibits an impressive second harmonic generation (SHG) approximately eight times that of AgGaS2, with a substantial band gap of 2.75&#8197;eV and robust stability against air and moisture, positioning it as a promising candidate for IR NLO applications.







Abstract
Strong polar molecular cages have recently emerged as novel functional building units for high&#8208;performance infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. However, these highly polar molecular cages often arrange themselves in a way that cancels out their polarity, leading to a more energetically stable state. As a result, most cage crystal formations tend to crystallize in centrosymmetric space groups, which conflicts with the primary requirement for NLO crystals. Herein, we address the challenge of polar molecular cage arrangement through bipolar&#8208;axis&#8208;symmetry coupling strategy, utilizing classical NLO parent compounds. By substituting the C3v symmetric [B3O6] groups with polar C3v symmetric [PAs3S3] cages within the &#946;&#8208;BBO polar aixs lattice, we successfully synthesized a new compound, PAs3S3 (PAS), which exhibits a consistent arrangement of polar molecular cages &#8212; crucial for maximizing NLO performance. Additionally, due to the non&#8208;covalent interactions among [PAs3S3] polar molecular cages, PAS demonstrates an unexpectedly strong second harmonic generation (SHG) about 8 times that of AgGaS2, along with a significant band gap of 2.75&#8197;eV. Furthermore, PAS exhibits remarkable stability against air and moisture. These findings validate our design strategy and position PAS as a promising candidate for applications in IR NLO crystals.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Carbon Fixation Using Photosynthetic Organelles in Artificial Photosynthetic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosynthetic organelles were constructed to efficiently produce ATP in the presence of phycocyanin. They were encapsulated into giant unilamellar vesicles together with a carbon fixation pathway to build artificial photosynthetic cells to produce acetyl&#8208;CoA upon light irradiation.







Abstract
Building an artificial photosynthetic cell from scratch helps to understand the working mechanisms of chloroplasts. It is a challenge to achieve carbon fixation triggered by photosynthetic organelles in an artificial cell. ATP synthase and photosystem II (PSII) are purified and reconstituted onto the phospholipid membrane to fabricate photosynthetic organelles. With the integration of phycocyanin, the ATP production yield increases by 2.51&#8208;fold due to the enhanced light harvesting capability. The carbon fixation pathway is established by converting &#945;&#8208;oxoglutarate to acetyl&#8208;CoA and oxaloacetate with cascade enzyme reactions including the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), aconitase (ACO), and ATP citrate lyase (ACL). The photosynthetic organelles, phycocyanin, and carbon fixation pathway are encapsulated into giant unilamellar vesicles to obtain artificial photosynthetic cells, which convert &#945;&#8208;oxoglutarate to acetyl&#8208;CoA and oxaloacetate inside artificial cells upon light irradiation. The acetyl&#8208;CoA is the most important intermediate product in the cellular metabolic networks for the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. Our results provide a way for efficient light energy conversion to produce ATP and fix CO2, and pave the path to build autonomous artificial cells with more complicated metabolic networks.

         <title>Amplified Cascade Catalysis for RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amplified cascade catalysis consisting of glucose oxidase (GOx) deoxygenation and Fenton reaction is reported and applied to reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The two catalysts used in this amplified cascade catalysis can interact with each other, enabling regeneration of ferrocene catalyst and thus enhancing hydroxyl radical production and polymerization rate. The concept of amplified cascade catalysis and the way how a biocatalyst recycles a chemical catalyst to enhance catalysis efficiency may inspire development of sustainable and ecofriendly catalytic methodologies for organic and material synthesis.







Abstract
We report a conceptually new amplified cascade catalysis that converts oxygen to hydroxyl radical for controlled RAFT polymerization. This catalysis consists of two sequential reactions, deoxygenation catalyzed by glucose oxidase and Fenton reaction catalyzed by ferrocene. The two catalysts can communicate with each other, leading to ferrocene recycling and hence amplification in radical generation. Ferrocene recycling was confirmed by UV/Vis spectroscopy, molecular docking simulation, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as polymerization studies. This catalysis was applied to RAFT polymerization of various monomers, yielding well&#8208;defined homopolymers and diblock copolymers with controlled molecular weights and low dispersities. Poly(N,N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide) with molecular weight over 1 million g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 was also successfully synthesized under ambient conditions. Ferrocene&#8208;functionalized microspheres were prepared and used as recyclable Fenton catalyst for five consecutive polymerizations with minimal declination in monomer conversion, which further improved the ecofriendly character of this polymerization methodology.

         <title>Chiroptical Response of Carbon Nanocages Enhanced by Achiral Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The geometrical reinforcement of chiral carbon cages by supramolecular technique led to enhancement of sensitivity against circularly polarized red light with an improved dissymmetry factor where the achiral guests such as Ar, CO2, and CH3CN are engaged in inhibition of undesired arrangement of transition dipole moments.







Abstract
Opening up [60]fullerene makes itself inherently chiral without loss of congenital &#960;&#8208;conjugation. An immoderately large aperture on [60]fullerene, however, renders the molecule less rigid and therefore it would reduce dissymmetry factors. Herein, we examined supramolecular technique in geometrical reinforcement of chiral open&#8208;[60]fullerenes by encasing achiral guests such as Ar, CO2, and CH3CN. At a lowest&#8208;energy transition, we confirmed a guest&#8208;dependency on chiroptical responses with increasing a dissymmetry factor by nearly twice to three times. It should be noted that the guests play a negligible role in electronic structures of the carbon cages. Instead, they are engaged in preclusion of an orifice shrinking not to reduce chiroptical response.

         <title>Dynamically Stable Cu0Cu&#948;+ Pair Sites Based on In Situ&#8208;Exsolved Cu Nanoclusters on CaCO3 for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We systematically investigated factors influencing Cu&#8722;O reducibility, focusing on electron affinity and anion vacancy formation energy. The Cu/CaCO3 interface was found to generate low&#8208;reducibility Cu0Cu0.13+ sites, achieving an impressive C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 83.7&#8201;%. An in situ reconstruction strategy during CO2RR enabled dynamically stable, highly dispersed Cu nanoclusters on CaCO3 nanospheres.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;based catalysts are the choice for producing multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) during CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), where the Cu0Cu&#948;+ pair sites are proposed to be synergistic hotspots for C&#8722;C coupling. Maintaining their dynamic stability requires precise control over electron affinity and anion vacancy formation energy, posing significant challenges. Here, we present an in situ reconstruction strategy to create dynamically stable Cu0Cu0.18+OCa motifs at the interface of exsolved Cu nanoclusters and CaCO3 nanospheres (Cu/CaCO3). In situ XAFS analysis confirmed the low&#8208;valency state of Cu&#948;+ during CO2RR. DFT calculations demonstrated that the nanocluster size arises from the balance between metal&#8208;support interactions and Cu&#8722;Cu cohesive energy, while the dynamic stability of rich interfacial Cu&#948;+ sites is attributed to their low electron affinity and high CO32&#8722; vacancy formation energy, which collectively contribute to reduced reducibility. The transformed Cu/CaCO3 exhibits an impressive C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 83.7&#8201;% at a partial current density of 393&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, facilitated by adsorption of *CO with varying electronegativity at heterogeneous copper sites that lowers the C&#8722;C coupling energy barrier. Our findings establish insoluble carbonate as an effective anion pairing for Cu0Cu&#948;+ sites, highlighting the effectiveness of the in situ reconstitution strategy in producing a high density of dynamically stable Cu0Cu&#948;+ pair sites.

         <title>Precise Manipulation on the Structural Defects of Poly (Triazine Imide) Single Crystals for Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two compositionally complementary comonomers are employed to synthesize poly (triazine imide) single crystal and to continuously manipulate the nature of structural defect, aiming at obtaining the fully conjugated &#960;&#8208;system with atomic precision. By inhibiting the C&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced exciton radiative loss and N&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced nonradiative loss, a record apparent quantum efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% for photocatalytic overall water splitting is achieved.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers, represented by polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs), have risen to prominence as new&#8208;generation photocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS). Despite considerable efforts, achieving highly crystalline PCNs with minimal structural defects remains a great challenge, and it is also difficult to examine the exact impact of complex defect states on OWS process, which largely limits their quantum efficiency. Herein, we devise a &#8216;in&#8208;situ salt flux&#8217; assisted copolymerization protocol by using nitrogen&#8208;rich and nitrogen&#8208;deficient monomers to precisely manipulate the structural defects of poly (triazine imide) (PTI) single crystals. Stoichiometric control between two comonomers enables continuous tunning of carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;vacancies within PTI, allowing the construction of a series of PTI crystals with different defect states. Theoretical and experimental results unveil the carbon vacancies are related with the radiative decay of excitons, while the nonradiative decay is mainly derived from the nitrogen vacancies. Owing to the effective suppression of both radiative and nonradiative losses, the as&#8208;synthesized PTI achieves a record apparent quantum efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% by one&#8208;step&#8208;excitation OWS. This work highlights the significance of rational control of the structural defects and describes clear structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationships in PTI photocatalyst, offering guidance for the development of polymer photocatalysts for solar fuel production.

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Design of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts with Nonplanar and Triple Pyrrole&#8208;N Coordination for Highly Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper designs a series of nonplanar and precise triple&#8208;coordinated SACs (ppy&#8208;MN3) for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysis and proposes a new descriptor (&#916;&#1013;d&#8208;p). Moreover, constant&#8208;potential kinetics explain a low kinetic barrier under alkaline conditions due to hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the OOH* intermediate and interfacial water. This study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept and performance&#8208;oriented design of nonplanar catalysts with precise coordination configurations and presents a complement to the d&#8208;band theory for more accurately predicting the catalytic activities for nonplanar materials.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with nonplanar configurations possess unique capabilities for tailoring the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance compared with the ones with planar configurations, owing to the additional orbital rearrangement arising from the asymmetric coordination atoms. However, the systematic investigation of these nonplanar SACs has long been hindered by the difficulty in screening feasible nonplanar configurations and precisely controlling the coordination structures. Herein, we demonstrate a combined high&#8208;throughput screening and experimental verification of nonplanar SACs (ppy&#8208;MN3) with metal atoms triple&#8208;coordinated by pyrrole&#8208;N, for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysis. With the additional p&#8208;orbital rearrangement of N&#8208;ligands for ppy&#8208;MN3 during catalysis, a new descriptor on the energy difference between d&#8208;band center of metal sites and p&#8208;band centers of N&#8208;ligands (&#916;&#1013;d&#8722;p) is proposed to accurately identify the relationship between their catalytic activities and electronic structures, on top of the conventional d&#8208;band center theory. Consequently, ppy&#8208;ZnN3 is identified with excellent 2e&#8722; ORR activity (&#951;=0.08&#8197;eV) and selectivity, as well as a low 2e&#8722; ORR kinetic barrier under alkaline condition owing to a strong hydrogen bonding between OOH* intermediate and interfacial water, which is then experimentally verified by its high electrocatalytic H2O2 yield (43&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (92&#8201;%) under alkaline condition. This study thus presents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the performance&#8208;oriented and precise coordination design of nonplanar SACs for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, and, more importantly, provides an essential complement to the d&#8208;band theory for more accurately predicting the catalytic activities of catalysts with nonplanar configurations for series potential electrochemical processes.

         <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In Electric Field Strength in Ru/RuO2 Interfaces through Ni Doping to Enhance Hydrogen Conversion at Ampere&#8208;level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use DFT calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2 as the most promising candidate among 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2 (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). Ni&#8208;RuO2 is experimentally synthesized confirming that introducing Ni atoms promotes the partial reduction of RuO2 to form a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO2 interface with a strong built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical processes. Consequently, the Ni&#8208;RuO2 catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE in 1&#8197;M KOH delivers a voltage of only 1.71&#8197;V to reach 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 1000&#8197;h stable operation.







Abstract
Improving the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency is essential for developing advanced anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) that operate at industrial ampere&#8208;level currents. Herein, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2 as the leading candidate among various 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2 (where metal M includes Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). The incorporation of Ni atoms facilitates the partial reduction of RuO2, resulting in the formation of a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO2 interface having a significant built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical reactions. The resulted BIEF enhances electron transfer across the interface, which is critical in lowering energy barriers and accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. As a result, the Ni&#8208;RuO2 catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 20.85&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, with just 0.03&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of Ru loading. The highly effective BIEF, therefore, plays a pivotal role in the catalyst&#8216;s remarkable performance, allowing the Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE to require only 1.71&#8197;V to maintain stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over a 1000&#8208;hour period.

&lt;p&gt;We use DFT calculations to identify Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the most promising candidate among 3d transition metal-doped M-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is experimentally synthesized confirming that introducing Ni atoms promotes the partial reduction of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface with a strong built-in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical processes. Consequently, the Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based AEMWE in 1&#8197;M KOH delivers a voltage of only 1.71&#8197;V to reach 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 1000&#8197;h stable operation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency is essential for developing advanced anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) that operate at industrial ampere-level currents. Herein, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the leading candidate among various 3d transition metal-doped M-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (where metal M includes Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). The incorporation of Ni atoms facilitates the partial reduction of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in the formation of a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface having a significant built-in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical reactions. The resulted BIEF enhances electron transfer across the interface, which is critical in lowering energy barriers and accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. As a result, the Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a low Tafel slope of 20.85&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with just 0.03&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; of Ru loading. The highly effective BIEF, therefore, plays a pivotal role in the catalyst&#8216;s remarkable performance, allowing the Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based AEMWE to require only 1.71&#8197;V to maintain stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over a 1000-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Ring Assembly Facilitates the Synthesis of a [12]Cycloparaphenylene ABC&#8208;Type [3]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By threading a secondary ammonium salt through the crown ether and closing the third ring via CuAAC click reaction, we obtained a rare ABC&#8208;type hetero&#8208;[3]catenane comprising [12]CPP, 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and a dibenzylammonium macrocycle. X&#8208;ray crystallography shed light on the ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring pre&#8208;organization. Molecular simulations provided insights into the intriguing ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring dynamics of the [3]catenane.







Abstract
Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) represent a significant challenge for the synthesis of mechanically interlocked architectures, because they lack heteroatoms, which precludes traditional active and passive template methods. To circumvent this problem and explore the fundamental and functional properties of CPP rotaxanes and catenanes, researchers have resorted to unusual non&#8208;covalent and even to labor&#8208;intensive covalent template approaches. Herein, we report a ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring non&#8208;covalent template strategy that makes use of the surprisingly strong non&#8208;covalent inclusion of crown ethers into suitably sized CPPs. By threading a secondary ammonium salt through the crown ether and closing the third ring via CuAAC click reaction, we obtained a rare ABC&#8208;type hetero&#8208;[3]catenane comprising [12]CPP, 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and a dibenzylammonium macrocycle. X&#8208;ray crystallography shed light on the ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring pre&#8208;organization and the [3]catenane topology was confirmed by NMR and MS&#8208;MS studies. Molecular simulations provided insights into the intriguing ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring dynamics of the [3]catenane, which are highly dependent on the protonation state of the dibenzylammonium site. This ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assembly strategy opens new avenues for the synthesis of complex CPP architectures and their use in functional supramolecular systems.

         <title>Mass Transfer&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Membranes with Synergistic Light Utilization for High&#8208;Turbidity Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A suspended photothermal Fenton membrane is specifically designed to address the challenges of light attenuation and impurity interference in treating high&#8208;turbidity and colored wastewater. Impressive light utilization and mass transfer allow for continuous operation in a flow reactor for up to 10&#8197;days without any significant decline in actual industrial wastewater.







Abstract
The photo&#8208;Fenton process faces significant limitations in treating high&#8208;turbidity, colored wastewater due to light attenuation and impurity interference (blocked mass transfer). To address these issues, we developed a suspended photothermal Fenton membrane by loading a photothermal catalyst on a hydrophobically modified cotton filter paper, enabling precise suspension 1&#8197;mm below the water surface. This design achieved 89.49&#8201;% light utilization and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, even in wastewater with extreme chromaticity (10 multiples) and turbidity (703 NTU). The enhanced photothermal conversion accelerated molybdenum co&#8208;catalyzed Fenton reactions and improved peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, maintaining over 90&#8201;% phenol removal for 15&#8197;days. Mechanistic simulations revealed improved mass transfer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pollutants at the solid&#8211;liquid interface, with PMS diffusion identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step. The membrane resisted fouling from suspended solids and maintained stable operation in soil&#8208;containing solutions for 10&#8197;days. This innovative approach offers an efficient solution for degrading pollutants in dark&#8208;colored, high&#8208;turbidity wastewater, overcoming traditional process limitations.

Co&#8208;feeding CO2 for methylfuran aromatization (CCMA) was investigated by Anqing Zheng and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202420779). Compared to the individual conversion of methylfuran, CCMA boosts arene formation, enhances catalyst stability, and enables efficient CO2 reduction simultaneously. Employing SVUV&#8208;PI&#8208;ReTOF&#8208;MS, operando spectroscopic techniques, and isotopic labeling elucidates key reaction pathways, paving the way for the innovative and efficient valorization of biomass in a carbon&#8208;negative manner.

In their Research Article (e202416088), Holger Helten and co&#8208;authors present a strictly alternating BN&#8208;isostere of poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) and well&#8208;defined oligomers. The polymerization was achieved by an AB&#8208;type step&#8208;growth polycondensation of a monomer (illustrated on the top right) featuring one N and one B terminus. The compounds show pronounced fluorescence with hypsochromic shifts with increasing chain length and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties to water (AIEE), solvent polarity and viscosity, temperature, as well as mechanical impact (Cover design: Leonie W&#252;st).

Oligophosphorylated peptides were prepared by Kevin Qian, Bj&#246;rn Hanf, Christopher Cummins, and Dorothea Fiedler in their Research Article (e202419147). Oligophosphorimidazolide reagents are presented that enable the conjugation of multiple phosphates to phosphopeptides, yielding derivatives with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths. The picture illustrates different peptides with varying phosphate chain lengths, bearing either a terminal protecting group or a free oligophosphate moiety.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers an introduction on the recent development of the porphyrin&#8208;based COFs with advantageous visible light absorption ability, adjustable optic/electronic properties, definite active center, post&#8208;modification capability, and excellent stability for photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction in terms of the synthetic methods, structure optimization, performance enhancement, and catalytic mechanisms.







Abstract
Photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction into high&#8208;value products are promising strategies for addressing both environmental problems and energy crisis. Duo to their advantageous visible light absorption ability, adjustable optic/electronic properties, definite active center, post&#8208;modification capability, and excellent stability, porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as attractive photo/electro&#8208;catalysts towards CO2 reduction. In this review, the research progress of the porphyrin&#8208;based COFs for photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction is summarized including the design principles, catalytic performance, and reaction mechanism. In addition, this review also presents some challenges and prospects for the application of porphyrin&#8208;based COFs in photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction, laying the base for both fundamental research and application efforts.

Porous supramolecular crystalline materials (PSCMs) are a type of porous supramolecular assemblies stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, which have shown great potential in photocatalysis by virtue of their unique features of well&#8208;defined and synthetically tailorable structures, mild synthesis conditions, easy healing and regeneration. In this Minireview, we summarize the syntheses, structural features and photocatalytic applications for PSCMs, including CO2 reduction, H2 evolution, H2O2 production, organic transformation and pollutant degradation. The challenges and opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance PSCMs&#8208;based photocatalysts are also put forward.







Abstract
Porous supramolecular crystalline materials (PSCMs), such as hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), &#960; frameworks, can be defined as a type of porous supramolecular assemblies stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and other non&#8208;covalent interactions. Benefiting from the unique features of mild synthesis conditions, well&#8208;defined and synthetically tailorable structures, easy healing and regeneration, PSCMs have garnered widespread interest in research fields including molecular recognition, sensor, gas storage and separation. Moreover, they have emerged as promising photocatalysts because these PSCMs could be readily endowed with optical function, and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking can offer channels for electron transfer to boost the photocatalytic activity. However, the research on PSCMs for photocatalysis is still at an early stage, and a review on this topic would help to promote the development of supramolecular chemistry. In this Minireview, we first introduce the synthesis methods for PSCMs, and then highlight their advantages in photocatalysis. Subsequently, we summarize the applications of PSCMs in photocatalysis including CO2 reduction, H2 evolution, H2O2 production, organic transformation and pollutant degradation, and we put particular emphasis on delineating the structure&#8208;performance relationship. At the end, we discuss the challenges and perspectives in developing high&#8208;performance PSCM&#8208;based photocatalysts.

As an efficient synthetic strategy, radical rearrangement reactions demonstrate significant potential in the construction of complex valuable molecules. This Minireview summarizes the emerging area of asymmetric functionalization involving radical&#8208;mediated functional&#8208;group migration (FGM) reactions, providing extensive discussion of the reported examples and highlighting the potential of this area







Abstract
Along with the renaissance of radical chemistry, the past decade has witnessed rapid development in radical&#8208;mediated rearrangement reactions. A wide diversity of radical approaches harnessing functional&#8208;group migration (FGM) have been devised to enhance both synthetic efficiency and molecular complexity. However, the application of FGM reactions to construct stereogenic centers remains underexplored owing to the inherent challenges of asymmetric radical reactions. In this Minireview, we summarize the emerging area of asymmetric functionalization involving radical&#8208;mediated FGM reactions. Enantioselectivity can be regulated by chiral substrates, auxiliaries or reagents, or achieved through asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis. This synthetic strategy demonstrates its superiority in the production of valuable complex molecules that are otherwise difficult to obtain by conventional methods.

         <title>Revealing the Potential of a Chimaera: a Peptide&#8208;Peptide Nucleic Acid Molecule Designed To Interact with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can a chimeric molecule mimic RNA and bind an RNA&#8208;binding protein? We designed and synthesized a ligand with a dual nature within the same sequence: a pure peptide component and a peptide nucleic acid one. This chimaera is able to target the construct of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid protein, which comprises the RNA&#8208;binding globular domain and the two flanking disordered regions.







Abstract
Numerous RNA&#8208;binding proteins have modular structures with folded domains and intrinsically disordered regions, making their atomic characterization difficult. This severely limits the investigation of their modalities of interaction as well as the evaluation of possible ways to interfere with this process. We report herein a rational strategy for the design and synthesis of a ligand able to interfere with the protein function, monitoring the interaction through solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our approach employs a chimaera composed of two different fragments, a peptide and a peptide&#8208;nucleic acid, allowing to incorporate in the resulting molecule key features to address RNA&#8208;protein interactions. Focusing on two constructs of the Nucleocapsid protein from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the globular N&#8208;terminal domain and a more extended one comprising also two flanking intrinsically disordered regions, we demonstrate the enhanced affinity of the designed peptide&#8208;peptide nucleic acid chimaera for the protein compared to a related peptide lacking &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking contributions within the chain. Furthermore, we emphasize the increasingly recognized relevant and synergistic role of the intrinsically disordered regions in protein&#8208;ligand interaction.

         <title>Stereoselective Preparation and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkenyl Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile preparation of alkenyl sulfoximines, monoaza analogues of sulfones, by condensation of alkyl sulfoximines with aldehydes and their palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling are reported. These alkenyl electrophiles underwent unique oxidative addition of the C&#8722;S bond to Pd to provide alkenes with three substituents. DFT calculations revealed the crucial role of the boronic acid in the transformation.







Abstract
Although numerous transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of alkenyl electrophiles with a sulfur(VI) leaving group, mainly alkenyl sulfones, have been developed, most rely heavily on highly nucleophilic Grignard reagents, and the use of organoboron reagents remains challenging. We report herein facile preparation and the following Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction of alkenyl sulfoximine, a monoaza analog of sulfone. The condensation of alkyl sulfoximine with aldehydes, developed in this study, makes alkenyl sulfoximines more readily available. The resulting alkenes undergo an unprecedented oxidative addition of the C&#8722;S bond to the Pd center. This cross&#8208;coupling proceeds with retention of its original stereochemistry and provided alkenes bearing three different functionalities in a stereoselective fashion. DFT calculations highlight the critical role of boronic acid and in situ&#8208;generated boroxines in facilitating this transformation.

         <dc:description>
We report herein an unprecedented desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;diynes via a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric redox cycloisomerization. This method operates through a novel mechanism involving initiation at the allylic alcohol moiety, and provides efficient access to multi&#8208;functional pyrrolidines and tetrahydrofurans in high to excellent stereoselectivities. Diverse derivatizations of the heterocyclic products including intriguing skeletal rearrangements have also been demonstrated.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Epoxidation of Aldehydes with &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Diazosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation reaction between aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazosilanes for the synthesis of chiral trifluoromethyl epoxides have been developed, which has overcome racemic background reaction. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The observed positive nonlinear effect supports ligand acceleration. The gram scale reaction and down&#8208;stream transformation based on the removable silyl group demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.







Abstract
Catalytic epoxidation of readily available aldehydes with diazo compounds is an atom economical strategy to synthesize epoxides. However, the asymmetric epoxidation reaction of aldehydes and fluorinated diazo compounds is challenging, because of the severe racemic background reaction. Herein, we report the first Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation reaction between aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazosilanes for the synthesis of chiral trifluoromethyl epoxides. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The observed positive nonlinear effect supports the ligand acceleration and the achievement of high enantioselectivity with a chiral ligand possessing lower enantiopurity. The gram scale reaction and down&#8208;stream transformation based on the removable silyl group demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.

         <title>Contrasting Mechanochromic Luminescence of Enantiopure and Racemic Pyrenylprolinamides: Elucidating Solid&#8208;State Excimer Orientation by Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrasting mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) has been observed for enantiopure and racemic crystals of pyrenylprolinamides with different substituents. Enantiopure crystals exhibited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and mechanochromic CPL was achieved due to the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded excimers in the amorphous state. For the first time, the amorphous&#8208;state CPL was elucidated based on the excimer chirality rule.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) have independently made substantial progress in recent years. However, the exploration of MCL in solid&#8208;state CPL materials, which holds practical significance, is still in its infancy. Herein, we report the MCL properties of readily accessible chiral pyrenylprolinamides bearing tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or 2,2,2&#8208;trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Troc) groups. Enantiopure crystals of the Boc derivative display a greater MCL wavelength shift than racemic crystals, while the Troc derivative exhibit the opposite trend. Most notably, the enantiopure crystals show mechanochromic CPL. Unlike in previous examples, where CPL is quenched upon amorphization, robust CPL spectra were observed even in the amorphous states. By applying the excimer chirality rule, we have, for the first time, acquired insights into the excited&#8208;state structures within mechanically generated amorphous states. These findings offer a novel design strategy for developing mechanochromic CPL materials, paving the way for the future advancements in this emerging field.

         <title>High Pressure Synthesis of Pr2O5 &#8211; A Unique Lanthanoid(IV) Oxide Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of PrO2 and oxygen at 27&#8197;GPa in a diamond anvil cell afforded the unique oxide peroxide Pr2(O2)O3 in which praseodymium is found in its rare oxidation state of +IV. Pr2(O2)O3 constitutes the most oxygen rich binary phase of any lanthanoid and oxygen. It could be characterised by X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction analysis at various pressure points, Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Reacting praseodymium(IV) oxide with oxygen at 27&#8197;GPa in a diamond anvil cell yielded the oxide peroxide Pr2IV(O2)O3, which was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction on multi&#8208;grain samples, Raman spectroscopy and quantum theoretical calculations at various pressure points. The presence of tetravalent praseodymium ions is supported by electronic structure calculations, showing a band gap of ca. 1.2&#8197;eV, which is consistent with the anticipated chemical model of an ionic solid. Pr2(O2)O3 thus far represents the most oxygen rich phase of any binary compound of a lanthanoid and oxygen and is the first example of a peroxide anion next to Pr4+. Additionally, these results demonstrate that instead of oxidizing the praseodymium ions past their +IV oxidation state, oxygen undergoes a comproportionation to form peroxide anions. Direct oxidation of the oxide anions by Pr4+&#8208;ions was ruled out by a control experiment in argon instead of oxygen, where no oxidation of oxide ions was observed.

         <dc:description>
We have developed a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed lactonization reaction to activate non&#8208;polar C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in cyclobutene and cyclopropane carboxylic acids. Using a dual ligand approach with pyridone&#8208;phosphine significantly boosts catalyst reactivity, creating a robust catalyst for unsaturated lactonization. This method shows excellent functional group tolerance and offers a straightforward, adaptable synthesis pathway for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;lactones. Computational studies provided mechanistic insights, identifying the TDI and TDTS, and revealing the role of dual ligands in facilitating the reaction.







Abstract
The activation of non&#8208;polar aliphatic C&#8722;C bonds represents a significant challenge that remains to be addressed in the field of Pd(II) catalysis. In this study, we present a dual ligand approach as a means of addressing this issue. The process entails lactonization of cyclobutane and cyclopropane carboxylic acid via the activation of non&#8208;polar C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond despite the high feasibility of both &#959;rtho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H and &#946; or &#947; &#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H activation. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to reveal the mechanistic insights and elucidate the role of dual ligands in facilitating this challenging transformation.

The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in heterocycles holds considerable importance in chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recently, the regioselective introduction of various functionalities at the meta&#8208;position of azines, utilizing readily accessible dearomatized intermediates, has emerged as a highly attractive approach. Along these lines, the meta&#8208;hydroxylation of azines is an appealing but challenging transformation due to the inherent electronic nature of these heterocycles. Herein, we report a meta&#8208;selective hydroxylation of pyridines, quinolines and isoquinolines through easily accessible oxazinoaza&#8208;arene intermediates. The nucleophilic C3&#8208;position of these dienamine&#8208;type intermediates engages in highly regioselective hydroxylation upon treatment with electrophilic peroxides.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroglycosylation of Alkynes for the Synthesis of Vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroglycosylation of terminal alkynes was developed with bench&#8208;stable ortho&#8208;iodobiphenyl substituted sulfides as glycosyl donors. This reaction, which proceeds by the intermediacy of glycosyl radicals, affords E&#8208;configured vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity and can be applied to the derivatization of bioactive compounds and the preparation of naturally occurring compounds.







Abstract
Herein we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroglycosylation of terminal alkynes, employing bench&#8208;stable ortho&#8208;iodobiphenyl (oIB) substituted sulfides as glycosyl donors. This reaction occurs with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity to afford E&#8208;configured vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, a class of compounds nontrivial to access by previous methods. The use of a bis(oxazoline) ligand with bulky side chains is critical for the high selectivities observed. Aryl iodides have not been used previously as surrogates for alkyl (glycosyl) electrophiles in Co&#8722;H catalyzed reactions. The transformation features mild reaction conditions, simple reagents, and broad substrate scope. This method can be applied to the derivatization of bioactive compounds and the preparation of naturally occurring products. Mechanistic studies suggest this stereoconvergent process involves glycosyl radicals as key reaction intermediates.

         <title>Fluoro&#8208;Fucosylation Enables the Interrogation of the Lea&#8208;LecB Interaction by BioNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis antigen Lea is a selective ligand for Lectin B in P. aeruginosa. Interrogating a key hydrogen bond in this complex has important ramifications for antibiotic research. Through the development of stereoselective fluoro&#8208;fucosylation, it has been possible to design F&#8208;Lea as a structural biology tool. BioNMR analyses with both the native (Lea) and fluorinated (F&#8208;Lea) glycans have unequivocally established the importance of this interaction in the Lea&#8208;LecB complex.







Abstract
Fucosylation patterns in cell&#8208;surface glycans are essential mediators of recognition and signalling. Aberrations in these signatures serve as vital diagnostic markers of disease progression, and so understanding fucose&#8208;protein interactions at the molecular level is crucial. Molecular editing of l&#8208;fucose (Fuc) at C2 with fluorine provides a platform to reconcile the ubiquity of fucosylation with the paucity of strategies to interrogate site&#8208;specific interactions. Through judicious introduction of a pseudo&#8208;equatorial fluorine [C(sp3)&#8208;F] adjacent to the anomeric position, &#946;&#8208;selective fucosylation can be achieved with a range of diverse acceptors (&gt;50&#8201;:&#8201;1): the selectivity of this process can be inverted through changes in the donor scaffold. Reaction development was driven by the desire to construct a fluorinated analogue of Lewis antigen a (F&#8208;Lea), in which fluorine replaces a key OH group at C2. Lea is a ligand for Lectin B (LecB) in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and thus delineating the importance of key interactions in this complex has ramifications for drug discovery. Independent syntheses of Lea and F&#8208;Lea, and systematic bioNMR analyses with both glycans has unequivocally established the essential role of O2 of fucose in the Lea&#8208;LecB complex.

         <title>Zeolite Blending: A New Approach to Direct Crystallization of Aluminosilicate Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The blending of two types of zeolites, MFI and Beta, as raw material in the interzeolite conversion/transformation method resulted in the collection of the required composite building&#8208;units of the CON&#8208;type topology, leading to the direct crystallization of the CON&#8208;type aluminosilicate with high Al content (Si/Al=20).







Abstract
Various synthesis methods for zeolites have been developed to date; however, precise control over aluminum (Al) content remains a significant challenge. For instance, in the case of CON&#8208;type zeolites, it is especially difficult to obtain a Si/Al ratio below a value of approximately 100 by direct synthesis, and below approximately 30 by post&#8208;treatment. In this study, we have developed a novel direct synthesis method of the CON&#8208;type zeolite having desired Al content by applying the interzeolite conversion/interzeolite transformation, wherein precursor zeolites that possess common composite building units (CBUs) with the target zeolite are employed as the Al and Si source. Initially, a single zeolite was utilized as a precursor, resulting in the successful synthesis of a high Al CON&#8208;type zeolite (Si/Al=40). Finally, we developed a novel synthesis method of the CON&#8208;type zeolite; blending of two types of zeolites, MFI and Beta, as starting material in the IZC method led to the direct crystallization of the CON&#8208;type aluminosilicate with high Al content (Si/Al=20).

         <title>Putting Charge Transfer Degree as a Bridge Connecting Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy revealed that ZnO with various amounts of copper doping exhibit very high consistency in the photocatalytic activity and the &#961;CT for surface&#8208;absorbed reactant molecules. This study firstly demonstrated the effectiveness of SERS spectroscopy based on the CT enhancement mechanism in predicting the interfacial CT process in semiconductor photocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling model reactions.







Abstract
To date, few systematic approach has been established for predicting catalytic performance by analyzing the spectral information of molecules adsorbed on photocatalyst surfaces. Effective charge transfer (CT) between the semiconductor photocatalysts and surface&#8208;absorbed molecules is essential for enhancing catalytic activity and optimizing light energy utilization. This study aimed to validate the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based on the CT enhancement mechanism in investigating the CT process during semiconductor photocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling model reactions. A copper ion doping strategy was employed to simultaneously enhance the SERS effect and catalytic activity of zinc oxide (ZnO) derived from metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). By analyzing molecular fingerprint SERS spectra, we calculated the degree of CT (&#961;CT), revealing that SERS enhancement is attributed to the CT mechanism. In situ SERS spectra confirmed a high correlation between the catalytic activity and &#961;CT of ZnO with varying copper ion doping levels. A range of photoelectric and spectroscopic tests validated the effectiveness of SERS in linking CT to photocatalytic performance, consistent with first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations. This finding is also validated in other semiconductor materials and catalytic reactions, demonstrating the broad applicability of &#961;CT for predicting and evaluating SERS and catalytic activity.

         <title>Helical Quintulene: Synthesis, Chirality, and Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical, bowl&#8208;shaped extended quintulene (1) was synthesized by incomplete dehydrocyclization, revealing quintuple [5]helicenes fused at the rim. Chiroptical studies on 1 demonstrated strong dissymmetry in both the absorption and luminescence. The bowl shape of 1 enables supramolecular assembly between 1 and fullerene. These findings expand the structural diversity of quintulene and represent the first example of a cycloarene fused with helicenes.







Abstract
Quintulene is a quintuply symmetrical cycloarene with a positively curved molecular geometry. First described by Staab and Sauer in 1984, its successful synthesis was not achieved until 2020. Due to the challenges posed by its positive curvature, structural extensions of quintulene have been studied rarely. In this work, we report the synthesis of a chiral quintulene (1) featuring five [5]helicene units at its rim constructed through the introduction of steric hindrance. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the structure of 1 that showcases a unique chirality combining helicity and rotational symmetry. The enantiomers of 1 were separated and their chiroptical properties were examined, revealing the dissymmetric absorption and luminescence. Additionally, the bowl shape facilitates supramolecular assembly between 1 and fullerenes, with a binding constant to C60 10&#8208;fold higher than to C70. This work expands the structural diversity of quintulene and bridges the structures of cycloarenes and multi&#8208;helicenes, paving the way for the structural design of chiral cycloarenes.

         <title>Manipulating the dynamics of chiral molecular bearings through subtle structural changes of guest molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isotropic rotation of a diamondoid molecule within a cylinder array was hindered by subtle structural changes introduced through a fluorine substituent. This bias in rotation induced precession with its direction controlled by an external electric field.







Abstract
By introducing fluorine substituents, anisotropic rotational motion was induced in diamondoid guests trapped in cylindrical hosts arranged in a 2D honeycomb crystal. Despite the subtle structural changes, the substituent hindered flipping motions in the host and biased its rotations toward tilted precession. The fluorine substituent facilitated the dielectric response of the crystal, as revealed through dielectric constant measurements, which provided insight into the detailed dynamics of the anisotropic rotations. The up&#8208;down flipping motion of the guest within the 2D crystal was constrained by an energy barrier but remained manipulable under an external electric field. Consequently, the angular momentum of the spinning guest, with its C&#8722;F pole, was forced to align with the applied electric field.

         <title>Enhanced Azo Dye Removal through Sequential Ultrasound&#8208;Assisted&#8208;Treatment and Photocatalysis Using CdZnS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

A novel sequential adsorption&#8208;photocatalytic system for the efficient degradation of complex dye mixtures in concentrated wastewater, showcasing enhanced removal kinetics and superior pollutant&#8208;catalyst interaction.







Abstract
The treatment of high&#8208;concentration azo dyes remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of conventional single&#8208;mode approaches. Here, we propose an integrated strategy that sequentially combines ultrasound&#8208;assisted adsorption with photocatalysis using CdZnS solid solutions to efficiently and rapidly remove high&#8208;concentration azo dyes. CdZnS exhibits high adsorption capacity and exceptional photocatalytic activity, enabling initial dye capture and enrichment, followed by significantly enhanced photocatalytic degradation. The adsorption of Congo Red (CR) on CdZnS solid solutions follows the Freundlich and pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order models, demonstrating a multilayer adsorption behavior involving physical and chemical interactions. Ultrasound assistance during the first stage not only significantly reduces equilibrium time, but also results in enhanced negative charges in CdZnS that extend to the subsequent photocatalysis stage. This charge enhancement substantially improves CR photodegradation performance, establishing synergistic interactions between ultrasonic treatment and photodegradation. The system demonstrates excellent performance in treating both concentrated single dyes and complex dye mixtures, maintaining high efficiency over multiple treatment cycles. This integrated approach provides new insights for developing more effective technologies for dye degradation and practical wastewater treatment applications.

         <title>Semirational Protein Engineering of a Decarboxylative Aldolase for the Regiodivergent and Stereodivergent Synthesis of Cyclic Imino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The decarboxylative aldolase UstD was semirationally engineered through a focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy. The obtained mutant showed complementary regioselectivity and stereoselectivity to the wild&#8208;type UstD, which enabled the divergent synthesis of cyclic imino acids in excellent yields and selectivity.







Abstract
Aldolases are powerful C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes for asymmetric organic synthesis because of their supreme stereoselectivity, compatibility with diverse electrophiles and nucleophiles, and promising scalability. Stereodivergent engineering of aldolases to tune the selectivity for the synthesis of stereoisomers of chiral molecules is highly desirable but has rarely been reported. Herein we report the semirational engineering of the decarboxylative aldolase UstD with a focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to perform a C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reaction with dione electrophiles. The variant obtained from a small mutant library showed divergent regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity compared to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, resulting in the production of 30 cyclic imino acids with stereocenters at the &#945; and &#947; positions. Molecular dynamics simulation and kinetic data revealed the basis of selectivity.
