         <title>Noninvasive Early Diagnosing of Allograft Rejection by a Granzyme B Protease Responsive NIR&#8208;II Bioimaging Nanosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Early diagnosis of allograft rejection helps to improve the immune&#8208;related management of transplant recipients. The clinically&#8208;used core needle biopsy method is invasive and subject to sampling error. In vivo fluorescence imaging for monitoring immune&#8208;related processes has the advantages of non&#8208;invasiveness, fast feedback and high sensitivity. Herein, we report a responsive second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent nanosensor (ErGZ) to detect early allograft rejection. ErGZ allows ratiometric in vivo fluorescence sensing of granzyme B, which is overexpressed in recipients&#8217; T cells during the onset of rejection. The sensor demonstrates efficacious detection of allograft rejection with high sensitivity and specificity, which accomplishes non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of rejection in skin and deep buried islets transplant mice models 2 d and 5 d earlier than biopsy, by in vivo fluorescence imaging and urinary detection, respectively, providing a valuable approach for therapeutical management.</dc:description>

         <title>Mobile Molecules: Reactivity Profiling Guides Faster Movement on a Cysteine Track</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical stepping of biopolymers within a protein nanopore suggests an enzymeless means of sequence characterization. Using a nanoreactor approach, we elucidated the reactivity profile of cysteine footholds along a protein track. Faster chemical stepping was achieved by rational mutagenesis and optimization of reaction conditions. In the future, the system has the potential for directional molecular motion at milliseconds per step.







Abstract
We previously reported a molecular hopper, which makes sub&#8208;nanometer steps by thiol&#8208;disulfide interchange along a track with cysteine footholds within a protein nanopore. Here we optimize the hopping rate (ca. 0.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 in the previous work) with a view towards rapid enzymeless biopolymer characterization during translocation within nanopores. We first took a single&#8208;molecule approach to obtain the reactivity profiles of individual footholds. The pKa values of cysteine thiols within a pore ranged from 9.17 to 9.85, and the pH&#8208;independent rate constants of the thiolates with a small&#8208;molecule disulfide varied by up to 20&#8208;fold. Through site&#8208;specific mutagenesis and a pH increase from 8.5 to 9.5, the overall hopping rate of a DNA cargo along a five&#8208;cysteine track was accelerated 4&#8208;fold, and the rate&#8208;limiting step 21&#8208;fold.

         <title>Electrode materials for desalination of water via capacitive deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have seen the emergence of capacitive deionization (CDI) as a promising desalination technique for converting sea and wastewater into potable water, due to its energy efficiency and eco&#8208;friendly nature. However, its low salt removal capacity and parasitic reactions have limited its effectiveness. As a result, the development of porous carbon nanomaterials as electrode materials have been explored, while taking into account of material characteristics such as morphology, wettability, high conductivity, chemical robustness, cyclic stability, specific surface area, and ease of production. To tackle the parasitic reaction issue, membrane capacitive deionization (mCDI) was proposed which utilizes ion&#8208;exchange membranes coupled to the electrode. Fabrication techniques along with the experimental parameters used to evaluate the desalination performance of different materials are discussed in this review to provide an overview of improvements made for CDI and mCDI desalination purposes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled cobalt(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation reaction for the &#946;&#8208;selective synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides from glycals is described. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions by a radical pathway and may inspire the development of similar stereoselective coupling reactions, particularly in the field of carbohydrate synthesis.







Abstract
We report a ligand&#8208;controlled CoII&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) coupling hydroalkylation for direct and &#946;&#8208;selective synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides from glycals. This reaction proceeds by a radical pathway for alkyl halide activation and is &#946;&#8208;selective through ligand control. This approach may inspire the development of further stereoselective coupling reactions with potential application in the field of carbohydrates.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Electrochemical CoII&#8208;catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Oxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical CoII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation is reported. A broad range of alkoxylated phosphinamides were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A cobalt(III) alcohol complex was prepared and characterized, and was found to be a key intermediate in this reaction. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxidation of CoIII to CoIV was facilitated by a base.







Abstract
Metalla&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H oxygenation represents one of the most straightforward and sustainable approaches to access valuable oxygenated molecules. Despite the significant advances, the development of enantioselective electrochemical C&#8722;H oxygenation reaction is very challenging and remains elusive. Herein, we described the first electrochemical CoII&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation. A broad range of enantioenriched alkoxylated phosphinamides were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). An unusual cobalt(III) alcohol complex was prepared and fully characterized, which was proven to be a key intermediate of this C&#8722;H alkoxylation reaction. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxidation of CoIII to CoIV was facilitated by a base and the whole process proceeded through a cobalt(III/IV/II) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Introduction of Bioorthogonal Handles to Nanopores by Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the genetic code expansion strategy, an azido amino acid is site&#8208;specifically incorporated into a biological nanopore and served as a &#8220;chemical clasp&#8221;, enabling bioorthogonal conjugation of DNA or proteins to generate nanopore sensors with novel sensing capacities. The lysozyme&#8208;conjugated pore was further demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the discrimination of different oligosaccharides.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific functionalization of natural amino acid&#8208;containing biological nanopores is pivotal in single molecule sensing. However, pore engineering methodologies are restricted to a limited choice and introduction of unnatural chemical components is extremely difficult. Herein we report the genetic code expansion (GCE) strategy to introduce unnatural amino acid (UAA) to an octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore.

     alt="Site-Specific Introduction of Bioorthogonal Handles to Nanopores by Genetic Code Expansion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the genetic code expansion strategy, an azido amino acid is site-specifically incorporated into a biological nanopore and served as a &#8220;chemical clasp&#8221;, enabling bioorthogonal conjugation of DNA or proteins to generate nanopore sensors with novel sensing capacities. The lysozyme-conjugated pore was further demonstrated as a proof-of-principle for the discrimination of different oligosaccharides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site-specific functionalization of natural amino acid-containing biological nanopores is pivotal in single molecule sensing. However, pore engineering methodologies are restricted to a limited choice and introduction of unnatural chemical components is extremely difficult. Herein we report the genetic code expansion (GCE) strategy to introduce unnatural amino acid (UAA) to an octameric &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; porin A (MspA) nanopore. GCE allows for rapid and efficient introduction of bioorthogonal reactive site (i.e., azide) to the pore rim, and conjugation of single stranded DNA or lysozyme was demonstrated. The lysozyme-conjugated pore was further used for the discrimination of different oligosaccharides, demonstrating a sensing capacity that a bare MspA nanopore does not possess. GCE with bioorthogonal handles, which has never been previously applied in the preparation of nanopores, is a versatile strategy for pore engineering and may further expand the application scenarios of nanopores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Machine learning (ML) algorithms are currently emerging as powerful tools in all areas of science. Conventionally, ML is understood as a fundamentally data&#8208;driven endeavour. Unfortunately, large well&#8208;curated databases are sparse in chemistry. In this contribution, I therefore review science&#8208;driven ML approaches which do not rely on &#8220;big data&#8221;, focusing on the atomistic modelling of materials and molecules. In this context, the term science&#8208;driven refers to approaches that begin with a scientific question and then ask what training data and model design choices are appropriate. As key features of science&#8208;driven ML, the automated and purpose&#8208;driven collection of data and the use of chemical and physical priors to achieve high data&#8208;efficiency are discussed. Furthermore, the importance of appropriate model evaluation and error estimation is emphasized.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Phase Regulation to Restrain Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination for Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite LEDs with EQE Exceeding 15&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;performing sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with peak external quantum efficiency exceeding 15&#8201;% is attained by the use of a synergetic modulation strategy, regarding defect passivation and phase distribution regulation, via the incorporation of a bifunctional molecular additive.







Abstract
Achieving efficient blue electroluminescence (EL) remains the fundamental challenge that impedes perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) towards commercial applications. The bottleneck accounting for the inefficient blue PeLEDs is broadly attributed to the poor&#8208;emissive blue perovskite emitters based on either mixed halide engineering or reduced&#8208;dimensional strategy. Herein, we report the high&#8208;performing sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs (490&#8197;nm) with the maximum EQE exceeding 15&#8201;% by incorporating a molecular modifier, namely 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Difluorophenone, for significantly suppressing the non&#8208;radiative recombination and tuning of the low&#8208;dimensional phase distribution of quasi&#8208;2D blue perovskites, which represents a remarkable paradigm for developing the new generation of blue lighting sources.

         <title>Selective Synthesis and Structural Transformation of a 4&#8208;Ravel Containing Four Crossings and Featuring Cp*Rh/Ir Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented [5+10] icosanuclear molecular 4&#8208;ravels containing four crossings have been generated using a single&#8208;step strategy. This topology is achieved by utilizing parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions with carefully selected naphthoquinoyl Cp*M building blocks and X&#8208;shaped pyridyl ligands.







Abstract
Intricately interwoven topologies are continually being synthesized and are ultimately equally versatile and significant at the nanoscale level; however, reports concerning ravel structures, which are highly entwined new topological species, are extremely rare and fraught with tremendous synthesis challenges. To solve the synthesis problem, a tetrapodontic pyridine ligand L1 with two types of olefinic bond units and two Cp*M&#8208;based building blocks (E1, M=Rh; E2, M=Ir) featuring large conjugated planes was prepared to perform the self&#8208;assembly. Two unprecedented [5+10] icosanuclear molecular 4&#8208;ravels containing four crossings were obtained by parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in a single&#8208;step strategy. Remarkably, reversible structural transformations between the 4&#8208;ravel and the corresponding metallocage could be realized by concentration changes and solvent&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced effects. X&#8208;ray crystallographic data and NMR spectroscopy provide full confirmation of these phenomena.

         <title>Electrochemical&#8208;Mediated Regenerable FeII Active Sites for Efficient Uranium Extraction at Ultra&#8208;Low Cell Voltage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work coupled electrochemical mediated FeII/FeIII redox with uranium extraction and realized high efficiency uranium extraction under ultra&#8208;low cell voltage (&#8722;0.1&#8197;V) in seawater with 20&#8197;ppm UO2(NO3)2. The findings also provide inspirations for other metal resource recovery applications.







Abstract
Nano&#8208;reduced iron (NRI) is a promising uranium adsorbent due to its strong reducibility and good selectivity, but it still faces the challenges of slow kinetics, limited and non&#8208;renewable active sites. In this work, we realized high efficiency uranium extraction under ultra&#8208;low cell voltage (&#8722;0.1&#8197;V) in seawater with 20&#8197;ppm UO2(NO3)2 solution by coupling electrochemical mediated FeII/FeIII redox and uranium extraction. The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency of NRI after electrochemical uranium extraction (EUE) could reach 452&#8197;mg/g and 99.1&#8201;%, respectively. Combined with quasi&#8208;operando/operando characterization technologies, we clarified the mechanism of EUE and revealed that continuously regenerating FeII active sites by electroreduction could significantly enhance the property of EUE. This work here provides a new electrochemical mediated and low energy consumption uranium extraction strategy which also provides a reference for other metal resource recovery.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost, High&#8208;Strength Cellulose&#8208;based Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;strength cellulose&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte was developed with high Li+ conductivity, Li+ transference number (0.85) and excellent interface stability. The delicate design results in an unprecedented 1200 cycles with 97.7&#8201;% capacity retention at 1&#8197;C and 25&#176;C is achieved for the assembled solid&#8208;state batteries, which provides a crucial solution for the industrial production of next&#8208;generation batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries are considered as the next generation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, their solid electrolytes suffer from low ionic conductivity, poor interface performance, and high production costs, restricting their commercial application. Herein, a low&#8208;cost cellulose acetate&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte (C&#8208;CLA QPE) was developed with a high Li+ transference number (
) of 0.85 and excellent interface stability. The prepared LiFePO4 (LFP)|C&#8208;CLA QPE|Li batteries exhibited excellent cycle performance with a capacity retention of 97.7&#8201;% after 1200 cycles at 1&#8197;C and 25&#8201;&#176;C. The experimental results and Density Function Theory (DFT) simulation revealed that the partially esterified side groups in the CLA matrix contribute to the migration of Li+ and enhance electrochemical stability. This work provides a promising strategy for fabricating cost&#8208;effective, stable polymer electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A low-cost, high-strength cellulose-based quasi-solid polymer electrolyte was developed with high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (0.85) and excellent interface stability. The delicate design results in an unprecedented 1200 cycles with 97.7&#8201;% capacity retention at 1&#8197;C and 25&#176;C is achieved for the assembled solid-state batteries, which provides a crucial solution for the industrial production of next-generation batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state lithium-metal batteries are considered as the next generation of high-energy-density batteries. However, their solid electrolytes suffer from low ionic conductivity, poor interface performance, and high production costs, restricting their commercial application. Herein, a low-cost cellulose acetate-based quasi-solid composite polymer electrolyte (C-CLA QPE) was developed with a high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (
) of 0.85 and excellent interface stability. The prepared LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LFP)|C-CLA QPE|Li batteries exhibited excellent cycle performance with a capacity retention of 97.7&#8201;% after 1200 cycles at 1&#8197;C and 25&#8201;&#176;C. The experimental results and Density Function Theory (DFT) simulation revealed that the partially esterified side groups in the CLA matrix contribute to the migration of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and enhance electrochemical stability. This work provides a promising strategy for fabricating cost-effective, stable polymer electrolytes for solid-state lithium batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hemin as a General Static Dark Quencher for Constructing Heme Oxygenase&#8208;1 Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hemin was identified as a broad&#8208;spectrum (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) and highly efficient (quenching efficiency &gt;97&#8201;%) dark quencher for designing &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescent probes. Based on this initial discovery, the first live cell&#8208;applicable fluorescent probe of heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1) was disclosed and a convenient fluoroassay was developed for determining HO&#8208;1 activity in biological samples.







Abstract
The development of small&#8208;molecule probes suitable for live&#8208;cell applications remains challenging yet highly desirable. We report the first fluorescent probe, RBH, for imaging the heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1) activity in live cells after discovering hemin as a universal dark quencher. Hemin works via a static quenching mechanism and shows high quenching efficiency (&gt;97&#8201;%) with fluorophores across a broad spectrum (&#955;ex=400&#8211;700&#8197;nm). The favorable properties of RBH (e.g. long excitation/emission wavelengths, fast response rate and high magnitude of signal increase) enable its use for determining HO&#8208;1 activity in complex biological samples. As HO&#8208;1 is involved in regulating antioxidant defence, iron homeostasis and gasotransmitter carbon monoxide production, we expect RBH to be a powerful tool for dissecting its functions. Also, the discovery of hemin as a general static dark quencher provides a straightforward strategy for constructing novel fluorescent probes for diverse biological species.

         <title>Direct Catalytic Asymmetric and Regiodivergent N1&#8208; and C3&#8208;Allenylic Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first direct catalytic asymmetric N1&#8208;functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles via an allenylic alkylation strategy. This transformation produces N&#8208;alkylated indoles bearing axial chirality with a stereocenter non&#8208;adjacent (&#946;) to the nitrogen. The regioselectivity (N1/C3) of this process can be switched efficiently. We also introduce a new class of tri&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles.







Abstract
Herein we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allenylic alkylation strategy for the direct functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles by employing P&#8208;chiral BIBOP&#8208;type ligands. The regioselectivity (N1/C3) of this process can be switched efficiently. Using Cs2CO3 at elevated temperatures in MeCN, N1&#8208;alkylated indoles bearing axial chirality with a stereocenter non&#8208;adjacent (&#946;) to the nitrogen are produced in good yields with high enantioselectivity and complete N1&#8208;regioselectivity regardless of the electronic properties and substitution patterns of diverse indoles. Using K2CO3 at room temperature in CH2Cl2, chiral C3&#8208;alkylated indoles can also be obtained. Notably, we introduce a new class of tri&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles that proceeded through different pathways from di&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Trisubstituted Carbocyclic Olefins: An Access to Chiral Cyclic Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of chiral cyclic amides has been achieved via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of the corresponding enamides with a high degree of enantioselectivity. This methodology extends the utilization of earth abundant metal catalysis in asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
The enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic enamides has been achieved using an earth&#8208;abundant cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. Using CoCl2/(S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE, several trisubstituted carbocyclic enamides were reduced with high activity and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) to the corresponding saturated amides. The methodology can be extended to the synthesis of chiral amines by base hydrolysis of the hydrogenation products. Preliminary mechanistic investigations reveal the presence of a high spin cobalt (II) species in the catalytic cycle. We propose that the hydrogenation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond proceeds via a sigma&#8208;bond&#8208;metathesis pathway.

         <title>Detachable Porous Organic Polymers Responsive to Light and Heat</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of stimuli&#8208;responsive porous material was prepared based on the detachment mechanism. The detachable porous polymer, namely DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1, was fabricated from the polymerization of anthracene&#8208;containing monomer with the irradiation of 365&#8197;nm UV light and it can detach into the monomer with the irradiation of 275&#8197;nm UV light or heat. The detachment results in a large difference in porosity and adsorption capacity.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive porous materials have captured much attention due to the on&#8208;demand tunable properties. Most reported stimuli&#8208;responsive porous materials are based on molecule isomerism or host&#8208;guest interaction, and it is highly desired to develop new types based on different responsive mechanism. Herein, inspired by natural cells which have the ability to fuse and divide induced by external stimulation, we report a new type of stimuli&#8208;responsive porous material based on detachment mechanism. A detachable porous organic polymer, namely DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1, is fabricated from the polymerization of anthracene&#8208;containing monomer (AnMon) when irradiated by 365&#8197;nm UV light. DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1 can detach into the monomer AnMon when irradiated with 275&#8197;nm UV light or heat. Such polymerization/detachment is reversible. The detachment results in a big difference in porosity and adsorption capacity, making the present detachable porous polymer highly promising in adsorptive separation and drug delivery.

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Mavacuran Alkaloids through Intermolecular 1,4&#8208;Addition of an Organolithium Reagent
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular 1,4&#8208;addition of a functionalized vinyl lithium reagent to a readily accessible Michael acceptor enabled the synthesis of six mavacuran alkaloids with a highly strained pentacyclic cagelike framework. The chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivity of the reaction were rationalized by DFT calculations. Dihydroxylation and pinacol rearrangement of the indole nucleus completed the first total syntheses of C&#8208;profluorocurine and C&#8208;fluorocurine.







Abstract
We report a synthetic endeavor towards the highly strained pentacyclic caged framework of the mavacuran alkaloids which culminated with the concise total synthesis of C&#8208;fluorocurine, C&#8208;profluorocurine, C&#8208;mavacurine, normavacurine, 16&#8208;epi&#8208;pleiocarpamine and taberdivarine H. We designed a strategy involving late&#8208;stage construction of the D ring by Michael addition of a vinylic nucleophile to a 2&#8208;indolyl acrylate moiety. While the intramolecular Michael addition did not succeed, we were able to perform a diastereoselective unusual intermolecular 1,4&#8208;addition of a functionalized vinyl lithium reagent to a readily accessible Michael acceptor with the assistance of the piperidine nitrogen atom through the formation of a complex as suggested by DFT computations. Final cyclization was achieved by nucleophilic substitution to form an ammonium intermediate. The first total syntheses of C&#8208;profluorocurine and C&#8208;fluorocurine were finalized by the dihydroxylation of C&#8208;mavacurine and a pinacol rearrangement, respectively.

     alt="Collective Total Synthesis of Mavacuran Alkaloids through Intermolecular 1,4-Addition of an Organolithium Reagent**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermolecular 1,4-addition of a functionalized vinyl lithium reagent to a readily accessible Michael acceptor enabled the synthesis of six mavacuran alkaloids with a highly strained pentacyclic cagelike framework. The chemo- and diastereoselectivity of the reaction were rationalized by DFT calculations. Dihydroxylation and pinacol rearrangement of the indole nucleus completed the first total syntheses of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-profluorocurine and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-fluorocurine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a synthetic endeavor towards the highly strained pentacyclic caged framework of the mavacuran alkaloids which culminated with the concise total synthesis of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-fluorocurine, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-profluorocurine, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-mavacurine, normavacurine, 16-&lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-pleiocarpamine and taberdivarine H. We designed a strategy involving late-stage construction of the D ring by Michael addition of a vinylic nucleophile to a 2-indolyl acrylate moiety. While the intramolecular Michael addition did not succeed, we were able to perform a diastereoselective unusual intermolecular 1,4-addition of a functionalized vinyl lithium reagent to a readily accessible Michael acceptor with the assistance of the piperidine nitrogen atom through the formation of a complex as suggested by DFT computations. Final cyclization was achieved by nucleophilic substitution to form an ammonium intermediate. The first total syntheses of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-profluorocurine and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-fluorocurine were finalized by the dihydroxylation of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-mavacurine and a pinacol rearrangement, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel(II) Nitrate Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for Single&#8208;Junction Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells with a Record 19.02&#8201;% Efficiency</title>

A facile strategy was developed to improve the film quality of a solution processed nickel(II) nitrate hole transporting layer, which realized a record efficiency of 19.02&#8201;% for the binary blend bulk heterojunction organic solar cells to date.







Abstract
A facile strategy was developed here to improve the film quality of nickel&#8208;based hole transporting layer (HTL) for efficient organic solar cell (OSC) applications. To prevent the agglomeration of Ni(NO3)2 during film deposition, acetylacetonate was added into the precursor solution, which led to the formation of an amorphous and glass&#8208;like state. After thermal annealing (TA) treatment, the film&#8208;forming ability could be further improved. The additional UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatment continuously improved the film quality and increased the work function and conductivity of such HTL. The resulting TA &amp; UVO modified Ni(NO3)2 &amp; Hacac HTL produced highly efficient organic solar cells with exciting power conversion efficiencies of 18.42&#8201;% and 19.02&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9 and D18&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;Th devices, respectively, much higher than the control PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS devices.

         <title>Magnetism in Nonplanar Zigzag Edge Termini of Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended 7&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbon with unique termini structures was synthesized on Au(111) using 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;12&#8208;(10&#8208;bromoanthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)tetraphene as the precursor. A Kondo resonance was observed for termini with nonplanar zigzag edges even on a bare Au(111) surface. DFT calculations revealed that the recovery of the spin localization of the zigzag terminus resulted from its weak interaction with the Au(111) because of its nonplanar conformation.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and nanographenes synthesized by on&#8208;surface reactions using tailor&#8208;made molecular precursors offer an ideal playground for a study of magnetism towards nano&#8208;spintronics. Although the zigzag edge of GNRs has been known to host magnetism, the underlying metal substrates usually veil the edge&#8208;induced Kondo effect. Here, we report the on&#8208;surface synthesis of unprecedented, &#960;&#8208;extended 7&#8208;armchair GNRs using 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;12&#8208;(10&#8208;bromoanthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)tetraphene as the precursor. Characterization by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy revealed unique rearrangement reactions leading to pentagon&#8208; or pentagon/heptagon&#8208;incorporated, nonplanar zigzag termini, which demonstrated Kondo resonances even on bare Au(111). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the nonplanar structure significantly reduces the interaction between the zigzag terminus and the Au(111) surface, leading to a recovery of the spin localization of the zigzag edge. Such a distortion of planar GNR structures offers a degree of freedom to control the magnetism on metal substrates.

         <title>A Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for OER and ORR based on a Cobalt(II) Triazole Pyridine Bis&#8208;[Cobalt(III) Corrole] Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing the structure of the catalyst, possessing CoII and CoIII reaction centers, we achieve nearly 100&#8201;% selective activity during ORR to H2O2. Similarly, promising results are obtained when applied in OER catalysis. A relatively low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 412&#8197;mV, a Faraday efficiency of 98&#8201;% for oxygen evolution, and an outstanding Tafel slope of 64&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 combined with a superior stability.







Abstract
As alternative energy sources are essential to reach a climate&#8208;neutral economy, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as futuristic energy carrier gains enormous awareness. However, seeking for stable and electrochemically selective H2O2 ORR electrocatalyst is yet a challenge, making the design of&#8212;ideally&#8212;bifunctional catalysts extremely important and outmost of interest. In this study, we explore the application of a trimetallic cobalt(II) triazole pyridine bis&#8208;[cobalt(III) corrole] complex CoIITP[CoIIIC]2 3 in OER and ORR catalysis due to its remarkable physicochemical properties, fast charge transfer kinetics, electrochemical reversibility, and durability. With nearly 100&#8201;% selective catalytic activity towards the two&#8208;electron transfer generated H2O2, an ORR onset potential of 0.8&#8197;V vs RHE and a cycling stability of 50&#8201;000&#8197;cycles are detected. Similarly, promising results are obtained when applied in OER catalysis. A relatively low overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 412&#8197;mV, Faraday efficiency 98&#8201;% for oxygen, an outstanding Tafel slope of 64&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 combined with superior stability.

         <dc:description>
The first intermolecular enantioselective addition of nitroalkanes to unactivated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters is described, catalyzed by a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase. This fundamental synthetically relevant transformation proceeds with high enantiomeric excesses and yields over a wide range of feedstock substrates, providing pharmaceutically relevant building blocks in a single step.







Abstract
Herein we describe the enantioselective intermolecular conjugate addition of nitroalkanes to unactivated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, catalyzed by a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase. The transformation provides the most direct access to pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;nitroesters, utilizing feedstock chemicals, with unprecedented selectivity. The methodology exhibits a broad substrate scope, including &#946;&#8208;(fluoro)alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl substituted electrophiles, and was successfully applied on a gram scale with reduced catalyst loading, and, additionally, catalyst recovery was carried out. The formal synthesis of a range of drug molecules, and an enantioselective synthesis of (S)&#8208;rolipram were achieved. Additionally, computational studies revealed key reaction intermediates and transition state structures, and provided rationale for high enantioselectivities, in good agreement with experimental results.

         <title>Multi&#8208;layer 3D Chirality and Double&#8208;Helical Assembly in a Copper Nanocluster with a Triple&#8208;Helical Cu15 Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conceptually mimicking biomolecules&#8217; ability to construct multiple&#8208;helical aggregates with emergent properties and functions remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here we report an atom&#8208;precise 18&#8208;copper nanocluster (NC), Cu18H(PET)14(TPP)6(NCS)3 ( Cu18H ) which contains a pseudo D3&#8208;symmetrical triple&#8208;helical Cu15 core. Structurally, Cu18H may be also viewed as sandwich type of sulfur&#8208;bridged chiral copper cluster units [Cu6&#8208;Cu6&#8208;Cu6], endowing three&#8208;layered 3D chirality. More importantly, the chiral NCs are aggregated into an infinite double&#8208;stranded helix supported by intra&#8208;strand homonuclear C&#8210;H&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8210;Cdihydrogen contacts and inter&#8208;strand C&#8208;H/&#960; and C&#8208;H/S interactions. The unique multi&#8208;layered 3D chirality and the double&#8208;helical assembly of Cu18H are evocative of DNA. Moreover, the collective behaviours of the aggregated NCs not only exhibit crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) effects in the deep&#8208;red region, but also efficiently catalyzes electron transfer (ET) reaction. This study thus presents that hierarchical assemblies of atomically defined copper NCs could be intricate as observed for important biomolecules like DNA with emergent properties arising from aggregated behaviours.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding MOF Flexibility: An Analysis Focused on Pillared Layer MOFs as a Model System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible porous frameworks are at the forefront of materials research. A unique feature is their ability to open and close their pores in an adaptive manner induced by chemical and physical stimuli. Such enzyme&#8208;like selective recognition offers a wide range of functions ranging from gas storage and separation to sensing, actuation, mechanical energy storage and catalysis. However, the factors affecting switchability are poorly understood. In particular, the role of building blocks, as well as secondary factors (crystal size, defects, cooperativity) and the role of host&#8208;guest interactions, profit from systematic investigations of an idealized model by advanced analytical techniques and simulations. The review describes an integrated approach targeting the deliberate design of pillared layer metal&#8208;organic frameworks as idealized model materials for the analysis of critical factors affecting framework dynamics and summarizes the resulting progress in their understanding and application.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal &#947;&#8722;C&#8211;H Functionalization of Cyclobutyl Ketones: Synthesis of cis&#8208;1,3&#8208;Difunctionalized Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Difunctionalized cyclobutanes are an emerging scaffold in medicinal chemistry that can confer beneficial pharmacological properties to small&#8208;molecule drug candidates. However, the diastereocontrolled synthesis of these compounds typically requires complicated synthetic routes, indicating a need for novel methods. Here, we report a sequential C&#8211;H/C&#8211;C functionalization strategy for the stereospecific synthesis of cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;functionalized cyclobutyl ketones from readily available cyclobutyl aryl ketones. Specifically, a bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan&#8208;2&#8208;ol intermediate is generated from the parent cyclobutyl ketone via an optimized Norrish&#8208;Yang procedure. This intermediate then undergoes a ligand&#8208;enabled, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;C cleavage/functionalization to produce valuable cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;(hetero)arylated, alkenylated, and alkynylated cyclobutyl aryl ketones, the benzoyl moiety of which can subsequently be converted to a wide range of functional groups including amides and esters.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalysis as an Effective Tool for Upcycling Polymers into Value&#8208;Added Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shaping a sustainable future is closely tied to the development of advanced plastic recycling technologies. As global recycling rates remain low, the lion&#8217;s share of post&#8208;consumer plastics is either incinerated or disposed of in landfills. This unbalanced plastic waste management not only poses severe environmental risks, but also entails an irrevocable loss of chemical resources that are embedded in synthetic polymers. To give plastic waste a new life, a series of photocatalytic methods has recently been reported that convert polymers directly into value&#8208;added organic molecules. These approaches operate at ambient temperature, show high reactivity/selectivity, and provide alternative reaction pathways as compared to thermal depolymerizations. This Minireview highlights the scientific breakthroughs in upcycling polymers through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysis under environmentally benign conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Molecular Mechanism for Enhanced Longevity of Supramolecular Vesicular Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is a promising strategy for stabilizing the photo&#8208;sensitive components in photocatalysis. However, the underlying correlation between the enhanced photostability and supramolecular structure at the molecular level has not yet been fully understood. Herein, we develop a biomimetic vesicular membrane&#8208;based polyporphyrin photocatalyst exhibiting excellent photocatalytic stability with at least activity time of 240 h in hydrogen generation. Time&#8208;domain ab Initio modelling together with transient absorption spectroscopy, visual frontier orbitals and Gibbs free energy calculation disclose that the ordered aggregation of porphyrin units in the vesicle membrane facilitates &#8220;hot&#8221; electron relaxation, a longer photo&#8208;generated carrier lifetime and the rapid dissipation of photo&#8208;generated charges, which contribute to the longevity. This work deepens the molecular&#8208;level understanding on photostability and photocatalytic mechanism of supramolecular photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining MN6 Octahedra and PN5 Trigonal Bipyramids in the Mica&#8208;like Nitridophosphates MP6N11 (M = Al, In)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered silicates are a very versatile class of materials with high importance to humanity. The new nitridophosphates MP6N11 (M = Al, In), synthesized from MCl3, P3N5 and NH4N3 in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction at 1100 &#176;C and 8 GPa, show a mica&#8208;like layer setup and feature rare nitrogen coordination motifs. The crystal structure of AlP6N11 was elucidated from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal diffraction data (space group Cm (no. 8), a = 4.9354(10), b = 8.1608(16), c = 9.0401(18) &#197;, &#946; = 98.63(3)&#176;), enabling Rietveld refinement of isotypic InP6N11. It is built up from layers of PN4 tetrahedra, PN5 trigonal bipyramids and MN6 octahedra. PN5 trigonal bipyramids have been reported only once and MN6 octahedra are sparsely found in the literature. AlP6N11 was further characterized by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX), IR and NMR spectroscopy. Despite the vast amount of known layered silicates, there is no isostructural compound to MP6N11 as yet.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrode potential driven dissociation of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;BF3 adducts: a possible manifestation of the electro&#8208;inductive effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, non&#8208;Faradaic effects were used to modify the electronic structure and reactivity of electrode&#8208;bound species. We hypothesize that these electrostatic perturbations could influence the chemical reactivity of electrolyte species near an electrode in the absence of Faradaic electron transfer. A prime example of non&#8208;Faradaic effects is acid&#8208;base dissociation near an interface. Here, we probed the near&#8208;electrode dissociation of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;BF3 Lewis adducts upon electrode polarization, well outside of the redox potential window of the adducts. Using scanning electrochemical microscopy and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy, we detected a potential&#8208;dependent depletion of the adduct near the electrode. We propose an electro&#8208;inductive effect where a more positive potential leads to electron withdrawal on the N&#8208;heterocycle. This study takes a step forward in the use of electrostatics at electrochemical interfaces for field&#8208;driven electrocatalytic and electrosynthetic processes.</dc:description>

Using scanning electrochemical microscopy and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy, we detected a potential-dependent depletion of the adduct near the electrode. We propose an electro-inductive effect where a more positive potential leads to electron withdrawal on the N-heterocycle. This study takes a step forward in the use of electrostatics at electrochemical interfaces for field-driven electrocatalytic and electrosynthetic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Photodynamic Chemiluminescent Probes for Cancer Therapy and Metastasis Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activatable phototheranostics hold potential for precision cancer treatment with minimized side effects due to specific &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; signal and phototoxicity. Particularly, there is a growing interest to develop chemiluminescence (CL) phototheranostic probes because of minimized tissue autofluorescence; however, current probes are based on nanoparticles composed of multiple components to realize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) CL imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy owing to the lack of NIR absorbing chemiluminophores. We herein report the design and synthesis of bright unimolecular chemiluminophores with NIR absorption (~ 650 nm) and emission (&#8805; 700 nm), long CL half&#8208;lives, and ideal photodynamic efficiency. One optimal chemiluminophore is further modified into an activatable probe (DBPOL), whose CL signal and photodynamic activity are only turned on in the presence of a cancer biomarker. Due to the high sensitivity and biomarker specificity, DBPOL permits CL&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), which completely inhibits the tumor growth and lung metastasis in mouse models. Moreover, DBPOL can be applied for noninvasive monitoring of lung metastasis. Thus, this study provides molecular guidelines for NIR&#8208;absorbing chemiluminophores with the structural versatility for imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Triplet Excited States of Organic Semiconductors via Tuning Molecular Conformation for Dual&#8208;ratiometric Thermometers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strength of noncovalent intramolecular interactions was fine&#8208;tuned to systematically modulate the triplet states, resulting in efficient room temperature phosphorescence and two well&#8208;separated emission bands. An unprecedent organic 3D dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometer was established based on intensity ratio and lifetime ratio of two bands, which was used for in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;thermometry with high accuracy.







Abstract
The dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometry is one of highly accurate methods for microscopic thermal measurement in biological systems. Herein, a series of chromone derivatives with noncovalently intramolecular interactions (NIIs) were designed and synthesized for ratiometric thermometers. The triplet states of these organic compounds were systematically tuned upon regulating the conformation with NIIs to yield efficient room temperature phosphorescence and large wavelength difference between fluorescence and phosphorescence simultaneously. As a result, an unprecedent organic 3D dual&#8208;ratiometric thermometer was established based on the intensity ratio and lifetime ratio of fluorescence/phosphorescence vs temperature, which was used for in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;thermometry with high accuracy. This work provides a novel method to achieve organic dual ratiometric thermometers via tuning the triplet excited states.

         <title>Burning Graphite Faster than Carbon Black: A Case of Diffusion Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through careful control of total diffusion&#8208;limited regime, it is possible to purify carbon black at the expense of far more stable graphite. This shows that targeted exploitation of total diffusion may be used to bypass the classical chemical reactivity. This represents a new technique for materials purification or synthesis not allowed by other methods.







Abstract
External diffusion may be exploited as a tool to purify materials in a way thought to be inaccessible from a chemical reactivity point of view. A mixture of two carbonaceous materials, graphite and carbon black, are thermally oxidized in either i) outside total diffusion&#8208;limited regime or ii) total diffusion&#8208;limited regime. Depending on the treatment applied it is possible to purify either graphite, a trivial task, or carbon black, a task thought impossible. Introducing geometrical selectivity, controlled total diffusion&#8208;limited chemistry exceeds by far the field of carbon materials and can be used as an engineering tool for many materials purification, original synthesis, or to introduce asymmetry in a system. Several examples for direct applications of the findings are mentioned.

         <title>Upcycling of Polybutadiene Facilitated by Selenium&#8208;Mediated Allylic Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling via the direct chemical functionalization of a commodity polymer is a promising strategy that introduces new value&#8208;added properties without destroying the parent backbone. This work harnesses the power of selenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization chemistry for the selective allylic amination of 1,4&#8208;polybutadiene, without alkene saturation or transposition, to tune thermal and surface wetting properties.







Abstract
Accumulation of end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics presents ongoing environmental concerns. One strategy to solve this grand challenge is to invent new techniques that modify post&#8208;consumer waste and impart new functionality. While promising approaches for the chemical upcycling of commodity polyolefins and polyaromatics exist, analogous approaches to repurpose unsaturated polymers (e.g., polybutadiene) are scarce. In this work, we propose a method to upcycle polybutadiene, one of the most widely used commercial rubbers, via a mild, metal&#8208;free allylic amination reaction. The resulting materials have tunable thermal and surface wetting properties as a function of both sulfonamide identity and grafting density. Importantly, this approach maintains the parent alkene microstructure without evidence of olefin reduction, olefin transposition, and/or chain scission. Based on these findings, we anticipate future applications in the remediation of complex elastomers and vulcanized rubbers.

         <title>Understanding the Synthesis Kinetics of Single&#8208;Crystal Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of single&#8208;crystal Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries is explored. A quasi&#8208;equilibrium reaction path is driven at low reaction temperature to induce a low&#8208;temperature topotactic lithiation, which can promote the rapid formation of the layered phase, thus contributing to the formation of highly ordered layered oxides in the solid&#8208;state synthesis of single&#8208;crystal Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathodes.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium kinetic intermediates are usually preferentially generated instead of thermodynamic stable phases in the solid&#8208;state synthesis of layered oxides. Understanding the inherent complexity between thermodynamics and kinetics is important for designing high cationic ordering cathodes. Single&#8208;crystal strategy is an effective way to solve the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical problems of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. However, the synthesis of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystal is very challenging. Herein, the kinetic reaction path and the formation mechanism of non&#8208;equilibrium intermediates in the synthesis of single&#8208;crystal Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich were explored. We demonstrate that the formation of non&#8208;equilibrium intermediate and the electrochemical&#8208;thermo&#8208;mechanical failure can be effectively inhibited by driving low&#8208;temperature topotactic lithiation. This work provides a basis for designing high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystal Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides by regulating the defective structures.

         <title>Understanding Electrochemical Reaction Mechanisms of Sulfur in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries through Operando and Theoretical Studies
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of the sulfur cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries are revealed. The results demonstrated there are no Li2S6 and Li2S4 formed but Li2S2 is observed. Furthermore, first&#8208;principles calculations disclose the formation energy of solid state Li2Sn (1&#8804;n&#8804;8), in which Li2S2 is a metastable phase.







Abstract
Due to its outstanding safety and high energy density, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASLSBs) are considered as a potential future energy storage technology. The electrochemical reaction pathway in ASLSBs with inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes is different from Li&#8208;S batteries with liquid electrolytes, but the mechanism remains unclear. By combining operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, we investigated the reaction mechanism of sulfur (S8) in ASLSBs. Our results revealed that no Li2S8, Li2S6, and Li2S4 were formed, yet Li2S2 was detected. Furthermore, first&#8208;principles structural calculations were employed to disclose the formation energy of solid state Li2Sn (1&#8804;n&#8804;8), in which Li2S2 was a metastable phase, consistent with experimental observations. Meanwhile, partial S8 and Li2S2 remained at the full lithiation stage, suggesting incomplete reaction due to sluggish reaction kinetics in ASLSBs.

&lt;p&gt;Utilizing operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of the sulfur cathode in all-solid-state batteries are revealed. The results demonstrated there are no Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formed but Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is observed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its outstanding safety and high energy density, all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries (ASLSBs) are considered as a potential future energy storage technology. The electrochemical reaction pathway in ASLSBs with inorganic solid-state electrolytes is different from Li-S batteries with liquid electrolytes, but the mechanism remains unclear. By combining operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we investigated the reaction mechanism of sulfur (S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) in ASLSBs. Our results revealed that no Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8,&lt;/sub&gt; Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6,&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; were formed, yet Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was detected. Furthermore, first-principles structural calculations were employed to disclose the formation energy of solid state Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Acid&#8208;Resistant BODIPY Amino Acids for Peptide&#8208;Based Fluorescence Imaging of GPR54 Receptors in Pancreatic Islets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS as a new acid&#8208;resistant building block for straightforward solid&#8208;phase synthesis of fluorogenic peptides. We demonstrate the utility of Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS with the first fluorogenic probe for direct visualization and quantitative analysis of the expression and localization of the G protein&#8208;coupled receptors&#8197;54 (GPR54 or kisspeptin) in human cells and intact mouse pancreatic islets.







Abstract
The G protein&#8208;coupled kisspeptin receptor (GPR54 or KISS1R) is an important mediator in reproduction, metabolism and cancer biology; however, there are limited fluorescent probes or antibodies for direct imaging of these receptors in cells and intact tissues, which can help to interrogate their multiple biological roles. Herein, we describe the rational design and characterization of a new acid&#8208;resistant BODIPY&#8208;based amino acid (Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS), and its implementation for solid&#8208;phase synthesis of fluorescent bioactive peptides. Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS retains the binding capabilities of both short linear and cyclic peptides and displays notable turn&#8208;on fluorescence emission upon target binding for wash&#8208;free imaging. Finally, we employed Trp&#8208;BODIPY PLUS to prepare some of the first fluorogenic kisspeptin&#8208;based probes and visualized the expression and localization of GPR54 receptors in human cells and in whole mouse pancreatic islets by fluorescence imaging.

         <title>Reversibly Modulating Plasmon&#8208;mediated Chemical Reaction via Electrode Potential on Reliable Copper Nanoelectrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and reliable copper nanoelectrodes (CuNEs) were fabricated. The reactions of aromatic nitro modified on the CuNE surface were probed using time&#8208;resolved electrochemical SERS measurements. Cyclic conversions between aromatic nitro and its reduction products aromatic azo and aromatic amine were achieved by balancing electrochemical and Cu reductions with the plasmon&#8208;assisted photooxidation.







Abstract
Plasmonic metal nanostructures are essential for plasmon&#8208;mediated chemical reactions (PMCRs) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The nanostructures are commonly made from the coinage metals gold and silver. Copper (Cu) is less used mainly due to the difficulties in fabricating stable nanostructures. However, Cu is an attractive option with its strong plasmonic properties, high catalytic activities, and relatively cheap price. Herein, we fabricated tunable, reliable, and efficient Cu nanoelectrodes (CuNEs). Using time&#8208;resolved electrochemical SERS, we have comprehensively studied the reversible chemical transformations between aromatic amine and nitro groups modified on the CuNE surface. Their PMCRs are well&#8208;controlled by changing the surface roughness, the oxidation states of Cu, and the applied electrode potential. We thus demonstrate that the Cu nanostructures enable better investigations in the interplays between PMCR, electrochemistry, and Cu catalysis.

         <title>Csp3&#8722;PIII Bond Formation via Cross&#8208;Coupling of Umpolung Carbonyls with Phosphine Halides Catalyzed by Nickel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes an unprecedented methodology for the direct construction of invaluable Csp3&#8722;PIII bond through a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of Umpolung carbonyls with phosphine chlorides. A series of trivalent alkylphosphines were isolated and characterized as sulfides or borane complexes in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A novel method for the formation of Csp3&#8722;PIII bonds via the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of Umpolung carbonyls and phosphine chlorides is reported herein. This process leads to a series of alkylphosphines, which are characterized as sulfides or borane&#8208;phosphine complexes after undergoing further transformation with moderate to good yields. Invaluable free alkylphosphines can be easily obtained by desulfurization or deboration of the products. A possible mechanistic pathway is also discussed. This report represents the first example of using renewable carbonyls as latent organometallic reagent surrogates for cross&#8208;coupling with heteroatom electrophiles.

         <title>Glucose&#8208;Responsive Charge&#8208;Switchable Lipid Nanoparticles for Insulin Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized four glucose&#8208;responsive cationic lipids to prepare lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with low toxicity. LNP&#8208;insulin complex can be formed by electrostatic attraction. The surface positive charge of LNPs is switched off in glucose solution, leading to insulin release. In type&#8197;1 diabetic mice, LNPs can prolong the subcutaneous retention of insulin, thus doubling the duration of the normoglycemia period as compared with native insulin.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based drug delivery systems have a profound clinical impact on nucleic acid&#8208;based therapy and vaccination. Recombinant human insulin, a negatively&#8208;charged biomolecule like mRNA, may also be delivered by rationally&#8208;designed positively&#8208;charged lipid nanoparticles with glucose&#8208;sensing elements and be released in a glucose&#8208;responsive manner. Herein, we have designed phenylboronic acid&#8208;based quaternary amine&#8208;type cationic lipids that can self&#8208;assemble into spherical lipid nanoparticles in an aqueous solution. Upon mixing insulin and the lipid nanoparticles, a heterostructured insulin complex is formed immediately arising from the electrostatic attraction. In a hyperglycemia&#8208;relevant glucose solution, lipid nanoparticles become less positively charged over time, leading to reduced attraction and subsequent insulin release. Compared with native insulin, this lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based glucose&#8208;responsive insulin shows prolonged blood glucose regulation ability and blood glucose&#8208;triggered insulin release in a type&#8197;1 diabetic mouse model.

         <title>Highly Strong and Tough Supramolecular Polymer Networks Enabled by Cryptand&#8208;Based Host&#8208;Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryptand&#8208;based host&#8208;guest recognition motifs with their high association constants have been exploited as cross&#8208;links to endow supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) with both excellent mechanical and dynamic properties. This approach also offers a fundamental understanding of the mechanism behind reinforcing SPNs with strong noncovalent cross&#8208;links, and acts as a guide for the design and preparation of high&#8208;performance dynamic materials.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) demonstrate great potential in the development of smart materials owing to their attractive dynamic properties. However, as they suffer from the inherent weak bonding of most noncovalent cross&#8208;links, it remains a significant challenge to construct SPNs with outstanding mechanical performance.

     alt="Highly Strong and Tough Supramolecular Polymer Networks Enabled by Cryptand-Based Host-Guest Recognition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptand-based host-guest recognition motifs with their high association constants have been exploited as cross-links to endow supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) with both excellent mechanical and dynamic properties. This approach also offers a fundamental understanding of the mechanism behind reinforcing SPNs with strong noncovalent cross-links, and acts as a guide for the design and preparation of high-performance dynamic materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) demonstrate great potential in the development of smart materials owing to their attractive dynamic properties. However, as they suffer from the inherent weak bonding of most noncovalent cross-links, it remains a significant challenge to construct SPNs with outstanding mechanical performance. Herein, we exploit the cryptand/paraquat host-guest recognition motifs as cross-links to prepare a class of highly strong and tough SPNs. Unlike those supramolecular cross-links with relatively weak binding abilities, the cryptand-based host-guest interactions have a high association constant and steady complexing structure, which effectively stabilizes the network and resists mechanical deformation under external force. Such favorable structural stability endows our SPNs with greatly enhanced mechanical performance, compared with the control-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; cross-linked by the weakly complexed crown ether/secondary ammonium salt motif (tensile strength: 21.1&#177;0.5 &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 2.8&#177;0.1&#8197;MPa; Young's modulus: 102.6&#177;4.8 &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 2.1&#177;0.3&#8197;MPa; toughness: 90.4&#177;2.0 &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 10.8&#177;0.6&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, our SPNs also retain abundant dynamic properties including good abilities in energy dissipation, reprocessability, and stimuli-responsiveness. These findings provide novel insights into the preparation of SPNs with enhanced mechanical properties, and promote the development of high-performance intelligent supramolecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Diverse Tetramic Acid Bearing cis&#8208;Decalin Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective endo&#8208;boat intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder (IMDA) reaction and a one&#8208;pot aminolysis/Dieckmann condensation cascade formed the basis for the total synthesis of four natural antibiotics and one hydrogenated natural product derivative, all of which contain a cis&#8208;decalin ring bearing a tetramic acid.







Abstract
We report herein the first total syntheses of four natural antibiotics, vermisporin, PF1052/AB4015&#8208;A, AB4015&#8208;L, AB4015&#8208;B, and one hydrogenated natural product derivative, AB4015&#8208;A2, that all feature a tetramic acid bearing cis&#8208;decalin ring. The construction of the functionalized cis&#8208;decalin ring was achieved by a diastereoselective intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder (IMDA) reaction, which proceeded via a rare endo&#8208;boat transition state. Through an intramolecular neighboring&#8208;group&#8208;oriented strategy, the sterically hindered epoxy group in vermisporin, PF1052/AB4015&#8208;A and AB4015&#8208;L was installed efficiently. A one&#8208;pot aminolysis/Dieckmann condensation cascade using l&#8208;amino acid derivatives afforded the desired tetramic acid structure. The total synthesis led to the unambiguous verification of the absolute configuration of these natural products.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale and Controllable Syntheses of Covalently&#8208;Crosslinked Poly(ionic liquid) Nanoporous Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green, straightforward and versatile conceptual synthetic procedure capable of scalable and controllable preparation of freestanding, covalently crosslinked nanoporous poly(ionc liquid) membranes in water solution under ambient condition is developed. The resultant membranes possess remarkable thermal/solvent (e.g. salt, pH, organic solvents) stability, and exhibit excellent Li+/Mg2+ ion separation performance.







Abstract
Herein, we report an exciting synthetic procedure for the scalable and controllable fabrication of covalently crosslinked poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) nanoporous membranes (CPILMs) in water solution under ambient conditions. We found that the pore sizes, flexibility and compositions of freestanding CPILMs can be finely tailored by a rational structural choice of PIL, diketone and aldehyde. Studies on the CPILM formation mechanism revealed that hydrogen bonding&#8208;induced phase separation of amino&#8208;functionalized homo&#8208;PIL between its polar and apolar domains coupled with structural rearrangements due to the Debus Radsizewski reaction&#8208;triggered ambient covalent crosslinking process created a stable three&#8208;dimensionally interconnected pore system in water solution. Employing structurally stable CPILMs in ion sieving devices resulted in an excellent Li+/Mg2+ separation efficiency due to the positively charged nature and &#8220;Donann&#8221; effects. This green, facile yet versatile approach to the production of CPILMs is a conceptually distinct and commercially interesting strategy for making useful nanoporous functional polyelectrolyte membranes.

         <title>Electrically Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence by a Chiral Anion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a chiral anion strategy, electrically amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is realized in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells of readily obtained diastereomeric ionic transition&#8208;metal complexes. The addition of a chiral ionic liquid (IL) into the active layer significantly improves the device performance and the electroluminescence dissymmetry factors.







Abstract
The development of circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is currently hampered by the high difficulty and cost in the syntheses of suitable chiral materials and the notorious chirality diminishment issue in electrical devices. Herein, diastereomeric IrIII and RuII complexes with chiral (&#177;)&#8208;camphorsulfonate counteranions are readily synthesized and used as the active materials in circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells to generate promising CPELs. The addition of the chiral ionic liquid (&#177;)&#8208;1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole camphorsulfonate into the active layer significantly improves the device performance and the electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (&#8776;10&#8722;3), in stark contrast to the very weak circularly polarized photoluminescence of the spin&#8208;coated films of these diastereomeric complexes. Control experiments with enantiopure IrIII complexes suggest that the chiral anions play a dominant role in the electrically&#8208;induced amplification of CPELs.

         <title>Glutathione&#8208;Induced In Situ Michael Addition between Nanoparticles for Pyroptosis and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;o&#8208;gallate (EGCG)&#8211;molybdenum ion coordination nanoparticles were prepared by biomineralization. In cancer cells, they disrupt the redox equilibrium and simultaneously compete for and consume intracellular glutathione (GSH) to form large aggregates, which mechanically disrupt the endosomal and plasma membranes, thus inducing pyroptosis and releasing inflammatory factors for activating immunological responses.







Abstract
Most tumor treatments will fail when ignoring competition and cooperation between each cancer cell and its microenvironment. Inspired by game theory, therapeutic agents can be introduced to compete for intracellular molecules to disrupt the cooperation between molecules and cells. Biomineralized oxidized (&#8722;)&#8208;epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;o&#8208;gallate (EGCG)&#8211;molybdenum ion coordination nanoparticles were prepared for disrupting redox equilibria and simultaneously reacting with intracellular GSH in a Michael addition to form large aggregates that can mechanically disrupt endosomal and plasma membranes, stimulating pyroptosis and anti&#8208;tumor immunological responses for versatile inhibition of different types of tumors. This design disrupts the cooperation between molecules and between cancer and immune cells, achieving an optimal payoff in competition and cooperation in cancer therapy.

         <title>Single&#8208;Benzene Dual&#8208;Emitters Harness Excited&#8208;State Antiaromaticity for White Light Generation and Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;benzene dual&#8208;emitters are realized by proton transfer equilibrium between two emissive tautomers. We demonstrate that the excited&#8208;state antiaromaticity of the benzene core drives the proton movements. The dual&#8208;emitters produce white light in both solution and solid states, making them useful for white light&#8208;emitting devices and multicolor fluorescence imaging of fluorous nanodroplets in live cells.







Abstract
Molecular emitters simultaneously generating light at different wavelengths have wide applications. With a small molecule, however, it is challenging to realize two independent radiative pathways. We invented the first examples of dual&#8208;emissive single&#8208;benzene fluorophores (SBFs). Two emissive tautomers are generated by synthetic modulation of the hydrogen bond acidity, which opens up pathways for excited&#8208;state proton transfer. White light is produced by a delicate balance between the energy and intensity of the emission from each tautomer.

     alt="Single-Benzene Dual-Emitters Harness Excited-State Antiaromaticity for White Light Generation and Fluorescence Imaging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-benzene dual-emitters are realized by proton transfer equilibrium between two emissive tautomers. We demonstrate that the excited-state antiaromaticity of the benzene core drives the proton movements. The dual-emitters produce white light in both solution and solid states, making them useful for white light-emitting devices and multicolor fluorescence imaging of fluorous nanodroplets in live cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular emitters simultaneously generating light at different wavelengths have wide applications. With a small molecule, however, it is challenging to realize two independent radiative pathways. We invented the first examples of dual-emissive single-benzene fluorophores (SBFs). Two emissive tautomers are generated by synthetic modulation of the hydrogen bond acidity, which opens up pathways for excited-state proton transfer. White light is produced by a delicate balance between the energy and intensity of the emission from each tautomer. We show that the excited-state antiaromaticity of the benzene core itself dictates the proton movements driving the tautomer equilibrium. Using this simple benzene platform, a fluorinated SBF was synthesized with a record high solubility in perfluorocarbon solvents. White light-emitting devices and multicolor imaging of perfluorocarbon nanodroplets in live cells demonstrate the practical utility of these molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structurally Simple Osmium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy in the Near Infrared
</title>

         <dc:description>
Osmium&#8208;based polypyridyl complexes have been developed as photosensitizers for one&#8208;photon photodynamic therapy in the near infrared.







Abstract
Five osmium(II) polypyridyl complexes of the general formula [Os(4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)2L]2+ were synthesized as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy by varying the nature of the ligand L. Thanks to the pronounced &#960;&#8208;extended structure of the ligands and the heavy atom effect provided by the osmium center, these complexes exhibit a high absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (up to 740&#8197;nm), unlike related ruthenium complexes. This led to a promising phototoxicity in vitro against cancer cells cultured as 2D cell layers but also in multicellular tumor spheroids upon irradiation at 740&#8197;nm. The complex [Os(4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)2(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)]2+ was found to be the most efficient against various cancer cell lines, with high phototoxicity indexes. Experiments on CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing BALB/c mice also indicate that the OsII complexes could significantly reduce tumor growth following 740&#8197;nm laser irradiation. The high phototoxicity in the biological window of this structurally simple complex makes it a promising photosensitizer for cancer treatment.

         <title>Protein Oligomer Engineering: A New Frontier for Studying Protein Structure, Function, and Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview classifies protein oligomers according to toxicity, biological function, and application as well as summarizes frontier methods for engineering protein oligomers. From the analysis of the advantages and deficits of each methodology, we highlight protein grafting as a promising and robust method for future oligomer engineering with the combination of AI technologies.







Abstract
Prevalent in nature, protein oligomers play critical roles both physiologically and pathologically. The multimeric nature and conformational transiency of protein oligomers greatly complicate a more detailed glimpse into the molecular structure as well as function. In this minireview, the oligomers are classified and described on the basis of biological function, toxicity, and application. We also define the bottlenecks in recent oligomer studies and further review numerous frontier methods for engineering protein oligomers. Progress is being made on many fronts for a wide variety of applications, and protein grafting is highlighted as a promising and robust method for oligomer engineering. These advances collectively allow the engineering and design of stabilized oligomers that bring us one step closer to understanding their biological functions, toxicity, and a wide range of applications.

         <title>An Optochemical Oxygen Scavenger Enabling Spatiotemporal Control of Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optochemical oxygen scavenging system is reported that enables spatiotemporal control of hypoxia in cellular conditions. In this system, a selenium&#8208;containing rhodamine derivative works as an oxygen scavenging photocatalyst with glutathione as a co&#8208;reductant. This system consumed oxygen quickly and can establish localized hypoxic conditions even in cultured cells, providing a new chemical tool for hypoxia research.







Abstract
We present an optochemical O2 scavenging system that enables precise spatiotemporal control of the level of hypoxia in living cells simply by adjusting the light intensity in the illuminated region. The system employs rhodamine containing a selenium or tellurium atom as an optochemical oxygen scavenger that rapidly consumes O2 by photochemical reaction with glutathione as a coreductant upon visible light irradiation (560&#8211;590&#8197;nm) and has a rapid response time, within a few minutes. The glutathione&#8208;consuming quantum yields of the system were calculated as about 5&#8201;%. The spatiotemporal O2 consuming in cultured cells was visualized with a hypoxia&#8208;responsive fluorescence probe, MAR. Phosphorescence lifetime imaging was applied to confirmed that different light intensities could generate different levels of hypoxia. To illustrate the potential utility of this system for hypoxia research, we show that it can spatiotemporally control calcium ion (Ca2+) influx into HEK293T cells expressing the hypoxia&#8208;responsive Ca2+ channel TRPA1.

         <title>Comproportionation of CO2 and Cellulose to Formate Using a Floating Semiconductor&#8208;Enzyme Photoreforming Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous formate formation from CO2 reduction and cellulose oxidation is enabled by a biohybrid photocatalyst with formate dehydrogenase immobilized on titanium dioxide. The semi&#8208;artificial photocatalytic system can be further immobilized onto floating hollow glass microspheres allowing vertical solar light illumination with optimal light exposure of the photocatalyst and thereby mimicking the trajectory of real sunlight.







Abstract
Formate production via both CO2 reduction and cellulose oxidation in a solar&#8208;driven process is achieved by a semi&#8208;artificial biohybrid photocatalyst consisting of immobilized formate dehydrogenase on titanium dioxide (TiO2|FDH) producing up to 1.16&#177;0.04&#8197;mmolformate&#8201;g
&#8722;1 in 24&#8197;hours at 30 &#176;C and 101 kPa under anaerobic conditions. Isotopic labeling experiments with 13C&#8208;labeled substrates support the mechanism of stoichiometric formate formation through both redox half&#8208;reactions. TiO2|FDH was further immobilized on hollow glass microspheres to perform more practical floating photoreforming allowing vertical solar light illumination with optimal light exposure of the photocatalyst to real sunlight. Enzymatic cellulose depolymerization coupled to the floating photoreforming catalyst generates 0.36&#177;0.04&#8197;mmolformate per m2 irradiation area after 24&#8197;hours. This work demonstrates the synergistic solar&#8208;driven valorization of solid and gaseous waste streams using a biohybrid photoreforming catalyst in aqueous solution and will thus provide inspiration for the development of future semi&#8208;artificial waste&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion strategies.

         <title>A Remotely Controlled Nanosystem for Spatiotemporally Specific Gene Regulation and Combinational Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR light&#8208;controlled, mitochondrial&#8208;targeted nanosystem achieves spatiotemporally selective gene regulation and tumor treatment. The system relies on photodynamic effect&#8208;induced translocation of a DNA repair enzyme, which enables spatially&#8208;controlled gene regulation and thus enhanced antitumor effects.







Abstract
The dearth of technologies that allow gene modulation and therapy with high spatiotemporal precision remains a bottleneck in biomedical research and applications. Here we present a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled nanosystem that allows spatiotemporally controlled regulation of gene expression and thus combinational tumor therapy. The nanosystem is built by engineering of an enzyme&#8208;activatable antisense oligonucleotide and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;based photodynamic system and a mitochondria localization signal. The system relies on photodynamic effect&#8208;induced translocation of a DNA repair enzyme from nucleus into mitochondria, which enables spatially selective gene regulation via enzymatic reactions. We demonstrate that the NIR light&#8208;induced mitochondrial photodamage and gene regulation enable enhanced antitumor effect. Our approach may enable the specific gene regulation and tumor treatment with high precision both spatially and temporally.

&lt;p&gt;The dearth of technologies that allow gene modulation and therapy with high spatiotemporal precision remains a bottleneck in biomedical research and applications. Here we present a near-infrared (NIR) light-controlled nanosystem that allows spatiotemporally controlled regulation of gene expression and thus combinational tumor therapy. The nanosystem is built by engineering of an enzyme-activatable antisense oligonucleotide and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle-based photodynamic system and a mitochondria localization signal. The system relies on photodynamic effect-induced translocation of a DNA repair enzyme from nucleus into mitochondria, which enables spatially selective gene regulation via enzymatic reactions. We demonstrate that the NIR light-induced mitochondrial photodamage and gene regulation enable enhanced antitumor effect. Our approach may enable the specific gene regulation and tumor treatment with high precision both spatially and temporally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of glycals was developed to access 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides. This method exhibits broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity under very mild conditions. In addition, unprecedented stereodivergent synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;ribofuranosides was achieved using different chiral bisoxazoline ligands.







Abstract
2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides represent an important class of carbohydrates that are present in many bioactive molecules. However, owing to the lack of substituents at the C2 position, the stereoselective synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is highly challenging. Herein, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled stereoselective C&#8208;alkyl glycosylation reaction to access 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides from readily available glycals and alkyl halides. This method exhibits broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity under very mild conditions. In addition, unprecedented stereodivergent synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;ribofuranosides is achieved using different chiral bisoxazoline ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that hydrometallation of the glycal with the bisoxazoline&#8208;ligated Co&#8722;H species may be the turnover&#8208;limiting and stereodetermining step of this transformation.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Structure&#8208;editing Fluorescent Hydrogel Actuators for Environment&#8208;interactive Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the metamorphosis development of glowing octopus, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study demonstrated a strategy to replicate the structure&#8208;editing capacity of natural organisms into soft artificial actuators/robots. On this basis, it is made possible to deeply imitate the environment&#8208;interactive morphology/pattern information delivery function of glowing octopus and thus produce conceptually new environment&#8208;interactive information encryption systems.







Abstract
Many living organisms have the superb structure&#8208;editing capacity for better adaptation in dynamic environments over the course of their life cycle. However, it's still challenging to replicate such natural structure&#8208;editing capacity into artificial hydrogel actuating systems for enhancing environment&#8208;interactive functions. Herein, we learn from the metamorphosis development of glowing octopus to construct proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept fluorescent hydrogel actuators with life&#8208;like structure&#8208;editing capacity by developing a universal stepwise inside&#8208;out growth strategy. These actuators could perform origami&#8208;like 3D shape deformation and also enable the postnatal growth of new structures to adapt additional actuating states for different visual information delivery by using different environment keys (e.g., temperature, pH). This study opens previously unidentified&#8208;avenues of bio&#8208;inspired hydrogel actuators/robotics and extends the potential uses for environment&#8208;interactive information encryption.

         <title>Structural and Morphological Transformations of Covalent Organic Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two imine bonds at the ortho&#8208;position of the benzene ring undergo a click rearrangement to form the imidazole ring. Such two geminal imine bonds in covalent organic nanotubes (CONTs) convert imine CONTs to imidazole CONTs. The CONTs exhibit two types of self&#8208;assembly like gold nanorods, i.e., side&#8208;by&#8208;side assembly and head&#8208;to&#8208;head assembly.







Abstract
Covalent organic nanotubes (CONTs) are porous one&#8208;dimensional frameworks connected through imine bonds via Schiff base condensation between aldehydes and amines. The presence of two amine groups at the ortho position in the structurally demanding tetraaminotriptycene (TAT) building block leads to multiple reaction pathways between the ditopic aldehyde and the tetratopic amine. We have synthesized five different monomers of CONT&#8208;1 by the Schiff base condensation reaction between TAT and o&#8208;anisaldehyde. The conversion of imine to imidazole bonding in a monomer is probed using NMR, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. Solid&#8208;state NMR provide insights into the CONTs&#8217; structural connectivity. A theoretical investigation suggests that the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking could be the driving force for rapid imine to imidazole conversion within the CONT&#8208;1. Microscopic imaging sheds further light on the self&#8208;assembly process of the CONTs, indicating both head&#8208;to&#8208;head and side&#8208;by&#8208;side assembly.

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution on Electrode&#8208;Supported Ptn Clusters: Ensemble of Hydride States Governs the Size Dependent Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution on size&#8208;selected subnano Pt clusters supported on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) originates from hydride&#8208;like species (ca. 2&#8197;H/Pt), which form at a reductive electrode potential and are distinct from single atoms and bulk Pt. The size dependence of activity and stability were understood based on a grand canonical ensemble representation of the catalyst states and chemical bonding analysis.







Abstract
We report the size&#8208;dependent activity and stability of supported Pt1,4,7,8 for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, and show that clusters outperform polycrystalline Pt in activity, with size&#8208;dependent stability. To understand the size effects, we use DFT calculations to study the structural fluxionality under varying potentials. We show that the clusters can reshape under H coverage and populate an ensemble of states with diverse stoichiometry, structure, and thus reactivity. Both experiment and theory suggest that electrocatalytic species are hydridic states of the clusters (&#8776;2&#8197;H/Pt). An ensemble&#8208;based kinetic model reproduces the experimental activity trend and reveals the role of metastable states. The stability trend is rationalized by chemical bonding analysis. Our joint study demonstrates the potential&#8208; and adsorbate&#8208;coverage&#8208;dependent fluxionality of subnano clusters of different sizes and offers a systematic modeling strategy to tackle the complexities.

         <title>Overcoming the Oxygen Dilemma in Photoredox Catalysis: Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) Light&#8208;Triggered Peroxynitrite Generation for Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Nile blue derivative SNB can be both used as a type I photosensitizer and a near&#8208;infrared photocatalyst, enabling the simultaneous generation of superoxide anions (O2&#8901;&#8722;) and nitric oxide (NO) via type I photosensitization and oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoredox catalysis, respectively. The combination of O2&#8901;&#8722; and NO leads to peroxynitrite generation under NIR light irradiation, showing great promise in antibacterial and antibiofilm applications.







Abstract
The peroxynitrite anion (ONOO&#8722;) is closely associated with many diseases and the creation of ONOO&#8722; donors is an essential means of understanding its pathophysiological functions. However, it is challenging to develop ONOO&#8722; donors due to the difficulties in simultaneously producing highly reactive and short&#8208;lived nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;). Here, we report a novel strategy for constructing ONOO&#8722; donors by combining near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated type I photosensitization and photoredox catalysis. The key design using a Nile blue analogue that can serve as both a type I photosensitizer and a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst. Intriguingly, the formation of O2&#8901;&#8722; via type I photosensitization avoids oxygen interference and instead activates nitrobenzofurazan&#8208;based NO donors via oxygen&#8208;tolerant NIR photoredox catalysis. The simultaneous release of O2&#8901;&#8722; and NO leads to ONOO&#8722; release, showing both antibacterial and antibiofilm activities.

Intriguingly, the formation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; via type I photosensitization avoids oxygen interference and instead activates nitrobenzofurazan-based NO donors via oxygen-tolerant NIR photoredox catalysis. The simultaneous release of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and NO leads to ONOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; release, showing both antibacterial and antibiofilm activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metastable Hexagonal Phase SnO2 Nanoribbons with Active Edge Sites for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hexagonal phase SnO2 nanoribbon with abundant edge&#8208;active sites has been successfully synthesized by microwave&#8208;assisted mechanochemical&#8208;thermal method. Due to its special structure and morphology, the h&#8208;SnO2 catalysts exhibit near 100&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity.







Abstract
Electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a promising alternative to the energetically intensive anthraquinone process. However, there remain challenges in designing 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR catalysts that meet the application criteria. Here, we successfully adopt a microwave&#8208;assisted mechanochemical&#8208;thermal approach to synthesize hexagonal phase SnO2 (h&#8208;SnO2) nanoribbons with largely exposed edge structures. In 0.1&#8197;M Na2SO4 electrolyte, the h&#8208;SnO2 catalysts achieve the excellent H2O2 selectivity of 99.99&#8201;%. Moreover, when employed as the catalyst in flow cell devices, they exhibit a high yield of 3885.26&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to the special crystal structure and morphology, resulting in abundantly exposed edge active sites to convert O2 to H2O2, which is confirmed by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>A Simple Colorimetric Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au Tip Sensor with a New Functional Nucleic Acid Probe for Food&#8208;borne Pathogen Salmonella typhimurium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and portable Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au tip sensor was constructed to achieve specific, sensitive, and colorimetric detection of Salmonella typhimurium using an RNase H2&#8208;specific nucleic acid molecule derived from a random&#8208;sequence synthetic nucleic acid pool by in vitro selection.







Abstract
An Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au tip sensor is developed for the detection of Salmonella typhimurium (Salmonella), using a new synthetic nucleic acid probe (NAP) as a linker for the immobilization of a DNA&#8208;conjugated Au nanoparticle (AuNP) onto a DNA&#8208;attached thin Au layer inside a pipette tip. In the presence of Salmonella, RNase H2 from Salmonella (STH2) cleaves the NAP and the freed DNA&#8208;conjugated AuNP can be visually detected by a paper strip. This portable biosensor does not require any electronic, electrochemical or optical equipment. It delivers a detection limit of 3.2&#215;103&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1 for Salmonella in 1&#8197;h without cell&#8208;culturing or signal amplification and does not show cross&#8208;reactivity with several control bacteria. Further, the sensor reliably detects Salmonella spiked in food samples, such as ground beef and chicken, milk, and eggs. The sensor can be reused and is stable at ambient temperature, showing its potential as a point&#8208;of&#8208;need device for the prevention of food poisoning by Salmonella.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Enhanced O&#8722;H Cleavage in Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of a magnetic field, the spin&#8208;enhanced electrochemical water oxidation was observed on ferrimagnetic Fe3O4. In the nucleophilic attack of FeIV=O by molecular water, the magnetized Fe3O4 catalyst polarizes the spin states of the nucleophilic attacking intermediates, during which spin&#8208;enhanced singlet O&#8722;H cleavage and triplet O&#8722;O bonding occurred synergistically.







Abstract
Herein we report the vital role of spin polarization in proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated water oxidation over a magnetized catalyst. During the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over ferrimagnetic Fe3O4, the external magnetic field induced a remarkable increase in the OER current, however, this increment achieved in weakly alkaline pH (pH&#8197;9) was almost 20 times that under strongly alkaline conditions (pH&#8197;14). The results of the surface modification experiment and H/D kinetic isotope effect investigation confirm that, at weakly alkaline pH, during the nucleophilic attack of FeIV=O by molecular water, the magnetized Fe3O4 catalyst polarizes the spin states of the nucleophilic attacking intermediates. The spin&#8208;enhanced singlet O&#8722;H cleavage and triplet O&#8722;O bonding occur synergistically, which promotes the O2 generation more significantly than the strongly alkaline case involving only spin&#8208;enhanced O&#8722;O bonding.

         <title>Mosaic CuI&#8722;CuII&#8722;InIII 2D Perovskites: Pressure&#8208;Dependence of the Intervalence Charge Transfer and a Mechanochemical Alloying Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mosaic perovskites, featuring 3 different octahedral metal sites, allow for adjacent CuI/II sites, which otherwise does not occur in stoichiometric layered perovskites. The CuI/II intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) affords a 30&#8208;GPa reduction in the onset pressure for appreciable conductivity (10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) compared to a CuII perovskite.







Abstract
The perovskite (BA)4[CuII(CuIInIII)0.5]Cl8 (1BA; BA+=butylammonium) allows us to study the high&#8208;pressure structural, optical, and transport properties of a mixed&#8208;valence 2D perovskite. Compressing 1BA reduces the onset energy of CuI/II intervalence charge transfer from 1.2&#8197;eV at ambient pressure to 0.2&#8197;eV at 21&#8197;GPa. The electronic conductivity of 1BA increases by 4 orders of magnitude upon compression to 20&#8197;GPa, when the activation energy for conduction decreases to 0.16&#8197;eV. In contrast, CuII perovskites achieve similar conductivity at &#8776;50&#8197;GPa. The solution&#8208;state synthesis of these perovskites is complicated, with more undesirable side products likely from the precursor mixtures containing three different metal ions. To circumvent this problem, we demonstrate an efficient mechanochemical synthesis to expand this family of halide perovskites with complex composition by simply pulverizing together powders of 2D CuII single perovskites and CuIInIII double perovskites.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Mediated Radical Stabilization and Dynamic Covalent Bonding: Tunable, Reversible and Photocontrollable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of a Lewis acid into the solution of a radical &#963;&#8208;dimer led to a radical, which is stabilized by captodative effect, single electron transfer and steric effect. This work describes a strategy not only to isolate a dynamically stable radical with physical property tunability, but to efficiently regulate the radical dissociation with reversibility and photocontrollability.







Abstract
This work describes a strategy not only to isolate a dynamically stable radical with physical property tunability, but to efficiently regulate the radical dissociation with reversibility and photo controllability. The addition of Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 (BCF) into the solution of a radical &#963;&#8208;dimer (1&#8208;1) led to a stable radical (1&#8901;&#8208;2B), which has been characterized by EPR spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in conjunction with theoretical calculation. The radical species is stabilized mainly by captodative effect, single electron transfer and steric effect. The absorption maximum of the radical can be tuned by using different Lewis acids. Dimer 1&#8208;1 can be achieved back by addition of a stronger base into the solution of 1&#8901;&#8208;2B, exhibiting a reversible process. By introducing a photo BCF generator, the dissociation of the dimer and the formation of the radical adduct become photocontrollable.

Abstract
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of amidoacrylates using deuterated methanol afforded &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dideuterio&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino esters in excellent enantiomeric ratios (mostly &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5) and almost complete deuteration (99&#8201;%). The new protocol was used to prepare dideuterio&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid fragments in some drugs. Furthermore, the stereoselective deuteration was applied in a concise synthesis of dideuterio l&#8208;DOPA.

         <title>An Efficient Opal&#8208;Suppressor Tryptophanyl Pair Creates New Routes for Simultaneously Incorporating up to Three Distinct Noncanonical Amino Acids into Proteins in Mammalian Cells
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study significantly expands the scope of multiple noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis in mammalian cells by developing a tryptophanyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair that efficiently decodes the TGA stop codon. It can be combined with three previously established pairs to create new ways to incorporate up to three distinct ncAAs into a protein in mammalian cells. Using this technology, two distinct cytotoxic drugs were site&#8208;specifically conjugated to a full&#8208;length humanized antibody.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of multiple distinct noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in mammalian cells is a promising technology, where each ncAA must be assigned to a different orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pair that reads a distinct nonsense codon. Available pairs suppress TGA or TAA codons at a considerably lower efficiency than TAG, limiting the scope of this technology. Here we show that the E. coli tryptophanyl (EcTrp) pair is an excellent TGA&#8208;suppressor in mammalian cells, which can be combined with the three other established pairs to develop three new routes for dual&#8208;ncAA incorporation. Using these platforms, we site&#8208;specifically incorporated two different bioconjugation handles into an antibody with excellent efficiency, and subsequently labeled it with two distinct cytotoxic payloads. Additionally, we combined the EcTrp pair with other pairs to site&#8208;specifically incorporate three distinct ncAAs into a reporter protein in mammalian cells.

         <title>Asymmetric C1 Extension of Aldehydes through Biocatalytic Cascades for Stereodivergent Synthesis of Mandelic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic cascades consisting of L&#8208;threonine aldolase (LTA), L&#8208;threonine dehydratase (LTD) and 4&#8208;hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS) were developed for cyanide&#8208;free asymmetric C1&#8208;extension. Engineering of the central enzyme, HmaS, enabled the stereodivergent synthesis of mandelic acids from glycine and aromatic aldehydes.







Abstract
The development of mild, efficient, and enantioselective methods for preparing chiral building blocks from simple, renewable carbon units has been a long&#8208;term goal of the sustainable chemical industry. Mandelate derivatives are valuable pharmaceutical intermediates and chiral resolving agents, but their manufacture relies heavily on highly toxic cyanide. Herein, we report (S)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS)&#8208;centered biocatalytic cascades for the synthesis of mandelates from benzaldehydes and glycine. We show that HmaS can be engineered to perform R&#8208;selective hydroxylation by single&#8208;point mutation, empowering the stereodivergent synthesis of both (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;mandelate derivatives. These biocatalytic cascades enabled the production of various mandelate derivatives with high atom economy as well as excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and ee values (up to &gt;99&#8201;%). This methodology offers an effective cyanide&#8208;free technology for greener and sustainable production of mandelate derivatives.

         <title>Visible Light Conjugation with Triazolinediones as a Route to Degradable Poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;Lipids for mRNA Lipid Nanoparticle Formulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugation of triazolinediones to poly(ethylene glycol) under visible light irradiation introduces labile bonds into the polymer backbone. These polymers can be used for engineering mRNA lipid nanoparticle formulations with a polymer coating that is degradable under physiologically relevant aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is considered as the gold standard for colloidal stabilization of nanomedicines, yet PEG is non&#8208;degradable and lacks functionality on the backbone. Herein, we introduce concomitantly PEG backbone functionality and degradability via a one&#8208;step modification with 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;diones (TAD) under green light. The TAD&#8208;PEG conjugates are degradable in aqueous medium under physiological conditions, with the rate of hydrolysis depending on pH and temperature. Subsequently, a PEG&#8208;lipid is modified with TAD&#8208;derivatives and successfully used for messenger RNA (mRNA) lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery, thereby improving mRNA transfection efficiency on multiple cell cultures in vitro. In vivo, in mice, mRNA LNP formulation exhibited a similar tissue distribution as common LNPs, with a slight decrease in transfection efficiency. Our findings pave the road towards the design of degradable, backbone&#8208;functionalized PEG for applications in nanomedicine and beyond.

         <title>Electrocatalytically Activating and Reducing N2 Molecule by Tuning Activity of Local Hydrogen Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically combines computational and experimental investigations and uncovers that N2 molecule can be effectively activated and reduced on electrocatalysts by tuning activity of local hydrogen radical.







Abstract
Decarbonizing N2 conversion is particularly challenging, but essential for sustainable development of industry and agriculture. Herein, we achieve electrocatalytic activation/reduction of N2 on X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C (X=Pd, Ir and Pt) dual&#8208;atom catalysts under ambient condition. We provide solid experimental evidence that local hydrogen radical (H*) generated on the X site of the X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts can participate in the activation/reduction of N2 adsorbed on the Fe site. More importantly, we reveal that the reactivity of X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts for N2 activation/reduction can be well adjusted by the activity of H* generated on the X site, i.e., the interaction between the X&#8722;H bond. Specifically, X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst with the weakest X&#8722;H bonding exhibits the highest H* activity, which is beneficial to the subsequent cleavage of X&#8722;H bond for N2 hydrogenation. With the most active H*, the Pd/Fe dual&#8208;atom site promotes the turnover frequency of N2 reduction by up to 10 times compared with the pristine Fe site.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decarbonizing N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion is particularly challenging, but essential for sustainable development of industry and agriculture. Herein, we achieve electrocatalytic activation/reduction of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C (X=Pd, Ir and Pt) dual-atom catalysts under ambient condition. We provide solid experimental evidence that local hydrogen radical (H*) generated on the X site of the X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts can participate in the activation/reduction of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorbed on the Fe site. More importantly, we reveal that the reactivity of X/Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation/reduction can be well adjusted by the activity of H* generated on the X site, i.e., the interaction between the X&#8722;H bond.

         <title>GdIII&#8208;19F Distance Measurements for Proteins in Cells by Electron&#8208;Nuclear Double Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GdIII&#8208;19F magnetic resonance measurements using electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) permit accessing the 1&#8211;1.5&#8197;nm distance range for proteins in human cells.







Abstract
Studies of protein structure and dynamics are usually carried out in dilute buffer solutions, conditions that differ significantly from the crowded environment in the cell. The double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) technique can track proteins&#8217; conformations in the cell by providing distance distributions between two attached spin labels. This technique, however, cannot access distances below 1.8&#8197;nm. Here, we show that GdIII&#8208;19F Mims electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) measurements can cover part of this short range. Low temperature solution and in&#8208;cell ENDOR measurements, complemented with room temperature solution and in&#8208;cell GdIII&#8208;19F PRE (paramagnetic relaxation enhancement) NMR measurements, were performed on fluorinated GB1 and ubiquitin (Ub), spin&#8208;labeled with rigid GdIII tags. The proteins were delivered into human cells via electroporation. The solution and in&#8208;cell derived GdIII&#8208;19F distances were essentially identical and lie in the 1&#8211;1.5&#8197;nm range revealing that both, GB1 and Ub, retained their overall structure in the GdIII and 19F regions in the cell.

         <title>Synchronously Manipulating Absorption and Extinction Coefficient of Semiconducting Polymers via Precise Dual&#8208;Acceptor Engineering for NIR&#8208;II Excited Photothermal Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;acceptor engineering was used to synchronously manipulate the absorption and extinction coefficient of semiconducting polymers for the first time. The optimized agent, which exhibits strong NIR&#8208;II absorption with high extinction coefficient and prominent photothermal conversion capability, shows an unprecedented performance in multi&#8208;modal phototheranostics for cancer.







Abstract
Integrating the ultralong excitation wavelength, high extinction coefficient, and prominent photothermal conversion ability into a single photothermal agent is an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Herein, a precise dual&#8208;acceptor engineering strategy is exploited for this attempt based on donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type semiconductor polymers by subtly regulating the molar proportions of the two employed electron acceptor moieties featuring different electronic affinity and &#960;&#8208;conjugation degrees, and making full use of the active intramolecular motion&#8208;induced photothermal effect. The optimal polymer SP4 synchronously shows desirable second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) absorption, an extremely high extinction coefficient, and satisfactory photothermal conversion behavior. Consequently, the unprecedented performance of SP4 NPs on 1064&#8197;nm laser&#8208;excited photoacoustic imaging (PAI)&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) is demonstrated by the precise tumor diagnosis and complete tumor elimination.

         <title>Polydopamine as a visible&#8208;light photosensitiser for photoinitiated polymerisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine free radicals are observed to be photo&#8208;responsive under visible light irradiation, amplifying semiquinone radical population and modifying redox potential. Using polydopamine nanoparticles, the researchers photo&#8208;initiate free&#8208;radical polymerization of vinylic monomers via sensitization of a diphenyliodonium photo&#8208;initiator. This work offers important insights into melanin&#8208;like materials and presents PDA as a promising photosensitizer.







Abstract
Polydopamine (PDA) is a synthetic model for melanin and has a wide range of opto&#8208;electronic properties that underpin its utility in applied and biological settings, from broadband light absorbance to possessing stable free radical species. Here, we show that PDA free radicals are photo&#8208;responsive under visible light irradiation, enabling PDA to serve as a photo&#8208;redox catalyst. Steady&#8208;state and transient electron spin resonance spectroscopy reveals a reversible amplification in semiquinone radical population within PDA under visible light. This photo&#8208;response modifies the redox potential of PDA and supports sensitisation of exogenous species via photoinduced electron transfer (PET). We demonstrate the utility of this discovery by employing PDA nanoparticles to photosensitise a common diaryliodonium photoinitiator and initiate free&#8208;radical polymerisation (FRP) of vinylic monomers. In situ 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals an interplay between PDA&#8208;driven photosensitising and radical quenching during FRP under blue, green, and red light. This work provides crucial insights into the photoactive free radical properties of melanin&#8208;like materials and reveals a promising new application for polydopamine as a photosensitiser.

Abstract
Fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs) have become one of the significantly strategical flexible energy&#8208;storage materials towards future wearable textile electronics and metaverse technologies. Here, we develop the high&#8208;performance FSCs based on multiscale dot&#8208;wire&#8208;sheet heterostructure microfiber of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/silk nanofibers (NCDs&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/SNFs) hybrids via microfluidic fabrication. Due to the enlarged interlayer spacing, plentiful porous channels, accelerated H+ ion transport dynamics, large electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical strength/flexibility, the NCDs&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/SNFs possesses high volumetric capacitance (2218.7&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and reversible charge&#8211;discharge stability in 1&#8197;M H2SO4 electrolyte. Furthermore, the solid&#8208;state FSCs present high energy density (57.9&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3), good capacitance (1157&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3), long&#8208;life cycles (82.3&#8201;% capacitance retention after 40000&#8197;cycles), which realize the actual energy&#8208;supply applications (powering lamp, watch and toy car).

         <title>Remote Control of One&#8208;Handed Helicity in Polyacetylenes through Flexible Spacers in Water: Impact of the Spacer Length</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sergeants and soldiers&#8208;type remote control of one&#8208;handed helicity in dynamic helical copolymers of chiral/achiral biphenylylacetylenes was achieved in water as well as in aqueous and nonaqueous organic solvents through intramolecular hydrophobic interactions with a small amount of chiral binaphthyl residues (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) introduced at the terminal of achiral flexible oligo(ethylene glycol) spacers as many as 80&#8197;bonds away from the polymer backbones.







Abstract
We report the unprecedented sergeants and soldiers (S&amp;S)&#8208;type remote control of one&#8208;handed helicity in copolymers of chiral/achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing amphiphilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains. A small amount of chiral binaphthyl residues (&#8804;10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) introduced at the terminal of the achiral OEG spacers as many as 80&#8197;bonds away from the polymer backbones induced a complete one&#8208;handed helix in water through preferential intramolecular encapsulation of the binaphthyl groups within a cavity of the copolymers. A fully one&#8208;handed helix can be induced virtually independent of the OEG spacer length and concentrations. At a specific spacer length, however, its helix&#8208;sense was inverted. The copolymers also form an excess one&#8208;handed helix in organic solvents in an OEG spacer&#8208;length dependent manner, yet far from the polymer backbones. We show the superiority of the present covalent&#8208;bond driven S&amp;S&#8208;type remote helicity control over the corresponding noncovalent helicity induction approach.

         <title>Stereospecific Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylations to Functionalized Alkenes and C&#8208;Glycosides
</title>

         <dc:description>
A convenient photo&#8208;catalyzed, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed with 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) and vinylbenziodoxol(on)es (VBX, VBO) to synthesize di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes with complete E&#8201;:&#8201;Z selectivity. A diastereoselective C&#8208;vinylation of glycosides was also developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a concerted radical coupling pathway.







Abstract
We report an efficient radical&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C coupling through photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reactions of 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) and vinylbenziodoxol(on)es (VBX, VBO). This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and mild photocatalytic method has excellent functional group tolerance and affords vinylated products in good yields, with complete retention of the alkene configuration. The utility of the methodology is demonstrated by the diastereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;vinyl glycosides. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the C&#8722;C bond formation is stereospecific and proceeds through a concerted radical coupling transition state.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Monofluorocyclohexenes through Photocatalyzed Cascade Cyclization of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first photocatalyzed cascade cyclization of readily available &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of monofluorocyclohexenes has been achieved. The reaction shows broad substrate scope and high diastereoselectivity, and the synthetic potential has been demonstrated by downstream transformations.







Abstract
Monofluoroalkenes are nonhydrolyzable mimetics of amides. Previous work focused on the synthesis of non&#8208;cyclic monofluoroalkenes. However, diastereoselective synthesis of monofluorocyclohexenes from non&#8208;cyclic substrates is challenging. Herein, we report the first photocatalyzed cascade cyclization reactions of readily available &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of highly functionalized monofluorocyclohexenes. The reaction shows broad substrate scope with high diastereoselectivity (&gt;30 examples, up to 86&#8201;% yield, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). The post&#8208;reaction transformations of the products demonstrate the synthetic potential of this methodology.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using the diphosphine&#8208;cobalt&#8208;zinc catalytic system, an efficient asymmetric hydrogenation of internal simple enamides has been realized. In particular, the Ph&#8208;BPE ligand can achieve convergent asymmetric hydrogenation of E/Z&#8208;substrates. High yields and excellent enantioselectivities were obtained for both acyclic and cyclic enamides bearing &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl, &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl, and &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkyl substituents. Hydrogenated products can be applied for the synthesis of useful chiral drugs such as Arfromoterol, Rotigotine, and Norsertraline. In addition, reasonable catalytic mechanism and stereocontrol mode are proposed based on DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerating Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction for Preparing&#160;Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is a formidable challenge in polycondensation to simultaneously construct multiple covalent bonds to prepare double&#8208;stranded polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) with fused multicyclic linkages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction for successfully preparing double&#8208;stranded PIMs with fused multicyclic backbone structures. A self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was developed based on the [4+2] cycloaddition of sym&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;3,7&#8208;diyne (DIBOD) and ortho&#8208;quinone compounds. In this reaction, the cycloaddition of ortho&#8208;quinone with the first alkyne of DIBOD activates the second alkyne, which reacts with ortho&#8208;quinone at a rate constant 192 times larger than that of the original alkyne. Using this self&#8208;accelerating reaction to polymerize DIBOD and spirocyclic/cyclic difunctional ortho&#8208;quinone monomers, a novel stoichiometric imbalance&#8208;promoted step&#8208;growth polymerization method was developed to prepare PIMs. The resultant PIMs possess intrinsic ultramicropores with pore sizes between 0.45 to 0.7 nm, high specific surface areas above 646 m2/g, and good H2 separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Air&#8208;stable Organoradical Boron Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both organic radicals and organoboron reagents have been broadly investigated, but the combination of them via direct C&#8211;H borylation as organic radical building blocks has never been achieved. Herein, a series of organoradical boron reagents, such as TTM&#8208;Bpin and TTM&#8208;BOH, were synthesized through the key step of C&#8211;H borylation of substrate TTM&#8208;H ((2,6&#8208;dichlorophenyl) bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl) radical for the first time. They are air stable enough to be stored in the solid state for several months under dark conditions, and fully investigated through single crystal analysis, EPR and DFT calculations. Furthermore, they can smoothly work in the standard Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling (SMC) reaction with retention of the carbon radical center. Meanwhile, these radical species bearing different boron units display fluorescent character and are potentially applied for the collective synthesis of luminescent organic radicals, as well as other functionalized open&#8208;shell materials.</dc:description>

Herein, a series of organoradical boron reagents, such as TTM-Bpin and TTM-BOH, were synthesized through the key step of C&#8211;H borylation of substrate TTM-H ((2,6-dichlorophenyl) bis(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl) radical for the first time. They are air stable enough to be stored in the solid state for several months under dark conditions, and fully investigated through single crystal analysis, EPR and DFT calculations. Furthermore, they can smoothly work in the standard Suzuki-Miyaura coupling (SMC) reaction with retention of the carbon radical center. Meanwhile, these radical species bearing different boron units display fluorescent character and are potentially applied for the collective synthesis of luminescent organic radicals, as well as other functionalized open-shell materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Redox Chemistry of p&#8208;Type Poly(vinyldimethylphenazine) Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free organic electrode materials have attracted vast research attention owing to their designable structures and tunable electrochemical properties. Although n&#8208;type cathode materials could be used in various metal&#8208;ion batteries, p&#8208;type ones with high potential can deliver high energy density. Herein, we report a new p&#8208;type polymeric cathode material, poly(2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;dihydro&#8208;phenazine) (PVDMP), with a theoretical capacity of 227 mAh g&#8722;1. PVDMP featuring two&#8208;step redox reaction will be doped by two anions to maintain electroneutrality during oxidation, which resulted in an anion&#8208;dependent electrochemical behavior of PVDMP&#8208;based cathode. The suitable dopant anion for PVDMP was selected and the doping mechanism was confirmed. Under the optimized condition, PVDMP cathode can deliver a high initial capacity of 220 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C and even remains 150 mAh g&#8722;1 after 3900 cycles. This work not only provides a new kind of p&#8208;type organic cathode materials but also deepens the understanding of its anion&#8208;dependent redox chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Metal Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer Mediated Allene Functionalization by Cobalt and Titanium Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic metal hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reactions have proven to be a powerful method for alkene functionalization. This work reports the discovery of Co&#8208;porphines as highly efficient MHAT catalysts with a loading of only 0.01 mol% for unprecedented chemoselective allene functionalization under photoirradiation. Moreover, the newly developed bimetallic strategy by the combination of photo Co&#8208;MHAT and Ti catalysis enabled the successful carbonyl allylation with a wide range of amino, oxy, thio, aryl, and alkyl&#8208;allenes providing expedient access to valuable &#946;&#8208;functionalized homoallylic alcohols in over 100 examples with exceptional regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Mechanism studies and DFT calculations supported that selectively transferring hydrogen atoms from cobalt hydride to allenes and generating allyl radicals is the key step in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent scrambling in porous polyarylthioethers through a stepwise SNAr for tunable bandgap and porosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous poly(aryl thioether)s offer stability and electronic tunability by robust sulfur&#8208;aryl conjugated architecture, but synthetic access is hindered due to limited control over the nucleophilic nature of sulfides and the air sensitivity of aromatic thiols. Here, we report a simple, one&#8208;pot, inexpensive, regioselective synthesis of highly porous poly(aryl thioether)s through polycondensation of perfluoroaromatic compounds with sodium sulfide. The unprecedented temperature&#8208;dependent para&#8208;directing formation of thioether linkages leads to a stepwise transition of the polymer extension into a network, thereby allowing fine control of the porosity and optical bandgaps. The obtained porous organic polymers with ultra&#8208;microporosity (&lt;1 nm) and sulfur as the surface functional groups show size&#8208;dependent separation of organic micropollutants and selective removal of mercury ions from water. Our findings offer easy access to poly(aryl thioether)s with accessible sulfur functionalities and higher complexity, which will help in realizing advanced synthetic designs in applications such as adsorption, (photo)catalysis, and (opto)electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Vinylcyclopropane&#8208;Cyclopentene (VCP&#8208;CP) Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have demonstrated that the catalytic and enantioselective vinylcyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene rearrangement can be carried out on (vinylcyclopropyl)acetaldehydes through activation via enamine intermediates. The reaction makes use of racemic starting materials that, upon ring opening facilitated by the catalytic generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane, deliver an acyclic iminium ion/dienolate intermediate in which all stereochemical information has been deleted. The final cyclization step forms the rearrangement product, showing that chirality transfer from the catalyst to the final compound is highly effective and leads to the stereocontrolled formation of a variety of structurally different cyclopentenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Molten Salts&#8208;Driven Discovery of a Polar Mixed&#8208;Anion 3D framework at the nanoscale: Zn4Si2O7Cl2, Charge Transport and Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed&#8208;anion compounds widen the chemical space of attainable materials compared to single anionic compounds, but the exploration of their structural diversity is limited by common synthetic paths. Especially, oxychlorides rely mainly on layered structures, which suffer from low stability during photo(electro)catalytic processes. Herein we report a strategy to design a new polar 3D tetrahedral framework with composition Zn4Si2O7Cl2. We use a molten salt medium to enable low temperature crystallization of nanowires of this new compound, by relying on tetrahedral building units present in the melt to build the connectivity of the oxychloride. These units are combined with silicon&#8208;based connectors from a non&#8208;oxidic Zintl phase to enable precise tuning of the oxygen content. This structure brings high chemical and thermal stability, as well as strongly anisotropic hole mobility along the polar axis. These features, associated with the ability to adjust the transport properties by doping, enable to tune water splitting properties for photoelectrocatalytic H2 evolution and water oxidation. This work then paves the way to a new family of mixed&#8208;anion solids</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are key to water electrolysis. Herein, we report built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) strategy to fabricate a heterogeneous nickel phosphide&#8208;cobalt nanowire arrays grown on carbon fiber paper (Ni2P&#8208;CoCH/CFP) with large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall splitting. Impressively, Ni2P&#8208;CoCH/CFP exhibits a remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen reactions to obtain 10 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. Moreover, the fabricated lab&#8208;scale electrolyzer driven by an AAA battery delivers excellent stability after 50 h electrocatalysis with a 100% faradic efficiency. Computational calculations combining with experiments reveal the interface&#8208;induced electric field effect facilitates asymmetrical charge distributions, thereby regulating the adsorption/desorption of the intermediates during reactions. This work offers an avenue to rationally design high&#8208;performance heterogeneous electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Practical Antibody Recruiting by Metabolic Labeling with Caged Glycans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We propose a de novo glycan display that combines metabolic labeling and a glycan&#8208;caging strategy as a facile editing method for cell&#8208;surface glycans. This method enables the introduction of antigen glycans onto cancer cells to induce immune responses through antibody recruiting. The caging strategy prevents the capture of &#945;&#8208;rhamnose (an antigen glycan) by their endogenous antibodies during the introduction of the glycan to the targeted cell surface, and subsequent uncaging successfully induces immune responses. Therefore, this study proposes a practical method for editing the cell&#8208;surface glycocalyx under promiscuous conditions, such as those in vivo, which paves the way for the development of glycan function analysis and regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Copolymers Under Kinetic, Thermodynamic, or Pathway&#8208;Switching Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular copolymers have attracted much attention due to their potential functionalities. However, the co&#8208;assembly strategies to construct co&#8208;assemblies of small molecules with well&#8208;defined sequence structures are still&#160;limited, especially for more complex crystalline block co&#8208;assemblies. Herein, we target this challenge by designing Ir(III) complexes 1 and 2, which possess unique self&#8208;assembly pathways and are capable of forming crystalline assemblies in aqueous systems. Specifically, block and random co&#8208;assemblies of 1 and 2 can be synthesized by kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. Meanwhile, by adjusting the water content to orthogonalize the on&#8208;pathway and the off&#8208;pathway, an unprecedented pathway&#8208;switching approach is realized to synthesize block and random co&#8208;assemblies. By coupling kinetic pathways, the present co&#8208;assembly strategies are expected to pave the way for the synthesis of crystalline co&#8208;assemblies of small molecules and the construction of organic heterostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cleavable Polymers via Oxidation of Thioether Moieties and Thiol Click Reactions: A Click&#8208;Declick Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past decades click chemistries including thiol chemistries have found wide applications in the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polymers. In this research, a click&#8208;declick strategy based on the oxidation of heteroaromatic thioethers and the substitution reactions between the oxidized groups and thiols, is proposed for the synthesis of the cleavable polymers. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments, block copolymers (BCP) and star&#8208;like polymers are synthesized by thiol&#8208;phenylsulfone substitution reactions, and heteroaromatic thioethers are produced at the junction points of the BCP chains or on the crosslinking sites of the star&#8208;like polymer. The thioethers can be oxidized to heteroaromatic sulfoxides or sulfones, depending on the oxidization condition. It is demonstrated that both sulfoxides or sulfones can have base catalyzed nucleophilic substitution reactions with thiols, leading to the cleavage of the polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Ammonium Ion Intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation with Crystal Water Promotion Effect in Layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;metal NH4+ carrier has attracted tremendous interests for aqueous energy storage owing to its light molar mass and fast diffusion in aqueous electrolytes. Previous study inferred that NH4+ ion storage in layered VOPO4&#8729;2H2O is impossible due to the removal of NH4+ from NH4VOPO4 leads to a phase change inevitably. Herein, we update this cognition and demonstrated highly reversible intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation behavior of NH4+ in layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O host. Satisfactory specific capacity of 154.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and very stable discharge potential plateau at 0.4 V based on reference electrode was achieved in VOPO4&#183;2H2O. A rocking&#8208;chair ammonium&#8208;ion full cell with the VOPO4&#183;2H2O // 2.0 M NH4OTf // PTCDI configuration exhibited a specific capacity of 55 mAh g&#8208;1, an average operating voltage of about 1.0 V and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability over 500 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of ~99 %. Theoretical DFT calculations suggest a unique crystal water substitution process by ammonium ion during the intercalation process. Our results provide new insight into the intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation of NH4+ ions in layered hydrated phosphates through crystal water enhancement effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrarapid Nanomanufacturing of High&#8208;Quality Bimetallic Anode Library toward Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimetallic alloy nanomaterials are promising anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) due to their high electrochemical performance. The most well&#8208;adopted fabrication method for bimetallic alloy nanomaterials is tube furnace annealing (TFA) synthesis, which can hardly satisfy the trade&#8208;off among granularity, dispersity and grain coarsening due to mutual constraints. Herein, we report a facile, scalable and ultrafast high&#8208;temperature radiation (HTR) method for the fabrication of a library of ultrafine bimetallic alloys with narrow size distribution (~10&#8208;20 nm), uniform dispersion and high loading. The metal&#8208;anchor containing heteroatoms (i.e., O and N), ultrarapid heating/cooling rate (~103 K s&#8208;1) and super&#8208;short heating duration (several seconds) synergistically contribute to the successful synthesis of small&#8208;sized alloy anodes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the as&#8208;prepared BiSb&#8208;HTR anode shows ultrahigh stability indicated by negligible degradation after 800 cycles. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals the K+ storage mechanism of BiSb&#8208;HTR. This study can shed light on the new, rapid and scalable nanomanufacturing of high&#8208;quality bimetallic alloys toward extended applications of energy storage, energy conversion and electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic cages have potential applications in molecular inclusion/recognition and porous organic crystals. Bridging arene units with sp3&#160;atoms enables facile construction of rigid isolated internal vacancies, and various prismatic arene cages have been synthesized by kinetically controlled covalent bond formation. However, the synthesis of a tetrahedral one, which requires twice as much bond formation as prismatic ones, has been limited to a thermodynamically controlled dynamic SNAr reaction, and this reversible covalent bond formation made the resulting cage product chemically unstable. Here we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed high&#8208;yielding and highly 1,3,5&#8208;selective room temperature [2+2+2] cycloaddition of push&#8208;pull alkynes and its application to the synthesis of chemically stable aryl ether cages of various shapes and sizes, including prismatic and tetrahedral&#160;forms. These aryl ether cages are highly crystalline and intertwine with each other to form regular packing structures.&#160;Some&#160;aryl ether&#160;cages encapsulated isolated water molecules in&#160;their hydrophobic cavity&#160;by hydrogen bonding with the&#160;multiple&#160;ester moieties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The total synthesis of lucidumone (1), a&#160;Ganoderma&#160;meroterpenoid, was accomplished in racemic form&#160;from easily prepared&#160;6&#160;and&#160;7&#160;in 10 steps&#160;as the longest linear sequence. The synthesis was completed through one&#8208;pot preparation of the tetracyclic core skeleton by Claisen rearrangement followed by an intramolecular aldol reaction. The intramolecular aldol reaction allowed for the stereocontrolled construction of the&#160;bicyclo [2.2.2] octane skeleton fused to an indanone structure.

         <title>A Linear C=Ge=C Heteroallene with a Di&#8208;coordinated Germanium Atom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allenes (&gt;C=C=C&lt;) are classified as cumulated dienes with a linear structure and an sp&#8208;hybridized central carbon atom. We have synthesized and isolated a stable 2&#8208;germapropadiene with bulky silyl substituents. The 2&#8208;germapropadiene allene moiety adopts a linear structure both in the solid state and in solution. An X&#8208;ray diffraction electron&#8208;density&#8208;distribution (EDD) analysis of this 2&#8208;germapropadiene confirmed the linear C=Ge=C geometry with a formally sp&#8208;hybridized germanium atom that bears two orthogonal C=Ge &#960;&#8208;bonds. Based on detailed structural and computational studies, we concluded that the linear geometry of the isolated 2&#8208;germapropadiene most likely arises from the negative hyperconjugation of the silyl substituents at the terminal carbon atoms. The 2&#8208;germapropadiene reacts rapidly with nucleophiles, indicating that the linearly oriented germanium atom is highly electrophilic.</dc:description>

         <title>Mercaptoamine&#8208;assisted Post&#8208;encapsulation of Metal Nanoparticles within Preformed Zeolites and their Analogues for Hydroisomerization and Methane Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a general synthetic strategy for post&#8208;encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within preformed zeolites using post&#8208;synthetic modification. Both anionic and cationic precursors to metal nanoparticle are supported on 8&#8208; and 10&#8208;membered ring zeolites and analogues during wet impregnation using 2&#8208;aminoethanethiol (AET) as a bi&#8208;grafting agent. Thiol groups are coordinated to metal centers, whereas amine moieties are dynamically attached to micropore walls via acid&#8208;base interactions. The dynamic acid&#8208;base interactions cause the even distribution of the metal&#8211;AET complex throughout the zeolite matrix. These processes encapsulate Au, Rh, and Ni precursors within the CHA, *MRE, MFI zeolite, and SAPO&#8208;34 zeolite analogues, for which small channel apertures preclude the post&#8208;synthesis impregnation of metal precursors. Sequential activation forms small and uniform nanoparticles (1&#8211;2.5 nm in diameter), as confirmed through electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Containment within the small micropores protected the nanoparticles against harsh thermal sintering conditions and prevented the fouling of the metal surface by coke, thus resulting in a high catalytic performance in n&#8208;dodecane hydroisomerization and methane decomposition. The remarkable specificity of the thiol to metal precursors and the dynamic acid&#8208;base interaction make these protocols extendable to various metal&#8208;zeolite systems, suitable for shape&#8208;selective catalysts in challenging chemical environments.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;mediated DNA sensing is demonstrated to be critical for launching antitumor immunity. However, DNA&#8208;based cGAS&#8208;STING agonists are rarely reported owing to low cell permeability, poor biostability and, especially, limited length of exogenous DNA.&#160;Here, we present a virus&#8208;like particle which is self&#8208;assembled from long DNA building blocks generated through rolling&#8208;circle amplification (RCA) and covered with cationic liposomes.&#160;Based on long and densely packed DNA structure, it could efficiently induce liquid phase condensation of cGAS and activate STING signaling to produce inflammatory cytokines.&#160;Moreover, this virus&#8208;like particle could also trigger the formation of AIM2 inflammasome to induce gasdermin D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, boosting antitumor immunity.&#160;Thus, this study provides a simple and robust strategy for cancer immunotherapy for clinical application.&#160;This is the first study to report the intrinsic immunogenicity of RCA products, thus facilitating their biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Sensitization Upconversion in Solution Dispersions of Co&#8208;Crystal Assemblies of Mononuclear Yb3+ and Eu3+ Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide upconversion luminescence in nanoparticles has prompted continuous breakthroughs in information storage, temperature sensing, and biomedical applications, among others. Achieving upconversion luminescence at the molecular scale is still a critical challenge in modern chemistry. In this work, we explored the upconversion luminescence of solution dispersions of co&#8208;crystals composed of discrete mononuclear Yb(DBM)3Bpy and Eu(DBM)3Bpy complexes (DBM: dibenzoylmethane, Bpy: 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine). The 613 nm emission of Eu3+ was observed under excitation of Yb3+ at 980 nm. From the series of molecular assemblies studied, the most intense luminescence was obtained for a 1:1 molar ratio of Yb3+:Eu3+, resulting in a high quantum yield of 0.67% at 2.1 W/cm2. The structure and energy transfer mechanism of the assemblies were fully characterized. This is the first example of an Eu3+&#8208;based upconverting system composed of two discrete mononuclear lanthanide complexes present as co&#8208;crystals in non&#8208;deuterated solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Gasoline Process Over Zeolite Beta</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarbonizing the transportation sector is among the biggest challenges in the fight against climate change. CO2&#8208;neutral fuels, such as those obtained from renewable methanol, have the potential to account for a large share of the solution, since these could be directly compatible with existing power trains. Although discovered in 1977, the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;gasoline (MTG) process has hardly reached industrial maturity, among other reasons, because maximizing the production of gasoline range hydrocarbons from methanol has proved complicated. In this work, we apply multimodal operando UV&#8208;Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy coupled with an online mass spectrometer and "mobility&#8208;dependent" solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy to better understand the reaction mechanism over zeolites H&#8208;Beta and Zn&#8208;Beta. Significantly, the influential co&#8208;catalytic role of oxymethylene species is linked to gasoline formation, which impacts the MTG process more than carbonylated species.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small Bandgap Conjugated Polymers Based on N&#8211;B&#8592;N Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the breakthrough of conductive polymers in 1977, scientists have made great efforts to create small bandgap (Eg) conjugated polymers. Two general strategies to design small Eg conjugated polymers are quinoid structure and donor&#8208;acceptor structure. Ultrasmall Eg conjugated polymers (Eg &lt; 1.0 eV) always suffer from poor air stability because of high&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels. In this work, we report a new strategy to design ultrasmall Eg conjugated polymers by N&#8211;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8211;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). The resulting polymer exhibits an Eg of 0.82 eV and an onset absorption wavelength of &gt;1500 nm. Moreover, the polymer exhibits excellent air stability because of its low&#8208;lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels. An unprecedented property of this polymer is the selective light absorption in the infrared range (800&#8208;1500 nm) and high transparency in the visible range (400&#8208;780 nm). Using this property, for the first time, we demonstrate the application of conjugated polymers as transparent thermal&#8208;shielding coating layer on glass, which reduces indoor solar irradiation through window and consequently reduces power consumption for cooling of building and cars in summer.</dc:description>

We show that the target guest can serve as a gating component of the host to block the undesired guest, giving molecular sieving effect for the adsorbent possessing large pores. Two hydrophilic/water&#8208;stable metal azolate frameworks were designed to compare the effects of gating and pore&#8208;opening flexibility. Large amounts (up to 28.7 mmol g&#8722;1) of ethanol with fuel&#8208;grade (99.5%+) and even higher purities (99.9999%+) can be produced in a single adsorption process from not only 95:5 but also 10:90 ethanol/water mixtures. More interestingly, the pore&#8208;opening adsorbent possessing large pore apertures showed not only high water adsorption capacity but also exceptionally high water/ethanol selectivity characteristic of molecular sieving. Computational simulations demonstrated the critical role of guest&#8208;anchoring aperture for the guest&#8208;dominated gating process.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanoparticles with Universal Dispersibility through Crown Ether Surface Coordination for Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis and Separation Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dispersing metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) solids in stable colloids is crucial for their availability and processibility. Herein, we report a crown ether surface coordination approach for functionalizing the surface&#8208;exposed metal sites of MOF particles with amphiphilic carboxylated crown ether (CEC). The surface&#8208;bound crown ethers significantly improve MOF solvation without compromising the accessible voids. We demonstrate that CEC&#8208;coated MOFs exhibit exceptional colloidal dispersibility and stability in 11 distinct solvents and six polymer matrices with a wide range of polarities. The MOF&#8208;CEC can be instantaneously suspended in immiscible two&#8208;phase solvents as an effective phase&#8208;transfer catalyst and can form various uniform membranes with enhanced adsorption and separation performance, illustrating the effectiveness of crown ether coating.</dc:description>

         <title>Braided Fiber Current Collectors for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Fiber Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries represent a promising power strategy for the rising wearable electronics. However, most fiber current collectors are solid with vastly increased weights of inactive materials and sluggish charge transport, thus resulting in low energy densities which have hindered the development of fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries in the past decade. Here, a braided fiber current collector with multiple channels was prepared by multi&#8208;axial winding method to not only increase the mass fraction of active materials, but also to promote ion transport along fiber electrodes. In comparison to typical solid copper wires, the braided fiber current collector hosted 139% graphite with only 1/3 mass. The fiber graphite anode with braided current collector delivered high specific capacity of 170 mAh&#8231;g&#8208;1 based on the overall electrode weight, which was 2 times higher than that of its counterpart solid copper wire. The resulting fiber battery showed high energy density of 62 Wh&#8231;kg&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of One to Four As4 Analogues, (Ge2As2) or (Ge3As), in the Coordination Sphere of [PhM]+, [MesM]+, or M2+ (M = Zn, Cd, Hg)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral units of p&#8208;block atoms proved to be excellent building blocks for novel molecular architectures and for introducing new elemental combinations which are not otherwise accessible. In this work, we present a series of clusters obtained by reactions of binary Ge/As anions with [MPh2] (M = Zn, Cd, Hg; Ph = phenyl). The study is grounded on the fact that the binary reactant gained by extracting the solid &#8216;K2GeAs&#8217; with ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine (en) co&#8208;exists as (Ge2As2)2&#8211; and (Ge3As)3&#8211; in solution. This allows for a larger variety of products by &#8216;selecting&#8217; the most suitable species for the final ternary complex to crystallize. The reactions afforded the unprecedented first step of the corresponding interaction, thus attachment of (MPh)+ to a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral unit in [PhZn(Ge3As)]2&#8722; (1) and [PhHg(Ge3As)]2&#8722; (2), and complex anions with two, three, or four units, [(Ge3As)Zn(Ge2As2)]3&#8722; (3), [Cd3(Ge3As)3]3&#8722; (4), and [Zn3(Ge3As)4]6&#8722; (5). Quantum chemistry confirmed the compositions and the positions of the Ge or As atoms, beside explaining structural peculiarities. The subtle impact of different [MR2] reactants was additionally studied by corresponding reactions using [ZnMes2] (Mes = mesityl), which showed success in selectively crystallizing [MesZn(Ge3As)]2&#8722; (6). Based on our findings, we derive a suggestion of the underlying reaction cascade.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Enables Polymer Hydrogels with pH&#8208;Induced Reversible Dynamic Responsive Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(acrylic acid&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) (PAN) hydrogels containing multiple hydrogen bonds can exhibit pH&#8208;induced reversible dynamic responsive behaviors. When placing a transparent hydrogel in an acid bath, as hydrogen bonds between comonomer units involving protonated COOH groups are formed faster than water diffusion, a nonequilibrium light&#8208;scattering state is formed to turn the hydrogel opaque, while as the swelling equilibrium is reached over time, the hydrogel regains its transparency. Likewise, when the transparent, hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrogel is subsequently immersed in DI water, faster water absorption occurs in where more COOH groups are deprotonated, which also generates a light&#8208;scattering state leading to opacity, while the transparency is slowly recovered after equilibrium. Using such two&#8208;way dynamic transparency evolution, a PAN&#8208;based hydrogel material is prepared to demonstrate a dynamic memory system for information memorizing&#8208;forgetting and recalling&#8208;forgetting.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the highly selective homogeneous iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) with deuterium or tritium gas as an isotope source in water and buffers. With an improved water&#8208;soluble Kerr&#8208;type catalyst, we have achieved first insights to apply HIE reactions in aqueous media with different pH media. DFT calculations gave consistent insights in the calculated energies of transition states and coordination complexes, further explaining the observed reactivity and guidance on the scope and limitations for HIE reactions in water. Finally, we adopted these findings successfully to tritium chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of an Highly Stable Aluminium Phosphonate Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Showing Reversible HCl Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concept for obtaining isoreticular compounds with tri&#8208; instead of tetravalent metal cations using highly acidic reaction conditions was developed and successfully applied in a high throughput study using N,N&#8242;&#8208;piperazinebis(methylenephosphonic acid) (H4PMP), that resulted in the discovery of a new porous aluminium phosphonate denoted CAU&#8208;60 &#8729; 6 HCl. The high&#8208;throughput study was subsequently extended to other trivalent metal ions. Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;60 &#8729; 6 HCl demonstrates reversible desorption of HCl (18.3 wt% loading) with three distinct compositions observed with zero, four or six HCl molecules per formula unit. Structural changes were followed in detail by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, EDX analysis as well as IR spectroscopy. Rapid desorption of HCl in water within minutes and subsequent adsorption from the gas phase and from aqueous solution are shown. Furthermore, it is possible to adsorb HBr into the guest free Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;60 framework, demonstrating the high stability of this compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Difunctionalization and Annulation of Ynamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of ynamides in organic synthesis has gained significant attention due to their ability to provide access to complex molecular structures through transformations such as 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization and annulation reactions. These reactions enable the formation of highly functionalized N&#8208;bearing olefins and unusual N&#8208;bearing heterocycles. In this minireview, we present a systematic overview of the regioselective difunctionalization and annulation reactions of ynamides. We discuss the use of bifunctional reagents, multi&#8208;component reactions, and radical&#8208;triggered functionalizations across the ynamides carbon&#8211;carbon multiple bonds, highlighting their potential in expanding the substrate scope. Furthermore, we provide insights into the mechanistic breakthroughs that have been achieved in recent years in the development of these reactions. Finally, we emphasize the promising future prospects of ynamides as versatile building blocks for the synthesis of complex molecular architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Solar&#8208;osmotic Power Generation from Bioinspired Anti&#8208;fouling 2D WS2 Composite Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanofluidic reverse electrodialysis provides an attractive way to harvest osmotic energy. However, most attention was paid to monotonous membrane structure optimization to promote selective ion transport, while the role of external fields and relevant mechanisms are rarely explored. Here, we demonstrate a Kevlar&#8208;toughened tungsten disulfide (WS2) composite membrane with bioinspired serosa&#8208;mimetic structures as an efficient osmotic energy generator coupling light. As a result, the output power could be up to 16.43 W m&#8208;2&#160;under irradiation, outperforming traditional two&#8208;dimensional (2D) membranes. Both the experiment and simulation uncover that the generated photothermal and photoelectronic effects could synergistically promote the confined ion transport process. In addition, this membrane also possesses great anti&#8208;fouling properties, endowing its practical application. This work paves new avenues for sustainable power generation by coupling solar energy.</dc:description>

         <title>MODULATION OF UPTAKE AND REACTIVITY OF NITROGEN DIOXIDE IN METAL&#8208;ORGANIC FRAMEWORK MATERIALS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the modulation of reactivity of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in a charged metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) material, MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 in which unbound N&#8208;centres are methylated and the cationic charge counter&#8208;balanced by Cl&#8722; ions in the pores. Uptake of NO2 into MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 leads to reaction between NO2 and Cl&#8211; to give nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and NO3&#8722; anions. A high dynamic uptake of 6.58 mmol g&#8722;1 at 298 K is observed for MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 as measured using a flow of 500 ppm NO2 in He. In contrast, the analogous neutral material, MFM&#8208;305, shows a much lower uptake of 2.38 mmol g&#8722;1. The binding domains and reactivity of adsorbed NO2 molecules within MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 and MFM&#8208;305 have been probed using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and by electron paramagnetic resonance, high&#8208;field solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies. The design of charged porous sorbents provides a new platform to control the reactivity of corrosive air pollutants.</dc:description>

         <title>Supercooled liquids with dynamic room temperature phosphorescence using&#160;terminal hydroxyl engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have potential applications in optoelectronics, which inevitably suffer from poor processability, flexibility or stretchability. Herein, we report a concise strategy to develop supercooled liquids (SCLs) with dynamic RTP behavior using terminal hydroxyl engineering. The terminal hydroxyls effectively hinder the nucleation process of molecules for the formation of stable SCLs after thermal annealing. Impressively, the SCLs show reversible RTP emission via alternant stimulation by UV light and heat. Photoactivated SCLs have phosphorescent efficiency of 8.50% and a lifetime of 31.54 ms under ambient conditions. Regarding the dynamic RTP behavior and stretchability of SCLs, we demonstrate the applications in erasable data encryption and patterns on flexible substrates. This finding provides a design principle for obtaining SCLs with RTP and expands the potential applications of RTP materials in flexible optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring *H Intermediate Coverage on the CuAl2O4/CuO Catalyst for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products offers a promising pathway for producing value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity. However, producing ethanol remains a challenge because of the competitive ethylene formation and hydrogen evolution reactions. Herein, we propose an active hydrogen (*H)&#8208;intermediate&#8208;mediating strategy for ethanol electroproduction on a layered precursor&#8208;derived CuAl2O4/CuO catalyst. The catalyst delivered a Faradaic efficiency of 70% for multi&#8208;carbon products and 41% for ethanol at current density of 200&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8208;2 and exhibited a continuous 150 h durability in a flow cell. The intensive spectroscopic studies combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the in situ generated CuAl2O4 could tailor *H intermediate coverage and the elevated *H coverage favors the hydrogenation of the *HCCOH intermediate, accounting for the increased yield of ethanol. This work directs a pathway for enhancing ethanol electroproduction from CO2 reduction by tailoring *H intermediate coverage.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active Hydrogen&#8208;rich Photothermal Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction on Ni/LaInO3 Perovskite Catalysts with Near&#8208;unity Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;assisted reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is regarded green and promising in controlling the reaction gas ratio in Fischer Tropsch synthesis. But it is inclined to produce more byproducts in high H2 concentration condition. Herein, LaInO3 loaded with Ni&#8208;nanoparticles (Ni NPs) was designed to obtain an efficient photothermal RWGS reaction rate, where LaInO3 was enriched with oxygen vacancies to roundly adsorbing CO2 and the strong interaction with Ni NPs endowed the catalysts with powerful H2 activity. The optimized catalyst performed a large CO yield rate (1314 mmol gNi&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) and ~100% selectivity. In situ characterizations demonstrated a COOH* pathway of the reaction and photoinduced charge transfer process for reducing the RWGS reaction active energy. Our work provides valuable insights on the construction of catalysts concerning products selectivity and photoelectronic activating mechanism on CO2 hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane via Regulating Methyl Intermediates over Metal/ZnO Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane conversion to higher hydrocarbons requires harsh reaction conditions due to high energy barriers associated with C&#8211;H bond activation. Herein, we report a systematic investigation of photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) over transition&#8208;metal&#8208;loaded ZnO photocatalysts. A 1 wt.% Au/ZnO delivered a remarkable C2&#8208;C4 hydrocarbon production rate of 683 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 (83% C2&#8208;C4 selectivity) under light irradiation with excellent photostability over two days. The metal type and its interaction with ZnO strongly influence the selectivity toward C&#8208;C coupling products. Photogenerated Zn+&#8208;O&#8211; sites enable CH4 activation to methyl intermediates (*CH3) migrating onto adjacent metal nanoparticles. The nature of the *CH3&#8208;metal interaction controls the OCM products. In the case of Au, strong d&#8208;&#963; orbital hybridization reduces metal&#8211;C&#8211;H bond angles and steric hindrance, thereby enabling efficient methyl coupling. Findings indicate the d&#8208;&#963; center may be a suitable descriptor for predicting product selectivity during OCM over metal/ZnO photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tailored Versatile and Efficient NHC&#8208;Based NNC&#8208;Pincer Manganese Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Polar Unsaturated Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of metal&#8208;hydride complexes can be harnessed by the modification of ancillary ligands. With the aim of improving the hydride&#8208;donor ability of the key Mn&#8211;H intermediate and reducing steric hindrance, we herein report the rational design of a versatile and efficient NHC&#8208;based NNC&#8208;pincer Mn catalyst for hydrogenation reactions. This newly developed catalyst exhibited higher activity than the corresponding NNP&#8208;pincer Mn catalyst owing to its reduced steric hindrance and enhanced Mn&#8211;H &#963;&#8208;bonding orbital energy level through a &#960;&#8208;antibonding interaction. Using this highly active NNC&#8208;pincer Mn catalyst, a rich array of polar unsaturated compounds (&gt;80 examples) including esters, N&#8208;heteroarenes, amides, carbonates, and urea derivatives, were successfully hydrogenated under relatively mild conditions. This work represents a rare example of a general phosphine&#8208;free Mn&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation system.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and Loading of a (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl&#160;Starter Unit in the Assembly Line of Polyketide&#8208;Nonribosomal Peptide Hybrid Sanglifehrin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sanglifehrin A (SFA) is a spirolactam&#8208;conjugated, 22&#8208;membered macrolide with remarkable immunosuppressive and antiviral activities. This macrolide is a result of a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly line that utilizes (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl as a starter unit. Here, we report that the formation and loading of this starter unit in the SFA assembly line involve two unusual enzymatic reactions that occur on a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP), SfaO. An amide synthetase, SfaP, catalyzes the amidation of (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonyl in a SfaO&#8208;dependent manner. Then, a b&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III&#8208;like protein, SfaN, transfers resultant (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl from SfaO onto the loading ACP domain of the hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS assembly line to prime SFA biosynthesis. Both SfaP and SfaN display promiscuous activities. This study furthers the appreciation of assembly line chemistry, as a new paradigm for unusual building block formation and incorporation is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecule Saturation&#160;Boosts Acetylene Semihydrogenation Activity and Selectivity on a Core&#8208;Shell Ruthenium@Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing selectivity without expense of activity is desired but challenging in heterogeneous catalysis. By revealing the molecule saturation and adsorption sensitivity on overlayer thickness, strain, and coordination of Pd&#8208;based catalysts from first&#8208;principles calculations, we design a stable Pd monolayer (ML) catalyst on Ru terrace to boost both activity and selectivity of acetylene semihydrogenation. The least saturated molecule is found most sensitive to the change in catalyst electronic and geometric properties. By simultaneously compressing the Pd ML and exposing the high coordination sites, the adsorption of more saturated ethylene is considerably weakened to facilitate the desorption for high selectivity, but the even stronger weakening to the least saturated acetylene drives its hydrogenation more exothermic to boost the activity. Tailoring the molecule saturation and its sensitivity on the structures and compositions provide a rational of design of efficient catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells by a Multifunctional Composite Photoanode to 14.13%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new strategy to fabricate a multifunctional composite photoanode containing TiO2 hollow spheres (TiO2&#8208;HSs), Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and novel NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaLuF4:Eu@SiO2 upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The AuNPs are grown on the photoanode film including TiO2&#8208;HSs and UCNPs by a simple in&#8208;situ plasmonic treatment. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.13% is obtained, which is a record for N719 dye&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, demonstrating great potential for the solar cells toward commercialization. This obvious enhancement is ascribed to a collaborative mechanism of the TiO2&#8208;HSs exhibiting excellent light&#8208;scattering ability, of the UCNPs converting near&#8208;infrared photons into visible photons and of the AuNPs presenting outstanding surface plasmon resonance effect. Notably, a steady&#8208;state experiment further reveals that the champion cell exhibits 95.33% retainment in efficiency even after 180 h of measurements, showing good device stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design in Photopharmacology with Molecular Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photopharmacology is an attractive approach for achieving targeted drug action with the use of light. In photopharmacology, molecular photoswitches are introduced into the structure of biologically active small molecules to allow for the optical control of their potency. Going beyond trial and error, photopharmacology has progressively applied rational drug design methodologies to devise light&#8208;controlled bioactive ligands. In this review, we categorize photopharmacological efforts from the standpoint of medicinal chemistry strategies, focusing on diffusible photochromic ligands modified with photoswitches that operate through E&#8208;Z bond isomerization. In the vast majority of cases, photoswitchable ligands are designed as analogs of existing compounds, through a variety of approaches. By analyzing in detail a comprehensive list of instructive examples, we describe the state of the art and discuss future opportunities for rational design in photopharmacology.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a mild, efficient, and epimerization&#8208;free method for the synthesis of peptide&#8208;derived 2&#8208;thiazolines and 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazines based on a cyclodesulfhydration of N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptoethylamine or N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropylamine derivatives. The described reaction can be easily carried out in aqueous solutions at room temperature and it is triggered by change of the pH, leading to complex thiazoline or dihydrothiazine derivatives without epimerization in excellent to quantitative yields. The new method was applied in the total synthesis of the marine metabolite mollamide F, resulting in the revision of its stereochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Not So Innocent After All: Interfacial Chemistry Determines Charge&#8208;Transport Efficiency in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most studies in molecular electronics focus on altering the molecular wire backbone to tune the electrical properties of the whole junction. However, it is often overlooked that the chemical structure of the groups anchoring the molecule to the metallic electrodes influences the electronic structure of the whole system and, therefore, its conductance. We synthesised electron&#8208;accepting dithienophosphole oxide derivatives and fabricated their single&#8208;molecule junctions. We found that the anchor group has a dramatic effect on charge&#8208;transport efficiency: in our case, electron&#8208;deficient 4&#8208;pyridyl contacts suppress conductance, while electron&#8208;rich 4&#8208;thioanisole termini promote efficient transport. Our calculations show that this is due to minute changes in charge distribution, probed at the electrode interface. Our findings provide a framework for efficient molecular junction design, especially valuable for compounds with strong electron withdrawing/donating backbones.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Quinocarcin Enabled by Catalytic Enantioselective Reductive 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Secondary Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;quinocarcin has been accomplished with high step economy from commercially available starting materials. A catalytic enantioselective reductive 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of N&#8208;heteroaryl secondary amides with reactive dipolarophile using iridium/copper relay catalysis was developed to prepare the key chiral pyrrolidine intermediate with three stereocenters. This protocol features excellent regio&#8208;, exo&#8208; and enantioselectivities, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. The high efficiency was also ensured by a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation/cyclization and a tandem diastereoselective hydrogenation/cyclization to construct the tetrahydroisoquinoline&#8208;pyrrolidine tetracyclic core unit of quinocarcin.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;symmetric Half&#8208;Fused B&#8592;N Coordinated Diketopyrrolopyrrole Building Block for n&#8208;type Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of conjugated polymers with high semiconducting performance and high reliability is of great significance for flexible electronics. Herein, we develop a new type of electron&#8208;accepting building block; ie., non&#8208;symmetric half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N coordinated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) (HBNDPP),&#160;for amorphous conjugated polymers towards flexible electronics. The rigid B&#8592;N fusion part of HBNDPP endows the resulting polymers with decent electron transport, while the non&#8208;symmetric structure of HBNDPP causes the polymer to exhibit multiple conformation isomers with flat torsional potential energies.&#160;Thus, it gets packed in an&#160;amorphous manner&#160;in solid state, ensuring good resistance to bending strain. Combined with hardness and softness, the flexible OFET devices exhibit n&#8208;type charge properties with decent mobility, good bending resistance, and good ambient stability. The preliminary study makes this building block a potential candidate for future design of conjugated materials for flexible electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;dependent Phosphorescence Color of Carbon Dots in Binary Salt Matrices through Activations by Structural Confinement and Defects for Dynamic Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials has taken information encryption to high&#8208;security levels. However, due to the only path of exciton transfer, it is almost impossible to obtain TDPC for chromophores with a single emission center. Theoretically, in inorganic&#8208;organic composites, the exciton transfer of organic chromophores depends on the inorganic structure. Here, we assign two structural effects to inorganic NaCl by metal (Mg2+ or Ca2+ or Ba2+) doping, which triggers the TDPC performance of carbon dots (CDs) with a single emission center. The resulting material is used for multi&#8208;level dynamic phosphorescence color 3D coding to achieve information encryption. The structural confinement activates the green phosphorescence of CDs; while the structural defect activates tunneling&#8208;related yellow phosphorescence. Such simply doped inorganic matrices can be synthesized using the periodic table of metal cations, endowing chromophores with tremendous control over TDPC properties. This demonstration extends the design view of dynamic luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallinity Regulation and Defects Passivation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Using Fully Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) have been constructed through Gilch reaction. The obtained PAFs have rigid conjugated backbones, high specific surface area, and excellent stability. The prepared PAF&#8208;154 and PAF&#8208;155 have been successfully applied in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by doping into the perovskite layer. The champion PSC devices afford a power conversion efficiency of 22.8% and 22.4%. It is found that the PAFs can be used as an efficient nucleation template, thus regulating the perovskite crystallinity. Meanwhile, PAFs can also passivate defects and promote carriers transporting in the perovskite film. By the comparative study with their linear counterpart, we unravel that the efficacy of PAFs is highly related to their porous structure and rigid fully conjugated networks. The unencapsulated devices with PAFs doping exhibit outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining 80% of their initial efficiencies after half&#8208;year storage in ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>An Artificial Single Molecular Channel Showing High Chloride Transport Selectivity and pH&#8208;Responsive Conductance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the unique structure and function of natural chloride channel (ClC) selectivity filter, we present herein the design of a ClC&#8208;type single channel molecule. This channel displays high ion transport activity with half&#8208;maximal effective concentration EC50 being 0.10 &#956;M or 0.075 mol% (channel molecule to lipid ratio) determined by fluorescent analysis using lucigenin&#8208;encapsulated vesicles. Planar bilayer lipid membrane conductance measurements indicated an excellent Cl&#8722;/K+ selectivity with permeability ratio PCl&#8722;/PK+&#160;up to 12.31, which is comparable with the chloride selectivity of natural ClC proteins. Moreover, high anion/anion selectivity (PCl&#8722;/PBr&#8722;&#160;= 66.21) and pH&#8208;dependent conductance and ion selectivity of channel molecule were also revealed. The ClC&#8208;like transport behaviours are contributed by the cooperation of hydrogen bonding and anion&#8211;&#960; interactions in the central macrocyclic skeleton, and by the existence of pH&#8208;responsive terminal phenylalanine residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered monophosphate tungsten bronzes [Ba(PO4)2]WmO3m&#8208;3: 2D&#8208;metals with locked charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave instabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphate tungsten and molybenum bronzes represent an outstanding class of materials displaying textbook examples of charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave (CDW) physics among other fundamental properties. Here we report on the existence of a novel structural branch with the general formula [Ba(PO4)2][W3O3&#8211;m] (m = 3, 4 and 5) denominated 'layered monophosphate tungsten bronzes' (L&#8208;MPTB). It results from thick [Ba(PO4)2]4&#8211; spacer layers disrupting the cationic metal oxide 2D&#8208;units and enforcing an overall trigonal structure. Their symmetries are preserved down to 1.8 K and the compounds show metallic behaviour with no clear anomaly as a function of temperature. However, their electronic structure displays the characteristic Fermi surface of previous bronzes derived from 5d&#8208;W states with hidden nesting properties. By analogy with previous bronzes, such a Fermi surface should result into CDW&#8208;order. Evidence of CDW&#8208;order was only indirectly observed in the low&#8208;temperature specific heat, giving an exotic context at the crossover between stable&#8208;2D metals and CDW&#8208;order.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Phosphate tungsten and molybenum bronzes represent an outstanding class of materials displaying textbook examples of charge-density-wave (CDW) physics among other fundamental properties. Here we report on the existence of a novel structural branch with the general formula [Ba(PO4)2][W3O3&#8211;m] (m = 3, 4 and 5) denominated 'layered monophosphate tungsten bronzes' (L-MPTB). It results from thick [Ba(PO4)2]4&#8211; spacer layers disrupting the cationic metal oxide 2D-units and enforcing an overall trigonal structure. Their symmetries are preserved down to 1.8 K and the compounds show metallic behaviour with no clear anomaly as a function of temperature. However, their electronic structure displays the characteristic Fermi surface of previous bronzes derived from 5d-W states with hidden nesting properties. By analogy with previous bronzes, such a Fermi surface should result into CDW-order. Evidence of CDW-order was only indirectly observed in the low-temperature specific heat, giving an exotic context at the crossover between stable-2D metals and CDW-order.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure Regulation of MOF Nanosheet Membrane for Accurate H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular scale chemical decoration on MOF molecular sieve nanosheets was developed. CO2 impurities physisorbed on the artificially introduced low dose amino side groups served as interlayer &#8220;bridges&#8221;, elegantly regulated interlayer spacing and retarded CO2 subsequent transports, bringing an unrivalled H2/CO2 separation accuracy which favored a high&#8208;purity H2 production.







Abstract
High&#8208;purity H2 production accompanied with a precise decarbonization opens an avenue to approach a carbon&#8208;neutral society. Metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheet membranes provide great opportunities for an accurate and fast H2/CO2 separation, CO2 leakage through the membrane interlayer galleries decided the ultimate separation accuracy. Here we introduce low dose amino side groups into the Zn2(benzimidazolate)4 conformation. Physisorbed CO2 served as interlayer linkers, gently regulated and stabilized the interlayer spacing. These evoked a synergistic effect of CO2 adsorption&#8208;assisted molecular sieving and steric hinderance, whilst exquisitely preserving apertures for high&#8208;speed H2 transport. The optimized amino membranes set a new record for ultrathin nanosheet membranes in H2/CO2 separation (mixture separation factor: 1158, H2 permeance: 1417 gas permeation unit). This strategy provides an effective way to customize ultrathin nanosheet membranes with desirable molecular sieving ability.

         <title>Heterocyclic Chromophore Amphiphiles and their Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocycles have been introduced into the structure of the model perylene monoimide chromophore amphiphile to afford monomers that undergo supramolecular polymerization in water but have different conductivities. The heterocycles alter the monomeric molecular dipole moments, which impacts the internal order within the polymeric assemblies. The conductivity of the supramolecular polymers formed is seemingly dependent on short&#8208;range interactions.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization of &#960;&#8208;conjugated amphiphiles in water is an attractive approach to create functional nanostructures. Here, we report on the synthesis, optoelectronic and electrochemical properties, aqueous supramolecular polymerization, and conductivity of polycyclic aromatic dicarboximide amphiphiles. The chemical structure of the model perylene monoimide amphiphile was modified with heterocycles, essentially substituting one fused benzene ring with thiophene, pyridine or pyrrole rings. All the heterocycle&#8208;containing monomers investigated underwent supramolecular polymerization in water. Large changes to the monomeric molecular dipole moments led to nanostructures with low electrical conductivity due to diminished interactions. Although the substitution of benzene with thiophene did not notably change the monomer dipole moment, it led to crystalline nanoribbons with 20&#8208;fold higher electrical conductivity, due to enhanced dispersion interactions as a result of the presence of sulfur atoms.

         <title>Turn&#8208;on Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Indium Chlorides by 5s2 Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports two new series of chiral indium&#8208;antimony chlorides, (R&#8208;MPA)4In2(1&#8722;x)Sb2xCl10 and (R&#8208;CHEA)4In2(1&#8722;x)Sb2xCl10 ((R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine (R&#8208;MPA), (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8208;cyclohexylethylammonium (R&#8208;CHEA)) with tunable PLQY and luminescence dissymmetry factors. The bright STE emission is generated from lone pair 5s2 electrons of Sb3+. Near&#8208;ultraviolet pumped white light is demonstrated with a circular polarization up to 6.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
Introducing chirality into the metal&#8208;halide hybrids has enabled many emerging properties including chiroptical activity, spin&#8208;dependent transport, and ferroelectricity. However, most of the chiral metal&#8208;halide hybrids to date are non&#8208;emissive, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show a new strategy to turn on the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral metal&#8208;halide hybrids. We demonstrate that alloying Sb3+ into chiral indium&#8208;chloride hybrids dramatically increases the photoluminescence quantum yield in two new series of chiral indium&#8208;antimony chlorides. These materials exhibit strong CPL signals with tunable energy and a high dissymmetry factor up to 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2. Mechanistic studies reveal that the emission originates from the self&#8208;trapped excitons centered in 5s2 Sb3+. Moreover, near&#8208;ultraviolet pumped white light is demonstrated with a polarization up to 6.0&#8201;%. Our work demonstrates new strategies towards highly luminescent chiral metal&#8208;halide hybrids.

         <title>Exfoliated 2D Layered and Nonlayered Metal Phosphorous Trichalcogenides Nanosheets as Promising Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered and nonlayered phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPCh3) are successfully exfoliated into ultra&#8208;thin metal nanosheets through wet grinding exfoliation (WGE). The systematic investigation of the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2 ECR) mechanism offers new insights for the understanding of Sn&#8208;based and MPCh3&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials catalysts provide an atomic&#8208;scale view on a fascinating arena for understanding the mechanism of electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2 ECR). Here, we successfully exfoliated both layered and nonlayered ultra&#8208;thin metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPCh3) nanosheets via wet grinding exfoliation (WGE), and systematically investigated the mechanism of MPCh3 as catalysts for CO2 ECR. Unlike the layered CoPS3 and NiPS3 nanosheets, the active Sn atoms tend to be exposed on the surfaces of nonlayered SnPS3 nanosheets. Correspondingly, the nonlayered SnPS3 nanosheets exhibit clearly improved catalytic activity, showing formic acid selectivity up to 31.6&#8201;% with &#8722;7.51&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.65&#8197;V vs. RHE. The enhanced catalytic performance can be attributed to the formation of HCOO* via the first proton&#8208;electron pair addition on the SnPS3 surface. These results provide a new avenue to understand the novel CO2 ECR mechanism of Sn&#8208;based and MPCh3&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Preparation of Large&#8208;Area Graphdiyne&#8208;Based Membranes via Alkynylated Surface&#8208;Modification for Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY)&#8208;based membranes are prepared on alkynylated commercial ceramic tubes, overcoming the limitation that such layers could be synthesized only on a limited number of metal surfaces. The prepared HsGDY layers are strongly attached to the ceramic surface and exhibit excellent molecular permselectivity and ultra&#8208;high water permeance due to the unique surface properties and unusual conjugated structure.







Abstract
Graphdiynes (GDYs), two&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;like carbon systems, are considered as potential advanced membrane material due to their unique physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the scale&#8208;up of integrated GDY membranes is technologically challenging, and most studies remain at the theoretical stage. Herein, we report a simple and efficient alkynylated surface&#8208;mediated strategy to prepare hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) membranes on commercial alumina tubes. Surface alkynylation initiates an accelerated surface&#8208;confined coupling reaction in the presence of a copper catalyst and facilitates the nanoscale epitaxial lateral growth of HsGDY. A continuous and ultra&#8208;thin HsGDY membrane (&#8764;100&#8197;nm) can be produced within 15&#8197;min. The resulting membranes exhibit outstanding molecular sieving together with excellent water permeances (ca. 1100&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 MPa&#8722;1), and show a long&#8208;term durability in cross&#8208;flow nanofiltration, owing to the superhydrophilic surface and hydrophobic pore walls.

         <title>A Systematic Study on the Effects of Solvating Solvents and Additives in Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes over Electrochemical Performance of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of microscopic solvation structure, solvating solvent and additive of localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) over the electrolyte properties, the electrode/electrolyte interphases and the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) were systematically studied. The synergetic decomposition of anion, proper solvent and additive in LHCEs is the key to forming effective interphases and achieving long cycle life of LIBs.







Abstract
Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) based on five different types of solvents were systematically studied and compared in lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The unique solvation structure of LHCEs promotes the participation of Li salt in forming solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite (Gr) anode, which enables solvents previously considered incompatible with Gr to achieve reversible lithiation/delithiation. However, the long cyclability of LIBs is still subject to the intrinsic properties of the solvent species in LHCEs. Such issue can be readily resolved by introducing a small amount of additive into LHCEs. The synergetic decompositions of Li salt, solvating solvent and additive yield effective SEIs and cathode electrolyte interphases (CEIs) in most of the studied LHCEs. This study reveals that both the structure and the composition of solvation sheaths in LHCEs have significant effect on SEI and CEI, and consequently, the cycle life of energetically dense LIBs.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Weak Solvating Molecule Regulation for Stable Li Deposition in High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Li deposition in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte is achieved through rationally designing the solvation environment. Anisole was screened and found to slice the ionic aggregate to generate anisole&#8208;doped ionic clusters, which significantly accelerates Li+ transport process in bulk electrolyte and SEI. The performance of Li&#8722;O2 battery is greatly improved thanks to the realized robust Li deposition behavior.







Abstract
Li&#8722;O2 batteries with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#8208;based ionic liquid (TFSI&#8208;IL) electrolyte are promising because TFSI&#8208;IL can stabilize O2&#8722; to lower charge overpotential. However, slow Li+ transport in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte causes inferior Li deposition. Here we optimize weak solvating molecule (anisole) to generate anisole&#8208;doped ionic aggregate in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte. Such unique solvation environment can realize not only high Li+ transport parameters but also anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Thus, fast Li+ transport is achieved in electrolyte bulk and SEI simultaneously, leading to robust Li deposition with high rate capability (3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long cycle life (2000&#8197;h at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Moreover, Li&#8722;O2 batteries show good cycling stability (a small overpotential increase of 0.16&#8197;V after 120 cycles) and high rate capability (1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). This work provides an effective electrolyte design principle to realize stable Li deposition and high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;O2 batteries.

Tetrazoles and azides find broad application in pharmaceuticals, chemical biology, and high&#8208;energy materials. In this work multivariant linear regression and classification are leveraged to develop predictive statistical models for their decomposition temperature and impact sensitivity, which are key in evaluating the safety of a given molecule. Furthermore, interpretation of the statistical models provided rich insight into the decomposition mechanisms.







Abstract
Nitrogen atom&#8208;rich heterocycles and organic azides have found extensive use in many sectors of modern chemistry from drug discovery to energetic materials. The prediction and understanding of their energetic properties are thus key to the safe and effective application of these compounds. In this work, we disclose the use of multivariate linear regression modeling for the prediction of the decomposition temperature and impact sensitivity of structurally diverse tetrazoles and organic azides. We report a data&#8208;driven approach for property prediction featuring a collection of quantum mechanical parameters and computational workflows. The statistical models reported herein carry predictive accuracy as well as chemical interpretability. Model validation was successfully accomplished via tetrazole test sets with parameters generated exclusively in silico. Mechanistic analysis of the statistical models indicated distinct divergent pathways of thermal and impact&#8208;initiated decomposition.

         <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Using Low&#8208;Melting Metal Salt Precursors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using low&#8208;melting metal (hydrate) salts as both the precursor and the solvent for ionothermal synthesis, a range of stable metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be prepared with high crystallinity and porosity and minimal use of organic solvents.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous, crystalline materials constructed from organic linkers and inorganic nodes with myriad potential applications in chemical separations, catalysis, and drug delivery. A major barrier to the application of MOFs is their poor scalability, as most frameworks are prepared under highly dilute solvothermal conditions using toxic organic solvents. Herein, we demonstrate that combining a range of linkers with low&#8208;melting metal halide (hydrate) salts leads directly to high&#8208;quality MOFs without added solvent. Frameworks prepared under these ionothermal conditions possess porosities comparable to those prepared under traditional solvothermal conditions. In addition, we report the ionothermal syntheses of two frameworks that cannot be prepared directly under solvothermal conditions. Overall, the user&#8208;friendly method reported herein should be broadly applicable to the discovery and synthesis of stable metal&#8208;organic materials.

     alt="Ionothermal Synthesis of Metal-Organic Frameworks Using Low-Melting Metal Salt Precursors**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using low-melting metal (hydrate) salts as both the precursor and the solvent for ionothermal synthesis, a range of stable metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be prepared with high crystallinity and porosity and minimal use of organic solvents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous, crystalline materials constructed from organic linkers and inorganic nodes with myriad potential applications in chemical separations, catalysis, and drug delivery. A major barrier to the application of MOFs is their poor scalability, as most frameworks are prepared under highly dilute solvothermal conditions using toxic organic solvents. Herein, we demonstrate that combining a range of linkers with low-melting metal halide (hydrate) salts leads directly to high-quality MOFs without added solvent. Frameworks prepared under these ionothermal conditions possess porosities comparable to those prepared under traditional solvothermal conditions. In addition, we report the ionothermal syntheses of two frameworks that cannot be prepared directly under solvothermal conditions. Overall, the user-friendly method reported herein should be broadly applicable to the discovery and synthesis of stable metal-organic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct N&#8722;H Activation to Generate Nitrogen Radical for Arylamine Synthesis via Quantum Dots Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct activation of amine N&#8722;H bonds is realized to provide N&#8208;radicals in a redox&#8208;neutral and site&#8208;selective manner. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation of quantum dots, the N&#8208;radicals are successfully applied to the synthesis of aromatic amines. The high efficiency and broad functional&#8208;group tolerance demonstrate the potential of photocatalytic N&#8208;radicals in the construction of valuable arylamines.







Abstract
Represented herein is the first example of N&#8208;radical generation direct from N&#8722;H bond activation under mild and redox&#8208;neutral conditions. The in situ generated N&#8208;radical intercepts a reduced heteroarylnitrile/aryl halide for C&#8722;N bond formation under visible&#8208;light irradiation of quantum dots (QDs). A series of aryl and alkylamines with heteroarylnitriles/aryl halides exhibit high efficiency, site&#8208;selectivity and good functional&#8208;group tolerance. Moreover, consecutive C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formation using benzylamines as substrates is also achieved, producing N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines with H2 evolution. The redox&#8208;neutral conditions, broad substrate scope, and efficiency of N&#8208;radical formation are advantageous for organic synthesis.

         <title>Directional Transformation of Heterometallic Oxo Clusters: A New Approach to Prepare Wide&#8208;Bandgap Cathode Interlayers for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A lead&#8208;doped titanium&#8208;oxo cluster protected by sulfur&#8208;containing organic ligands is employed as a molecular model to realize the directional preparation of PbSO4&#8208;PbTi3O7 heterostructure at the cathode interlayer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The oxygen atoms from the sulfate ion in the heterostructure connect with iodine from the perovskite to boost interfacial electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. An efficiency as high as 24.2&#8201;% for the modified PSC is realized, and the stability of the devices is also improved.







Abstract
Typical wide&#8208;band gap cathode interlayer materials are difficulty in reducing interface recombination without limiting charge transport in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a lead&#8208;doped titanium&#8208;oxo cluster protected by S&#8208;containing ligands is introduced at the interface of perovskite and SnO2. By in situ heating, the cluster is transformed into PbSO4&#8208;PbTi3O7 heterostructure. The oxygen atoms from sulfate ion in heterostructure connect with iodine from perovskite to boost interfacial electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. While the yielded metallic interface between PbSO4 and PbTi3O7 promotes the electron transport across the interface. Finally, an efficiency as high as 24.2&#8201;% for the modified PSC is obtained. The heterostructure well&#8208;stabilize the interface of perovskite and SnO2, to greatly improve the device stability. This work provides a novel strategy to prepare wide&#8208;band gap cathode interlayer by directional transformation of heterometallic oxo clusters.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Propagation of a Minimal Catalytic RNA Network in GUV Protocells by Temperature Cycling and Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;responsive RNA organelles inside giant unilamellar vesicles were exploited to increase catalytic rates of a minimal catalytic RNA network. Subsequent cycles of freezing and thawing serve as physico&#8208;chemical driver to exchange vesicle contents aiming at an efficient organelle&#8208;aided propagation of such catalytic networks across lipid vesicles.







Abstract
Compartmentalization is key to many cellular processes and a critical bottleneck of any minimal life approach. In cells, a complex chemistry is responsible for bringing together or separating biomolecules at the right place at the right time. Lipids, nucleic acids and proteins self&#8208;organize, thereby creating boundaries, interfaces and specialized microenvironments. Exploiting reversible RNA&#8208;based liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) inside giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), we present an efficient system capable of propagating an RNA&#8208;based enzymatic reaction across a population of GUVs upon freezing&#8208;thawing (FT) temperature cycles. We report that compartmentalization in the condensed RNA&#8208;rich phase can accelerate such an enzymatic reaction. In the decondensed state, RNA substrates become homogeneously dispersed, enabling content exchange between vesicles during freeze&#8208;thawing. This work explores how a minimal reversible phase separation system in lipid vesicles could help to implement spatiotemporal control in cyclic processes, as required for minimal cells.

         <title>Anticooperative Supramolecular Oligomerization Mediated by V&#8208;Shaped Monomer Design and Unconventional Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A V&#8208;shaped monomer derived from BODIPY has been shown to self&#8208;assemble in non&#8208;polar media into anticooperatively formed luminescent oligomers with ultrahigh thermal stability. The delicate balance between attractive interactions (unconventional C/N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722;B hydrogen bonds), steric side chain effects, and inefficient aromatic interactions associated with the non&#8208;preorganized V&#8208;shaped monomer geometry lead to a restricted growth into discrete oligomer stacks.







Abstract
After more than three decades of extensive investigations on supramolecular polymers, strategies for self&#8208;limiting growth still remain challenging. Herein, we exploit a new V&#8208;shaped monomer design to achieve anticooperatively formed oligomers with superior robustness and high luminescence. In toluene, the monomer&#8208;oligomer equilibrium is shifted to the monomer side, enabling the elucidation of the molecular packing modes and the resulting (weak) anticooperativity. Steric effects associated with an antiparallel staircase organization of the dyes are proposed to outcompete aromatic and unconventional B&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;N/C interactions, restricting the growth at the stage of oligomers. In methylcyclohexane (MCH), the packing modes and the anticooperativity are preserved; however, pronounced solvophobic and chain&#8208;enwrapping effects lead to thermally ultrastable oligomers. Our results shed light on understanding anticooperative effects and restricted growth in self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Enhanced Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Selectivity of Clamp&#8208;Shaped Cobalt(II) Porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clamp&#8208;shaped cobalt(II) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) complexes were investigated as to their electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and electrocatalytic ORR. Electrochemistry indicates that the first oxidation corresponds to a CoII/CoIII process. The ORR capacities of both complexes show higher selectively for the 4e&#8722; ORR and DFT calculations suggest a lower overpotential for the 4e&#8722; ORR pathway than for the 2e&#8722; pathway.







Abstract
The molecular structure, electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) features of two CoII porphyrin(2.1.2.1) complexes bearing Ph or F5Ph groups at the two meso&#8208;positions of the macrocycle are examined. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis reveal a highly bent, nonplanar macrocyclic conformation of the complex resulting in clamp&#8208;shaped molecular structures. Cyclic voltammetry paired with UV/Vis spectroelectrochemistry in PhCN/0.1&#8197;M TBAP suggest that the first electron addition corresponds to a macrocyclic&#8208;centered reduction while spectral changes observed during the first oxidation are consistent with a metal&#8208;centered CoII/CoIII process. The activity of the clamp&#8208;shaped complexes towards heterogeneous ORR in 0.1&#8197;M KOH show selectivity towards the 4e&#8722; ORR pathway giving H2O. DFT first&#8208;principle calculations on the porphyrin catalyst indicates a lower overpotential for 4e&#8722; ORR as compared to the 2e&#8722; pathway, consistent with experimental data.

         <title>Tuning the Cellular Uptake and Retention of Rhodamine Dyes by Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Contrast Imaging of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work reports a strategy involving the introduction of a polar aminoalkyl group into asymmetric rhodamine, which aids in regulating the cellular uptake, intracellular retention, and brightness of dyes to efficiently discriminate cancer cells from normal cells. The novel NYL2 dye can serve as an effective platform to engineer various activatable fluorescent probes for high&#8208;contrast imaging of cancer cells.







Abstract
Probes allowing high&#8208;contrast discrimination of cancer cells and effective retention are powerful tools for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. However, conventional small&#8208;molecule probes often show limited performance in both aspects. Herein, we report an ingenious molecular engineering strategy for tuning the cellular uptake and retention of rhodamine dyes. Introduction of polar aminoethyl leads to the increased brightness and reduced cellular uptake of dyes, and this change can be reversed by amino acetylation. Moreover, these modifications allow cancer cells to take up more dyes than normal cells (16&#8208;fold) through active transport. Specifically, we further improve the signal contrast (56&#8208;fold) between cancer and normal cells by constructing activatable probes and confirm that the released fluorophore can remain in cancer cells with extended time, enabling long&#8208;term and specific tumor imaging.

         <title>Alternating Metal&#8208;Ligand Coordination Improves Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by a Mononuclear Ru Catalyst
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;overpotential mechanistic route is proposed for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. One metal center acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid at different stages of the catalytic cycle. This ambivalent behavior of the metal along with the flexibility of the ligands allows for the formation of a 5&#8208;membered metallacyclic intermediate by intramolecular cyclization.







Abstract
Molecular electrocatalysts for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion often operate at large overpotentials, due to the large barrier for C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Illustrated with ruthenium polypyridyl catalysts, we herein propose a mechanistic route that involves one metal center that acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid at different stages of the catalytic cycle, by density functional theory in corroboration with experimental FTIR. The nucleophilic character of the Ru center manifests itself in the initial attack on CO2 to form [Ru&#8208;CO2]0, while its electrophilic character allows for the formation of a 5&#8208;membered metallacyclic intermediate, [Ru&#8208;CO2CO2]0,c, by addition of a second CO2 molecule and intramolecular cyclization. The calculated activation barrier for C&#8722;O bond cleavage via the metallacycle is decreased by 34.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 as compared to the non&#8208;cyclic adduct in the two electron reduced state of complex 1. Such metallacyclic intermediates in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction offer a new design feature that can be implemented consciously in future catalyst designs.

         <title>Enforced Electronic&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Formation in Water for Photochemical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sugar alcohol meglumine can solubilize organic compounds in water to synthetically useful levels, allowing the formation of enforced electron donor acceptor (EDA) complexes in water. These EDA complexes offer a new activation for light driven C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling chemistry without sensitizers.







Abstract
The amino alcohol meglumine solubilizes organic compounds in water and enforces the formation of electron donor acceptor (EDA) complexes of haloarenes with indoles, anilines, anisoles or thiols, which are not observed in organic solvents. UV&#8208;A photoinduced electron transfer within the EDA complexes induces the mesolytic cleavage of the halide ion and radical recombination of the arenes leading, after rearomatization and proton loss to C&#8722;C or C&#8722;S coupling products. Depending on the substitution pattern selective and unique cross&#8208;couplings are observed. UV and NMR measurements reveal the importance of the assembly for the photoinduced reaction. Enforced EDA aggregate formation in water allows new activation modes for organic photochemical synthesis.

         <title>Electroreduction Enables Regioselective 1,2&#8208;Diarylation of Alkenes with Two Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing cyanoarene radical anions as redox&#8208;mediators, the electrochemical regioselective 1,2&#8208;diarylation of alkenes with cyanoarenes and aryl halides takes place in the absence of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. The merit of this method has been well demonstrated by its wide scope, excellent regioselectivity, and powerful scale&#8208;up synthesis.







Abstract
Precisely introducing two similar functional groups into bulk chemical alkenes represents a formidable route to complex molecules. Especially, the selective activation of two electrophiles is in crucial demand, yet challenging for cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling. Herein, we demonstrate a redox&#8208;mediated electrolysis, in which aryl nitriles are both aryl radical precursors and redox&#8208;mediators, enables an intermolecular alkene 1,2&#8208;diarylation with a remarkable regioselectivity, thereby avoiding the involvement of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This transformation utilizes cyanoarene radical anions for activating various aryl halides (including iodides, bromides, and even chlorides) and affords 1,2&#8208;diarylation adducts in up to 83&#8201;% yield and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 regioselectivity with more than 80 examples, providing a feasible approach to complex bibenzyl derivatives.

         <title>Divalent Lanthanide Tetraisobutylaluminates: Reactivity and Living Isoprene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic isobutylaluminates [Ln(AliBu4)2] (Ln=Sm, Eu, Yb) serve as single&#8208;component catalysts for cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;selective isoprene polymerization. Chlorination with C2Cl6 affords highly symmetric, mostly inactive clusters such as mixed&#8208;valent [Sm6Cl8(AliBu4)6], while activation of [Yb(AliBu4)2] with [PhNMe2H][B(C6F5)4] gives divalent &#8220;[Yb(AliBu4){AliBu3(PhNMe2)}][B(C6F5)4]&#8221; promoting ideal living polymerization.







Abstract
Lanthanide (Ln) tetraisobutylaluminates constitute key components in commercial 1,3&#8208;diene polymerization catalysts, and likewise are the homogeneous rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal catalysts of prime industrial importance. Discrete divalent rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal complexes [Ln(AliBu4)2] (Ln=Sm, Eu, Yb) reported here display the first structurally characterized homoleptic metal tetraisobutylaluminates. Treatment of [Ln(AliBu4)2] with C2Cl6 gives access to SmII/SmIII mixed&#8208;valence cluster [Sm6Cl8(AliBu4)6] and the YbII cluster [Yb4Cl4(AliBu4)4], respectively. Reaction with B(C6F5)3 leads to hydride abstraction and formation of arene&#8208;coordinated hydroborates such as [Sm{HB(C6F5)3}2(toluene)2]. Complexes [Ln(AliBu4)2] engage in single&#8208;component isoprene polymerization, affording high cis&#8208;1,4 polyisoprenes with narrow molecular weight distributions. Binary [Yb(AliBu4)2]/[HNPhMe2][B(C6F5)4] fabricates polyisoprene in a perfectly living manner. The catalytically active species are scrutinized by NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Electronic Structure Manipulation of the Mott Insulator RuCl3 via Single&#8208;Crystal to Single&#8208;Crystal Topotactic Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structures of the honeycomb Mott&#8208;insulator RuCl3 are tailored by employing a facile and reversible single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal intercalation strategy. The resulting product forms a new hybrid superlattice of alternating RuCl3 monolayers, displaying distinct optical and electronic properties and dramatically boosted charge carrier transport characteristics.







Abstract
The core task for Mott insulators includes how rigid distributions of electrons evolve and how these induce exotic physical phenomena. However, it is highly challenging to chemically dope Mott insulators to tune properties. Herein, we report how to tailor electronic structures of the honeycomb Mott insulator RuCl3 employing a facile and reversible single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal intercalation process. The resulting product (NH4)0.5RuCl3&#8901;1.5&#8201;H2O forms a new hybrid superlattice of alternating RuCl3 monolayers with NH4+ and H2O molecules. Its manipulated electronic structure markedly shrinks the Mott&#8211;Hubbard gap from 1.2 to 0.7&#8197;eV. Its electrical conductivity increases by more than 103 folds. This arises from concurrently enhanced carrier concentration and mobility in contrary to the general physics rule of their inverse proportionality. We show topotactic and topochemical intercalation chemistry to control Mott insulators, escalating the prospect of discovering exotic physical phenomena.

         <title>Photoswitchable Oxidopyrylium Ylide for Photoclick Reaction with High Spatiotemporal Precision: A Dynamic Switching Strategy to Compensate for Molecular Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoswitching equilibrium between 2,3&#8208;diaryl indenone epoxide (DIO) and mesoionic oxidopyrylium ylide (PY) is governed by dual&#8208;&#955; gating, in which PY can undergo fast [5+2] cycloaddition with BCN. A photoswitchable strategy for photoclick labeling with spatiotemporal control was developed, recycling the unreacted PY to minimize side&#8208;effects. Also, molecular diffusion of the reactive PY was compensated for by improvement of the spatial accuracy.







Abstract
We describe a novel type of photoclick reaction between 2,3&#8208;diaryl indenone epoxide (DIO) and ring&#8208;strained dipolarophiles, in which DIO serves as a P&#8208;type photoswitch to produce mesoionic oxidopyrylium ylide (PY) to initiate an ultra&#8208;fast [5+2] cycloaddition (k2h&#957;=1.9&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). The photoisomerization between DIO and PY can be tightly controlled by either 365 or 520&#8197;nm photo&#8208;stimulation, which allows reversion or regeneration of the reactive PY dipole on demand. Thus, this reversible photoactivation was exploited to increase the chemoselectivity of the [5+2] cycloaddition in complex environments via temporal dual&#8208;&#955; stimulation sequences and to recycle the DIO reagent for batch&#8208;wise protein conjugation. A dynamic photoswitching strategy is also proposed to compensate for molecular diffusion of PY in aqueous solution, enhancing the spatial resolution of lithographic surface decoration and bioorthogonal labeling on living cells via a spatiotemporal dual&#8208;&#955; photo&#8208;modulation.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Unsymmetrical Bis&#8208;Allylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient unsymmetrical bis&#8208;allylation of alkynes has been developed by simultaneously utilizing electrophilic trifluoromethyl alkenes and nucleophilic allylboronates as the allylic reagents. With the aid of a robust Ni0/NHC catalysis, valuable skipped trienes can be obtained in high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
The catalytic bis&#8208;allylation of alkynes is an important but challenging protocol to construct all&#8208;carbon tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes. Particularly, the catalytic unsymmetrical bis&#8208;allylation of alkynes remains as an underexplored task to date. We herein report an unprecedented unsymmetrical bis&#8208;allylation by simultaneously utilizing electrophilic trifluoromethyl alkene and nucleophilic allylboronate as the allylic reagents. With the aid of robust Ni0/NHC catalysis, valuable skipped trienes can be obtained in high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction may proceed through a &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination of a nickelacycle followed by a transmetalation step with allylboronate. The present method exhibits a good tolerance of various functional groups. Besides, the skipped triene products can undergo an array of elaborate transformations, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy.

         <title>Boranes Paving the Way to Anionic Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (Ani&#8208;cAACs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
First examples of anionic cAACs (Ani&#8208;cAACs) bearing B(CN)3 or C2F5BF2 as N&#8208;substituents are reported and their stereo&#8208;electronic parameters have been evaluated. These anionic carbenes can replace anionic substituents as exemplified by the formation of selenium adducts and [Ani&#8208;cAAC&#8208;Au&#8208;PPh3].







Abstract
First examples of anionic cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (Ani&#8208;cAACs) that contain borane substituents have been synthesized. The nature of the borane substituents allows a modulation of the &#963;&#8208;donor or &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities compared to their neutral analogues. A B(CN)3&#8208;substituted Ani&#8208;cAAC has been generated and used in situ. The corresponding C2F5BF2&#8208;Ani&#8208;cAAC 6 was obtained in high yield on a multigram scale. First reactions of these novel ligands with elemental selenium and chloro(triphenylphosphine)gold(I) led to the anionic selenium adducts 7 and 8 and the Ani&#8208;cAAC gold complex 9. The properties of these compounds and data derived from theoretical calculations provide an insight into the electronic and steric properties of these novel anionic cAACs. Especially the ease of synthesis and the combination of properties such as negative charge, large buried volume, and good &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability renders Ani&#8208;cAACs unique and promising new building blocks.

         <title>Type I Photosensitizer Targeting G&#8208;Quadruplex RNA Elicits Augmented Immunity for Cancer Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared (NIR) type&#8197;I photosensitizer (PS), BAMA, was developed using an acridinium scaffold that enables efficient O2.&#8722; production upon targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s). It was employed for imaging and effective photodynamic therapy (PDT) of an immunogenic cold tumor with bolstered antitumor immunity, raising the possibility of developing efficient PDT through ablation of functional RNAs for cancer therapy.







Abstract
Type&#8197;I photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a promising treatment modality for tumors with intrinsic hypoxia. However, type&#8197;I photosensitizers (PSs), especially ones with near infrared (NIR) absorption, are limited and their efficacy needs improvement via new targeting tactics. We develop a NIR type&#8197;I PS by engineering acridinium derived donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor systems. The PS exhibits an exclusive type&#8197;I PDT mechanism due to effective intersystem crossing and disfavored energy transfer to O2, and shows selective binding to G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) via hydrogen bonds identified by a molecular docking study. Moreover, it enables fluorogenic detection of G4s and efficient O2&#8901;&#8722; production in hypoxic conditions, leading to immunogenic cell death and substantial variations of gene expression in RNA sequencing. Our strategy demonstrates augmented antitumor immunity for effective ablation of immunogenic cold tumor, highlighting its potential of RNA&#8208;targeted type&#8197;I PDT in precision cancer therapy.

         <title>Near&#8208;Stoichiometric and Homogenized Perovskite Films for Solar Cells with Minimized Performance Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delaying initialized crystallization and manipulating crystal growth of mixed&#8208;cation alloyed perovskites by pre&#8208;seeding colloidal chemistry realized reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with homogenized chemical compositions and improved optoelectronic properties, delivering a record efficiency up to 24.31&#8201;% for blade&#8208;coated solar cells with minimized performance variation and extended lifespan.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation, small band&#8208;gap perovskites via rationally alloying formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA) together have been widely employed for blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells with satisfied efficiencies. One of the stringent challenges lies in difficult control of the nucleation and crystallization kinetics of the perovskites with mixed ingredients. Herein, a pre&#8208;seeding strategy by mixing FAPbI3 solution with pre&#8208;synthesized MAPbI3 microcrystals has been developed to smartly decouple the nucleation and crystallization process. As a result, the time window of initialized crystallization has been greatly extended by 3 folds (i.e. from 5&#8197;s to 20&#8197;s), which enables the formation of uniform and homogeneous alloyed&#8208;FAMA perovskite films with designated stoichiometric ratios. The resultant blade&#8208;coated solar cells achieved a champion efficiency of 24.31&#8201;% accompanied by outstanding reproducibility with more than 87&#8201;% of the devices showing efficiencies higher than 23&#8201;%.

The [3s,5s]&#8208;sigmatropic shift is a pericyclic reaction that is forbidden according to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. Density functional theory calculations are used to show that systems utilizing transition&#8208;state complexation to a metal catalyst and strategically placed substituents engaging in key stereoelectronic effects can select for the [3s,5s] process and outcompete both allowed [3s,3s]&#8208; and [3s,5a]&#8208;shifts.

         <title>Phase Instability in van der Waals In2Se3 Determined by Surface Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixture of experimental and theoretical approaches reveals that the ambient stability of 2D In2Se3 strongly depends on the surface coordination. Tetrahedral&#8208;coordinated surfaces were found to be more stable and suitable for device applications.







Abstract
van der Waals In2Se3 has attracted significant attention for its room&#8208;temperature 2D ferroelectricity/antiferroelectricity down to monolayer thickness. However, instability and potential degradation pathway in 2D In2Se3 have not yet been adequately addressed. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we here unravel the phase instability in both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8242;&#8208;In2Se3 originating from the relatively unstable octahedral coordination. Together with the broken bonds at the edge steps, it leads to moisture&#8208;facilitated oxidation of In2Se3 in air to form amorphous In2Se3&#8722;3xO3x layers and Se hemisphere particles. Both O2 and H2O are required for such surface oxidation, which can be further promoted by light illumination. In addition, the self&#8208;passivation effect from the In2Se3&#8722;3xO3x layer can effectively limit such oxidation to only a few nanometer thickness.

     alt="Phase Instability in van der Waals In2Se3 Determined by Surface Coordination"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mixture of experimental and theoretical approaches reveals that the ambient stability of 2D In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; strongly depends on the surface coordination. Tetrahedral-coordinated surfaces were found to be more stable and suitable for device applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;van der Waals In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has attracted significant attention for its room-temperature 2D ferroelectricity/antiferroelectricity down to monolayer thickness. However, instability and potential degradation pathway in 2D In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; have not yet been adequately addressed. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we here unravel the phase instability in both &#945;- and &#946;&#8242;-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; originating from the relatively unstable octahedral coordination. Together with the broken bonds at the edge steps, it leads to moisture-facilitated oxidation of In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in air to form amorphous In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;3&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; layers and Se hemisphere particles. Both O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are required for such surface oxidation, which can be further promoted by light illumination. In addition, the self-passivation effect from the In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;3&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; layer can effectively limit such oxidation to only a few nanometer thickness. The achieved insight paves way for better understanding and optimizing 2D In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; performance for device applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Diamines via Reductive Coupling of Ketimines Templated by Chiral Diborons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines are prepared with high ee values and good to excellent yields via an unprecedented chiral diboron&#8208;templated asymmetric homocoupling of aryl alkyl ketimines. The synthetic value of these chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines is demonstrated by the development of efficient organocatalysts for the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;bromination of aliphatic aldehydes.







Abstract
We herein describe the chiral diboron&#8208;templated asymmetric homocoupling of aryl alkyl ketimines, providing for the first time a series of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines with excellent ee values and good to high yields. The powerful and efficient diboron&#8208;participated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is successfully demonstrated by the homocoupling of a variety of ketimines thanks to the rational design and engineering of chiral diborons. Systematic DFT studies suggest that two chiral diborons adopt different conformational assembling strategies to couple the diboron template with ketimine substrates in their tight concerted transition states to ensure the excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines is demonstrated by the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;bromination of aliphatic aldehydes by employing a chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamine&#8208;based organocatalyst.

         <title>Breaking the Size Limitation of Directly&#8208;Synthesized PbS Quantum Dot Inks Toward Efficient Short&#8208;wavelength Infrared Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, scalable synthesis of short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) PbS quantum dot (QD) inks is realized after an extensive investigation of the reaction kinetics. Based on these PbS SWIR QD inks, SWIR solar cells and photodetector devices are fabricated, demonstrating record&#8208;high efficiency. The direct synthesis of low&#8208;cost and scalable SWIR QD inks may accelerate the industrialization of consumer SWIR technologies.







Abstract
PbS quantum dots (QDs) are promising building blocks for solution&#8208;processed short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) devices. The recently developed direct synthesis of semi&#8208;conductive PbS QD inks has substantially simplified the preparation processing and reduced the material cost, while facing the challenge to synthesize large&#8208;size QDs with absorption covering the SWIR region. Herein, we for the first time realize a low&#8208;cost, scalable synthesis of SWIR PbS QD inks after an extensive investigation of the reaction kinetics. Finally, based on these PbS SWIR QD inks, the solar cell demonstrates a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.44&#8201;% through an 1100&#8197;nm cutoff silicon filter and the photodetector device shows a low dark current density of 2&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V reverse bias with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 70&#8201;% at &#8776;1300&#8197;nm. Our results realize the direct synthesis of low&#8208;cost and scalable SWIR QD inks and may accelerate the industrialization of consumer SWIR technologies.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Framework Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Nanotrap for the Precise Recognition and Separation of Gold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold recovery with exceptional uptake capacity, high selectivity, and excellent recyclability has been achieved in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through the regulation of hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotraps within the pore surfaces.







Abstract
Utilizing weak interactions to effectively recover and separate precious metals in solution is of great importance but the practice remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy to achieve precise recognition and separation of gold by regulating the hydrogen&#8208;bond (H&#8208;bond) nanotrap within the pore of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). It is found that both COF&#8208;HNU25 and COF&#8208;HNU26 can efficiently capture AuIII with fast kinetics, high selectivity, and uptake capacity. In particular, the COF&#8208;HNU25 with the high density of H&#8208;bond nanotraps exhibits an excellent gold uptake capacity of 1725&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is significantly higher than that (219&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) of its isostructural COF (COF&#8208;42) without H&#8208;bond nanostrap in the pores. Importantly, the uptake capacity is strongly correlated to the number of H&#8208;bonds between phenolic OH in the COF and [AuCl4]&#8722; in water, and multiple H&#8208;bond interactions are the key driving force for the excellent gold recovery and reusability of the adsorbent.

         <title>Chemoproteomic and Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals that O&#8208;GlcNAc Regulates Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Fate through the Pluripotency Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many pluripotency transcription factors (PTFs) were found to be O&#8208;GlcNAcylated in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and the O&#8208;GlcNAcylation stoichiometry at various modification sites suppressed during differentiation. Mechanistically, O&#8208;GlcNAc acts at the PTF network level and inhibition of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation enhances the expression of neuronal lineage&#8208;specific genes, promoting mESC&#8208;derived neuronal differentiation.







Abstract
Self&#8208;renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are influenced by protein O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) modification, but the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Herein, we report the identification of 979 O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins and 1340 modification sites in mouse ESCs (mESCs) by using a chemoproteomics method. In addition to OCT4 and SOX2, the third core pluripotency transcription factor (PTF) NANOG was found to be modified and functionally regulated by O&#8208;GlcNAc. Upon differentiation along the neuronal lineage, the O&#8208;GlcNAc stoichiometry at 123 sites of 83 proteins&#8212;several of which were PTFs&#8212;was found to decline. Transcriptomic profiling reveals 2456 differentially expressed genes responsive to OGT inhibition during differentiation, of which 901 are target genes of core PTFs. By acting on the core PTF network, suppression of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation upregulates neuron&#8208;related genes, thus contributing to mESC fate determination.

         <title>Structural and Mechanistic Studies on Substrate and Stereoselectivity of the Indole Monooxygenase VpIndA1: New Avenues for Biocatalytic Epoxidations and Sulfoxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structure analysis of a group E flavoprotein monooxygenase in complex with substrates and products reveals a confined hydrophobic binding pocket that controls the stereoselectivity of sulfoxidation or epoxidation reactions. Molecular mechanics force&#8208;field calculations and kinetic studies allowed structure&#8208;based redesign of this cavity, resulting in variants with greatly enhanced stereoselectivity or acceptance of novel substrates.







Abstract
Flavoprotein monooxygenases are a versatile group of enzymes for biocatalytic transformations. Among these, group E monooxygenases (GEMs) catalyze enantioselective epoxidation and sulfoxidation reactions. Here, we describe the crystal structure of an indole monooxygenase from the bacterium Variovorax paradoxus EPS, a GEM designated as VpIndA1. Complex structures with substrates reveal productive binding modes that, in conjunction with force&#8208;field calculations and rapid mixing kinetics, reveal the structural basis of substrate and stereoselectivity. Structure&#8208;based redesign of the substrate cavity yielded variants with new substrate selectivity (for sulfoxidation of benzyl phenyl sulfide) or with greatly enhanced stereoselectivity (from 35.1&#8201;% to 99.8&#8201;% ee for production of (1S,2R)&#8208;indene oxide). This first determination of the substrate binding mode of GEMs combined with structure&#8208;function relationships opens the door for structure&#8208;based design of these powerful biocatalysts.

         <title>A Heptacene Analogue Entailing a Quinoidal Benzodi[7]annulene (7/6/7 Ring) Core with a Tunable Configuration and Multiple Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Varying the substituents linked to the heptagons of a heptacene analogue containing a quinoidal benzodi[7]annulene core allows modulation of the configuration of this acene. When Mes groups are attached to the heptagons, the resulting acene displays polymorphism, with a tunable configuration ranging from a curved to a wavy one. This acene can also be oxidized or reduced by NOSbF6 or KC8 to the respective radical cation or radical anion.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid acenes containing heptagons have received increasing attention. We herein report a heptacene analogue containing a quinoidal benzodi[7]annulene core. Derivatives of this new non&#8208;benzenoid acene were obtained through an efficient synthetic strategy involving an Aldol condensation and a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction as key steps. The configuration of this heptacene analogue can be modulated from a wavy to a curved one by just varying the substituents from a (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl group to a 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl (Trip) group. When mesityl (Mes) groups are linked to the heptagons, the resulting non&#8208;benzenoid acene displays polymorphism with a tunable configuration from a curved to a wavy one upon varying the crystallization conditions. In addition, this new non&#8208;benzenoid acene can be oxidized or reduced by NOSbF6 or KC8 to the respective radical cation or radical anion. Compared with the neutral acene, the radical anion shows a wavy configuration and the central hexagon becomes aromatic.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Alkenylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes by Ligand&#8208;Directed Co/Al and Co/Mg Cooperative Catalysis
</title>

         <dc:description>
Co/Al&#8208; and Co/Mg bimetallic catalysts, supported by a phosphine/secondary phosphine oxide bifunctional ligand, have been developed for site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes with alkynes. Pyridines, pyridones, and imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines are efficiently alkenylated at the C&#8722;H site proximal to the Lewis basic nitrogen or oxygen. A ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer process is proposed as a general mechanism of these C&#8722;H activations.







Abstract
We report herein the design and development of Co/Al and Co/Mg bimetallic catalysts, supported by a phosphine/secondary phosphine oxide (PSPO) bifunctional ligand, for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation of nitrogen&#8208;containing heteroarenes with alkynes. These catalysts enable the alkenylation of pyridine, pyridone, and imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives at the C&#8722;H site proximal to the Lewis basic nitrogen or oxygen atom, which represents a selectivity profile distinct from that of the previously developed cobalt&#8208;diphosphine/aluminum catalyst. The alkenylated products were obtained in moderate to good yields using various heterocycles and differently substituted internal alkynes. Kinetic isotope effect experiments suggest the irreversibility of the C&#8722;H activation step, the relevance of which to the rate&#8208;limiting step depends on the reaction conditions. Density functional theory calculations indicate that ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer is the common mechanism of C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>ARMOR: Auto&#8208;Assembled Resilient Biomimetic Calcified Ornaments for Selective Cell Protection by Dual&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;Driven Hybridization Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Auto&#8208;assembled Resilient bioMimetic calcified ORnaments (ARMOR) strategy was created by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based HCR and Ca2+ assisted calcification for selective cell protection. The ARMOR can shield cells from external assaults and enhance the survival rate of the protected cells in an unfavorable environment. The ARMOR&#8208;based cell capture strategy can obtain more intact genetic information and provide a new method for clinical CTC analysis.







Abstract
Unlike plant and microbial cells having cell walls, the outermost layer of mammalian cell is a delicate, two&#8208;layered structure of phospholipids with proteins embedded, which is susceptible to environmental changes. It is necessary to create an &#8220;armor&#8221; on cell surface to protect cell integrity. Here, we propose an Auto&#8208;assembled Resilient bioMimetic calcified ORnaments (ARMOR) strategy driven by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and Ca2+ assisted calcification for selective cell protection. This co&#8208;recognition design enhances the selectivity and leverages robust in situ signal amplification by HCR to improve the sensitivity. The calcified shell is cogenerated by crosslinking the alginate&#8208;HCR product with Ca2+ ion. ARMOR has high efficiency for shielding cells from environmental assaults, which can be applied to circulating tumor cell (CTC) protection, isolation, and identification, maintaining the native state and intact genetic information for downstream analysis.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Nanobeacons Redirect Innate Immune Killing towards Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly imprinted nanobeacons (MINBs) were developed for redirecting innate immune killing towards cancer. The MINBs target the cancer cells and provide navigation for recruiting hapten&#8208;specific antibodies. The recruited antibodies further gather natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, triggering specific antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody&#8208;dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) to kill the tagged cancer cells.







Abstract
Harnessing innate immunity is an appealing strategy for cancer treatment. Herein, we report a new strategy called molecularly imprinted nanobeacons (MINBs) for redirecting innate immune killing towards triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). The MINBs were molecularly imprinted nanoparticles with the N&#8208;epitope of glycoprotein nonmetastatic B (GPNMB) as the template and grafted with plentiful fluorescein moieties as the hapten. The MINBs could tag the TNBC cells via binding with GPNMB and thereby provide navigation for recruiting hapten&#8208;specific antibodies. The gathered antibodies could further trigger effective Fc&#8208;domain&#8208;mediated immune killing towards the tagged cancer cells. In vivo experiments showed that the TNBC growth was significantly inhibited after MINBs treatment by intravenous injection as compared with control groups. This study not only opens a new access for redirecting innate immunity towards TNBC but also paves the way for innate immunity&#8208;based therapy of other diseases.

         <title>Manipulating Host&#8208;Guest Charge Transfer of a Water&#8208;Soluble Double&#8208;Cavity Cyclophane for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble double&#8208;cavity cyclophane with high electron&#8208;deficiency has been shown to bind two electron&#8208;rich guests and extend the charge&#8208;transfer absorption into the NIR&#8208;II region. The use of a diaminofluorene guest substituted with an oligoethylene glycol chain led to a biocompatible host&#8211;guest complex exhibiting excellent NIR&#8208;II photothermal effects for cancer cell and bacterial ablation.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble small organic photothermal agents (PTAs) over NIR&#8208;II biowindow (1000&#8211;1350&#8197;nm) are highly desirable, but the rarity greatly limits their applications. Based on a water&#8208;soluble double&#8208;cavity cyclophane GBox&#8208;44+, we report a class of host&#8211;guest charge transfer (CT) complexes as structurally uniform PTAs for NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy. As a result of its high electron&#8208;deficiency, GBox&#8208;44+ can bind different electron&#8208;rich planar guests with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host/guest stoichiometry to readily tune the CT absorption band that extends to the NIR&#8208;II region. When using a diaminofluorene guest substituted with an oligoethylene glycol chain, the host&#8211;guest system realized both good biocompatibility and enhanced photothermal conversion at 1064&#8197;nm, and was then exploited as a high&#8208;efficiency NIR&#8208;II PTA for cancer cell and bacterial ablation. This work broadens the potential applications of host&#8211;guest cyclophane systems and provides a new access to bio&#8208;friendly NIR&#8208;II photoabsorbers with well&#8208;defined structures.

         <title>Preferential Pyrolysis Construction of Carbon Anodes with 8400&#8197;h Lifespan for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density K&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

A durable carbon anode has been constructed for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density K&#8208;ion batteries by a preferential pyrolysis strategy, in which the low&#8208;potential active sites of sp2 hybridized C and vacancies were generated utilizing S and N volatilization from a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked supermolecule.







Abstract
Carbonaceous materials are promising anodes for practical potassium&#8208;ion batteries, but fail to meet the requirements for durability and high capacities at low potentials. Herein, we constructed a durable carbon anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density K&#8208;ion full cells by a preferential pyrolysis strategy. Utilizing S and N volatilization from a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked supermolecule, the preferential pyrolysis process introduces low&#8208;potential active sites of sp2 hybridized carbon and carbon vacancies, endowing a low&#8208;potential &#8220;vacancy&#8208;adsorption/intercalation&#8221; mechanism. The as&#8208;prepared carbon anode exhibits a high capacity of 384.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (90&#8201;% capacity locates below 1&#8197;V vs. K/K+), which contributes to a high energy density of 163&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of K&#8208;ion full battery. Moreover, abundant vacancies of carbon alleviate volume variation, boosting the cycling stability over 14&#8201;000&#8197;cycles (8400&#8197;h). Our work provides a new synthesis approach for durable carbon anodes of K&#8208;ion full cells with high energy densities.

         <title>The First UV Nonlinear Optical Selenite Material: Fluorination Control in CaYF(SeO3)2 and Y3F(SeO3)4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;centrosymmetric hydrogen&#8208;free selenite Y3F(SeO3)4 was synthesized from the centrosymmetric CaYF(SeO3)2 by controlling the fluorine content. Y3F(SeO3)4 features large SHG intensity, wide band gap, short UV cut&#8208;off edge and high thermal stability.







Abstract
It is a great challenge to develop UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material due to the demanding conditions of strong second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity and wide band gap. The first ultraviolet NLO selenite material, Y3F(SeO3)4, has been obtained by control of the fluorine content in a centrosymmetric CaYF(SeO3)2. The two new compounds represent similar 3D structures composed of 3D yttrium open frameworks strengthened by selenite groups. CaYF(SeO3)2 has a large birefringence (0.138@532&#8197;nm and 0.127@1064&#8197;nm) and a wide optical band gap (5.06&#8197;eV). The non&#8208;centrosymmetric Y3F(SeO3)4 can exhibit strong SHG intensity (5.5&#215;KDP@1064&#8197;nm), wide band gap (5.03&#8197;eV), short UV cut&#8208;off edge (204&#8197;nm) and high thermal stability (690&#8201;&#176;C). So, Y3F(SeO3)4 is a new UV NLO material with excellent comprehensive properties. Our work shows that it is an effective method to develop new UV NLO selenite material by fluorination control of the centrosymmetric compounds.

         <title>Using Biological Photophysics to Map the Excited&#8208;State Topology of Molecular Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodology to investigate the excited&#8208;state dynamics of phototoxic compounds in&#8197;cellulo using transient absorption spectroscopy is established and exemplified by two RuII photosensitizers (PSs) showing relevancy in photodynamic therapy. The kinetic signatures recorded for the PSs in&#8197;cellulo are distinct from those in water, indicating a complex interplay of either PS&#8208;biomolecular interaction or interaction between PSs or both.







Abstract
This study employs TLD1433, a RuII&#8208;based photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent in human clinical trials, as a benchmark to establish protocols for studying the excited&#8208;state dynamics of photosensitizers (PSs) in cellulo, in the local environment provided by human cancer cells. Very little is known about the excited&#8208;state properties of any PS in live cells, and for TLD1433, it is terra incognita. This contribution targets a general problem in phototherapy, which is how to interrogate the light&#8208;triggered, function&#8208;determining processes of the PSs in the relevant biological environment, and establishes methodological advances to study the ultrafast photoinduced processes for TLD1433 when taken up by MCF7 cells. We generalize the methodological developments and results in terms of molecular physics by applying them to TLD1433&#8217;s analogue TLD1633, making this study a benchmark to investigate the excited&#8208;state dynamics of phototoxic compounds in the complex biological environment.

     alt="Using Biological Photophysics to Map the Excited-State Topology of Molecular Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A methodology to investigate the excited-state dynamics of phototoxic compounds &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;cellulo&lt;/i&gt; using transient absorption spectroscopy is established and exemplified by two Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; photosensitizers (PSs) showing relevancy in photodynamic therapy. The kinetic signatures recorded for the PSs &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;cellulo&lt;/i&gt; are distinct from those in water, indicating a complex interplay of either PS-biomolecular interaction or interaction between PSs or both.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study employs TLD1433, a Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent in human clinical trials, as a benchmark to establish protocols for studying the excited-state dynamics of photosensitizers (PSs) &lt;i&gt;in cellulo&lt;/i&gt;, in the local environment provided by human cancer cells. Very little is known about the excited-state properties of any PS in live cells, and for TLD1433, it is &lt;i&gt;terra incognita&lt;/i&gt;. This contribution targets a general problem in phototherapy, which is how to interrogate the light-triggered, function-determining processes of the PSs in the relevant biological environment, and establishes methodological advances to study the ultrafast photoinduced processes for TLD1433 when taken up by MCF7 cells. We generalize the methodological developments and results in terms of molecular physics by applying them to TLD1433&#8217;s analogue TLD1633, making this study a benchmark to investigate the excited-state dynamics of phototoxic compounds in the complex biological environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Molecular Switch Toward Texture&#8208;Regulated Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the periodic pH evolution during Zn plating/stripping, a pH&#8208;triggered molecular switch with reversible transformation between &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone and &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate is applied to dynamically modulate the Zn/electrolyte interface. This molecular switch strategy results in texture&#8208;regulated Zn plating, suppressed hydrogen evolution, and excellent Zn reversibility even under high depth of discharge.







Abstract
Zn electrodes in aqueous media exhibit an unstable Zn/electrolyte interface due to severe parasitic reactions and dendrite formation. Here, a dynamic Zn interface modulation based on the molecular switch strategy is reported by hiring &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (GBL) in ZnCl2/H2O electrolyte. During Zn plating, the increased interfacial alkalinity triggers molecular switch from GBL to &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (GHB). GHB strongly anchors on Zn surface via triple Zn&#8722;O bonding, leading to suppressive hydrogen evolution and texture&#8208;regulated Zn morphology. Upon Zn stripping, the fluctuant pH turns the molecular switch reaction off through the cyclization of GHB to GBL. This dynamic molecular switch strategy enables high Zn reversibility with Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% and Zn||iodine batteries with high&#8208;cyclability under high Zn depth of discharge (50&#8201;%). This study demonstrates the importance of dynamic modulation for Zn electrode and realizes the reversible molecular switch strategy to enhance its reversibility.

         <title>Direct Oxygen&#8208;Oxygen Cleavage through Optimizing Interatomic Distances in Dual Single&#8208;atom Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual single&#8208;atom carbon electrocatalysts are rationally optimized for the interatomic distance and promote an effective oxygen reduction reaction via the direct oxygen&#8208;oxygen bond cleavage mechanism in acid electrolyte. The specific distance of dual&#8208;hetero single&#8208;atom pairs weakens and destabilizes the bond energy of the oxygen&#8208;oxygen bond through the strong and evenly bilateral electron and charge transfer capabilities.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on transition single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is sustainable in energy&#8208;conversion devices. However, the atomically controllable fabrication of single&#8208;atom sites and the sluggish kinetics of ORR have remained challenging. Here, we accelerate the kinetics of acid ORR through a direct O&#8722;O cleavage pathway through using a bi&#8208;functional ligand&#8208;assisted strategy to pre&#8208;control the distance of hetero&#8208;metal atoms. Concretely, the as&#8208;synthesized Fe&#8722;Zn diatomic pairs on carbon substrates exhibited an outstanding ORR performance with the ultrahigh half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#8197;V vs. RHE in acid electrolyte. Experimental evidence and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the Fe&#8722;Zn diatomic pairs with a specific distance range of around 3&#8197;&#197;, which is the key to their ultrahigh activity, average the interaction between hetero&#8208;diatomic active sites and oxygen molecules. This work offers new insight into atomically controllable SACs synthesis and addresses the limitations of the ORR dissociative mechanism.

         <title>Ir Nanoparticles Anchored on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Overall Water Splitting under pH&#8208;Universal Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient electrocatalyst was prepared by anchoring well&#8208;dispersed Ir nanoparticles on nickel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets. The strong interaction of Ir and MOF through the formation of interfacial Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ir bonds optimized the adsorption energies of H2O, OH* and H*, thus leading to the improved performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and water electrolysis under pH&#8208;universal conditions.







Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;activity and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts is critical for efficient hydrogen production by water electrolysis. Herein, we developed an advanced electrocatalyst by anchoring well&#8208;dispersed Ir nanoparticles on nickel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Ni&#8208;NDC (NDC: 2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic) nanosheets. Benefiting from the strong synergy between Ir and MOF through interfacial Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ir bonds, the synthesized Ir@Ni&#8208;NDC showed exceptional electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting in a wide pH range, superior to commercial benchmarks and most reported electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations revealed that the charge redistribution of Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ir bridge induced the optimization of H2O, OH* and H* adsorption, thus leading to the accelerated electrochemical kinetics for HER and OER. This work provides a new clue to exploit bifunctional electrocatalysts for pH&#8208;universal overall water splitting.

The sugar alcohol meglumine enhances the solubility of organic compounds in water and enforces the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes, enabling photochemical C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling transformations without sensitizers. The light&#8208;driven redox&#8208;neutral protocol connects haloarenes with indoles, anilines, anisoles, and thiols, as reported by Burkhard K&#246;nig and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202218775).

A flavin&#8208;dependent group E monooxygenase ("GEM&#8221;) has been characterized by crystal&#8208;structure analysis, computational and kinetic studies to reveal substrate binding and mechanistic details for this class of enzymes for the first time. Based on these data, Dirk Tischler, Norbert Str&#228;ter, and co&#8208;workers redesigned the substrate binding pocket to synthesize chiral epoxides and sulfoxides with high stereoselectivity, a true treasure of molecular gems, as described in their Research Article (e202300657).

A lead&#8208;doped titanium&#8208;oxo cluster protected by sulfur&#8208;containing organic ligands is employed as a molecular model to realize the preparation of a PbSO4&#8211;&#8208;PbTi3O7 heterostructure at the cathode interlayer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as reported by Yong Peng, Lei Zhang, Jing Cao, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202218478). The oxygen atoms from the sulfate ion in the heterostructure connect with iodine from the perovskite to boost interfacial electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. The efficiency and stability of the modified PSC are significantly improved.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2 ECR) over metal phosphorous trichalcogenide (MPCh3) nanosheets was systematically investigated by Dong Wang, Chen Shen, Dan Ren, Hongguang Wang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202217253). Unlike the layered CoPS3 and NiPS3 nanosheets, the active Sn atoms tend to be exposed on the surfaces of nonlayered SnPS3 nanosheets, which exhibit clearly improved formic acid selectivity.

         <title>Engineering Photosynthetic Microbial Consortia for Carbon&#8208;Negative Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li et&#8197;al. recently developed a highly compatible phototrophic community integrating a sucrose&#8208;producing CO2 sequestration module and a super&#8208;coupled module. By a simple alteration of the sucrose utilization module, four distinct products could be synthesized directly from channelling CO2 into various chemicals, thus enabling a carbon&#8208;negative biosynthesis.







Abstract
Microbial consortia consisting of phototrophs and heterotrophs have raised extensive attention due to their potential in sustainable biotechnology. The challenge remains in the selection of appropriate partners since most heterotrophic microorganisms cannot naturally use the intermediate carbohydrates secreted by autotrophic partners. In a recent study, the Ni Lab has developed a highly compatible autotrophic&#8208;heterotrophic symbiotic system comprising Synechococcus elongatus and Vibrio natriegens. V.&#8197;natriegens (the sucrose utilization module) shows a high degree of nutritional complementarity and culturing compatibility with the engineered S. elongatus (the CO2 sequestration module). The combination of both species channels CO2 into various valuable chemicals, enabling carbon&#8208;negative biosynthesis.

         <title>The Rise of Trichlorides Enabling an Improved Chlorine Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine is an indispensable base chemical that is used to produce numerous materials. To enable the chlorine industry to harvest renewable energies, a safe chlorine storage is of central importance. More recently, trichlorides, [Cl3]&#8722;, have evolved to a key technique for the storage of chlorine and for important chlorination reactions. In this minireview, the potential of trichlorides for academic research and the chlorine industry are outlined.







Abstract
Chlorine plays a central role for the industrial production of numerous materials with global relevance. More recently, polychlorides have been evolved from an area of academic interest to a research topic with enormous industrial potential. In this minireview, the value of trichlorides for chlorine storage and chlorination reactions are outlined. Particularly, the inexpensive ionic liquid [NEt3Me][Cl3] shows a similar and sometimes even advantageous reactivity compared to chlorine gas, while offering a superior safety profile. Used as a chlorine storage, [NEt3Me][Cl3] could help to overcome the current limitations of storing and transporting chlorine in larger quantities. Thus, trichlorides could become a key technique for the flexibilization of the chlorine production enabling an exploitation of renewable, yet fluctuating, electrical energy. As the loaded storage, [NEt3Me][Cl3], is a proven chlorination reagent, it could directly be employed for downstream processes, paving the path to a more practical and safer chlorine industry.

         <title>Antibacterial Nanomaterials: Mechanisms, Impacts on Antimicrobial Resistance and Design Principles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>

This review focuses on the impacts of antimicrobial nanomaterials on the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The relationships among nanomaterial structures, bactericidal effects and AMR evolution are thoroughly discussed to summarize the design principles of desired antimicrobial nanomaterials for the prevention of AMR spread.







Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest threats to the environment and health. AMR rapidly invalidates conventional antibiotics, and antimicrobial nanomaterials have been increasingly explored as alternatives. Interestingly, several antimicrobial nanomaterials show AMR&#8208;independent antimicrobial effects without detectable new resistance and have therefore been suggested to prevent AMR evolution. In contrast, some are found to trigger the evolution of AMR. Given these seemingly conflicting findings, a timely discussion of the two faces of antimicrobial nanomaterials is urgently needed. This review systematically compares the killing mechanisms and structure&#8208;activity relationships of antibiotics and antimicrobial nanomaterials. We then focus on nano&#8208;microbe interactions to elucidate the impacts of molecular initiating events on AMR evolution. Finally, we provide an outlook on future antimicrobial nanomaterials and propose design principles for the prevention of AMR evolution.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarises the progress of the recently developed locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs), including their physicochemical properties, solution structures, and applications in lithium&#8208;metal batteries with a variety of high&#8208;energy cathode materials. A perspective on the future research directions of LCILEs to further understanding and achieve improved cell performances is outlined.







Abstract
Non&#8208;flammable ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) are well&#8208;known candidates for safer and long&#8208;lifespan lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the high viscosity and insufficient Li+ transport limit their practical application. Recently, non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;viscosity co&#8208;solvents diluting ILEs without affecting the local Li+ solvation structure are employed to solve these problems. The diluted electrolytes, i.e., locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs), exhibiting lower viscosity, faster Li+ transport, and enhanced compatibility toward lithium metal anodes, are feasible options for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs. Herein, the progress of the recently developed LCILEs are summarised, including their physicochemical properties, solution structures, and applications in LMBs with a variety of high&#8208;energy cathode materials. Lastly, a perspective on the future research directions of LCILEs to further understanding and achieve improved cell performances is outlined.

         <title>CRISPR&#8208;Cas Biochemistry and CRISPR&#8208;Based Molecular Diagnostics</title>

This review focuses on recent developments in both fundamental CRISPR biochemistry and CRISPR&#8208;based molecular diagnostic technologies. Four emerging research topics on target preamplification&#8208;free detection, microRNA (miRNA) detection, non&#8208;nucleic&#8208;acid detection, and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection are also covered.







Abstract
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#8208;based nucleic acid testing has played a critical role in disease diagnostics, pathogen surveillance, and many more. However, this method requires a long turnaround time, expensive equipment, and trained personnel, limiting its widespread availability and diagnostic capacity. On the other hand, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has recently demonstrated capability for nucleic acid detection with high sensitivity and specificity.

&lt;p&gt;This review focuses on recent developments in both fundamental CRISPR biochemistry and CRISPR-based molecular diagnostic technologies. Four emerging research topics on target preamplification-free detection, microRNA (miRNA) detection, non-nucleic-acid detection, and SARS-CoV-2 detection are also covered.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based nucleic acid testing has played a critical role in disease diagnostics, pathogen surveillance, and many more. However, this method requires a long turnaround time, expensive equipment, and trained personnel, limiting its widespread availability and diagnostic capacity. On the other hand, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has recently demonstrated capability for nucleic acid detection with high sensitivity and specificity. CRISPR-mediated biosensing holds great promise for revolutionizing nucleic acid testing procedures and developing point-of-care diagnostics. This review focuses on recent developments in both fundamental CRISPR biochemistry and CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection techniques. Four ongoing research hotspots in molecular diagnostics-target preamplification-free detection, microRNA (miRNA) testing, non-nucleic-acid detection, and SARS-CoV-2 detection-are also covered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Microtubular Covalent Organic Frameworks Achieved by COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically microtubular covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were achieved by a COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation process, where the C3&#8208;symmetric guanidine units were decomposed into C2&#8208;symmetric hydrazine units. The mixed COFs with hierarchical architectures exhibited much&#8208;improved efficiency and selectivity in catalyzing CO2 reduction with phenylsilane and N&#8208;methylaniline due to enhanced mass transport ability.







Abstract
Pore environment and aggregated structure play a vital role in determining the properties of porous materials, especially regarding the mass transfer. Reticular chemistry imparts covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with well&#8208;aligned micro/mesopores, yet constructing hierarchical architectures remains a great challenge. Herein, we reported a COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation methodology to prepare microtubular COFs. In this process, the C3&#8208;symmetric guanidine units decomposed into C2&#8208;symmetric hydrazine units, leading to the crystal transformation of COFs. Moreover, the aggregated structure and conversion degree varied with the reaction time, where the hollow tubular aggregates composed of mixed COF crystals could be obtained. Such hierarchical architecture leads to enhanced mass transfer properties, as proved by the adsorption measurement and chemical catalytic reactions. This self&#8208;template strategy was successfully applied to another four COFs with different building units.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Coupling of Secondary Alcohols, Primary Alcohols and Methanol</title>

         <dc:description>
For the first time, a manganese&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of secondary alcohol, primary alcohol and methanol for the synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;methylated/alkylated alcohol with high chemoselectivity is presented.







Abstract
Herein, we report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of secondary alcohols, primary alcohols and methanol for the synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;methylated/alkylated secondary alcohols. Using our method, a series of 1&#8208;arylethanol, benzyl alcohol derivatives, and methanol undergo sequential coupling efficiently to construct assembled alcohols with high chemoselectivity in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via methylation of a benzylated secondary alcohol intermediate to generate the final product.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Recovery of Organic Polymer Photocatalytic Particles for the Production of High Value Compounds and Enhanced Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic nanoparticles are presented that are active and well&#8208;dispersed under acidic conditions but aggregate instantly upon elevation of pH. These responsive photocatalytic polymers can be used in various photocatalytic transformations, including CrVI reduction and photoredox alkylation of an indole derivative. The particles could be readily recycled, allowing multiple successive photocatalytic reactions with no clear loss in activity.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;homogeneous polymeric photocatalysts are an emerging class of highly efficient and tunable photocatalytic materials, where the photocatalytic centers are easily accessible. The creation of highly efficient photocatalytic materials that can be rapidly separated and recovered is one of the critical challenges in photocatalytic chemistry. Here, we describe pH&#8208;responsive photocatalytic nanoparticles that are active and well&#8208;dispersed under acidic conditions but aggregate instantly upon elevation of pH, enabling easy recovery. These responsive photocatalytic polymers can be used in various photocatalytic transformations, including CrVI reduction and photoredox alkylation of indole derivative. Notably, the cationic nature of the photocatalyst accelerates reaction rate of an anionic substrate compared to uncharged species. These photocatalytic particles could be readily recycled allowing multiple successive photocatalytic reactions with no clear loss in activity.

         <title>Determining the Physico&#8208;Chemical Composition of Biomolecular Condensates from Spatially&#8208;Resolved NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of the molecular complexity and dynamic nature of biomolecular condensates, effective tools to investigate their composition and structure have been lacking. Improved spatially&#8208;resolved NMR enables the quantification of multiple components in biomolecular condensates in equilibrium and in a label&#8208;free fashion. The ability to simultaneously observe proteins, small molecules, and water is expected to have a major impact on understanding the composition and physical chemistry of biomolecular condensates.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;Liquid phase separation has emerged as fundamental process underlying the formation of biomolecular condensates. Insights into the composition and structure of biomolecular condensates is, however, complicated by their molecular complexity and dynamics. Here, we introduce an improved spatially&#8208;resolved NMR experiment that enables quantitative analysis of the physico&#8208;chemical composition of multi&#8208;component biomolecular condensates in equilibrium and label&#8208;free. Application of spatially&#8208;resolved NMR to condensates formed by the Alzheimer's disease&#8208;associated protein Tau demonstrates decreased water content, exclusion of the molecular crowding agent dextran, presence of a specific chemical environment of the small molecule DSS, and &#8776;150&#8208;fold increased concentration of Tau inside the condensate. The results suggest that spatially&#8208;resolved NMR can have a major impact in understanding the composition and physical chemistry of biomolecular condensates.

         <title>Reactivities of &#945;&#8208;Oxo BMIDA Gold Carbenes Generated by Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of BMIDA&#8208;Terminated Alkynes</title>

&#945;&#8208;Oxo BMIDA gold carbenes are oxidatively generated from BMIDA&#8208;terminated alkynes. With the electrophilicity modulated by BMIDA, these carbene species undergo C&#8722;H insertion in the absence of the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effect. This chemistry provides expedient access to structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;boryl ketones, which were previously scarcely documented.







Abstract
An oxidative strategy is reported to access &#945;&#8208;oxo BMIDA gold carbenes directly from BMIDA&#8208;terminated alkynes. Besides offering expedient access to seldom studied boryl metal carbenes, these BMIDA gold carbene species undergo facile insertions into methyl, methylene, methine, and benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in the absence of the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effect. They also undergo efficient OH insertion, cyclopropanation, and F&#8722;C alkylations. This chemistry provides rapid access to structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;BMIDA ketones, which are scarcely documented. In combination with DFT studies, the role of BMIDA is established to be an electron&#8208;donating group that attenuates the high electrophilicity of the gold carbene center.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An oxidative strategy is reported to access &#945;-oxo BMIDA gold carbenes directly from BMIDA-terminated alkynes. Besides offering expedient access to seldom studied boryl metal carbenes, these BMIDA gold carbene species undergo facile insertions into methyl, methylene, methine, and benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in the absence of the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effect. They also undergo efficient OH insertion, cyclopropanation, and F&#8722;C alkylations. This chemistry provides rapid access to structurally diverse &#945;-BMIDA ketones, which are scarcely documented. In combination with DFT studies, the role of BMIDA is established to be an electron-donating group that attenuates the high electrophilicity of the gold carbene center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Solvated Double&#8208;Layer Polymer Electrolytes with Molecular Interactions Mediated Stable Interfaces for Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvated double&#8208;layer quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte is rationally designed for two purposes: enhancing the interfacial stability and Na ion conductance. The double&#8208;layer structure is laminated by cathode&#8208; and anode&#8208;facing polymer electrolytes to meet the different interfacial requirements. Meanwhile, different functional fillers are solvated with plasticizer to improve the Na+ conductivity and thermal stability.







Abstract
Unstable cathode&#8208;electrolyte and/or anode&#8208;electrolyte interface in polymer&#8208;based sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) will deteriorate their cycle performance. Herein, a unique solvated double&#8208;layer quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (SDL&#8208;QSPE) with high Na+ ion conductivity is designed to simultaneously improve stability on both cathode and anode sides. Different functional fillers are solvated with plasticizers to improve Na+ conductivity and thermal stability. The SDL&#8208;QSPE is laminated by cathode&#8208; and anode&#8208;facing polymer electrolyte to meet the independent interfacial requirements of the two electrodes. The interfacial evolution is elucidated by theoretical calculations and 3D X&#8208;ray microtomography analysis. The Na0.67Mn2/3Ni1/3O2|SDL&#8208;QSPE|Na batteries exhibit 80.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 400&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C with the Coulombic efficiency close to 100&#8201;%, which significantly outperforms those batteries using the monolayer&#8208;structured QSPE.

         <title>Electrically Switchable Persistent Spin Texture in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We implement electrically switchable persistent spin texture (PST) in a 2D perovskite ferroelectric, which highlights the potential of 2D ferroelectric PST&#8208;active materials for spin manipulation and facilitates high&#8208;performance spintronic device application.







Abstract
As a momentum&#8208;independent spin configuration, persistent spin texture (PST) could avoid spin relaxation and play an advantageous role in spin lifetime. Nevertheless, manipulation of PST is a challenge due to the limited materials and ambiguous structure&#8211;property relationships. Herein, we present electrically switchable PST in a new 2D perovskite ferroelectric, (PA)2CsPb2Br7 (where PA is n&#8208;pentylammonium), which has a high Curie temperature of 349&#8197;K, evident spontaneous polarization (3.2&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a low coercive electric field of 5.3&#8197;kV&#8201;cm&#8722;1. The combination of symmetry&#8208;breaking in ferroelectrics and effective spin&#8208;orbit field facilitates intrinsic PST in the bulk and monolayer structure models. Strikingly, the directions of spin texture are reversible by switching the spontaneous electric polarization. This electric switching behavior relates to the tilting of PbBr6 octahedra and the reorientation of organic PA+ cations. Our studies on ferroelectric PST of 2D hybrid perovskites afford a platform for electrical spin texture manipulation.

         <title>Amphibian&#8208;like Flexible Organic Crystal Optical Fibers for Underwater/Air Micro&#8208;Precision Lighting and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible organic optical waveguides are good candidates for air/underwater dual&#8208;media compatible optical signal transduction. The passive signal transport in an organic flexible waveguide was effectively channelized for high&#8208;precision nano/micro particle sensing in ambient/aquatic conditions.







Abstract
Visible light guiding optical fibers with underwater operational capability are highly desired for subaquatic communication and sensing technologies. Herein, we present mechanically flexible, blue&#8208;violet fluorescent (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)biphenyl) (BPP) crystal waveguides with high&#8208;aspect ratio. These milli&#8208;meter&#8208;long BPP crystals guide light actively and passively in ambient and underwater conditions demonstrating their amphibian&#8208;like character. Due to the crystal's high flexibility, the optical fiber's output light direction in submerged and ambient states can be altered mechanically for high&#8208;precision lighting and sensing applications. The development of such multi&#8208;environment&#8208;compatible and mechanically flexible organic optical fibers acting as sensing materials possess enormous potential for short&#8208;range underwater photonic technologies.

         <title>Chemical Validation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Phosphopantetheine Adenylyltransferase Using Fragment Linking and CRISPR Interference
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fragment screen yielded three series of Mycobacterium tuberculosis phosphopantetheinyl adenylyltransferase (MtbPPAT) ligands that bind to distinct regions within the active site. This presented a unique opportunity for fragment linking that was exploited for the design of higher affinity ligands, shown, using CRISPR interference, to possess on&#8208;target antimycobacterial activity.







Abstract
The coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathway has attracted attention as a potential target for much&#8208;needed novel antimicrobial drugs, including for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), the lethal disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Seeking to identify inhibitors of Mtb phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (MtbPPAT), the enzyme that catalyses the penultimate step in CoA biosynthesis, we performed a fragment screen. In doing so, we discovered three series of fragments that occupy distinct regions of the MtbPPAT active site, presenting a unique opportunity for fragment linking. Here we show how, guided by X&#8208;ray crystal structures, we could link weakly&#8208;binding fragments to produce an active site binder with a KD &lt;20&#8197;&#956;M and on&#8208;target anti&#8208;Mtb activity, as demonstrated using CRISPR interference. This study represents a big step toward validating MtbPPAT as a potential drug target and designing a MtbPPAT&#8208;targeting anti&#8208;TB drug.

         <dc:description>
An efficient organocatalytic method to synthetically versatile chiral triflones with two non&#8208;adjacent stereogenic centers was developed. The work uses, for the first time, &#945;&#8208;aryl vinyl triflones as Michael acceptors in stereoselective catalysis. Control over the absolute configuration is achieved by a catalyst&#8208;controlled stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formation&#8208;protonation sequence.







Abstract
Trifluoromethylsulfones (triflones) are useful compounds for synthesis and beyond. Yet, methods to access chiral triflones are scarce. Here, we present a mild and efficient organocatalytic method for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral triflones using &#945;&#8208;aryl vinyl triflones, building blocks previously unexplored in asymmetric synthesis. The peptide&#8208;catalyzed reaction gives rise to a broad range of &#947;&#8208;triflylaldehydes with two non&#8208;adjacent stereogenic centers in high yields and stereoselectivities. A catalyst&#8208;controlled stereoselective protonation following a C&#8722;C bond formation is key to control over the absolute and relative configuration. Straightforward derivatization of the products into, e.g., disubstituted &#948;&#8208;sultones, &#947;&#8208;lactones, and pyrrolidine heterocycles highlights the synthetic versatility of the products.

         <title>Fucose Migration Pathways Identified Using Infrared Spectroscopy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass&#8208;spectrometric study of fucosylated oligosaccharides is arduous due to the propensity of fucose to migrate in the gas phase&#8212;especially during the collision&#8208;induced dissociation step (but not always). Gas&#8208;phase infrared spectroscopy has shown its potential to identify fucose migration products. The investigations have also shown a new type of migration.







Abstract
Fucose is a ubiquitous monosaccharide associated to major classes of glycans. A main obstacle to the sequencing of fucosylated glycans is the migration of fucose, which leads to misinterpretations in mass spectrometry analysis. Here, using ion vibrational spectroscopy, we resolve the structure of fucosylated fragments of Lewis and blood group H antigen trisaccharides and we unveil the position and linkage of the fucose after migration. Our findings demonstrate that the structure of fragment ions resulting from fucose migration can be characterized. Additionally, we report a new type of fucose migration, which does not feature any change of mass and therefore had not been previously reported: it consists of a local migration where the fucose changes its position remaining on the initial residue. Our approach allows the characterization of glycans, an essential step to interpret glycomics data, as well as to understand underlying processes at play in mass spectrometry.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of the Orthorhombic Sn3O4 Polymorph</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A previously unreported orthorhombic Sn3O4 polymorph was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method and characterized carefully by empirical and calculational methods.







Abstract
An unexplored tin oxide crystal phase (Sn3O4) was experimentally synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. After tuning the often&#8208;neglected parameters for the hydrothermal synthesis, namely the degree of filling of the precursor solution and the gas composition in the reactor head space, an unreported X&#8208;ray diffraction pattern was discovered. Through various characterization studies, such as Rietveld analysis, energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations, this novel material was characterized as orthorhombic mixed&#8208;valence tin oxide with the composition SnII2SnIVO4. This orthorhombic tin oxide is a new polymorph of Sn3O4, which differs from the reported conventional monoclinic structure. Computational and experimental analyses showed that orthorhombic Sn3O4 has a smaller band gap (2.0&#8197;eV), enabling greater absorption of visible light. This study is expected to improve the accuracy of hydrothermal synthesis and aid the discovery of new oxide materials.

         <title>Dynamically Resettable Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface through Supramolecular Sol&#8208;Gel Transition Electrolyte for Flexible Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel supramolecular sol&#8208;gel transition electrolyte that can dynamically reset damaged electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and accommodate deformations/dendrites is developed, providing a general strategy to enhance interface stability in flexible batteries.







Abstract
Flexible batteries based on gel electrolytes with high safety are promising power solutions for wearable electronics but suffer from vulnerable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces especially upon complex deformations, leading to irreversible capacity loss or even battery collapse. Here, a supramolecular sol&#8208;gel transition electrolyte (SGTE) that can dynamically accommodate deformations and repair electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces through its controllable rewetting at low temperatures is designed. Mediated by the micellization of polypropylene oxide blocks in Pluronic and host&#8208;guest interactions between &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) and polyethylene oxide blocks, the high ionic conductivity and compatibility with various salts of SGTE afford resettable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and thus constructions of a series of highly durable, flexible aqueous zinc batteries. The design of this novel gel electrolyte provides new insights for the development of flexible batteries.

Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H activation in simple amides has been achieved by using palladium(II) catalysis with a chiral sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) ligand. We report herein an efficient asymmetric PdII/SOHP&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of aliphatic tertiary amides (up to 93&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee), in which the SOHP ligand plays a key role in the stereoselective C&#8722;H deprotonation&#8208;metalation step.







Abstract
Amide is one of the most widespread functional groups in organic and bioorganic chemistry, and it would be valuable to achieve stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization in amide molecules. Palladium(II) catalysis has been prevalently used in the C&#8722;H activation chemistry in the past decades, however, due to the weakly&#8208;coordinating feature of simple amides, it is challenging to achieve their direct C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization with enantiocontrol by PdII catalysis. Our group has developed sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) ligands, which exhibited remarkable activity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation. In this work, we demonstrate that chiral SOHP ligands served as an ideal solution to enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H activation in simple amides. Herein, we report an efficient asymmetric PdII/SOHP&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of aliphatic tertiary amides, in which the SOHP ligand plays a key role in the stereoselective C&#8722;H deprotonation&#8208;metalation step.

         <title>Reductive Asymmetric Aza&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans Rearrangement by 1,3,2&#8208;Diazaphospholene Catalysis

A 1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;step cascade transformation of chiral N&#8208;sulfinyl acrylamides comprised of a conjugate reduction, enantiospecific [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic aza&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans rearrangement, and subsequent S&#8722;O bond reductive cleavage provides access to synthetically valuable enantio&#8208;enriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides. Various &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides are obtained in good yields and high enantioselectivities under very mild conditions.







Abstract
1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene hydrides (DAP&#8722;H) enable smooth conjugate reduction of polarized double bonds. The transiently formed phosphorus&#8208;enolate provides a potential platform for reductive &#945;&#8208;functionalizations. In this respect, asymmetric C&#8208;heteroatom bond forming processes are synthetically appealing but remain elusive. We report a 1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;step cascade reaction of N&#8208;sulfinyl acrylamides comprised of conjugate reduction, [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic aza&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans rearrangement and subsequent S&#8722;O bond cleavage. The obtained enantio&#8208;enriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides are formed in good yields and excellent enantiospecificity. The stereo&#8208;defined P&#8208;bound N,O&#8208;ketene aminal ensures an excellent transfer of chirality from the sulfur stereocenter to &#945;&#8208;carbon. The transformation operates under mild conditions at ambient temperature. Moreover, DAP&#8722;H is a competent reductant for the cleavage of formed sulfenate ester, eliminating the extra step in traditional Mislow&#8208;Evans processes.

         <title>Haloboration of o&#8208;Alkynyl Phenols Generates Halogenated Bicyclic&#8208;Boronates
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;directed alkyne trans&#8208;haloboration using BX3 (X=Cl or Br) leads to C4&#8208;halogenated benzoxaborinines that are useful intermediates for accessing the core structure found in bicyclic boronate based &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors. A computational study identified two viable mechanisms to furnish the trans&#8208;haloboration products.







Abstract
Benzoxaborinines are intermediates en&#8208;route to bicyclic boronates that are important active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Herein, the haloboration of o&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;phenols using BX3 (X=Cl or Br) is disclosed as a route to form C4&#8208;X&#8208;benzoxaborinines with good functional group tolerance. Computational studies indicated that there are two similar in barrier mechanisms: (i) double alkyne haloboration followed by retro&#8208;haloboration; (ii) concerted trans&#8208;haloboration involving an exogenous chloride source. The C4&#8208;halide in these benzoxaborinines is useful, with a one&#8208;pot haloboration&#8208;Negishi cross coupling protocol effective to form benzoxaborinines with an alkyl or an aryl at C4. Therefore this method is a useful addition to the toolbox for synthesising bicyclic&#8208;boronates that are attracting increasing attention as APIs.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Clay C.&#8197;C. Wang. He and his collaborators recently published an article on the conversion of polyethylenes to fungal secondary metabolites. First, the team employs an oxidative catalytic process, highly tolerant of impurities, to degrade post&#8208;consumer polyethylenes to carboxylic diacids. Then, they utilize engineered strains of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans to convert these diacids to structurally diverse and pharmacologically active secondary metabolites. &#8220;Conversion of Polyethylenes into Fungal Secondary Metabolites&#8221;, C.
